Mr. President, I said that the Senate would take up \nthe fiscal agreement after the House acted, and we are. This agreement \nisn't perfect. I share some concerns other colleagues have raised. But \nhere is the bottom line. This is a fully offset agreement that rejects \ntax hikes, secures long-term savings through entitlement reforms, and \nprovides increased support for our military. All this is at a time when \nwe confront threats in multiple theaters.\n  Each of these items was a Republican goal heading into the \nnegotiation. Each of these items was achieved in the agreement before \nus. I am encouraged that it would enact the most significant reform to \nSocial Security since 1983, resulting in $168 billion in long-term \nsavings. I am encouraged that it would repeal more of ObamaCare. I am \nencouraged that it would help provide resources our troops so \ndesperately need in an era of diverse and very challenging global \nthreats--when we see ISIL consolidating gains in Iraq and Syria; when \nwe see the forces of Assad marching alongside Iranian soldiers and \nHezbollah militias, supported by Russian aircraft overhead.\n  Colleagues know that I will respect whatever choice they ultimately \nmake when this agreement comes up for a vote. There are valid \ndifferences of opinion, and that is OK. But I ask every colleague to \nalso consider what this fully offset agreement would mean for the men \nand women who voluntarily put themselves in harm's way so that we may \nlive free.\n  Commanders tell us that additional resources are required--required \nto ensure their safety and preparedness. This fully offset agreement \nwould help provide them--along with enacting the most significant \nSocial Security reform in over three decades, along with repealing \nanother piece of ObamaCare, and along with refusing to raise taxes by a \npenny. I hope Senators will join me in voting for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7601-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7601-S7602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN BOEHNER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, allow me to say a few words about the \nSpeaker of the House. There is a lot you can say about John Boehner. He \nloves his breakfast every morning at Pete's Diner. He is a fan of the \ntie dimple. He is one of the most genuine guys you will ever, ever \nmeet. I know because we have fought many battles together in the \ntrenches. He never breaks his word. He never buckles in a storm.\n  What is amazing is how we have had such a frictionless relationship, \nespecially when you consider that old House saying: The other party--\nthat is just the opposition. But the Senate--that is the enemy.\n  That may have been true of past House and Senate leaders, but it \nwasn't true for us. Though you might not expect it, I am a little more \nBourbon and John is a little more Merlot. I lecture on Henry Clay. John \nsings ``Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.'' But I have always considered John an ally. \nI have always considered John a friend. It is hard not to like him, and \nit is hard not to admire what John has accomplished in his career.\n  As a concerned Ohioan, he took on a scandal-plagued incumbent in a \nprimary and won. As a freshman Congressman, he took on money laundering \nschemes and banking scandals involving powerful Members and prevailed. \nAs an engineer of the Contract with America, he took on Democrats' \ndecades-long power lock and triumphed.\n  As an ex-member of leadership once considered politically dead, he \nknew he had more to offer and convinced his colleagues that he did. As \nthe inheritor of a diminished and dispirited House minority, he dared \nto believe conservatives could rise again and help grow the largest \nRepublican majority since\n\n[[Page S7602]]\n\nbob-haired flappers were dancing the Charleston back in the 1920s.\n  John Boehner has wandered the valley. John Boehner has also been to \nthe mountaintop. John Boehner has slid right back into the valley, and \nthen ascended to great heights yet again. He does it all with hard \nwork. He does it with an earnestness and an honesty I have always \nadmired.\n  When John talks about struggling to make it, it is not some \nplatitude. When John gets choked up about Americans reaching for their \ndreams, it is not some act. This is a guy who had to share a bathroom \nwith 11 brothers and sisters. Imagine that. This is a guy whose parents \nslept on the pullout sofa. This is a guy who worked hard behind the bar \nand eventually found his way atop the rostrum. Maybe that is why he is \nso humble. Maybe that is why when he orders breakfast at Pete's, they \ndon't call him Mr. Speaker; they call him ``John-John.''\n  Here is what I know about Speaker John Boehner. He says the code he \nlives by is a simple one: Do the right thing for the right reasons, and \nthe right things will happen. I have always found that to be true. I \nfound it to be true in our battles fighting side by side for \nconservative reform, sometimes from a position deep in the minority. We \nhad our share of Maalox moments. That is for sure. But he always \nstrived to push forward.\n  As I said about John Boehner the day he announced his retirement, \ngrace under pressure, country and institution before self--these are \nthe things that come to mind when I think of him. I wish Speaker \nBoehner the very best in retirement. I thank him for always working \nhard to do the right thing--for his family, for his district, for his \nparty, and for his country. Farewell, my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7602-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PAUL RYAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, last night the House of Representatives \npassed the bipartisan budget agreement that will keep our Government \nopen, funded, and free from default. Now, 100 percent of the Democrats \nin the House of Representatives voted for this, and 68 percent of \nRepublicans voted against it. Let's pause just a minute and understand \nwhat I said: 68 percent of the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives voted to default on the full faith and credit of our \ngreat country. So 68 percent of the Republicans voted to close our \ngovernment.\n  This legislation is now before the Senate. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this responsible agreement. It is not perfect, as \nmy friend the Republican leader said. No legislation is. But this \nbudget agreement accomplishes two major priorities the Democrats have \nlong supported. It promotes economic growth by providing relief from \nsequestration's damaging cuts for 2 years, and it ensures that we \ninvest equally in the middle class and the Pentagon. The budget \nagreement is good for the middle class, good for the economy, and good \nfor the country.\n  I thank the people who worked so hard to make this agreement what it \nis today. The agreement was among President Obama, Speaker Boehner, \nMitch McConnell, Leader Pelosi, and I helped. I applaud and commend the \nPresident of the United States. He was firm, he was resolute, and he \nwas--as usual--very smart. I appreciate the good work that he did to \nhelp us get to the point where we are now.\n  To reach these negotiations, each of us had discussions with each \nother. We also know that a lot of the work was done by our staffs--our \nrespective staffs. My chief of staff, Drew Wilson, represented the \nSenate Democrats in these negotiations. The Senate Democratic caucus is \naware of Drew's expertise, hard work, fairness, and openness. Drew was \nably assisted by Gary Myrick--indispensable Gary Myrick, who is the \nDemocratic Secretary, as well as a number of people on my team of \nsenior policy analysts who helped a great deal. Kate Leone--I don't \nthink there is anyone in the Senate who doesn't know who Kate Leon is. \nShe is the expert on health care. Bruce King, Ellen Doneski, Ayesha \nKhanna, Trey Reffett, Tyler Moran, George Holman, Gavin Parke, Alex \nMcDonough, and utility man Bill Dauster all worked literally night and \nday to get this to the point where we were able to be here on the floor \ntoday, seeking support for it.\n\n  I am so grateful for the wonderful staff that I have, but there were \nothers involved. Senator McConnell's negotiator in this was Hazen \nMarshall. Hazen Marshall is a good person. He was resolute. He carried \nforward what the Republican leader wanted, but, like my staff, you \nnever get exactly what you want. Everybody enjoyed working with him.\n  Dave Stewart was Speaker Boehner's negotiator on this. I care a great \ndeal about Dave Stewart. David is a good man, and we all admire the \nwork that he has done. I hope the new Speaker to be, Paul Ryan, will \nuse his good offices. He is very good. He is a talented man.\n  Dick Meltzer was Leader Pelosi's able negotiator. I have to commend \nNancy Pelosi. I so admire this good woman. She is a stalwart in the \nHouse of Representatives. She will go down in history as one of the \ngreat leaders of that body. I admire her, appreciate her friendship, \nand extend to anyone within the sound of my voice my appreciation for \nthe work that she did on this bill.\n  As to the White House, I have already indicated the President did a \nwonderful job on this, but he also assigned two really terrific, good, \noutstanding people. I can't say enough about them. Brian Deese was one \nof the White House negotiators, along with Katie Fallon. Katie is a \nwoman whom we all know in the Senate. She worked for Senator Schumer \nfor a number of years, and she worked for the Democratic Policy \nCommittee. She was on the committee for a number of years. We admire \nher very much. She was so helpful with everything we did in this \nlegislation. She was always easy to get ahold of. She was easy to \nreach.\n  It is now time for this important legislation to pass the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I have to say a few words about Speaker Boehner. I have to admit that \nI was skeptical when he said that he wanted to clean out the barn \nbefore he left, but he found a way to clean out the barn by passing a \nclean debt limit and a 2-year budget agreement, which should go a long \nway to returning the appropriations process to the way it should work.\n  I will always consider him my friend, and I will miss him. I wish him \nthe very best in everything he does in the future. I listened to his \nfinal remarks on the House floor, which were very moving. It wasn't \nonly John Boehner who shed a tear over there today, but many Members of \nthe House of Representatives and a number of us who watched his final \nspeech shed a tear or two.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the appropriations process. I have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S7603]]\n\nan appropriator since I came to the Senate. I was very fortunate as a \nbrand new Senator, which was many decades ago, to be on the \nAppropriations Committee. What an honor.\n  The Appropriations Committee's work is not as it used to be. We have \nto get back to doing individual appropriations bills.\n  I say to my Republican friends: Let's do the appropriations bills. \nLet's get rid of these foolish riders that they stick on appropriations \nbills. We need to understand that there is a time and place for doing \nthat. There is authorization. Do the bills, authorize stuff, but don't \nmess up the appropriations process. Next year, we will be happy to \nsupport individual appropriations bills that come to the floor. We \ndon't need motions to proceed. We will be happy to move to the bill as \nlong as they get rid of those vexatious riders that have nothing to do \nwith the bill brought before us. The Defense appropriations bill \ndoesn't need something dealing with women's health in the sense of \ndirectly attacking Planned Parenthood. We don't need on Commerce, \nState, Justice something that basically does away with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. There are many examples that I could \nuse. Let's get to doing appropriations bills the way we used to. I want \nto do them. We don't need to have a motion to proceed as long as my \nRepublican colleagues get rid of these foolish, ideological amendments \nthat have nothing to do with the bill before us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7603-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday the Georgetown University Center \nfor Children and Families released a stunning report detailing the \nsharp increase in the number of Nevada children who have health \ninsurance. At one time, we were the most underinsured State in the \ncountry for health insurance.\n  According to the Georgetown study, the number of Nevada children \nwithout health insurance fell by 35 percent in just 1 year. In 2013, 15 \npercent of children in Nevada lacked health insurance coverage. One \nyear later, that number fell to 9.3 percent.\n  Reading directly from that report:\n\n       States with the sharpest declines in the rate of uninsured \n     children were Nevada, Colorado, West Virginia, Mississippi, \n     and Rhode Island. Nevada's decline was considerably larger \n     than any other State.\n\n  A 35-percent increase in the number of insured children in 1 year is \nremarkable. It means more children have access to the care they need to \nstay healthy. A number of these children will be able to go to the \ndoctor for the first time in their lives. It is yet further proof that \nthe Affordable Care Act is working in Nevada and across America.\n  Again, I say to my friends, the Republicans: Let's start working \ntogether to improve health care. We want to work with you. If there is \na problem you see with ObamaCare, let's work together. We have been \nable to make some improvements in this law, and we want to make more \nimprovements. We just need cooperation from our Republican friends.\n  The spike in the number of insured Nevada children is also due to the \nforesight of the Governor of the State of Nevada. Brian Sandoval is a \nRepublican. He is a proud Republican who supported the State's Medicaid \nexpansion option. He took on all the naysayers.\n  Why did Brian Sandoval do this? Is he really one of ours? He did this \nbecause he thought it was the right thing to do for the State of \nNevada, and it has been proven that, in fact, is true. By expanding \nMedicaid in Nevada, many, many more parents were able to secure \naffordable health care for their kids. Quite frankly, Governor \nSandoval's courage stands in stark contrast to many of his fellow \nRepublicans.\n  Governors in a number of States dominated by Republican State \nlegislatures have refused to expand coverage to the needy. These \nRepublicans have blocked expanded coverage despite the fact that it \nmeans fewer Americans and their children have access to the health care \nthey need. This means that people are dying as a result of this.\n  Two States with the highest rates of uninsured children, Alaska and \nTexas, have rejected Medicare expansion, and others have done the same. \nThere were many Republicans in Nevada who wanted to go the same route. \nThe Republican State legislature within the Nevada congressional \ndelegation opposed all efforts to increase access to health care. They \nhave voted to repeal ObamaCare time and time again, but Governor \nSandoval was not swayed by the cynics in his own party. He refused to \nlet politics stand in the way of children's health, and today Nevada's \nchildren are better for it.\n  I repeat, the Affordable Care Act is helping American families, it is \nhelping Nevada families, and it is working especially well in States \nthat are actually using the law as it was intended.\n  I hope more Republicans will follow Governor Sandoval's examples, \nthus helping their States and their constituents by expanding access to \nquality health care. I am an admirer of Governor Sandoval, and that is \nsaying a lot. His opponent in the last election was my son. But I have \nto say this: In spite of the fact that my son came in second, Brian \nSandoval has done an outstanding job as Governor. I admire him and \nappreciate what he has done. I don't agree with everything he has done. \nI had some disagreements with what he did in the legislature. None of \nus are perfect, and he certainly isn't, but I appreciate what he has \ndone for the betterment of the State of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7603-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7603-S7604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LATINA EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier this year we recognized Equal Pay \nDay--a day that highlights the disparaging wage gap between women and \nmen in the United States. Equal Pay Day marks the day when women's \nwages finally catch up with men's wages from the previous year.\n  On average, American women make about 77 cents for every $1 that \ntheir male colleagues make while doing the very same job. This unjust \nand immoral reality is even more pronounced for women of color.\n  Tomorrow is Latina Equal Pay Day, the point at which wages of Latina \nwomen in America catch up to men's earnings from the previous year. It \nis today. They have had to work all of this time to catch up. The fact \nthat a Hispanic woman must work a full year, plus 9 months and 30 days, \njust to make what her male co-workers make is certainly unacceptable.\n  In Nevada, Latina women earn 53 cents for every $1 their fellow male \nworkers make. It is not just a problem in Nevada; it is a problem \nnationwide. Nationwide they earn 55 cents for every $1 a man makes for \ndoing the exact same work. All told, the wage gap that Latina women \nface results in a loss of over $25,000 a year for these women. That is \n$25,000 that could be used to help these women sustain their families.\n  To make matters worse, the wage gaps that exist between Latina women \nand their male counterparts disproportionately affect Hispanic \nfamilies. Why? Because Latina women are more likely to be the primary \nbreadwinners for their families. Thirty percent of all Hispanic \nfamilies in the United States are headed by a single mother, and 40 \npercent of married Latina women earn more than 50 percent of their \nfamily's income.\n  As legislators, it is our duty to seek the well-being of all \nAmericans. Democrats don't take that responsibility lightly. We \nunderstand that when wages of women do not reflect their hard work, it \nundermines the strength of families and communities throughout the \nNation. That is why we have continually and consistently fought to \nsecure equal pay for equal work.\n  Five times in 5 years Republicans have stood in the way of equal pay \nfor women. They have stood in the way of equal wages for their own \nsisters, daughters, and wives. Even Republican women--that is \nRepublican Members of Congress--have refused to address this important \nissue. The proposal that Republicans have put forward falls short of \nensuring real equal pay protections and ignores the realities women \nface in fighting for fair pay. In so doing, Republicans have proudly \nplaced their stamp of approval on unequal paychecks across America.\n  The wage gap Latina women endure is a disgrace to this Nation. No \nwoman should make less than a man who does the exact same work. Latina \nwomen\n\n[[Page S7604]]\n\ndeserve the hard-earned wages for which they work. They also deserve \nelected officials who will advocate on their behalf.\n  As we recognize Latina Equal Pay Day, I call on Republicans to \nsupport a pay equity bill that empowers women to receive equal pay they \nhave so rightly earned, not just because it strengthens families and \nbenefits our country but because it is the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7604-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today we are kicking off a debate on major \nbipartisan legislation. Chairman Hatch and I are also involved in an \nimportant Senate Finance Committee hearing. He will be here a little \nbit later today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our colleague, Senator Durbin from \nIllinois, be allowed to speak after I do. I believe that his remarks \nwill also be completed before Chairman Hatch arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Chairman Hatch and I will be managing this bill, and we want our \ncolleagues to know that we are anxious to give everyone an opportunity \nto speak out on this extraordinarily important issue. If Senators who \nwish to speak come down and consult with the Finance staff--majority \nand minority--in our respective cloakrooms, we are going to work very \nhard to accommodate all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Here, in my view, is what this issue is all about. Fiscal battles in \nthe Congress come and go, but nothing should ever be allowed to \nthreaten America's sterling economic reputation, and this legislation \nwill preserve it. Without this agreement, the Congress is staring at a \npotential debt default--a debt default that would be literally days \naway, when the Treasury would lose its authority to borrow in order to \nmake payments.\n\n  By now, I think a lot of Senators understand the disastrous \nconsequences of default: housing costs shooting upward, retirement \naccounts shrinking, jobs disappearing, and consumer confidence \ndropping. We also understand that no one can get particularly thrilled \nby the prospect of raising the debt ceiling. Yet it is a job that must \nbe done.\n  Our country is an economic rock in tumultuous seas, and we certainly \nhave disagreements. Disagreements practically come with every news \ncycle and election. But what doesn't change is that our country pays \nits debts and we pay them on time. That is why this legislation is so \nimportant.\n  The bipartisan compromise reduces the threats of a potential \ngovernment shutdown in December. When this becomes law, the pin, in \neffect, goes back in the grenade, where it belongs. That is positive \nnews, as we look for some predictability and certainty, and we all hear \nfrom our businesses, our employers, and our citizens that this is so \nimportant.\n  Congress ought to look at this compromise, in my view, as a \nspringboard to a full and productive debate over the budget in the \nupcoming 2 years. The fact is, last-minute deals have become too \ncommonplace and they have left a lot of important policy reforms and \npolicy improvements on the cutting room floor.\n  For example, with America's West getting hotter and drier each year, \nour broken system of budgeting for wildfires is in drastic need of \nimprovement. The same goes for many programs and services that are a \nlifeline for rural America. Fortunately, this legislation lays the \ngroundwork for the Congress to go back to having robust budget debates \nthat can actually solve these challenges.\n  With my time this morning, I wish to address some specific elements \nof the bill, starting with what I see as several particularly \nconstructive policies.\n  First, the legislation staves off the full brunt of the automatic \nbudget cuts known in the corridors of Washington as sequestration. This \npolicy was designed in effect to be painful from the get-go, and it \nwould weaken Medicare, the lifeline for older people, and other \ndomestic programs. It was supposed to be considered so god-awful that \nit would vanish 2 years after it began, but it continues to haunt \nbudget debates to this day.\n  It is important that this legislation eases the burden by $80 billion \nover 2 years. That means more opportunities to invest in education, in \nmedical and scientific research, in housing assistance, in public \nhealth, and more.\n  Second, this bipartisan plan is going to prevent a big spike in \nMedicare costs for millions of older people. Several weeks ago, the \nnews came down that seniors were facing a hike in premiums and \ndeductibles in Medicare Part B, the outpatient portion of Medicare, of \npotentially more than 50 percent. That would amount to an increase of \nhundreds of dollars--perhaps more--in a year when Social Security \nbenefits are not expected to grow. From my years as codirector of \nOregon's Gray Panthers, I can tell my colleagues that for many seniors \nliving on a fixed income, that would have really hit them like a \nwrecking ball.\n  When we got those initial reports, several of my Democratic \ncolleagues and I got together and introduced legislation that would \nfully shield older people from this huge financial hit. Following our \nwork, the bipartisan compromise before the Senate includes a version of \nthis important fix. It is not as generous as the proposal my colleagues \nand I introduced. There are questions about how it will affect the \nlandscape a few years down the road. But, make no mistake about it, \nthis approach goes a long, long way toward protecting seniors, \nparticularly the dual eligibles--seniors eligible for Medicare and \nMedicaid--and this is a very important part of this legislation.\n  Third, the budget compromise takes an extraordinarily important step \nto shore up one of our country's most vital safety net programs: the \nSocial Security Disability Insurance Program. Without a fix, what is \ncalled SSDI--Social Security disability insurance benefits--that \nworkers have earned would have been slashed by 20 percent, and that 20-\npercent cut would have hit those affected very quickly.\n  This proposal is going to follow what has been a frequently used \nbipartisan approach of shifting funding within the Social Security \nProgram to make sure that those who depend on this program are \nprotected through 2022. I introduced legislation earlier this year, \nalong with 28 of our colleagues, which would have gone further by \nguaranteeing that the program remain solvent through 2034, but this \ncompromise package strengthens the program for several years, and we \nwill have a chance to come together--hopefully on a bipartisan basis--\nand go even further.\n\n  Fourth, the budget package makes real progress on what is called \ncomplying with our tax laws--tax compliance. It is important to note \nthat these are not tax hikes. This is a question of enforcing tax law \nso that when taxes are owed, they are actually paid.\n  In the tax compliance area, there are several important proposals \nthat are\n\n[[Page S7605]]\n\ngoing to crack down on taxpayers who seek to dodge their \nresponsibilities and pass the buck to other Americans. For example, \nenforcing the tax laws with respect to large partnerships has been a \nchallenge for some time. There are more than 10,000 of these complex \nbusinesses in our country. More than 500 of them have at least 100,000 \npartners. So there has not been an effective way to conduct audits \nunder the current rules because the rules are basically decades old and \nhaven't kept up with the times. In my view, the proposal before the \nSenate makes meaningful improvements. More taxpayers will pay what they \nowe instead of using sleight-of-hand approaches to dodge their \nresponsibilities.\n  We all understand that the Tax Code almost boggles the mind in terms \nof its complexity. I think it would be fair to say there may be more \nwork that goes into getting this policy right as it relates to \npartnerships and several of the other issues, and my colleagues and I \non the Finance Committee intend to keep giving the scrutiny the \npartnership issue deserves on an ongoing analysis.\n  Those are four specific areas of progress in this compromise that \nstaves off a risky budgetary battle.\n  I do feel it is important to share one of my concerns with the bill \nat this time, and it is a provision that really has little to do with \nthe budget. It is called section 301, and it allows debt collectors to \nmake robocalls directly to Americans' cell phones. Here is my view. \nDebt collectors should not be gifted broad permission to harass our \ncitizens, particularly through robocalls, running up costly charges in \nmany cases. The Federal Communications Commission has limits on the \nnumber and duration of calls, and they are not sufficient. In a \nhealthier budget process, this kind of proposal would get weeded out. \nSo I would like to say to our colleagues in the Senate, both Democrats \nand Republicans, that I am going to do everything I can to reverse this \naction in the weeks ahead.\n  Finally, in my capacity as ranking member of the Finance Committee, I \nwish to discuss how these fiscal agreements ought to be financed in the \nfuture. Medicare and Social Security absolutely cannot become the honey \npots that Congress raids whenever it needs to pay for legislation. If \nwe go around the country--to Oregon, to Illinois, to Georgia, to the \nDakotas, to Texas--and we ask typical Americans what they want their \nrepresentatives in Congress to do, protecting Medicare and Social \nSecurity is right at the top of the list. I hear it in every townhall \nmeeting. I have had more than 700 of them in my home State. And I have \nto believe many colleagues in South Dakota and Illinois and elsewhere \nhear the same thing.\n  There is a longstanding tradition that says changes in Medicare \npolicy should be for strengthening Medicare in the future. The same \nprinciple goes for Social Security. Yet, twice now, these vital \nprograms have been used to fund budget deals, and Medicare \nsequestration is sticking around long past its original expiration \ndate.\n  This legislation preventing a calamitous default is coming down to \nthe wire. I would tell colleagues that this is a must-pass bill. I \nsupport it, and I urge Democrats and Republicans to do so as well.\n  I would also say as we talk about where we go from here that it is \nimportant to recognize that Medicare and Social Security must not be \nused as ATMs for other spending in the future. The bottom line has to \nbe that the process of reaching a budget and keeping the lights on in \nthis wonderful institution--the people's branch--keeping the lights on \nin the process of reaching a budget has to change. The Congress cannot \ncontinue to just go from crisis to crisis to crisis. It is our job as \nlawmakers, working in a bipartisan way, to set the right temperature in \nour economy with smart, forward-looking policies that help our \nbusinesses succeed and give everybody in America--I want to emphasize \nthat; everybody in America--the opportunity to get ahead. It is pretty \nhard to do when we lurch from one crisis to another.\n  Let's use this legislation as an opportunity to get back to writing \nthe budget in a bipartisan fashion through the traditional approaches \nthat have been used in what is called regular order, pass this bill now \nso as to ensure that America's sterling economic reputation is intact, \nand then let's look to the future around some of the principles I have \nlaid out.\n  Again, Chairman Hatch will be here in a bit. He and I, as the \nmanagers of the bill, want to make it clear we want to try to \naccommodate as many colleagues as we can, and we ought to be able to. I \nlook forward to the remarks of the distinguished senior Senator from \nIllinois. I believe that before too long Chairman Hatch will be here as \nwell.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n\n                         University of Phoenix\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday the senior Senator from Arizona, \nthe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, came to the floor \nto speak to an issue and mentioned my name several times during the \ncourse of his remarks on the floor. I come here this morning to respond \nto the senior Senator from Arizona.\n  The issue is a decision by the Department of Defense on October 7 of \nthis year to place the University of Phoenix, a for-profit university, \non probation and prohibit the company from enrolling new Department of \nDefense tuition assistance and MyCAA beneficiaries. Under this \nDepartment of Defense order, the company--University of Phoenix--was \nbarred from accessing military bases. This is a serious action, and \nthere is a reason for it.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona came to the floor to protest this \ndecision by the Department of Defense and to also protest other actions \nthat have been taken relative to other for-profit universities. I come \nthis morning to respond.\n  What is at stake is something that is very essential. When men and \nwomen volunteer for our military and hold up their hands and say ``I am \nwilling to die for this country,'' they make a promise and we make a \npromise. Our promise is that if you will serve this country and risk \nyour life for America, we will stand by you when you come home. If you \nare injured, we will provide medical care. If you want to pursue \neducation and training, we will help you do it; in fact, we will help \nyour family do it. And there are many other benefits that we rightly \npromise to these members of the military.\n  Department of Defense tuition assistance and the GI bill, which has \nbeen characterized as the GI bill since World War II, is really the \nvehicle that gives to many of these servicemembers, while they are \nserving and after they have completed their service, a chance to build \ntheir lives. They are generous programs, and they should be. MyCAA is \ngenerous to their families, and it should be. But these are virtually \nonce-in-a-lifetime opportunities. We hope these members of the military \nchoose well in terms of the courses they need to take and the training \nthey need to prepare for their lives after they have served our \ncountry. We have a responsibility when it comes to those who are \ncurrently in the service to monitor the activities of the schools that \nare offering education and training as part of these programs. We would \nbe derelict in our responsibility if we did not.\n  The Department of Defense wrote a memorandum of understanding to all \nschools saying: If you want to offer Tuition Assistance program \ntraining and education, if you want to offer training for the families \nof servicemembers, here are the rules to play by. And I think virtually \nevery institution of higher learning knows going in to follow the \nrules, whatever the institution may be.\n  Let me say a word about the University of Phoenix. This is not just \nanother for-profit school; it is the largest by far. At the height of \nits enrollment, the University of Phoenix, a for-profit university \nlargely offering online courses, had as many as 600,000 students. That \nis dramatically more than the combined enrollment of all the Big Ten \ncolleges and universities. Over the years--in the last 5 years, the \nsize of their student body has declined; it is now slightly over \n200,000. As an individual institution, it is the largest in America, \nand it certainly is the largest of the for-profit colleges and \nuniversities. You can hardly escape the advertising, the naming rights \nto the stadium where the Arizona Cardinals play their football games in \nArizona. They have advertising on television, radio,\n\n[[Page S7606]]\n\nand billboards. It is a company that markets in every direction and as \na consequence has built a large student enrollment.\n  How about the University of Phoenix in terms of dollars it receives? \nThat is interesting. Unlike universities and colleges around the United \nStates, whether in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, or \nwherever, these for-profit universities get a substantial portion of \ntheir revenue directly from the Treasury through Pell grants and \nstudent loans. Dramatically higher percentages of their revenue come \nfrom Treasury than virtually any other college or university. This is \nunique to the for-profit college and university sector. They are the \nmost heavily subsidized for-profit private businesses in America today.\n  Let me give an example of what I am talking about. Eighty-two percent \nof the revenue going to the University of Phoenix--$2.7 billion--comes \nout of title IV. When it comes to Department of Defense tuition \nassistance, University of Phoenix is the fourth largest recipient in \nthe United States--$20 million. Under the GI bill, it is the largest \nrecipient from the Department of Defense and the Treasury--$346 \nmillion. Their CEO, Mr. Cappelli, is paid $8 million a year in total \ncompensation, which is dramatically more than virtually any other \nuniversity president in the ordinary course of higher education--what \nis a record.\n  University of Phoenix students cumulatively owe more in student debt \nthan any educational institution in America. University of Phoenix \nstudents owe $35 billion in student loans. Only half of the University \nof Phoenix borrowers are paying down their debt 5 years after \ngraduation or after they have dropped out of school. Phoenix's overall \n3-year repayment rate--that means how many borrowers are making \npayments on their debt after 3 years--is 41 percent. Less than half of \nthe University of Phoenix students and graduates after 3 years are \npaying back. Their 5-year repayment rate is 47 percent. Nearly one out \nof every two students who graduated or dropped out in 2009 has \ndefaulted within 5 years. The University of Phoenix's 5-year cohort \ndefault rate--students who graduated in 2009 and defaulted by 2014--is \n45 percent. The Arizona location--which includes online students across \nthe country--the 4-year bachelor's-seeking graduation rate is 1 percent \nand the 6-year bachelor's-seeking graduation rate is 10 percent.\n  In the for-profit college and university industry, there are three \nnumbers to remember. Ten percent of the students graduating from high \nschool go to these for-profit schools. Twenty percent of all the \nFederal aid for education goes to these schools. Why? They are very \nexpensive. The tuition they charge is dramatically more than colleges \nand universities across the country. But here is the number to \nremember: As an industry, 40 percent of all the student loan defaults \nare students who attend for-profit colleges and universities. Why? It \nis so darned expensive that students can't continue the education and \ndrop out or they complete the education and many times find that the \ndiploma is worthless.\n  Let's go back to the Department of Defense. We want to protect our \nmen and women in uniform from being exploited by any college or \nuniversity, for-profit or not. The Department of Defense wrote a \nmemorandum of understanding and said: If you want to offer courses to \nour men and women in uniform, here are the rules to play by.\n  On October 7, the Department of Defense announced that they placed \nthe University of Phoenix on probation and prohibited them from \nenrolling new servicemembers in the DOD Tuition Assistance and MyCAA \nPrograms. They barred them from accessing military bases. The decision, \nthe Department said, was based on violations of the memorandum of \nunderstanding, which I described this morning, based on their own \nreview.\n  Yesterday the senior Senator from Arizona came to the floor to \nprotest the decision by the Department of Defense. There were several \nthings he said during the course of his floor statement which I would \nlike to address.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona claimed that the Department of \nDefense's ``actions were taken without due process'' and based on ``an \noutside investigative report.'' The Senator went on to say that it \n``wasn't a department investigation. There was no scrutiny.'' He said \nthat on the floor to protest the Department of Defense decision.\n  Here are the facts. The Department of Defense conducted nearly 4 \nmonths of review of the University of Phoenix's practices after the \nreport by the Center for Investigative Reporting raised allegations \nrelating to the company strategy using corporate sponsorship of events \non military bases to skirt the Federal rules on recruitment that had \nbeen spelled out in the memorandum of understanding.\n  The Department of Defense placed the University of Phoenix on \nprobation when its review ``revealed several violations of the \nDepartment of Defense Memorandum of Understanding.'' DOD also gave the \ncompany 14 days to provide the Department of Defense with materials in \nresponse to the decision.\n  To argue that there was no due process in this is betrayed by the \nfacts.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona went on to say: ``If the University \nof Phoenix is guilty of some wrongdoing, I want to be one of the first \nto make sure that proper penalties are enacted.''\n  Here is the fact: The Department of Defense confirmed that the \nUniversity of Phoenix is guilty of wrongdoing. The Department of \nDefense's notice to the university stated that ``it conducted a review \nof the agreements between the University of Phoenix and the DoD, as \nreflected in the DoD MOU. . . . This review revealed several violations \nof the DoD MOU attributed to the University of Phoenix, including, but \nnot limited to, transgression of Defense Department policies regarding \nuse of its official seals or other trademark insignia and failure to go \nthrough the responsible education advisor for each business related \nactivity requiring access to the DoD installations. . . .'' They go on \nto say that they found that ``the frequency and scope of these previous \nviolations of the DoD MOU is disconcerting.''\n  Despite this, the senior Senator from Arizona is urging the \nDepartment of Defense to ignore what they found in their investigation \nand to reverse their decision putting the company on probation.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona went on to call Phoenix's violations \n``minor breaches in decorum'' and ``technical in nature.''\n  The Department of Defense found that the University of Phoenix \nviolated terms of its memorandum of understanding--a legal document \nlaying out the rules and standards every institution must adhere to in \norder to be eligible to participate in voluntary military education \nprograms. For instance, this document specifies that the base's \neducation officer, not the base commander, is the sole approving \nauthority for any and all access to the base. In their violation of \nthis memorandum of understanding provision, the Department of Defense \ncalled the University of Phoenix's violations disconcerting in their \nfrequency and scope.\n  The company had a corporate strategy of spending millions of dollars \nto sponsor events on military bases to skirt Department of Defense \nrules and the 2012 Executive order that was designed to prohibit \ninstitutions from recruiting servicemembers on military bases.\n  Mr. President, let me spell out some of the things that were being \ndone by the University of Phoenix. Remember what we are talking about. \nThis university is receiving $20 million a year through DOD tuition \nassistance and $346 million through the GI bill. Of course, it is a big \nprofit center for them to continue this pursuit of the military, and \nthey spent a lot of money to support it, and that is what got them in \ntrouble.\n  The University of Phoenix spent over $250,000 in the last 3 years \njust in one location--Fort Campbell, KY--sponsoring 89 events. One \nevent featured a performer named Big Smo; that alone cost $25,000. \nAcross the country, the University of Phoenix sponsored events on \nmilitary bases, including rock concerts, Super Bowl parties, father-\ndaughter dances, Easter egg hunts, a chocolate festival, and even \nbrunch with Santa.\n  The University of Phoenix paid the Department of Defense to have its \nstaff serve as exclusive resume advisers in\n\n[[Page S7607]]\n\nHiring Our Heroes job fairs and workshops, many on military bases. A \nCenter of Investigative Reporting hidden camera documented that all of \nthe resume workshop materials, presentation slides, and sample \n``successful'' resumes were labeled with University of Phoenix \nmarketing, and trainers urged attendees to go to the University of \nPhoenix Web site for more information.\n  The University of Phoenix used ``challenge coins''--which the Senator \nfrom Arizona raised on the floor--with DOD seals and logos to show its \nclose relationship with the military without receiving prior approval. \nThe Senator from Arizona noted that other schools have done the same \nthing, including, he mentioned, Southern Illinois University. This \nSenator is not going to send a letter to the DOD protesting if they \nhold SIU or any school accountable for the same conduct as the \nUniversity of Phoenix. The senior Senator from Arizona did, and I think \nhe ought to reflect on that for a moment.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona says the University of Phoenix has a \nlong history of serving nontraditional students, such as Active-Duty \nmilitary and others. According to Paul Reickhoff of the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, the university of Phoenix ``is \nconstantly reported as the single worst by far'' when it comes to for-\nprofit colleges taking advantage of its members.\n\n  The Senator from Arizona says the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, the Education Department, and the California attorney general, \nKamala Harris, drove another for-profit school, Corinthian, out of \nbusiness without ever proving misconduct, and now we are attempting to \ndo the same to the University of Phoenix.\n  The fact is, there are ongoing investigations into the University of \nPhoenix by the Federal Trade Commission related to unfair and deceptive \npractices, including military recruitment and the handling of student \npersonal information. There is an investigation underway of the \nUniversity of Phoenix by the Department of Education's inspector \ngeneral related to marketing, recruitment, enrollment, financial aid \nprocessing, fraud prevention, student retention, personnel training, \nattendance, academic grading, et cetera.\n  There is an ongoing investigation into the University of Phoenix by \nthe Security and Exchange Commission relating to insider trading, and \nnot one but three different state attorneys general are investigating \nthe University of Phoenix for unfair and deceptive practices. The \nSenator from Arizona comes and protests that we are involved in some \nsort of ideological grandstanding--that is what he said, ideological \ngrandstanding--ignoring the evidence which I have presented this \nmorning about the investigations into the University of Phoenix going \non across agencies, State and Federal, and the investigation by the \nDepartment of Defense that led to this decision.\n  He also went on to say yesterday in his remarks:\n\n       Last year, the Education Department, Consumer Financial \n     Protection Bureau--\n\n  And an individual named Ms. Harris--\n\n     mounted a coordinated campaign that drove for-profit \n     Corinthian College out of business without ever proving \n     misconduct.\n\n  They were able to drive a college out of business. What a coincidence \nthat he would make that statement on the floor of the Senate yesterday, \nthe same day it was reported that a Federal judge in Chicago ordered \nCorinthian College--now bankrupt--to pay $530 million to the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, resolving a year-long lawsuit against the \nfor-profit chain for allegedly steering students into predatory student \nloans.\n  The CFPB Director, Richard Cordray, said in a statement, ``Today's \nruling marks the end of our litigation against a company that has \nseverely harmed tens of thousands of students, turning dreams of higher \neducation into a nightmare.'' I don't understand how the Senator from \nArizona could come to the floor the same day this Federal decision was \nreported and raise this issue without some knowledge of what the \nCorinthian Colleges were doing. What they were doing was lying. They \nwere misrepresenting to the Federal Government how many students were \nemployed after they graduated. It turns out Corinthian was paying \nemployers several thousand dollars to hire their students--graduates--\nfor a month or two so they could report to the Federal Government they \nhad jobs.\n  Of course, when the money ran out from Corinthian, the students lost \nthose part-time jobs. Corinthian was caught. They were asked to provide \ninformation to refute what I have just said. Instead of doing that, \nthey started dissembling and going out of business. They were also \nsteering students to what they called genesis loans at Corinthian \nCollege. Students were paying outrageous tuition and fees for \nbachelor's degrees, $60,000 or $75,000, and then they were facing \ngenesis loans, they called them, with interest rates as high as 15 \npercent.\n  This industry does have good schools and good courses in the for-\nprofit business sector, I am sure, but there has clearly been \nmisconduct. We have to call them on it and hold them responsible. It is \nour Federal Government that virtually acknowledges the accreditation of \nthese schools that offer Pell grants and direct student loans to their \nstudents, creating the impression among students and families that \nthese are perfectly good colleges and universities. We have a \nresponsibility to students and families across this Nation to police \ntheir ranks when there is misconduct. In this case, the Department of \nDefense looked closely and decided that the University of Phoenix was \ninvolved in misconduct. That is why they reached their decision.\n  There was a letter that was prepared by a number of organizations--I \nwill not read all of their names--but it was sent October 27 this week \nto the Honorable Ashton Carter, the Secretary of Defense, thanking the \nDepartment for their recent action when it came to the University of \nPhoenix. These organizations went on to catalog the things I have said \nthis morning. They also talk about the students these organizations \nhave worked with. This letter says servicemember complaints regarding \nthe University of Phoenix fall into three categories: servicemembers \nwho were signed up for loans without their knowledge or permission \nafter being promised they would incur no loans, servicemembers who were \nmisled about the cost of tuition increases at the University of \nPhoenix, servicemembers who were misled about the accreditation and \ntransferability of University of Phoenix credits.\n  Yesterday, the senior Senator from Arizona cited three students. I \nwould like to read from this letter. They note three students who were \nmembers of the military commenting on the University of Phoenix. First, \nCody Edie, of the U.S. Marines said:\n\n       I was told these credits would transfer anywhere nationwide \n     but as I began my transition from active duty I found out \n     they will not transfer to the schools in my home state. I \n     wasted my time and 15 credits for nothing.\n\n  A statement from Erin Potter, U.S. Army:\n\n       I was told by the University of Phoenix that I would be \n     eligible for grants that I did not have to pay back. I came \n     to find out they enrolled me in loans and now I cannot afford \n     the payments.\n\n  From Dennis Chamberlain, U.S. Army:\n\n       I attended the University of Phoenix to obtain my bachelors \n     degree. I racked up close to $20,000 in debt to attain my \n     degree. I feel they targeted me for my military student aid. \n     I struggle every month paying back the student loans I could \n     have avoided. I was shot twice in Afghanistan by shrapnel \n     from RPGs.\n\n  The letter is signed by about 20 different organizations: the Air \nForce Sergeants Association, the Association of the U.S. Navy, the \nAmerican Association of State Colleges and Universities, Blue Star \nFamilies, Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Ashton Carter,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Carter: We write to thank you and your staff \n     for the Department's recent action to enforce its Tuition \n     Assistance Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the \n     University of Phoenix. The MOU is the Department's main tool \n     for implementing Executive Order 13607 and its directive to \n     protect service members from deceptive recruiting, including \n     surreptitious recruiting on military installations.\n       In these difficult financial times, protecting the \n     integrity of the Tuition Assistance program is essential to \n     preservation of\n\n[[Page S7608]]\n\n     the program and its goal of military readiness and \n     professional development for our men and women in uniform. In \n     this context, the Department's action to enforce the MOU is a \n     prudent measure, and we feel more needs to be done to protect \n     the integrity of the program. Failure to take swift and \n     serious action against violations of the MOU harms service \n     members, taxpayers, and the program itself, and sends the \n     wrong message to other MOU signatories about the \n     acceptability of violations.\n       The Department's investigation concluded that ``the \n     frequency and scope'' of the University's violations was \n     ``disconcerting,'' including ``transgression of Defense \n     Department policies regarding use of its official seals or \n     other trademark insignia and failure to go through the \n     responsible education advisor for each business related \n     activity requiring access to the DoD installations.'' The \n     Department's letter to the University also raised concern \n     that ``several additional provisions'' of the MOU may have \n     been violated if allegations are substantiated about \n     deceptive marketing, recruiting, and billing of U.S. military \n     personnel raised in the law enforcement inquiries of the U.S. \n     Federal Trade Commission and California Attorney General. We \n     also would draw to your attention similar allegations that \n     also, if substantiated, would violate provisions of the MOU, \n     raised in ongoing investigations of the Attorneys General of \n     Delaware, Florida, and Massachusetts; the Enforcement \n     Division of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission; the \n     Mid-Atlantic Region of the U.S. Education Department's Office \n     of Inspector General; and the whistleblower suit brought by \n     University of Phoenix military recruiters filed in the \n     federal district court in Kentucky.\n       Although signatories to the MOU promise to eliminate unfair \n     and deceptive marketing and recruiting, such practices \n     continue. For example, many of our organizations are helping \n     service members and veterans who experienced deceptive \n     recruiting, and nearly 1,000 of these attended the University \n     of Phoenix. Their experiences over the past decade, and \n     through 2015, demonstrate a pattern consistent with the \n     allegations made by current law enforcement investigations. \n     Service members' complaints regarding the University of \n     Phoenix tend to fall into three categories: (1) service \n     members who were signed up for loans without their knowledge \n     or permission, after being promised they would incur no \n     loans; (2) service members who were misled about the cost and \n     tuition increases at University of Phoenix; and (3) service \n     members who were misled about the accreditation and \n     transferability of University of Phoenix credits. Below is a \n     small sampling of complaints about the University of Phoenix \n     from service members who used Tuition Assistance. The first \n     student attended the University as recently as 2015:\n       ``I was told these credits would transfer anywhere \n     nationwide but as I begin my transition from active duty, I \n     found out they will not transfer to the schools in my home \n     state. I wasted my time and 15 credits for nothing.''--Cody \n     Edie, U.S. Marines E-4\n       ``I was told by University of Phoenix that I would be \n     eligible for grants that I did not have to pay back. I came \n     to find out they enrolled me in loans and now I cannot afford \n     the payments.''--Erin Potter, U.S. Army E-5\n       ``I attended University of Phoenix to attain my bachelors \n     degree. I racked up close to $20,000 in debt to attain my \n     degree. I feel they targeted me for my military student aid. \n     I struggle every month paying back the student loans I could \n     have avoided. I was shot twice in Afghanistan by shrapnel \n     from RPGs.''--Dennis Chamberlain, U.S. Army 0-3\n       Because the Department's action affects only prospective \n     students, we also urge you to alert service members currently \n     enrolled at the University about the probation and current \n     law enforcement investigations, and remind them about the \n     availability of the Department's complaint system. Doing so \n     would aid those students and enhance the Department's ability \n     to identify MOU infractions. As you may know, the University \n     was required by SEC rules to notify its investors of these \n     actions; current students deserve to be informed as well.\n       We thank you for your efforts to protect the integrity of \n     the Tuition Assistance program and to protect service members \n     from deceptive recruiting practices. We hope the Department \n     will continue to take action against violations and consider \n     that reinstatement following a short probation could indicate \n     to other MOU signatories that violations are met with little \n     repercussion.\n           Sincerely,\n       Air Force Sergeants Association, American Association of \n     State Colleges and Universities, American Federation of \n     Labor--Congress of Industrial Organizations, Association of \n     the U.S. Navy, Blue Star Families, Campaign for America's \n     Future, Children's Advocacy Institute, Consumer Action, \n     Consumer Federation of California, Consumers Union, Empire \n     Justice Center, Higher Ed Not Debt, Institute for Higher \n     Education Policy, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n       Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, League of \n     United Latin American Citizens, National Association of \n     Consumer Advocates, National Consumer Law Center (on behalf \n     of its low-income clients), Paralyzed Veterans of America, \n     Public Law Center, Student Debt Crisis, Student Veterans of \n     America, The Education Trust, The Institute for College \n     Access & Success, University of San Diego Veterans Legal \n     Clinic, Veterans Education Success, Veterans for Common \n     Sense, Veterans Student Loan Relief Fund, VetJobs, VetsFirst, \n     a program of United Spinal Association, Vietnam Veterans of \n     America, Working America, Young Invincibles.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to wrap up. I read carefully \nwhat the senior Senator from Arizona had to say yesterday. I hope I \nhave addressed each of the major points he raised. There was indeed an \ninvestigation. There were standards which the University of Phoenix \nagreed to follow and then failed to follow. There is an effort underway \nto make sure we protect the men and women in the military and their \nfamilies from exploitation when it comes to their GI bills. We should \ncontinue that effort.\n  I hope my friend and colleague from Arizona who has made a record in \nthe Senate of speaking up, standing up to avoid those misuses of \nFederal funds, will continue in that same vein when it comes to this \nissue. We want money well spent. We want our men and uniform well \nserved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Crop Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the chairman of the Senate agriculture \ncommittee is on the floor, and I thank him for his tenacity and \ndiligent work on behalf of America's farmers and rural communities.\n  I have discussed with the chairman his concerns about crop insurance \nprovisions in the fiscal agreement and their impact on farmers, \nconcerns which are shared by our counterparts in the House of \nRepresentatives. I also have concerns about the changes to crop \ninsurance and what it will mean to the future farmers in my State. We \nhave a big agricultural community in Kentucky, and I have certainly \nheard from them in great numbers over the past couple of days.\n  Farming has been a long tradition in my State. Kentucky is made up \nlargely of smaller family farms--farms that have been passed down from \ngeneration to generation. These folks rely heavily on the notion that a \nbad-crop-yield year will not stop their ability to continue farming \nbecause of the certainty provided through this crop insurance program.\n  It is our joint understanding that the House leaders will work to \nreverse these crop insurance changes and find bipartisan alternative \ndeficit reduction savings when they consider the omnibus appropriations \nbill later this year.\n  So I assure my friend from Kansas and the other Members of our \nconference who care about this that I will work closely with him to \nsupport the House in these efforts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the distinguished leader yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to engage in this colloquy that \nour distinguished Republican leader has already mentioned or stressed. \nI also thank our majority whip, the Senator from Texas, and the senior \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, with regard to a commitment made \nbetween all of us on the floor.\n  This commitment is in reference to the obvious need to remedy the \nlanguage adversely affecting our Nation's farmers and ranchers that is \nnow included in the Bipartisan Budget Act. This provision, section 201, \nincluded in the underlying bill, should it go into effect, would \ngreatly damage the crop insurance program as we know it, not to mention \nthe farmers who purchase this crop insurance.\n  The commitment we have reached is to reverse these damaging cuts and \npolicy changes to the crop insurance program in order to protect our \nproducers' primary risk management tool and their No. 1 priority. In \nall of the great talk and effort that we had to pass the farm bill--\nover 400 days--the No. 1 issue to farmers, ranchers, and every \ncommodity group and every farm organization was crop insurance.\n  This legislative action--or fix, if we want to call it that--will \ntake place in consideration of the year-end spending bill. I have been \nworking very closely\n\n[[Page S7609]]\n\nwith House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, who has reached \na similar position with the House leadership. It was a tough trail, but \nMike got it done.\n  We have all agreed here to restore these funds to the program and \nreverse this policy and do so with support from the House and the \nSenate.\n  I yield to our distinguished majority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to the majority \nleader and to the chairman of the agriculture committee in the Senate, \nas well as to the two Senators from South Dakota, Mr. Thune and Mr. \nRounds, for their cooperation and their commitment to address this \nissue.\n  I particularly wish to join the chairman of the agriculture \ncommittee, Senator Roberts, in commending Mike Conaway, a good Texan, \nwho is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, whom I know cares \nvery deeply about this issue.\n  Texas is a huge agricultural State and 98 percent of our agricultural \nproduction is run by families and employs one out of every seven \nTexans. Texas ranchers and farmers are no strangers to the perils \ncaused by drought and other weather-related events beyond their \ncontrol.\n  With the current regulatory environment and unforeseen perils they \nface, I understand the necessity and the viability of the crop \ninsurance program to their livelihoods.\n  So I wish to say that I too stand ready to support our colleagues, \nworking together to find a solution to this important problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from South Dakota, the senior Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nThune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Kansas, \nwho is the distinguished chairman of the agriculture committee, on \nwhich I serve, as well as the leader and the whip in the Senate.\n  I rise in support as well of restoring what would be some very \ndevastating cuts to an important program, the crop insurance program. \nThe cuts were supposed to be imposed by the budget agreement that was \nreached and that we are going to be voting on later today.\n  Crop insurance plays a critical role in supporting South Dakota \nagriculture. It is my State's No. 1 industry. Crop losses due to \ndrought, wind, hail, and excessive moisture provide the greatest \nchallenges to economic survival and sustainability in production \nagriculture. Crop insurance provides the only viable risk management \ntool to meet those challenges. So it is imperative that we preserve \ncrop insurance and maintain its viability.\n  I support the agreement that has been discussed on the floor today. I \nwill work with the leader, the chairman, my Senate colleagues, and my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Rounds, who has been involved in \nthese discussions, to make sure we find a reasonable alternative to the \nunworkable cuts to crop insurance that are found in section 201 of the \nBipartisan Budget Act.\n  I thank the majority leader, the whip, and the chairman of our \nagriculture committee for their commitment to our farming families and \nrural economies across this great country. I also thank those who have \nworked in the House to come to a point where we can have this \ndiscussion and move forward in a way that will preserve what is a very \nimportant program for production agriculture in this country.\n  I ask the chairman of the agriculture committee, Senator Roberts, \nthrough the Presiding Officer, if the House has reached a similar \nagreement in terms of the discussion that we are having in the Senate \ntoday.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my friend for the question. I \nrespond to my friend that, yes, the chairman, Mike Conaway, has reached \na bipartisan agreement with the House leadership and also the chairman \nof the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Rogers from Kentucky. So there \nis bipartisan agreement with the House leadership, and it is now time \nfor the Senate to respond.\n  I also echo the comments of the senior Senator from South Dakota, \nwith the help of Senator Rounds, and I would be remiss in not \nmentioning virtually every member of the ag committee who has been \ninvolved in this effort as well. I appreciate the work of my colleagues \nand the work of our ranking member, Senator Stabenow. I especially want \nto thank her for raising this issue and helping to find an agreement.\n  I note that I have worked my entire career to build crop insurance as \na public-private partnership that best protects our producers, \ntaxpayers, and consumers, not to mention a very hungry and malnourished \nworld. This agreement reached today continues in that effort to fulfill \nthat mission. I thank the majority leader, the majority whip, and \nSenator Thune for their commitment. I also thank many of our colleagues \nwho helped reach this solution today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nbipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the legislation that passed in the House \nlast night and that I expect we will be voting on soon in the Senate.\n  Anyone who hasn't been living in a cave for the last few weeks is \naware of the controversy surrounding this legislation. However, while \nthe bill is likely no one's idea of an ideal path forward, I believe \nthe controversy stems more from political considerations than from \npolicy or substance.\n  Let me say one thing up front. I don't love this legislation. If we \nwere living in the ``United States of Orrin Hatch'' this bill would \nlook very different, but while I may not like parts of this deal very \nmuch, there are other things I like much less, including political \nbrinksmanship on important matters and election-year posturing on \ncomplicated issues.\n  This budget deal, while far from perfect, will help eliminate several \nhurdles that must be overcome in the near term and hopefully allow \nCongress to function and to actually govern over the next year. That \nsaid, there are some very important provisions in this bill that I \nthink will be counted as wins for good government and will help us \naddress some important issues. So I would like to take just a few \nminutes and talk about some of the specifics of this legislation and \nwhy I believe these provisions are important.\n  First, as we all know, the bill would suspend the statutory debt \nlimit through mid-March of 2017. I have heard a number of my colleagues \ndecry this provision, arguing that any increase in the debt limit \nshould be accompanied by fiscal reforms, and on that count my \ncolleagues are right.\n  I think you would be hard-pressed to find many Members in this \nChamber who have spent more time than I have talking about our Nation's \ndebt and calling for reforms. I have spoken extensively about the need \nto rein in our broken entitlement programs, which are the main drivers \nof our debt. Unlike most Members of Congress, I have actually come up \nwith specific proposals that would help stave off the growing \nentitlement crisis. On top of that, as chairman of the Senate committee \nwith jurisdiction over the debt limit, I have repeatedly called on the \nObama administration to do what past administrations have done, which \nis to use debt limit increases as opportunities to reexamine our fiscal \nsituation and work with Congress to find a path toward reforms that \nwill improve our fiscal outlook.\n\n  Unfortunately, these calls and similar calls made by other leaders in \nCongress have largely gone ignored as the administration refuses to \neven consider fiscal changes in the context of a debt limit increase. I \nam as frustrated as anyone by the refusal of this administration to \neven engage on this issue. However, the President's refusal to be \nreasonable and to do his job when it comes to our debt is no excuse for \nCongress failing to do its job and prevent a default.\n  I know some of my colleagues either don't believe a default would be \nthat bad or that the result of hitting the debt limit would even be \nclassified as a default. I will not delve into the semantics of the \nissue, I will just say that hitting the debt limit would prevent the \ngovernment from meeting a\n\n[[Page S7610]]\n\nlarge number of its obligations. Nothing good and many things that are \nbad will come from that result. No reasonable person would dispute \nthat.\n  In addition, I don't think any reasonable person wants to see \nCongress push up against debt limit deadlines multiple times throughout \n2016. Mixing a looming possibility of default with election-year \nposturing--and I am talking about posturing on both sides of the aisle, \nby the way--is, in my view, a recipe for disaster. This budget bill \nwill suspend the debt limit and spare Congress and the American people \nthe spectacle of ticking debt clocks in the middle of an election \nseason. Once again, this isn't my preferred result, but it is much \nbetter than the alternative.\n  In addition to raising the debt limit, the bill would extend the life \nof the Social Security disability insurance, or SSDI, trust fund \nthrough a temporary reallocation of resources from the retirement trust \nfund into the disability insurance program.\n  As we all know, the SSDI trust fund is set to be exhausted sometime \nlate next year, which would lead to benefit cuts of around 20 percent \nfor disabled Americans. I am not willing to do that. Right now, the \nbeneficiaries in the disability program face enormous uncertainty, and \nthat will only get worse between now and the end of 2016 if Congress \nfails to act.\n  I have been urging action on this issue for quite some time and have \nput forward a number of proposals to reform various aspects of the \ndisability insurance program. Sadly, despite many calls for bipartisan \ncooperation, the administration has decided to remain silent, aside \nfrom the very simple and overly broad reallocation proposal. \nNonetheless, the budget bill will, as I mentioned, provide an interfund \nreallocation that will add an additional 6 years of viability to the \nSSDI trust fund, preventing benefit cuts to disabled American workers \nand removing the current uncertainty.\n  That is not all. The bill would also put in place reforms to the SSDI \nProgram, including some of the proposals I put forward earlier this \nyear and reflecting a great deal of work between Chairman Paul Ryan of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee and Representative Sam Johnson, who \nchairs the Social Security Subcommittee, and me. Our work led to a \nnumber of features of the budget bill's treatment of SSDI that will \nhelp combat fraud in the program, make it easier for those who can and \ndesire to return to work to be able to do so, and improve the overall \nadministration and integrity of the disability program.\n  As I said before, this is not a budget bill that I would have \nwritten, and I think there are a number of other ways to improve the \nSSDI Program and Social Security more generally. However, nothing in \nthe bill prevents us from continuing our work to develop and refine \nideas and come up with additional improvements. Given the \nunsustainability of the Social Security System generally, we will have \nto continue to work on reforms to ensure these programs are available \nto future generations.\n  For now, we must be realistic. If we don't act now to prevent next \nyear's benefit cuts, we will create a cliff that will occur right in \nthe middle of an election campaign, when fundamental reforms to an \nentitlement program will be virtually impossible. Instead of a real \ndebate over the future of this important program, we would see \naccusations lobbed back and forth about which side is responsible for \nthe impending benefit cuts. Why would anyone want that? What good would \nthat accomplish?\n  I would also like to remind my colleagues that the SSDI reforms in \nthis budget bill represent the most significant changes to any Social \nSecurity program since 1983--more than three decades ago. That is \nnothing to sneeze at. So while critics may be right that these changes \naren't the only types of long-term fixes the SSDI Program needs, they \nshould not by any means be overlooked.\n  While we are on the subject of entitlements, I also want to point out \nthat this budget bill will avert an unprecedented and large increase in \nMedicare Part B premiums for millions of elderly Americans. Under the \nlaw, there is a complicated interplay between the Social Security and \nMedicare Programs, where under what is called the ``hold harmless'' \nrule, the majority of Medicare beneficiaries cannot see a premium \nincrease greater than their cost-of-living adjustment under Social \nSecurity. However, due to very low inflation, there will be no cost-of-\nliving adjustments in Social Security in 2016, meaning there can be no \npremium increases for the majority of Medicare Part B participants. \nThis means the full amount of what the Medicare system needs to collect \nin Part B premiums for next year will be charged to the nearly 30 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries who do not have their premiums \ndeducted from their Social Security payments.\n\n  Long story short, absent some kind of action, more than one-quarter \nof all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will see their premiums go up as \nmuch as 52 percent in 2016. This bill is important, with all its \nfaults, and that is a great reason to vote for it. The legislation \nbefore us will prevent this increase, once again allowing Congress to \navoid a contentious fight and preventing many seniors from becoming \npawns in the unending liberal political gamesmanship and demagoguery. \nMost importantly it would do so in a responsible manner.\n  In addition to sparing our country some needless political fights \nover Social Security and Medicare, this bill will also repeal the \nemployer autoenrollment requirement under the so-called Affordable Care \nAct. This provision, once implemented, would require large employers to \nautomatically enroll new employees in health insurance plans, putting \nthe burden on employees who prefer alternative plans to opt out. This \nprovision, like many provisions of ObamaCare, never made sense and \nultimately had few champions outside left-leaning think tanks that \ncontinually advocate for the government to ``nudge'' citizens into what \nsome technocrats believe are preferred outcomes by removing certain \nnonpreferred choices.\n  So with this legislation we have bipartisan agreement on the need to \nremove at least part--and not an insignificant part--of ObamaCare. That \nis important. That is a good reason to vote for this. Obviously, we \nneed to do more, but in my view any acknowledgement from my friends on \nthe other side that any part of the President's health care law doesn't \nwork is good progress. We haven't been able to get them to admit that \nin all these years of this failing program that is going on.\n  Finally, and for many most significantly, the bipartisan budget \nlegislation would partially lift the budget caps established under the \nBudget Control Act both for domestic spending priorities and national \ndefense. While very few people in Congress or elsewhere are big fans of \nthe sequester threat, it did result in the only legitimate measurable \nspending cuts we have seen in quite some time. It is especially \nnoteworthy, given the current administration's seemingly insatiable \ndesire for more debt-fueled spending.\n  I sympathize with my colleagues who might be hesitant to lift those \nspending caps. However, I think we need to keep a few things in mind. \nFirst, the increase in the spending baseline under this bill is fully \noffset. That is important. While not all of the offsets are ideal, it \nis important that the spending cap relief will not result in increased \ndebt or a tax hike. Let me repeat that. It is important to note that \nthe spending cap relief will not result in increased debt or a tax \nhike. In that sense, the spending caps, even with the relief included \nin this bill, continue to be successful. Let me repeat that again. In \nthat sense, the spending caps, even with the relief included in this \nbill, continue to be successful.\n  Second, lifting the spending caps will help us ensure our military is \nproperly funded, although many of us would like to do more with the \nworld in the turmoil it is in. Many Members of Congress, particularly \non the Republican side, have expressed concern regarding the impact of \nthe spending caps on our men and women in uniform and our overall \nmilitary readiness. Make no mistake, these are dangerous times. \nAmerican generals and military officials have made clear the spending \nlevels under the Budget Control Act are not enough to meet the \nchallenges our Nation faces on the world stage. Between the threat of \nISIS in Iraq and\n\n[[Page S7611]]\n\nSyria, Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, and our newly prolonged \ntroop presence in Afghanistan, now is not the time to underfund our \nmilitary. We need to be sure our troops have all the resources they \nneed to succeed.\n\n  As we know, President Obama has conditioned any budget-cap relief for \ndefense on similar relief for other domestic spending programs. While I \nagree with many of my colleagues that this represents an odd set of \npriorities for a Commander in Chief--his No. 1 duty is to keep us \nsafe--we should not let the President's refusal to do right by our \nmilitary lead us to do the same.\n  In addition to criticisms of the substance of the bill, some of which \nI agree with, I have also heard complaints about the process that led \nus here. On that front as well, I share some of my colleagues' \nconcerns. It certainly would have been better to move this legislation \nthrough regular order, including committee consideration and an open \namendment process. I can't speak for anyone else, but I would assume \nthat almost everyone involved would prefer to see legislation of this \nmagnitude move through the House and Senate in a more deliberative \nprocess and a longer timetable. Unfortunately, for a variety of \nreasons, that is not what happened.\n  However, much of the time, effective government is about the art of \ndoing what is doable. Though Republicans control both Chambers of \nCongress, there is a Democrat in the White House and enough Democrats \nin the Senate to sustain a filibuster. That is just a fact. We have to \nlive with that. If we want to get anything done around here, we cannot \ndemand perfection, nor can we operate in a zero-sum environment where \nevery victory for the other side, however minor, is considered a loss \nfor yours.\n  I get that there are some who sincerely and truthfully believe that \ncompromise inherently means failure, and I know there are others with \ndifferent agendas in mind that lead them to oppose anything resembling \na concession to the other side, no matter what their side may get in \nreturn, but I have been around here long enough to know that such an \napproach does not often yield satisfactory results. If you are going to \nwait for that perfect bill to come around, my experience has taught me \nthat you are likely to wait a very long time.\n  The budget bill before us is far from perfect. But, as the saying \ngoes, the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. Under the \ncircumstances, I believe this bill needs to pass so we can solve these \nproblems, remove many dangerous obstacles directly in front of us, and \ngive ourselves a chance to govern effectively without the cliffs, \ncrises, and deadlines that all too frequently dictate what we do around \nhere. For these reasons I plan to vote yes on this legislation, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Having said that, I would like to compliment our majority leader. He \nhas one of the toughest jobs ever on Capitol Hill.\n  I want to compliment the House as well. I have worked very closely \nwith the distinguished new Speaker of the House. He is a tremendous \nhuman being. He does not reject the doable. He is a very strong \nconservative, one of the strongest people in either House of Congress, \nas is our majority leader. Both of them are doing what has to be done, \nand they deserve to have support in doing that. I compliment my friends \non the other side for the successes they consider they have made.\n  On the other hand, I wish to pay tribute to our majority leader and \nthe work that he is doing, trying to keep this fractious group of \npeople together in so many ways and to get important legislation like \nthis passed so that we are working on even more important legislation \nin the future.\n  I want to personally pay tribute to Paul Ryan for his election to \nSpeaker of the House. We have worked very closely together, as he has \nbeen chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. We have met almost \nweekly ever since he took over as chairman of that committee and I as \nchairman of the Finance Committee. He is one of the truly great people \nin the Congress, and I personally want to express my view that we are \nlucky to have him. We are lucky to have our distinguished majority \nleader as well.\n  I want to compliment my friends on the other side who have been \nworking to do the art of the doable and, though imperfect, have worked \nwith both of these leaders to get this done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                            The Middle East\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a very troubled part of \nthe world, the Middle East, a region that is experiencing perhaps the \ngreatest turmoil it has seen since the end of the First World War.\n  After more than 4 years, with over 200,000 people killed and 4 \nmillion forced to flee, Syria's civil war and humanitarian crisis \ncontinues to drag on. President Assad still clings to power, and he \nclings to that power with the help of Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah.\n  Opposition groups remain divided, and they are weak, while terrorist \ngroups like ISIS and Al Qaeda's al-Nusra Front exploit the chaos. ISIS \nalso exploits sectarian tensions across the border in Iraq, where its \nfighters battle Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as Shia militias, for \ncontrol of large parts of the country. And, according to press reports, \na Saudi-led coalition meanwhile battles Iranian-backed Houthi rebels \nfor control of Yemen, home to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n  In addition to its support for Assad and terror and proxy groups, \nIran continues other hostile activities, such as testing ballistic \nmissiles, attacking in cyberspace, and violating human rights. I think \nthis is an important thing to remember, as the expectations of the \nIranian joint nuclear agreement--this was not a panacea for all of the \nthings that Iran is doing. As a matter of fact, it specifically was a \nnegotiation to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, which I think \nhas been achieved for at least 10, if not 15 to 25, years.\n  Then, to add to the complications regarding Iran, there are still \nfour Americans detained or missing. One that is missing, of course, is \nour Floridian Bob Levinson, a former FBI agent.\n  These are tough challenges that reflect a changing balance of power, \nand we have already taken important steps to meet them. I am talking \nabout steps other than the Iranian nuclear joint agreement. American \nand coalition air strikes against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria and the \ntraining and equipping of Iraqi and Kurdish forces in Iraq have blunted \nISIS's momentum, and we are starting to see some reverses there. As the \nSecretary of Defense just a few days ago told our Armed Services \nCommittee, we are changing our approach to supporting the moderate \nSyrian opposition and equipping those forces already on the battlefield \nagainst ISIS. It is much more difficult in Syria, and we have not had a \nlot of success in training and equipping those so-called moderate \nforces in Syria.\n  So now the changing strategy is that the United States is focusing on \nwhat the Secretary of Defense referred to as the ``three R's''--the \nISIS strongholds of Raqqa in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq and then targeted \nraids in both to build battlefield momentum. We saw such a raid that \ntragically took the life of a senior enlisted Special Forces Special \nOperations sergeant the other day, but that raid was particularly \nsuccessful in that it rescued 70 people who were about to be executed \nthe next morning. In those raids, the three R's the Secretary mentioned \nare underway.\n  Turmoil and violence in the Middle East may seem distant to everyday \nAmericans, but the consequences extend far beyond those regions. We see \nit daily on our television screens. Tens of thousands of Syrians have \nsought refuge in Europe. ISIS, we are reminded, uses the Internet and \nsocial media to spread its propaganda and radicalizes young people far \nfrom Iraq and Syria and even some in the United States.\n  So in this whole perplexing problem, as we try to get our arms around \nit, meeting these challenges, protecting our national security and \ninterests, including those of our allies like Israel, is going to take \nstrong and patient leadership on the part of our country.\n  I wanted to share these thoughts with the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7612]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is not always easy to get a majority \nof Congress to agree on something. But when it comes to the Export-\nImport Bank, the numbers are now clear. Three days ago, the House \neasily passed a bill to reauthorize this critically important program, \n313 to 118. Months before that, here in the Senate, we approved \nreauthorization 64 to 29. That is a supermajority in both Chambers, so \nno one should think we should not be able to pass this. But right now, \nthe will of a bipartisan supermajority is being blocked by Senate \nRepublican leaders who have so far refused us the opportunity to act. \nThis lack of movement on this critical issue is unacceptable, and \npeople across the country are not going to stand for it.\n  Every single day that passes without this program in operation, \nAmerica's businesses--most of them small businesses--are at a \ndisadvantage. That is because one of the main goals of the Export-\nImport Bank is to level the playing field for American companies to \nsell their goods overseas.\n  There are 60 other export credit agencies worldwide, including \nseveral in China. While companies around the world are enjoying the \nsupport of their own lending programs, this Congress allowed one of its \nbest tools to grow the economy to go dark. That is now hurting our \neconomy at a time when we should be continuing to work to build and \ngrow and create jobs.\n  For months, I have heard from businesses in my home State of \nWashington that they are being held back by partisan grandstanding \nnearly 3,000 miles away. Businesses in Washington State make great \nproducts, and they want to ship what they make overseas and continue to \nbuild their business at home, and Congress ought to be a good partner \nin that effort.\n  This isn't a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is about \nsupporting American companies that are creating local jobs, adding to \nour economy, and helping our economy grow from the middle out. It is \nwhy the Export-Import Bank has had the support of this body now for \nmore than 80 years.\n  I urge Republican leaders to stop allowing extreme members of their \nparty--a minority of their party--to hold our economy hostage. It is \ntime to renew the Export-Import Bank on behalf of American businesses, \nAmerican workers, and American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 597\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, once again we are down on the floor of \nthe Senate, begging, pleading, and trying to get anyone to listen to \nour pleas to once again open the Export-Import Bank. As we look at the \nconsequences of having closed--for the last 3\\1/2\\ months--the Export-\nImport Bank, it becomes readily apparent every day and every hour that \nwe are losing American manufacturing jobs and we are stressing small \nbusinesses that have a strong history of reliance on the Export-Import \nBank, and that we are, in fact, not only not helping American business, \nbut we are hurting American manufacturers in this country.\n  Why would we do that? Why would we wait one more day? Before the \ncharter expired on the Export-Import Bank, we were told that the reason \nwhy--even though we had 64 votes in the Senate for the Ex-Im Bank--we \ncouldn't possibly get this done was because the House of \nRepresentatives would not take this up. The House of Representatives \nwould not move on the Ex-Im Bank, and, in fact, if it came to the \nfloor, it was doubtful that we would actually get a vote that was \nfavorable to the Ex-Im Bank. Well, a funny thing happened when we \nlooked at the reality of where the House of Representatives is today.\n  When we counted the votes this week for the Ex-Im Bank, guess what; \nover 70 percent of the House of Representatives voted to reauthorize \nthe Ex-Im Bank. And probably even more remarkable, a majority of \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives voted to reauthorize the \nEx-Im Bank.\n  Now, you might wonder: What changed? What happened? How could we \npossibly have been so wrong?\n  Well, let me tell you that no one in their right mind in the business \ncommunity ever believed that we would let the Ex-Im Bank charter \nexpire, and so everybody assumed that we would do the right thing \nhere--that the charter would go on and that this would happen. Guess \nwhat happened. When we shut down the Ex-Im Bank and people weren't able \nto approach the Ex-Im Bank to get credit guarantees to do the work of \nmanufacturing and exporting, all of a sudden, those small business men \nand women and those employees of those institutions picked up their \nphones and started calling their Members of Congress. When they called \ntheir Members of Congress, that is when we saw action. That is when we \nsaw things moving in a direction that actually supports American \nmanufacturing.\n  This is an institution that has been reauthorized many times. This is \nan institution that has been in existence for decades. It is an \ninstitution that is in competition with dozens--in fact, about 80 or 90 \nexport credit agencies are run by other countries--of credit agencies \nevery day. They are competing against those same agencies.\n  What we have now is unilateral disarmament. Imagine this: American \nmanufacturers--longstanding manufacturers--are actually considering \nmoving their manufacturing facilities offshore so that they can compete \nfor this export business. We can't wait another minute. We can't wait \nanother day. We can't wait for another opportunity to present itself. \nWe have to do this now.\n  I understand and know that I am new to this institution. But most \ntimes when you have supermajorities in support of something, it \nshouldn't be that hard to get it done, and we know the President will \nsign it.\n  I am always a little shocked when people say: Well, you know, we \nstill can't get that done because we need to find a vehicle. And I \nthink: Well, what does that mean when you actually introduce a bill and \nthe bill itself is sitting at the desk and there is an opportunity not \nto try to attach something so that somebody can hide their vote or not \nto try to attach it to something because you might be able to leverage \nanother idea on there but to actually move this bill forward?\n  We don't need to look for a vehicle. We don't need to look for \nanother opportunity to advance the Ex-Im Bank. Guess what we need. We \nneed to bring this bill to the floor right now. We need to ask our \ncolleagues to engage in what we should be doing here, which is debate \nand legislation on the floor of the Senate. We need to resolve this \nissue and wrap it up.\n  When we started this journey, we were told the Ex-Im Bank was in need \nof reform. In a very bipartisan way, my office sat down with Senator \nKirk's office, joined by Senator Blunt, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator \nManchin, and Senator Donnelly and said: What do we need to do to make \nthe Ex-Im Bank better? What do we need to do to make the Ex-Im Bank \nmore accessible and more accountable?\n  We negotiated something that is rare here, which is a bipartisan \nbill, the Kirk-Heitkamp Ex-Im Bank reauthorization bill. That bill has \nbeen the vehicle and the kind of blueprint for how we are going to move \nforward. In fact, when the House did their discharge petition, they \ndischarged the bill that is, in fact, the Kirk-Heitkamp bill. There is \nnothing in there where we have to balance this or somehow reconcile a \nHouse version and a Senate version.\n  We can get this done today. We can move this forward. We can send the \nmessage to the rest of the world that the Ex-Im Bank and American \nmanufacturers are open for business. It makes absolutely no sense for \nus to wait any longer and in any way delay the movement of the Ex-Im \nBank.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n[[Page S7613]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor her continued leadership on this issue and for pointing out to our \ncolleagues that we really could be just a short step away from \nreauthorizing a very important business tool for small businesses, \nmanufacturers, and the agriculture industry by making sure that we \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  What my colleague is referring to is that it would take just a short \nagreement here this morning to go ahead and take the House-passed bill \nthat, as she explained, was passed after colleagues got a discharge \npetition, but it is the same as the language that we have had over here \nin the Senate.\n  The process to move forward on this reauthorization would be very \nsimple. I am sure Senator Heitkamp pointed out before I got to the \nfloor that a filibuster-proof majority of our colleagues approve of \nthis legislation. I think 67 of our colleagues approve of this, and now \nwe have this tremendous support--313 votes--from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  As Senator Heitkamp said, we are just a short step away. Why are we \nso emphatic about that? Why wait? When we look at what has just come \nout, the financial numbers show a 1.5 percent job growth. I think it is \nsomething like that. It shows very anemic numbers for our economy.\n  I don't know about anybody else, but since we are a very cyclical \neconomy in the Northwest, or we have been for various periods of time \nin our history, my constituents expect me to get up every day and fight \nfor things that will improve the economic opportunity of America, and \nthat is what we are doing here.\n  When we look at 2014, it supported $27.4 billion in U.S. exports and \n164,000 jobs. My colleagues know how much the economy outside of the \nUnited States is growing. So we want to sell them U.S.-made products. I \nthink it is one of the biggest economic opportunities in front of us. I \nbelieve in what we make.\n  I complained because I think exotic financial instruments got us into \ntrouble, and I want to be known for something in the United States of \nAmerica besides exotic financial instruments. I like that we make \nairplanes and automobiles.\n  The Senator from Michigan has joined us on the floor. I like that we \nmake great agriculture products from North Dakota that are then \nexported around the globe.\n  I visited Bob's Red Mill in Oregon. That company makes a great \nvariety of various grain products that are shipped all over the world. \nThey use the Export-Import Bank as a way to gain access because not \nevery bank in Oregon is brave enough to take on a deal in Tanzania or \nsome other country. Why? Because the banking doesn't exist there. So \nthe Oregon bank says: OK, I will bank you. I will get Bob's Red Mill \nsold in all of those places, but I want some credit insurance. I want \nto be sure that you have an insurance program in case something goes \nwrong, and that is where the Export-Import Bank comes in.\n  In 2014, we had $27.4 billion in U.S. exports and 164,000 jobs.\n  Where have we been since 2008? It has helped us with 1.4 million \njobs. Our economic information shows that we have had a somewhat anemic \nquarter in our country. I would say it is interesting that it did \ncoincide with this issue of the Export-Import Bank, and this whole \nmalaise here of not getting work done probably didn't make anybody \nhappy in business, and there is the fact that a lot of doubt and \nuncertainty plagued us.\n  So if you want to help the economy, let's just agree this morning \nthat the Export-Import Bank is a great tool to help U.S. manufacturers \ngrow their economic opportunities outside of the United States. Let's \njust agree this morning and get this done, and we will be moving ahead \non this important issue.\n  Now, some people are saying: Let's just wait. I am saying: What we \nare risking by waiting is more job loss, more small businesses at risk, \nand the U.S. economy at risk. There are more than $9 billion in pending \nExport-Import Bank deals on the table--$9 billion. That can't get done \nbecause the Bank doesn't exist anymore. If you just think about that, \nthose are U.S. companies that have economic activity to do around the \nglobe to help us grow the U.S. economy at a time when we have been \nanemic. If no one objects to my motion, we would restart that engine \ntoday.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator from Washington yield for one quick \nquestion?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Was that $9 billion?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We have economic activity that is hanging in the \nbalance, and because of this inactivity, we are losing $9 billion every \nsingle day?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is billion with a ``B''?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes. That's the dollar value of deals for U.S. \ncompanies being held up that could be moved forward.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Shocking.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 282, H.R. 597, the Export-Import Bank \nReform and Reauthorization Act, and that the bill be read a third time \nand passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would remind my colleagues that we \nvoted on the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank already. There \nare numerous objections on this side of the aisle; therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues realize that the \neconomic activity we could be seeing today could help us in everything \nwe are doing moving forward.\n  While the Senate has passed the Export-Import Bank, it is part of a \nlarger transportation package that this Senator hopes will actually get \ndone. But there are many people who don't want to see the Export-Import \nBank reauthorized. In fact, some of our colleagues suggested in the \nrecent budget deal that they put a 1-year provision in for the Export-\nImport Bank. I don't support a 1-year provision. We support a 5-year \nreauthorization, and we want to get to that now. We do not want to see \nmore jobs shifted overseas as we continue to have this debate, because \nthat is what is happening. We are giving economic opportunity to other \ncountries to take advantage of our businesses.\n  I hope we will take this up and move it forward so that we can get \neconomic opportunities back in front of the American people at a time \nwhen we most critically need to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Will my friend from Washington yield for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. We have now had this experience of 3\\1/2\\ months--\nreally 4 months because we are at the end of October--with no \nopportunity for a small business to actually look at how they could \ngrow that small business. We know we have lost jobs all across America \nin States where they are economically challenged. Opportunities are \nthere. We know that the large institutions, the large manufacturers in \nour country, some of which are in Senator Cantwell's State, rely on \nthis small business chain of businesses, and those are the businesses \nthat have been hit the hardest.\n  If we wait, again, for another promise that we are going to put it on \nanother vehicle--how much more inactivity, how much more disruption to \nthese small businesses can these small supply chains have given their \neconomics? Isn't it true that a small business is much more challenged \nby a day's delay in opening up the Ex-Im Bank than a large corporation?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor her question because she is right on the pinpoint of what this \nissue is about. It is really about small businesses that don't have \nhuge capital reserves to set aside money so that they can guarantee the \nsale of their product.\n  As I said, there is $9 billion of pending issues before the Bank \nright now, and many of those are small businesses. So those small \nbusinesses could\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\nbe opening up economic opportunity that might grow their revenue \nsignificantly and allow them to create more jobs. When we think about \nthe motion I just made, if no one had objected, that $9 billion would \nhave been free to go out into the economy, those deals would have \ngotten done, those small businesses would have been empowered, and we \nwould be on our way to winning in what is an export economy.\n  Why is it an export economy? Because the growing middle class around \nthe globe is going to double in the next several years. Ninety-five \npercent of consumers live outside the United States of America. So we \nwant to win economic opportunity, and we have to be able to sell \noutside the United States of America. It is hard because not every \nplace in the United States of America is so developed that their \nbanking system is there to do deals.\n  This great company in my State, in Spokane, SCAFCO--two of my \ncolleagues here--the ranking member on the Agriculture Committee, from \nMichigan, and my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp--are \nvery active in agriculture issues and will get it. He is basically \nmaking and selling aluminum grain containers, silos, all over the \nworld. That is his business. He has expanded it, built new buildings, \nand he has an incredible workforce.\n  As the rest of the world--particularly in Africa and South America \nbut even in Asia--starts to grow their agricultural economies, guess \nwhat they need. They need agriculture equipment. I am sure the Senator \nfrom Michigan understands that because she has some of those \nmanufacturers. So those manufacturers have a huge opportunity to sell \nU.S.-made agriculture equipment.\n  I like to say: Guess what we are still No. 1 at in the United States \nof America? Agriculture. We know how to do agriculture. Guess what the \nnext big opportunity is around the globe? Feeding the growing middle \nclass around the globe. It is one of the biggest economic \nopportunities. But we have to be able to sell them things. We have to \nbe able to sell them Michigan-manufactured products. We have to be able \nto sell them agriculture products that my colleague from North Dakota \nmakes. SCAFCO needs to be able to sell their grain silos, but they \ncan't because people want to hold up this process, all to put a trophy \non someone's desk saying they did the bidding of a very conservative \nthink tank that--the last I know, I don't think they created any of \nthese manufacturing jobs in America.\n  I hope my colleagues will help us continue this debate because I know \nthere are some who will say: Well, we passed this bill, and it is going \nto get done someday. Someday, really? Because everybody said we will \nget it on the Transportation bill in April. OK. That didn't happen. \nThey did an extension. It didn't happen. We will get it on the \nTransportation bill in July. The Bank won't expire. Guess what. It \nexpired. Now they are telling us to wait again, and we do not want to \nwait on creating more U.S. jobs.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might just wrap up one statement. I \nknow my colleague from New Jersey is here.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who are such great leaders on the \nExport-Import Bank, the Senator from Washington State, Ms. Cantwell, \nand Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota.\n  I just want to put on the record that 100 businesses in Michigan \nalone were assisted in $1 billion in exports, which meant jobs in \nMichigan last year. We can't wait. We need those jobs. Our businesses \nneed the support. We need to get this done now.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, Senator Sessions be recognized, and that following Senator \nSessions, Senator Daines be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Third Anniversary of Superstorm Sandy\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise on the third anniversary of \nSuperstorm Sandy to reflect on where we have been, how far we have \ncome, and what is still left to accomplish, and to praise the people of \nNew Jersey who have remained New Jersey proud and New Jersey strong \nduring this long, 3-year recovery process. But, most importantly, it is \nto remind everyone in this Chamber and all around the Nation that the \njob isn't done yet. Many people believe that this is over and that \neveryone just moved on, but I know that for many Sandy victims, that is \nnot the case.\n  In these last few years, we have made a lot of progress. Billions of \ndollars of Federal funds have flowed to the State and were used to \nrebuild bridges, roads, boardwalks, help businesses reopen, and keep \npeople working. Those fortunate enough to navigate the maze of Federal \nand State programs have rebuilt their homes stronger and more resilient \nthan before. The Jersey Shore has enjoyed a resurgence in tourism which \nfueled the local and State economy, creating jobs and supplementing the \nrecovery.\n  But while the beaches have been replenished and the boardwalks have \nbeen rebuilt, 3 years later, for far too many working-class New \nJerseyans, the recovery not only is incomplete, in some cases it has \nstill barely begun. There are still parts of the State that remain \nneglected. There are still families who haven't stepped foot in their \nhomes for 3 years. They may not have a reality TV crew following them \naround, but they are the real New Jerseyans, the salt of the Earth, and \nthe backbone of our great State. They are the unsung, hard-working New \nJersey families who suffered loss and pulled themselves back up and \nkept going, one foot in front of the other, every day, not only because \nthey wanted to but because they had no other choice.\n  For these families, even after the storm passed, the clouds parted, \nand the Sun came out, a different kind of disaster--this time manmade--\nwas looming on the horizon. They went from filling up sandbags to fend \noff the Atlantic Ocean to filling out endless forms to fend off \ninsurance companies and government officials. They had endured the \nfight against Mother Nature but were simply no match against Uncle Sam.\n  Doug Quinn, a constituent of mine who served as a marine--and once \nyou are a marine, you are always a marine, so I won't say former marine \nbut who served as a marine--and who served his country with \ndistinction, encapsulated this sentiment perfectly in a letter he wrote \nto me. In it he said:\n\n       I was in my home the night the floodwaters rushed in. I \n     waded out through waist deep water at midnight to escape \n     while electrical transformers exploded and houses burned \n     down. That was the easy part. It's the year-and-a-half since \n     then that has been the tragedy.\n\n  Let me repeat that. He says the flood was the easy part. This is a \npicture of him in that flood and the consequences to his home \nafterward.\n  Doug had maximum coverage of $250,000 and received estimates of \ndamages in excess of that--$254,000--but he received only $90,000, just \nover a third of what he needed to rebuild. And Doug was not alone.\n  Chuck Appleby is another one of the thousands of New Jerseyans who \nhas had to engage in this fight for the past 3 years to just get what \nhe deserves. Like many others, Chuck, who joined us recently, was \nlowballed by FEMA and his insurance company, which somehow claimed it \nwasn't Sandy that severely cracked the foundation of his home. \nAccording to them, it was all a preexisting condition that just \nhappened to magically appear the day after Sandy hit. Imagine that. He \nplayed by the rules, he faithfully paid for flood insurance for 10, 20, \nor 30 years, never had a claim until Sandy, came only to find out it \nwasn't enough.\n  People assumed that since they have insurance, they would be made \nwhole and that the resources necessary to rebuild would be there. But \nafter surviving the wind, the rain, and the storm surge, he woke up to \nanother nightmare: A flood insurance claim process that threatened to \ntake what the storm had not.\n  As much as I wish it were an aberration, Chuck's story is not unique. \nThousands of New Jerseyans were lowballed by their insurance company, \nstunting the recovery and leaving families out of their homes.\n  Fortunately, I, along with Senators Booker, Schumer, and Gillibrand, \nwas\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\nable to convince FEMA to allow all Sandy survivors to have their claims \nreviewed, which will result in tens of millions of dollars going to the \nrecovery. Chuck is one of those people who opted into the process, and \nFEMA recently admitted its mistake and acknowledged he was shorted at \nleast $50,000.\n  Dawn and Sonny Markosky are another example. They stood next to me in \nBelmar this week after having received a check for $56,000 from FEMA's \nclaims review money that they should have received the first time \naround. Sonny served our country as a retired Army reservist and a \npolice chief. He is now only receiving the justice he deserved and the \nchance to rebuild. And even Dawn's mom, who was lowballed $17,000 on \nher house, got an additional $17,000 from the claims review--money she \nhad been owed all along. And it goes on and on.\n  It shouldn't have taken this long, nor should the path have been this \nwinding and difficult, but these successes illustrate the incredible \nresiliency of all the Sandy survivors who wouldn't give up no matter \nhow dark things appeared on the morning of October 30, 2012, and \nthroughout the 3 years that followed.\n  I will continue to fight to help everyone recover. I will continue to \nbe a voice for everyone in the Sandy community as we seek to repair \nwhat happened and make our communities more resilient in the future and \nmore capable of dealing with storms like Sandy, which left incredible \ndevastation in its wake.\n  As we take a moment to think back on that day 3 years ago today, when \nthe clouds finally parted and the ominous seas receded, the destruction \nSandy left is almost unimaginable. We remember images like these of \nSeaside Heights. In fact, I actually took this photo while touring the \ndamage with Vice President Biden.\n  This is a photo of Hoboken, in northern New Jersey, where street \nafter street looked like a series of canals. Thousands of families lost \neverything and suddenly found themselves homeless. Billions upon \nbillions of dollars' worth of property, roads, bridges, trains, \nschools, fire stations, and hospitals were in ruins. Most tragically of \nall, dozens of people lost their lives. It was a dark time for our \nentire State, no doubt about it, but, as the proverb goes, the darkest \nhour is just before the dawn.\n  Today, as we remember that dark hour, we commit ourselves to \ncompleting the job and entering the dawn of a new era in the long \njourney to rebuild and recover not just to where we were before the \nstorm but to a place where we are stronger, more resilient, and more \nprepared. I have no doubt we will get there together, not just through \nour efforts here in Washington but because of the indefatigable, dogged \ncharacter of the people of New Jersey. We showed that character in the \nimmediate aftermath when, despite the level of devastation, New \nJerseyans were true to their reputation of being New Jersey strong. \nCommunities united, families took in neighbors who lost their homes, \nand we all came together and worked together. It was a testament to the \nfundamental nature of community action, community involvement, and to \nwhat real community service is all about.\n  After seeing the impact of the damage that day, I came back to \nWashington with a heavy heart but a determined mind, solely focused on \nrepresenting the countless victims of our State who had their lives \nturned upside down. They didn't ask for handouts; they asked for help \nand kept moving forward.\n  I remember working closely with my late colleague and dear friend \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, and we made it our No. 1 priority to bring \nevery available resource back to the victims of our State. I continued \nto work with Senator Booker, who jumped head first into the fight from \nthe moment he entered the Senate to do the same. And to be clear, we \nhad to fight from the very beginning. We had to fight a tea party-\ninspired opposition that was blocking the relief we so desperately \nneeded. We had Senators and Congressmen who said no to disaster victims \nin New Jersey with one side of their mouths, while asking for Federal \nfunds when a disaster struck their State on the other side. Ultimately, \nwe overcame the calloused and ideological attacks and secured more than \n$50 billion for the entire region. These Federal funds have been \nabsolutely critical to our recovery, but mistakes by government \nagencies at the Federal and State level hindered our progress.\n  On this third anniversary of Sandy, I don't come to the floor to \npoint fingers at FEMA or the State or to play a blame game. This is not \nabout politics or scapegoating; it is about continuing to do all we can \nto deliver for the people in every disaster who still need help, and \nthat requires cooperation and teamwork from all levels of government.\n  One example of bipartisanship was our effort to stop the draconian \nflood insurance rate increases that Sandy survivors were facing after \nthe storm. These families were being confronted with skyrocketing \npremiums which threatened to take what the storm had not. In response, \nI led a broad, bipartisan coalition from all parts of the country and \npassed legislation to stop these egregious hikes and restore fairness \nin the flood insurance program.\n  A recovery requires more efforts like this. It requires the State to \nbe transparent and open to correcting any inefficiency that causes \ndelays and for every Federal Government agency to step up, step in, and \nmake corrections when needed. It requires strong oversight and \ntechnical assistance from Federal agencies, such as Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  As we have seen in the past, this cooperation can result in \nsignificant improvement. For example, when I discovered that homeowners \nwere being needlessly delayed from rebuilding because the State chose \nto conduct historical and environmental reviews at the end of the \napplication process--therefore, further delay--I worked with then-\nSecretary Donovan to clarify to the State that they could conduct these \nreviews at the front end of the application process, allowing victims \nto begin rebuilding sooner without jeopardizing their funding. This was \na perfect example of eliminating unnecessary obstacles and \ninefficiencies, and I was proud to be in charge.\n  We always need to find more opportunities like this. We need HUD to \ncontinue to work with the States to discover these inefficiencies and \nto get people fully restored. It is our responsibility to make the \nsystem and the process work for them.\n  When I look at two of these families--a marine serving with \ndistinction for his country and a former Army reservist and police \nchief--their country didn't ultimately respond to them the way it \nshould have. It made life more difficult when, in fact, it should have \nbeen the other way around.\n  We cannot allow partisan and geographical politics into our Nation's \ndisaster response priorities. There is a reason we call our Nation the \nUnited States of America. I have cast my vote time and time again for \nflooding in Mississippi, wildfires out West, Hurricane Katrina--the \nlist goes on and on--because I believe in this we are one. No matter \nwhere a disaster occurs, no matter if it is across the street or across \nthe country, we come together as a nation ready to go.\n  With that, Mr. President, I look forward to our continuing effort to \nget everyone in New Jersey back in their homes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, and no doubt they faced tremendous challenges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Daines be \nrecognized for up to 2 minutes for remarks and that I then be \nrecognized for the 30 minutes I have noticed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Remembering Charles ``Charlie'' DeCrane\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Today I rise to honor Montana World War II veteran \nCharlie DeCrane, a member of the Crow Tribe, who passed away earlier \nthis week in Billings, MT.\n  Charlie was an incredible person. He was hard-working and dedicated \nto serving his country as well as his tribe. He was a quiet and gentle \nspirit, and that was apparent to anyone who came into contact with him. \nCharlie was a man of principle and honor.\n  I had the privilege of spending time with Charlie in Washington, DC, \nwhen\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\nhe accompanied me as my one special guest to the State of the Union \nAddress. I was able to witness firsthand truly what an amazing man he \nwas. Our walk from my office to the House Chamber is one I will never \nforget. To personally know a man who fought so courageously in World \nWar II was a great honor. Many freedoms we have today stem from the \nsacrifices made by Charlie and men and women like him. His \naccomplishments in life will continue to live on.\n  It is my hope that through Charlie's life we will remember how \nimportant our veterans are and how much respect and care they deserve.\n  His passing is one that will affect many, and not just his close \nfamily and friends. Cindy and I will be keeping Charlie's family and \nthe entire Crow community in our thoughts and prayers in this most \ndifficult time.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama for allowing me to speak.\n  I yield back to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the budget passage that will soon be \nbefore us essentially does a number of things. One of the more basic is \nthat it spends a lot more money than the current law allows, and it is \ndone in a way that the new Speaker of the House said ``stinks'' a day \nor so ago.\n  Once again a massive deal is crafted behind closed doors and is being \nrushed through Congress under the threat of panic. The Bipartisan \nBudget Act of 2015 serves as a reminder that the most important and \ncontroversial legislation is still being drafted in secret with little \nor no input from the Members of this Chamber. We have been cut out of \nthe process. No amendments will be allowed to this massive package, and \nthe cloture vote will be filed immediately after the bill is placed on \nthe floor in order to force a vote, limiting the debate to the shortest \npossible time under the rules of the Senate. Those who question, \nobject, and want more time, are accused of wanting to shut down the \ngovernment and disrupt the machinery of the government. They say that \nPresident Obama will accuse us of shutting down the government. They \nsay that we should cower under our debt at this great charge he might \nmake against us. As if insisting that we have a right to read and study \na bill of this magnitude is out of order.\n  It should not be run through the Congress in the shortest possible \ntime. They can bluster and they can huff and puff, but I say the \narguments that I am going to make in opposition to this deal are bricks \nof truth, and this house will not fall down. They will not be able to \nsustain a charge that somehow we have bad motives by objecting to what \nis set about here.\n  At its core, this deal with President Obama provides what the \nPresident has demanded throughout.\n  First, it lifts the Federal spending caps for 2 years, including a \n$40 billion increase in spending on the Federal bureaucracy.\n  A ``yes'' vote affirms that this spending level--the new high \nspending level--is correct and that we need to spend this much money.\n  Second, it erases the current debt limit we have that stops spending \nor borrowing money above a certain amount. It erases that debt limit \nuntil March of 2017, allowing for approximately $1.5 trillion more to \nbe added to our debt of $18.4 trillion, and it could be more than that.\n  The text states that at that date the debt ceiling shall be raised to \nwhatever level of public debt is at that time. Unlike in the past, when \nwe had a debt ceiling, it was a dollar amount, and we would raise it \nand approve a certain dollar amount. Suspending this limit is a very \nunwise process. It was done last time and should not be done in the \nfuture--raise it to a date in the future and indicate, in effect, that \nas much debt as Congress or the President wants to add in that time is \napproved. We don't even know the amount. This is a covert and clever \nway of raising the debt ceiling without having to engage in a real \ndiscussion of Washington's runaway spending problem. It ensures that no \nfurther serious conversation about our debt course or any corresponding \naction to alter it will take place.\n  The debt ceiling has always been a pivotal point. It is the classic \ncase of the parents calling the young man home from college. He has \noverrun his credit card, and they have a little prayer meeting about \nthis spending and demand certain reforms in the young man's spending \nhabits if he wants to continue to have a credit card.\n  Congress has the debt ceiling power to call in the President and say: \nWe are on an unsustainable debt course. We need to have reform.\n  That was done in 2011, and that is why we have these numbers in place \ntoday that contain spending but are being violated by this act.\n  Finally, the deal submits the unacceptable precedent that every \ndollar of increased defense spending should be met with a dollar of \nincreased nondefense spending. How silly is this? What possible logical \nargument can you make for this? This is upside down.\n  If an emergency requires more defense spending--as I think it does--\nwe could dispute the amount, but we have had the Russians in Crimea \nsince 2011, Russians in Syria, refugees by the millions in the Middle \nEast, ISIS threatening the very government of Iraq, Afghanistan is \nstill a problem, Yemen, Libya, and so forth. All of these have happened \nin some part due to the inconsistent, incoherent policies of this \nPresident. It has happened. We have a lot of problems out there. We \nneed some more money for defense.\n  Common sense says we should seek to identify reductions and not \ndemand spending hikes because we have to spend more money on defense. I \nthink this is a deeply troubling problem that we have.\n  Raising these budget caps, as we go forward now, removes the moral \nauthority of Senators who vote yes and approve this process and reduces \nour ability to talk with integrity to our friends and voters back home \nto whom we promised reform and more principled spending decisions in \nWashington.\n  How can we with a straight face say this is a good policy? If we \napprove these higher spending levels, those who vote for it are \nprohibited in many ways from objecting to the levels in the future. If \nthey find some waste and cut it, it does not mean we will reduce \nspending. Instead, the Congress, lacking the moral authority to \ndecrease spending below these levels, will spend that money up to the \nhigher levels in the future. It is a big decision and I think it is \nwrong.\n  Furthermore, I would note, as a member of the Armed Service \nCommittee, my concern about defense, but the defense account takes a \nlarger percentage of the budget than does the nondefense account for \ndiscretionary spending. By increasing defense and nondefense by the \nsame amount, the nondefense category actually receives a larger \npercentage of the increase, all to pay for more bureaucracy, employees, \nand government in Washington.\n  So let's be clear. The spending caps in law today were placed in as a \npart of the 2011 Budget Control Act agreement which lifted the debt \nceiling by $2.1 trillion. We objected. Congress objected to raising the \ndebt ceiling without reform. Senator McConnell stood firm, and the \nBudget Control Act of 2011 is the reform that came. Then we raised the \ndebt ceiling. We approved a raising of the debt limit on the credit \ncard only after we got a containment of the growth in spending. So \nsupporters are calling this bill sequester relief as if that is OK, but \nsequester and the Budget Control Act were just simply limits on \nspending. That is what they were.\n  The fact is, we have never followed the sequester. In 2013 the \nCongress passed the Ryan-Murray budget deal. That deal raised the \ndiscretionary spending $64 billion over 2 years. Now that deal has \nended, and instead of returning to regular order and agreed-upon \nlimits, the President wants us to yet again break the Budget Control \nAct and raise spending an extra $80 billion over the next 2 years.\n  This deal will obliterate future spending restraint, it does do so, \ndestroying our credibility to achieve meaningful spending reform. The \nBudget Control Act represented a bipartisan commitment to cap spending, \nlimiting it at a fixed amount. It is a good, responsible policy. In \nfact, I thought it did not limit the spending enough. It was passed by \na Republican House, a Democratic Senate, and signed into law by \nPresident Obama. He agreed to these limits.\n  This deal shatters that commitment by spending $80 billion more than \nwe\n\n[[Page S7617]]\n\npromised over the next 2 years. It is problematic because it is filled \nwith gimmicks. They contend, not correctly, that all of this new \nspending is offset by new revenues or cuts in spending somewhere else. \nHowever, I would suggest and would show here that is not accurate. \nThese are a lot of gimmicks we have here.\n  Secondly, if we have wasteful spending, and some of this is wasteful \nspending, it needs to be eliminated. But the spending cuts ought to be \nused to reduce the deficit, which was over $400 billion last year, will \nbe $400 billion next year, and will double in the next 10 years \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. We need to be using this \nwasteful spending--these low-hanging-fruit problems--to reduce \ngovernment expenditures and reduce our deficits, not using that \nopportunity to reduce deficits to instead spend more money somewhere \nelse.\n  So they offset. It appears the deal is built on the same principles \nas the deal in 2013. It exchanges instant increases in Federal spending \nfor distant promised savings in the future, as much as 20 years, or two \ndecades down the road, many of which are unlikely to occur. It funds \nincreased spending through increased revenues, violating a core budget \nprinciple by extracting evermore money from Americans to expand an \nalready-too-large Federal bureaucracy.\n  We need to be reducing the bureaucracy, not adding to it.\n  The deal trades ending spending limits for the promise of new \nspending limits 10 years from now. We just agreed to limits in 2011. \nThey promised that we are going to have new spending limits in the \nfuture. My time in the Senate says promises about the future seldom \ncome to pass in this body.\n  We need to fight tenaciously to hold the spending limits that are in \nlaw today and not exchange those limits for a promised limit in the \nfuture. This is how a country goes broke. We are heading to financial \ncatastrophe on the path we are going.\n  The deal also uses a common gimmick where alleged savings in an \nentitlement program--a trust fund--are used to boost unrelated spending \nin the general discretionary budget. This is a bigger issue than most \nof our colleagues understand. Any savings found in the entitlement \nprograms faced with insolvency must be used to shore up those programs, \nthose trust funds, not for spending somewhere else. Yet this deal \nclaims illusory savings from disability insurance, part of Social \nSecurity. That is the disability trust fund. There are two trust funds \nof Social Security, disability and a retirement fund. Every American \npays into both from their paycheck. So 2.2 percent of your paycheck \ngoes to fund the disability fund, the rest of it funds your Social \nSecurity, and then there is additional money that comes out of your \npaycheck to fund the Medicare trust fund.\n  So this deal claims illusory savings from the disability insurance \nand increased pension insurance fees in order to boost bureaucratic \nbudgets. Perhaps even worse, the deal attempts to stave off the \nshortfall in the fraud-ridden Social Security Disability Insurance \nProgram that has a host of problems. We all know and have known for \nyears it is coming into default by the end of 2016. How does it get \naround the default in the disability program? It raids the Social \nSecurity retirement fund to pay for the deficient, ineffective, badly \nmanaged disability fund.\n  It weakens Social Security. We need to be looking at ways to \nstrengthen Social Security, not raid it and weaken it. Some $150 \nbillion in funds will be siphoned off from Americans' payroll \nretirement contributions and taken out of the Social Security fund and \ntransferred to the disability program--four-tenths of a percent each \nyear of the income of an American.\n  This will weaken the Social Security trust fund by $150 billion while \npoliticians all over America continue to promise that what they are \ndoing is acting to strengthen the Social Security trust fund. We have \nseen the disability trust fund heading for disaster for several years \nnow. Now, ``60 Minutes'' and program after program have shown abuse, \nfraud, and total mismanagement in Social Security Disability. It has \nnot been reformed. It needs fundamental reform. They made a few changes \nin the program that I am sure are worthwhile, but none that come close \nto putting the disability fund on a long-term sound basis. It is \nbasically a gimmick to get past the impending insolvency crisis, to \nkick it down the road, and then create some money to justify the new \nspending above the spending limits imposed by the Budget Control Act.\n  People want to end wasteful Washington spending. The people want \nthat. Lifting the budget caps and raising the debt ceiling through 2017 \nonly ensures that our ineffective bureaucracy continues its wasteful \nways, while momentum in Washington for deficit reduction stalls out. \nThat is what is happening. We are losing momentum. Several years ago we \nwere in serious discussions about the dangers we faced financially. \nThat conversation has been eroded. It eliminates a powerful \nopportunity, the debt ceiling, to advance the case for fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  What about Social Security? The deal uses the same fraudulent \naccounting methods our Democratic colleagues used to pass ObamaCare on \na straight party-line vote. We just received a letter from the Social \nSecurity Actuary, Mr. Goss, who stated that the ``enactment of these \nprovisions [in this proposed legislation] is projected to reduce the \nlong-range 75-year OASDI [the combined Social Security trust funds] \nactuarial deficit by 0.04 percent of taxable payroll,'' which is a lot. \nHowever, the savings going in are being counted as both, creating money \nthat can be spent to increase new spending, and also creating money \nthat can be spent to shore up the retirement insurance program. This is \nan important concept, colleagues. The funds are used to pay for more \ngovernment spending outside the retirement and disability funds.\n  Even worse than the promise of saving Social Security, which has been \noverstated as major entitlement reform, the savings are being counted \nas money that can be spent on the discretionary account. It basically \nprovides cover to extend the debt of the United States.\n  This is the very same tool the Democrats used to pass the ObamaCare \nbill, amazingly, and to produce a phony score so the President could \nsay that every penny of it is paid for--saying it would not increase \nthe deficit. Our colleagues used the same tactic in this deal by \ncounting the funds they cut from your retirement account as being able \nto fund new discretionary spending.\n  During the Obamacare debate, the Democrats reduced payments to \nhospitals and doctors and others, but Medicare is a trust fund. They \nclaimed some $500 billion would be used both to extend the life of \nMedicare and to pay for the new ObamaCare spending. They openly and \ndirectly claimed that these savings could be used for two different \nthings--$500 billion. It was one of the largest, I contend, \nmisrepresentations of finances--fraudulent activities--in the history \nof the world.\n  You cannot have money that is used for two different purposes. Mr. \nElmendorf, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, has said: \nYou cannot spend the same dollar twice, even though the conventions of \naccounting might suggest otherwise. So they used an accounting gimmick \nto make it appear that this money was available to strengthen Medicare \nand fund ObamaCare. It is the same money.\n  We accepted that kind of improper financial analysis. The bill was \npassed on the promise it would not add to the debt. It certainly did. \nThe same accounting gimmick lies at the heart of the proposed \nlegislation to waive Federal spending caps and to raise the debt limit \nby at least $1.5 trillion.\n  Promoters of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 boast of long-term \nfuture savings to Social Security disability, but those savings need to \nextend the life of the disability program, which is nearing insolvency. \nInstead, they are spent on new discretionary spending, basically adding \nto the debt. This is not entitlement reform, this is an accounting \ngimmick. Any savings to be captured in the future from disability \ninsurance cannot be spent today on bureaucratic budgets for Federal \ndepartments such as the EPA, the Department of Labor, or the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  A second and no less egregious accounting trick siphons off as much \nas $150 billion from the Social Security trust fund for retirees and \ntransfers\n\n[[Page S7618]]\n\nthat money to the fraud-ridden disability program. But there is no \nsurplus in the retirement trust fund. We know the Social Security \nretirement trust fund is heading toward insolvency. Taking this money \nout and moving it to the disability program shortens the lifespan, the \nsolvency of the retirement program. All this reform accomplishes is \nadvancing the insolvency date of the retirement fund, while bailing out \nthe mismanaged disability fund by taking working Americans' pension \ncontributions and reallocating them to the disability fund. Again, the \nauthors of the bill double count the savings as both increasing the \nsustainability of Social Security disability and paying for the new \nspending.\n  So instead of implementing much needed reforms to fix the disability \nprogram, which is projected to go broke next year, this deal robs $150 \nbillion from the Social Security trust fund and uses it to pay \ndisability checks through 2022. The Social Security trust fund is never \nreimbursed. They reduce the amount of dedicated money going to the \nSocial Security retirement fund on everybody's paycheck and redirect it \nfor 3 years to the disability fund, and the Social Security retirement \nfund is never reimbursed for the money they lost. So Social Security is \nleft in a worse financial situation than it is currently. It is also a \nviolation of the budget law to do that; I am confident.\n  Furthermore, this bailout lasts only 6 years. In 2022, the disability \nfund runs out of money again, and Congress will have to bail it out \nonce again. This bill removes the incentive to provide serious reform \nto fix that broken program and put it on a sound basis. It kicks the \ncan down the road once again.\n  In conclusion, I would say to my colleagues that we don't have to \npass this bill today. There is no crisis that requires us to pass it \ntoday. There are a number of interim steps we could take to allow this \nbill to be out there for the Members who actually study it, to offer \namendments on it, and maybe improve it for the American people to \nunderstand just what it is the Members of Congress are doing to their \nSocial Security and to the fiscal debt of America.\n  As I have mentioned, the Budget Control Act of 2011 increased the \namount that we can borrow in exchange for $2.1 trillion in spending \ncuts that we were able to win in 2011. What we did when we faced the \ndebt ceiling issue was that we were able to enforce our new spending \nlaw, which limited the growth of spending in the future, saving $2.1 \ntrillion over that period of time. We are still in that time period, \nand we are ceasing to save money because we are violating the law.\n  We were able to win a concession from the President. We didn't cower \nunder our tables. We didn't retreat from the huffing and puffing of the \nPresident on this issue. We stood up as Members of Congress, committed \nto fiscal integrity in America, and we told the President: You are not \ngoing to get an increase in the debt ceiling unless you agree to some \nspending reforms. That is what happened. We did that when there were \nonly 45 Republicans in the Chamber. Now there are 54 Republicans in the \nChamber, and the House has a huge majority.\n  I think we can do better. I don't think this should be rushed through \nthe Congress, and I object to its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes and that Senator Sanders be recognized \nimmediately following my remarks for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator. If you could extend that up to 20 \nminutes, that would be great.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I amend that to 20 minutes for Senator \nSanders, if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, having previously served in the Senate, I \ncame to the floor once again for the second time as a freshman Senator, \nin the early months of 2011, full of optimism and a sense of purpose.\n  Back for a second time as a newly elected freshman, I delivered my \ninaugural speech, which included the following thoughts:\n\n       For each of us serving today, I believe it is our duty to \n     rise to the immediate challenge and resolve the problems \n     which now confront us. It will take all of us, united behind \n     a common purpose--that above all else we must first restore \n     and strengthen our fiscal security. We must articulate a \n     clear vision, set specific goals and make the tough decisions \n     needed to bring our nation out of debt and preserve \n     prosperity and opportunity for future generations.\n\n  Those remarks outline a major part of my vision for what I hope to \nachieve in my term as a Senator. It is now 5 years later. What I came \nback to try to accomplish hasn't been accomplished.\n  At the time, I saw--and it was the reason why I answered the call to \ncome back--that our fiscal health was eroding right before our very \neyes. I didn't want to be a part of the first generation of Americans \nto leave our children and the country worse off than the one we \ninherited.\n  Anyone who reads through our history knows the sacrifices that have \nbeen made by generation after generation after generation so that their \nchildren and their grandchildren and their country could be in a better \nposition so that they wouldn't be saddled with the burdens that might \nnot allow them to live the American dream.\n  I asked Hoosiers to send me back to Washington to focus on taking on \nthese essential issues. It was the first thing in my very first debate, \nwhere I put it on the table and said: Unless we go back and address our \nrunaway mandatory spending and entitlement programs, it is not worth \ngoing back, and I will not ask you to send me back there unless you \ngive me the mandate that this is a task that has to be undertaken.\n  It was called political suicide at the time: Oh, you can't bring that \nup. I mean those who are on Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security \nwill make sure that you will never be sent back to the Senate if that \nis what your goal is.\n  I said: I just want every Hoosier to know, when you walk in that \nvoting booth, what you are voting for and what you are not voting for.\n  And I received the mandate to come back to address that because \npeople in my generation understood that as to the privileges they had \nreceived and the opportunities they had received throughout their \nlives, they wanted to pass them and that same opportunity on to their \nchildren and their grandchildren. They wanted us to come back and make \ndifficult decisions so that would happen.\n  It is not that this issue wasn't worked on. Whether it was to fix the \ndebt or the Business Roundtable, Domenici-Rivlin, Simpson-Bowles, the \nGang of 6, the super committee resulting from the Budget Control Act, \nand the dinner club of Senators--all of these efforts over the early \nyears I threw myself into and in support of. And many of us--even on a \nbipartisan basis--were working together to try to address this gorilla \nin the room, the runaway mandatory spending. It is now eating up over \n70 percent of our total budget and ever-decreasing discretionary \nspending.\n  The President, unfortunately, walked away from every effort that was \nmade. The efforts were divided, and nearly 40 of us--20 Democrats and \n20 Republicans--sent the President a letter stating: We need to address \nthat, and we are willing to step up and address this if you will join \nus in this process.\n  I was very much a part of the final effort with the President--the \nso-called dinner club--at the President's initiative. We were working \nwith the President himself, his Chief of Staff, his top Director of \nOMB--now Secretary Burwell at HHS--and his political director. Over the \nmonths, eight of us met privately--there was no press, no staff--\nworking to see, as principals, if we could come up with something. In \nthe end, it fell apart. It fell apart because the President, in the \nend, wouldn't even accept his own previous proposals--his own White \nHouse proposals to address this problem.\n  Here we are 5 years later. Currently, what we have gone from, under \nthis administration, is a $10.6 trillion debt at the beginning of this \nPresidency to now 18-plus, or almost $18.2 trillion. There was almost a \ndoubling in just two terms of one President, almost a doubling of our \ndebt.\n  And here we stand with injunctions from the Congressional Budget \nOffice\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\nsaying that we are headed toward a crisis and it is holding down our \neconomy. We are not growing as we should and putting people back to \nwork as we should because this is a drag on us. It is an anchor holding \nus down.\n  Every Member of this Senate understands that the issue here is not \nthis particular program or that particular program. The issue is \nrunaway mandatory entitlements that are eating up everything--virtually \nthree-quarters of everything they spend money on.\n  There are essential functions of the Federal Government that have to \nbe addressed: the National Institutes of Health and, obviously, our \ndefense and national security. There is the CDC, which deals with \ncommunicable diseases, education funding, veterans programs, law \nenforcement, border security, and food safety, just to name a few. \nThose are essential functions. But the money available to do what \ngovernment needs to do is ever shrinking in terms of our ability to \nallocate it for that to be done, and the mandatory spending is just \nsimply running out of control.\n  Is anyone in this Senate or in this Congress saying we should end \nSocial Security, end Medicare, and end Medicaid? Everyone here is \nsaying no. Everyone has to understand, however, that to preserve those \nprograms we have to bring on sensible reforms, and that has been the \nchallenge.\n  CBO said earlier this year: ``Large and growing federal debt would \nhave serious negative consequences, including increasing federal \nspending for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the long \nterm; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected \nchallenges; and eventually heightening the risk of a fiscal crisis.\n  The evidence that we read and talk about in the Senate every day \ncomes to the same conclusion. Congress too often has governed to avoid \na crisis and failed to make the tough but necessary choices.\n  Now here we are in another crisis looming, another leverage for us to \ntry to achieve some sensible forward movement in terms of dealing with \nthis runaway mandatory spending, and this is the raising of the debt \nlimit. Given all the failure of previous efforts, the exhaustion of the \nprivate sector and congressional efforts, we are left with very few \noptions to address our fiscal problems. Now we have a debt limit that \nis hitting us just days from now, November 3, and we won't be able to \npay our bills unless we raise that debt limit.\n  So what have we done, using this potential leverage, to try to \nachieve something of significance? We end up basically waving the white \nflag and saying: There is really nothing more we can do. We just have \nto simply raise this. We have to live with it. We have to continue \nspending more. Oh, and by the way, those caps that we put in terms of \ndiscretionary spending, we have to break those also.\n  There is a legitimate argument for the need to provide additional \nfunding for our Department of Defense and our national security. All \nyou have to do is turn on the television and watch what is happening \naround the world to understand that America is in a weakened position \nand that national strength and defense strength are important for the \nfuture of our country. So I do think that was a legitimate issue to try \nto deal with. But to break the caps on an equal basis for more \ngovernment spending on the discretionary side simply is something we \nshouldn't have to do.\n\n  These so-called pay-fors that were put out there are the same old, \nsame old. It is spend now and maybe we will adjust the program later \nand that will help cover the cost now. That hasn't worked before, and \nit won't work now. It is a gimmick, in most instances. It is something \nto sell the program, but it doesn't begin to address the problem of \nout-of-control debt.\n  Along with that, Social Security disability, the trustees have said, \nis going to go broke in just a few months, and the benefits are going \nto have to be dramatically cut unless it is fixed. So do we come in \nwith a real fix for the real future of the Social Security-related \nprograms? No, we transfer money from the old age fund--actually, there \nis no money in that fund, we simply allocate the money that is owed to \nthat fund to pay for solvency for the disability part of that fund.\n  First of all, the thing we need to do is to be honest with the \nAmerican people is to rename the Social Security trust fund to \nsomething else because the trust tells us there is money there to pay \nthese benefits when there isn't. There are IOUs there, locked in a box \nor a safe somewhere. There are simply piled up pieces of paper saying: \nWe have to pay you back at some point. Without addressing this--and we \nsaw this last evening in the debate, those of us who watched. I was \ngoing back and forth, to be truthful, between the World Series and the \ndebate, trying to catch both of those. But we saw a few Members stand \nup and tell the truth--tell the American people exactly what the \nsituation is and why we need to do what we need to do. I commend those \nfew who had the courage to go forward and tell the American people \nstraight up that this is the problem and it must be solved.\n  Anyway, speaking of this vote that is coming up--the vote that will \nallow more spending for Federal programs, many of which are not \npriority programs--the arrangement will simply allow us to take a pass \non raising the debt limit. We are not going to use it as leverage to \ntry and achieve anything meaningful in terms of entitlement--frankly, \noffsets that we have used before and we use over and over again. It is \nthe same old shuffle game where we move pieces around, but it doesn't \naccomplish the purpose. All of that leads me to the conclusion that I \ncannot support this particular arrangement.\n  There are reforms that must be put in place. We have to get to the \npoint where we stop talking about these reforms and put them in place, \nwhere we make the political decisions that I believe will be supported \nback home. But even if they aren't supported by everyone back home, \neven if they are distorted by organizations that are funded by trying \nto scare seniors into believing Congress or the government is taking \naway their benefits--which is not the case; we are trying to save those \nbenefits and we are trying to put our future generations, our children \nand grandchildren, in a better position so they won't be so saddled \nwith that debt--there are many ways we can go forward.\n  We have talked about balancing our budget. What entity in the world \ndoesn't have to balance a budget at some point? What entity can keep \nborrowing money, saying on a piece of paper they will pay it later--\nthat they are going to spend it now and pay it later? What businessman \nor woman, what small, medium-sized, or large business, what family, \nwhat organization continues to deal with their fiscal issues the way \nthe Federal Government deals with its fiscal issues and survives? We \nare careening toward a crisis. There are solutions for this, but it \ntakes political will, and we have seen far too little of that political \nwill.\n  More importantly, it takes support from both branches of government, \nboth the legislative and the executive, if we are going to accomplish \nthis. Unfortunately, it appears now we are going to have to wait for \nyet another Presidency, yet another Congress, because we are kicking \nthe can down the road. We are dumping this problem on the next group \ncoming in. Boy, I feel for whoever winds up with the Presidency, \nwhether it is Democrat or Republican, because of what they will \ninherit, given the damage that has been done over the past several \nyears.\n  Clearly, we need to address the gorilla in the room. Clearly, we need \nto stand up and be truthful with the American people, as some of our \ncandidates were last evening. We must tell them exactly where we are, \nwhat we need to do, and then put the long-term reforms in place that \nwill save these programs and put America in a solid fiscal situation.\n  Getting a balanced budget amendment in place is something we have \ntalked about. We have made an effort, and we need to continue that. \nWithout the discipline of putting your hand on the Bible with your \nright hand up and swearing you will uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States, which includes balancing our budget and not spending \nmore than we take in, we will never get there. You have to put people \nunder oath in order to achieve that. We have come close on a couple of \noccasions but, unfortunately, not close enough.\n  Therefore, I am resorting to a program that has worked in the past \nregarding our national defense and our military and proposing that what \nwe\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\ndo is create another BRAC. BRAC was the Base Realignment Commission--a \nprocess we finally agreed to because there was no way we could touch or \nclose anything, and we were just overrun with excess spending and \nexcess bases in the United States. And that worked. It worked very \nwell. All of us here know exactly or very closely what the parameters \nof that were.\n  In this case, if we cannot summon the courage and the will to stand \nup and do this, as we are required to do under the oath of office we \ntake, but which we avoid doing, we should turn to a commission that \nwould provide a solution. It would be a budget reduction accountability \ncommission. We can use the same BRAC title on the thing. Let's call it \nthe budget reduction accountability commission, which would bring \nforward a plan to achieve the goal of bringing us back to fiscal \nhealth. We would put it before this Congress, both the Senate and the \nHouse, with a straight up-or-down majority vote--yea or nay.\n  Here is the plan. You haven't been able to do it yourself, you have \ntried it, we appreciate your trying it, but it has come up short, \nwhether it is the executive branch or the legislative branch. So the \noutside commission presents the path forward, and we say yes or no. \nThen the people back home all know exactly where we stand in terms of \nthe future fiscal health of this country. They will know exactly where \nwe stand in terms of how we want to leave our legacy to the next \ngeneration and future generations, how we want to treat our children \nand our grandchildren.\n  Each Member will have to go home and not talk about procedures and \nnot talk about bumping up to the crisis level of spending and how we \nhave to do something to avoid a government shutdown or avoid chaos or \navoid economic collapse. Every Member will go home and say they were \npresented with a plan to get us there, and they were either for it or \nagainst it. Nobody could say: Well, we had to do this, we had to do \nthat, it was late, we bumped up against the ceiling, it was running \nout, and so forth. I am tired of hearing all of that.\n  Mr. President, clearly solutions exist to deal with this problem. \nClearly, we must summon the courage to set aside politics and do what \nwe all know we need to do and suffer the consequences. I think the \nconsequences will be applause and support because finally someone is \nstanding up and saying we are going to fix this problem for the future \nof America and the future of our children and grandchildren; we are \ngoing to take that risk. If the groups outside are going to rally \nagainst this kind of thing and try to take us down, fine; we will go \ndown doing the right thing. But I think we will be rewarded for doing \nso.\n  I want to close this today with the same words I used to conclude my \ninaugural speech in 2011, where I said:\n\n       I am standing here today to find solutions--to make the \n     hard decisions--and to leave behind a country that is \n     stronger and more fiscally secure for future generations. \n     This crisis is not insurmountable. We can overcome it by \n     doing what great generations before us have done--mustering \n     our will to do what is right. If we do, I know America's \n     greatest days are not behind us, but still lie ahead of us.\n\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Marijuana Legalization\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes discussing \na major crisis in this country that must be addressed. Tragically, in \nthe United States of America we now have 2.2 million people in jail. We \nhave more people incarcerated than any other country on Earth, \nincluding China, which is a Communist authoritarian country four times \nour size. We have more people in jail than does China.\n  Further, at a time of large deficits and a very large national debt, \nwe are spending about $80 billion a year in Federal, State, and local \ntaxpayer money to lock up people--$80 billion a year to incarcerate \npeople.\n  Our criminal justice system is broken, and we need major reforms in \nthat system. I think there is no debate in this country that violent \nand dangerous people must be locked up and they must be kept in jail \nand away from society. I think nobody argues that. On the other hand, I \nhope there is also no debate that nonviolent people--people who have \nbeen convicted of relatively minor crimes--should not have their lives \ndestroyed while they do time in prison and create an arrest record \nwhich will stay with them for their entire lives. The important point \nis, it is not just the year or 2 years somebody is in prison; this \nrecord will stay with them for their entire lives and do enormous \ndamage to their lives.\n  In 2014 there were 620,000 marijuana possession arrests. That is one \narrest every minute. According to a report by the ACLU, there were more \nthan 8 million marijuana arrests in the United States from 2001 to \n2010--8 million marijuana arrests--and almost 9 in 10 were for \npossession. Arrests for marijuana possession rose last year nationwide \neven as Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the District of \nColumbia became the first States in the Nation to legalize personal use \nof marijuana.\n  Let's be clear that there is a racial component to this situation. \nAlthough about the same proportion of Blacks and Whites use marijuana, \na Black person is almost four times more likely to be arrested for \nmarijuana possession than a White person. In other words, as we try to \nunderstand why our prison population today is disproportionately Black \nand Latino, one reason is because in overpoliced Black neighborhoods, \nAfrican Americans are much more likely to be arrested for smoking or \nusing marijuana than will Whites. Here is the simple truth: An upper \nmiddle class White kid in Scarsdale, NY, has a much lower chance of \nbeing arrested for using marijuana than a low-income Black kid in \nChicago or Baltimore. Those are just the facts.\n  Too many Americans in this country have seen their lives destroyed \nbecause they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use. That \nis wrong. That has to change. Let's be clear. A criminal record could \nmean not only jail time, but much more. If a person has a criminal \nrecord, it will be much harder for that person later in life to get a \njob. It is not so easy to come out of jail and get a job, and if you \ndon't get a job, there is a strong likelihood you will go back into \nyour same old environment and end up in jail again. If somebody has a \ncriminal record, it may be impossible for them to obtain certain types \nof public benefits and in fact make it difficult for them to even live \nin public housing. A criminal record stays with a person for his or her \nentire life until the day he or she dies. A criminal record destroys \nlives.\n  Right now, under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed \nas a Schedule I drug, meaning it is considered to be a drug that is \nextremely dangerous. In fact, under the act, marijuana is considered to \nbe as dangerous as heroin. I know there are conflicting opinions about \nthe health impacts marijuana may have, but nobody I know seriously \nbelieves marijuana is as dangerous as heroin. This is absurd. Nobody \nbelieves that.\n  In my view, the time is long overdue for us to take marijuana off of \nthe Federal Government's list of outlawed drugs. In my view, at a time \nwhen Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia \nhave already legalized the personal use of marijuana, every State in \nthis country should have the right to regulate marijuana the same way \nthat State and local laws now govern sales of alcohol and tobacco. \nAmong other things, that means recognized businesses in States that \nhave legalized marijuana should be fully able to use the banking system \nwithout fear of Federal prosecution.\n  In response to the initiatives that Colorado and other States have \ntaken, the Obama administration has essentially allowed these States to \ngo forward and do what the people in those States have chosen to do. \nThat is a good step forward, but it is not good enough because a new \nadministration with a different point of view could simply go forward \nand prosecute those marijuana businesses and individuals in those \nStates who use marijuana despite what the people in those States have \ndecided to do legislatively.\n  What I am saying is not that the Federal Government should legalize\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\nmarijuana throughout the country. This is a decision for the States. I \nhope many of my colleagues, especially those who express support for \nStates' rights and our Federalist system of government, those who often \ndecry the power of the big bad Federal Government in undermining local \ninitiatives, would support my very simple and straightforward \nlegislation that will be introduced next week.\n  All my legislation says is that if a State chooses to legalize \nmarijuana, that State should be able to go forward without legal \nimpediments from the Federal Government.\n\n\n                           Capital Punishment\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about an issue of great importance in \nthis country. I believe the time is now for the United States to end \ncapital punishment. I know this is not necessarily a popular point of \nview, but in my view it is the right point of view. Virtually every \nWestern industrialized country has chosen to end capital punishment. I \nwould rather have our country stand side-by-side with European \ndemocracies than with countries like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \nothers that maintain the death penalty.\n  We are all shocked and disgusted by the horrific murders we see in \nthis country, including massacres in schools and on college campuses \nthat seem to take place every week. All of us are tired and disgusted \nwith what we are seeing, but it seems to me that at a time of rampant \nviolence and murder all over the world, where people are being blown up \nand their heads are being cut off, it is important that the state \nitself, the Federal Government in America, say loudly and clearly that \nwe will not be part of that process.\n  When people commit horrendous crimes--and we see too many of them--we \nshould lock them up and throw away the key. I have no problem in saying \nthat people who commit terrible murders should spend the rest of their \nlives in jail, but the state itself, in a democratic civilized society, \nshould itself not be involved in the murder of other Americans.\n  I know there are strong differences of opinion on this issue. In \nfact, I think I am in a minority position, but I think those of us who \nwant to set an example, who want to say that we have to end the murders \nand the violence we are seeing in our country and all over the world, \nshould in fact be on the side of those of us who believe we must end \ncapital punishment in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7621-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7621-S7622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HOMELESS VETERANS SERVICES PROTECTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk \nabout an issue that is very important to me, and that is the care of \nour Nation's veterans. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I \nrealize what it means for a family member to be willing to sacrifice \ntheir life for their country. We promise our men and women in uniform \nthat the country will be there for them after they leave service, and \nsometimes that means long after the war is over. But I am concerned our \ncountry is about to turn its back on thousands of veterans, and I am \nhere today to say we have to fix it.\n  Last year, the VA told homeless service providers they needed to cut \noff services to certain veterans who had other than honorable \ndischarges or had not served a certain length of time. If that policy \nhad been enacted, it would have been a major setback for veterans \nacross the country. It would have set us back on our goal of ending \nveteran homelessness, a goal that the administration has set for itself \nand hundreds of mayors across the country have committed to. It would \nhave been simply unacceptable. These are veterans who need our support. \nMany of them struggle with mental illness and substance abuse or simply \nfinding employment.\n  According to some of our leading veterans and homeless groups--\nincluding the American Legion, the National Alliance to End \nHomelessness, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and the \nNational Coalition for Homeless Veterans--if the policy had been \nenacted, the VA would have had to stop serving about 15 percent of the \nhomeless veteran population. In some urban areas, up to 30 percent of \nhomeless veterans would be turned away.\n  Thankfully, after hearing concern from around the country, including \nfrom my home State of Washington, the VA was able to put off that \nterrible policy change. But, unfortunately, the VA is now expected to \nannounce their final decision any day that the reprieve is over, and \nthey are going to have to go ahead with this change and force homeless \nproviders to turn away veterans who have nowhere else to go--veterans \nwhose providers have been serving them for decades. That is wrong. This \npolicy change would be heartless. It is a bureaucratic move that would \nput thousands of veterans on the streets practically overnight, and it \nhas to be stopped.\n  The VA is going to enact this policy when the final decision is made. \nSo Congress needs to act now to stop this from happening. Earlier this \nyear, I introduced the Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act. That \nis a bill that would ensure our most vulnerable veterans would be \nassured continued access to critical homeless service programs, \nregardless of their discharge status or length of service. In other \nwords, it fixes the problem the VA says it has and makes sure they do \nnot have to cut off homeless veterans from care.\n  My bill will make it clear that our country takes care of those who \nserved and that we do not allow bureaucracy to dictate who gets a roof \nover their head and who does not. But it is critical that we act now. \nThe VA has said it would issue this legal position in November, which \ncould put thousands of veterans on the street. We are running out of \ntime. But the solution to this crisis is now before us, and we can do \nit by passing the Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act.\n  I don't believe there is any Member of this body who would deny our \nobligation to ensure that veterans are taken care of and have a roof \nover their head. While our country has made great strides in recent \nyears providing homeless services to the men and women who so bravely \nserved our country, I believe that even one veteran sleeping on our \nstreets in the United States is one too many. We know we have a lot of \nwork ahead of us.\n  Veterans are at a greater risk of becoming homeless than nonveterans. \nOn any given night, as many as 50,000 veterans are homeless here in \nthis country. With an influx of veterans now returning from the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, the numbers of veterans seeking care will \ncontinue to go up.\n  In short, this problem is not going away. Our veterans have made \ngreat sacrifices serving our country. We cannot turn our backs on them \nwhen they come home. That commitment includes providing benefits, \nmedical care, support, and assistance to prevent homelessness. It is a \ncommitment that shouldn't stop simply because we have run into a policy \nroadblock.\n  I am very pleased to call this up now with the Heller amendment which \nis the text of S. 1105. It is a bill that I strongly support. The \nprovision will increase the availability of care for homeless veterans \nwith children by reimbursing facilities funded by the VA Grant and Per \nDiem Program.\n  I want to thank Senator Heller for his leadership on this issue. I \nwant to thank Senator Isakson and Senator Blumenthal for their \nleadership, as the heads of the Veterans Affairs' Committee, and for \ntheir support in being here today.\n  I am hoping Democrats and Republicans join us today to right this \nwrong and prevent this problem from happening. It shouldn't be a \npartisan issue. It is not a political issue. This is a veterans issue. \nIt is one that should bring us all together.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs be discharged from further consideration of S. 1731 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1731) to amend title 38, United States Code, to \n     waive the minimum period of continuous active duty in the \n     Armed Forces for receipt of certain benefits for homeless \n     veterans, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \n     furnish such benefits to homeless veterans with discharges or \n     releases from service in the Armed Forces with other than \n     dishonorable conditions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Heller \namendment be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2760) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize per diem payments under comprehensive service \n    programs for homeless veterans to furnish care to dependents of \n                           homeless veterans)\n\n       On page 4, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Heller, Senator \nIsakson, and the other Members who worked so hard for this. I would \nlike to yield some time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Murray for her \nefforts here today and for her willingness to work with me on including \na provision that we worked on together for several years now as members \nof the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Senator Murray's \nlegislation ensures that homeless veterans continue to be eligible for \nthe VA's Grant and Per Diem Program.\n  With my provision that Senator Murray agreed to include, this \nlegislation will also extend this eligibility to the dependents of \nhomeless veterans. Given the work that I have done with Senator Murray \non eligibility for homeless veterans' dependents, I believe it was \nimportant we addressed both the needs of the veteran as well as their \ndependents.\n  In cities such as Las Vegas, where veteran homelessness remains a \nserious problem, the support of housing and service centers that \nreceive VA funding is absolutely critical in getting these veterans \nback on their feet. Not only do the programs provide housing but they \nalso offer services, such as case management, education, crisis \nintervention, and other services to special populations and important \npopulations such as homeless women veterans.\n  This Congress has a responsibility to ensure that existing veterans \nunder this program remain eligible, but also that dependents of \nveterans, especially their children, are taken care of when their \nveteran parents have fallen on hard times.\n  That is why I introduced the CARE for Veterans' Dependents Act with \nSenator Murray, to make dependents eligible for care at VA-funded \nfacilities. These children and their parents deserve the certainty that \nthey will able to access supportive housing during their serious time \nof need. I am proud that we were able to move forward on this measure, \nwhich was just accepted a few moments ago by unanimous consent.\n  Senator Murray and I have a proud history of working together to \nadvocate on behalf of our Nation's veterans, and today's passage of \nthis legislation is another testament to our strong partnership on \nbehalf of veterans. I am also grateful to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Isakson, and to Ranking Member Blumenthal of the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for working so diligently with \nus to make this happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield back.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 222\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the proud parent of a wonderful daughter \nand the proud grandparent of three wonderful granddaughters, like so \nmany others, I was proud of the U.S. Women's National Team and their \nhistoric World Cup victory. I was even more proud on Tuesday when I saw\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\nthem at the White House with President Obama.\n  I know all Americans are so proud, as well as honored. The reason why \nso many Americans are proud of it is that earlier this year, with more \nthan 25 million Americans watching, this electrifying group of athletes \nled the United States to a record third World Cup title. We all \ncheered, but then along with a lot of other Americans, I was surprised \nto learn that the U.S. Women's National Team--even though there were \nenormous receipts from the TV coverage of this--received $2 million for \nwinning the Women's World Cup. The 2014 Men's World Cup winners were \nawarded $35 million. When the women won, it was $2 million. When the \nmen won, it was $35 million. To make it even worse, the men's teams \nthat lost in the first round of the 2014 Men's World Cup were awarded \n$8 million. In other words, if you lose and are a man, you get $8 \nmillion. If you are a woman and you win, you get $2 million.\n  That is really not acceptable. I cannot imagine anybody finding it \nacceptable. I wanted to raise some awareness of this. I introduced a \nSenate resolution calling on soccer's international governing body, \nFIFA, to eliminate its discriminatory prize awards structure.\n  It highlights the gross pay disparity in their award structure and \ncalls for immediate change. All Democrats support this call. I have \nheard some opponents of an equal prize awards structure in sports who \nsay: Oh, no, we must pay men more than women. They point to revenue as \nthe reason behind this disparity. Revenue cannot be accepted as a means \nfor discrimination. Awards should not be determined by gender. That is \nwhy major sporting events, including the U.S. Open Tennis Championships \nand Wimbledon changed their prize award structure to assure that both \nfemale and male athletes are treated with the same dignity and respect \nthey deserve.\n  This proud father and grandfather feels that my sons and my daughter \nshould be treated the same and my grandsons and granddaughters should \nbe treated the same. In fact, it is why the U.S. Women's National Team \nwas rightly honored with a Ticker-Tape parade and magazine covers for \neach player and their head coach by Sports Illustrated.\n  These athletes, recognized at the White House on Tuesday, are global \nicons. Not just here in America but around the world they are \nrecognized. They are role models to young athletes and fans everywhere.\n  This includes fans such as 13-year-old Ayla Ludlow. She wrote to \nPresident Obama and the First Lady after the Women's World Cup. She \nsaid: ``It makes me mad that people do not treat girls equally.'' I \nagree. It is time to recognize all athletes for their contributions--\nnot make women second-class citizens. By taking an overdue but \nimportant step toward pay equity, we send a resounding message not just \nto women and girls but also to men and boys around the world. Equal pay \nfor equal work should not be an ideal we talk about, but a reality.\n\n  The men's teams that lost in the 2014 Men's World Cup was awarded $8 \nmillion. The women's team, which was watched worldwide as they won, was \nawarded $2 million. The men's team that did win was awarded $35 \nmillion. I cannot imagine anybody who could stand up for that kind of \ndisparity and treat men so much differently and so much better than \nwomen. These are athletes who worked hard from the time they were young \nto be the best of the best. They made America proud. But I think we \nmake America a little ashamed if we do not stand up and say: We want \nwomen treated the same as men.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. Res. 222, and that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration--this is the resolution \ncalling on FIFA to pay the same; and that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nlistened carefully to the distinguished Senator's comments. Gender \ndiscrimination is wrong, and we all know that. We have enacted laws in \nthe United States for sports and for the workplace to make sure that we \nreflect those values.\n  I support those laws, but we have a budget to pass, a debt crisis to \nfix, an education system that needs reform, and a humanitarian crisis \nin Europe that we ought to address. That is what the U.S. Senate ought \nto be spending its time on rather than offering opinions and \nresolutions about a private international entity and how they should \ndistribute prizes and awards. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night we passed resolutions, and here \nwe are talking about taking 30 seconds out of our busy, busy schedule. \nOf course, we were in a quorum call for a few hours today. We could \ntake 30, 50, or 82 seconds out of the 100 hours or so we will spend \nduring the month sitting here doing nothing and pass a resolution that \ncalls for the equal treatment of male and female athletes.\n  If we cannot even do that, is it any wonder that the approval ratings \nof the Senate are in the tank? If we cannot even pass a nonbinding \nresolution, how can we ever achieve real pay equity for women? What is \nthe real objection? We are simply urging for the equal treatment of \nfemale athletes. Treating people differently solely because of their \ngender is unacceptable. It sends a terrible message to mothers, \ndaughters, and granddaughters across the globe.\n  As I said, every single Democrat supports this resolution. I am very \ndisappointed that the Republicans are blocking it.\n  I will leave after saying one more thing. The women's team won to \ninternational acclaim, and they were awarded $2 million. The men's \nteams that lost in the first round was paid $8 million. The men's team \nthat won was awarded $35 million.\n  Wimbledon knows better. The U.S. Open Tennis Championships said \nenough is enough. Women should be treated the same as men.\n  A 13-year-old girl wrote to the President and said: ``It makes me mad \nthat people do not treat girls equally.'' Well, I have a granddaughter \nwho will be 13 in December. How do I speak to her? How do I tell her \nthat the U.S. Senate--which is sort of waiting around here and has not \ndone anything today--is unwilling to take 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 50 \nseconds to say: Let's treat women athletes the same as men.\n  I thank my Democratic colleagues for supporting this legislation. I \nhope my Republican colleagues will change their minds and say: Let's \ntreat female athletes the same as male athletes, especially since the \nWorld Cup organization made a fortune on TV rights. They certainly made \na heck of a lot more money on those TV rights while the women were \nwinning than they were making when the men's team lost, but the men's \nteams that lost in the first round were still paid $8 million. They \nmade four times more than the women who won the championship were paid. \nIt is sexist, and it is wrong.\n  In this day and age we need to stop treating women as second-class \ncitizens. I do not want my daughter treated that way. I do not want my \ngranddaughters treated that way. I do not want the women in Vermont \ntreated that way. I do not want women anywhere in this country to be \ntreated that way. I want to say to that 13-year-old girl who is angry \nbecause of the unfair treatment of girls: I am sorry the U.S. Senate \nwould not stand up for you, but I, and others, stand up for you, and I \nalways will. Let us hope someday the Senate stands up for you too.\n  We can see how busy we are at this time. There is not a single \nSenator on the floor, except for the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nof course, and so I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to address a frustrating \nsituation that has brought us here today. For months I have been \ncalling on Congress to come to the middle and negotiate a responsible \nbudget deal that\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\nworks for the American people, but time and time again, whether it was \nin the Appropriations Committee or here on the Senate floor, Members of \nthis body refused to have a conversation about how to do that. They dug \ntheir heels in and said: It is my way or the highway.\n  Now here we are, down to the wire, and they finally realize that \nsequestration is damaging. It is something that we have been saying \nfrom day one. Unfortunately, it cost the Speaker of the House his job, \nit wasted months of time, and it continued to erode what is left of the \nfaith that the American people have in Congress.\n  Coming from Montana, I find this incredibly frustrating. Folks back \nhome are reasonable. They talk to their neighbors even if they don't \nagree with them. They compromise, negotiate, give a little, and most of \nthe time they get a lot. This body could learn a lot from my \nconstituents.\n  The Senate was designed to be a deliberative body. It was supposed to \nbe a place where conversations and compromise happen, where we reach \nacross the aisle and partner with our colleagues with whom we might not \nalways agree. That kind of bipartisanship requires more time, harder \nwork, and tougher conversations. Sure, it is a lot easier to scream and \nyell at the other side so the super PACs and millionaires who fund too \nmuch of our politics these days know we didn't back down, but at the \nend of the day, that doesn't move the country forward, and \nunfortunately that happened again this year.\n  Had we started these budget negotiations back in July when 10 \nmoderate Members of this body first rang the alarm, we wouldn't be in a \nlast-minute scramble today. I am disappointed. I am disappointed in the \nSenate. The only time folks are talking to one another is when there is \na crisis. The only time folks are working together is when we are faced \nwith fiscal cliffs, economic meltdowns, and catastrophes. I hope we \nrealize that Congress is the only place in this country that operates \nlike this. Businesses and families plan, talk, and they certainly don't \nwait until the last minute to get their financial house in order.\n  Why does it take an emergency for Congress to govern? Why does it \ntake a looming deadline for folks to come to their senses and to do \ntheir jobs? It is because the voices in the middle are getting drowned \nout by the voices on the fringes. We have become afraid of compromise. \nIn many circles it is a dirty word, one that should never be uttered.\n  So here we are today, just a few days before we default on our debt, \nand we have wasted so much time. Our inability to tackle these issues \nearlier this year caused the appropriations process to break down. It \ncaused an unnecessary veto of the Defense authorization bill, something \nour troops are waiting for us to resolve while they stand on the \nfrontlines.\n  I know this budget deal isn't perfect, but it is the product of \ncompromise, however last minute it may be and however limited the \nability of Senators to weigh in on it is. But by raising the debt \nceiling, we will prevent interest rates from skyrocketing and the value \nof the dollar from plummeting. By ending the sequester, we will do away \nwith severe budget cuts that are hurting our veterans, seniors, \nstudents, and working families.\n  We will shore up Social Security and allow ourselves to make \nresponsible investments in our national security, education, health \ncare, and public lands. It will reduce a massive premium hike that was \nscheduled to impact 46,000 Montana seniors who use Medicare for their \nhealth insurance. This legislation will keep those premiums more \nmanageable.\n  Those accomplishments are critically important to our economy and \nworthy of this Senate's support, but as with anything that comes \ntogether at the last minute, there are provisions I don't like, things \nthat could have been fixed if we had taken more time to negotiate. \nTake, for instance, the budget's impact on our rural hospitals. There \nare provisions in here that could severely limit access to rural health \ncare. I am committed to addressing those concerns in the upcoming \nappropriations process because folks in Montana and other rural States \nshouldn't have to drive hundreds of miles to see a doctor.\n\n  As I said, this budget isn't perfect. The most disappointing thing is \nthat it could have been so much better. But in the spirit of compromise \nthat got us here today, we need to use that conversation to make sure \nwe get things done.\n  I know there will always be those who refuse to get off the \nideological soapbox and who like to watch others do the hard work of \ngoverning, but those folks usually don't last long with my \nconstituents.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                    Congratulating Speaker Paul Ryan\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when responsibility calls, it is \nusually not at a time of our choosing. The decision to answer is rarely \neasy or straightforward. Paul Ryan knows this. He spent his nights \ndreaming about tax policy, not the Speakership. But our country is \nfortunate that he stepped up to lead, and I know I am grateful that he \ndid.\n  Speaker Ryan is thoughtful about the issues facing our Nation. He is \nsober-minded. He knows the job he is walking into is tough. He also \nunderstands the potential it holds in terms of conservative solutions \nfor our country and in terms of more opportunity for the middle class.\n  When I called to congratulate Speaker Ryan, we discussed our many \nshared goals in Congress. We pledged a strong partnership. We aimed to \ncontinue advancing conservative reform. I look forward to working \nclosely with him as we move forward.\n  Speaker Ryan knows what it means to work hard. He knows what it means \nto dream big dreams. He knows what it means to achieve them as well. \nSomething we all admire about Speaker Ryan is his determination to \nensure others are able to achieve big things in their lives too, to \nensure others can lead fulfilling lives defined by meaning and \npunctuated with purpose.\n  There is no doubt he cares deeply. He cares about combating poverty \neffectively. He cares about lifting up the middle class successfully. \nAnd because he cares, he is willing to call out failed policies when \nthey hurt those they are supposed to help, and he has suggested better \nways forward as well.\n  In short, here is what we can say about Speaker Ryan: He has a big \nheart, he has an extraordinary intellect, and he knows how to lead with \nboth. That quality is rare around here. So is having a reputation that \nso greatly precedes oneself in such a positive way. But that is Speaker \nRyan.\n  Nothing is going to come easily in his new role, and he certainly \nknows that. Neither of us will be under any illusions about the \npositions we hold. We face a Democratic Party that continues to move \nleft. We face a President who doesn't seem very interested in \ncooperation on the big things or the hard things, nor on making divided \ngovernment work. These are the realities that face us, and we might as \nwell acknowledge them, but it won't stop us from working together to \nadvance conservative reform as well as to achieve solutions for the \nmiddle class whenever we can.\n  Today, though, let's celebrate Speaker Ryan's extraordinary \nachievement. He has already proven his stature as a leader in our \nparty. From leading the Nation on responsible budgeting and pro-growth \ntax reform to serving as an extraordinary candidate for Vice President, \nhe always rises to the challenge.\n  I would note for my House colleagues that their incoming leader \ncampaigned vigorously to become President of the Senate, but he was \ndrafted into the Speakership.\n  But, look, on a more serious note, Paul Ryan may not have asked for \nthis job, but the moment called for him to lead, and I am grateful that \nhe will because we know he is a leader who has repeatedly demonstrated \nthe talent, the vision, and the experience to succeed.\n  I look forward to building a strong partnership on behalf of our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7624-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7624-S7625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to raising the \ndebt ceiling. I rise particularly in opposition to raising the debt \nceiling without getting any sort of spending reform or budgetary reform \nin return. In fact, it will be completely the opposite. We will be \nraising the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion. We will be giving \nPresident Obama a free pass to borrow as much money as he can borrow in \nthe last year of his office--no dollar limit. Here you go, President \nObama, spend what you want. We do this while also exceeding what are \ncalled budget caps.\n  We have been trying to have spending restraint in Washington. It \nhasn't worked very well, but at least there are some numbers the \ngovernment is not supposed to exceed. These include spending caps for \nmilitary spending as well as domestic spending.\n  When I first arrived in 2010, I was part of the movement called the \ntea party movement. We came into prominence, and I was elected \nprimarily because I was concerned about the debt, worried about the \ndebt we were leaving to our kids and our grandkids, worried that we \nwere destroying the very fabric of the country with debt.\n  We came here in 2010, and we negotiated and negotiated, and President \nObama said: I won't negotiate with you. I won't negotiate with a gun to \nmy head.\n  The media said: You always have to raise the debt ceiling. It is \nirresponsible to use that as leverage to get reform.\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\n  But you know what. We did get reform. The conservatives put together \nsomething called cut, cap, and balance. It was passed overwhelmingly in \nthe House, blocked in the Senate, but ultimately there was something \npassed called sequestration, which put caps on both military and \ndomestic spending. It did slow down the rate of growth in government \nfor a little while.\n  This is the problem with Congress: Congress will occasionally do \nsomething in the right direction, and then they take one step forward \nand two steps back. In 2013 we gave up on the sequester and we added \nback in about $60 billion worth of money. Now they are doing the same \nthing again. This time we are going to add back in $80 billion--$50 \nbillion in 2016 and another $30 billion in 2017.\n  We are doing the opposite of what we should be doing. We should be \nusing the leverage of the debt ceiling by saying: We are not raising it \nagain until you reform your ways, until you begin spending only the \nmoney you have.\n  Instead, we are saying: Here, Mr. President. You can raise the debt \nas much as you want. You can spend as much as you want while you are in \noffice, and we are going to do nothing. In fact, we are going to help \nyou. We are going to exceed the caps so everybody gets what they want.\n  So everyone in Washington is going to get something. The right is \ngoing to get more military money, the left is going to get more welfare \nmoney, the secret handshake goes on, and the American public gets stuck \nwith the bill.\n  I think one of the most important things that we do is defend the \ncountry. If you ask me to prioritize the spending, I will say we have \nto defend the country above and beyond and before all else. But that \ndoesn't mean we are stronger or safer if we are doing this from \nbankruptcy court.\n  I think the No. 1 threat to our country, the No. 1 threat to our \nsecurity is debt, this piling on of debt. The debt threatens our \nnational security. Yet we just want to pile it on and pile it on.\n  This deal will do nothing but explode the debt. In fact, it doesn't \neven limit how much the debt can go up. We are giving the President a \nblank check.\n  We are in the middle of a filibuster. This filibuster will go on \nuntil about 1:00 in the morning, and then we will find out who the true \nconservatives in this town are. If you are conservative, you will say: \nThere is no way I am going to vote to give an unlimited power to the \nPresident to borrow money. If you are a conservative, you are going to \nsay: We shouldn't be exceeding the budget caps; if anything, we should \nbe passing more stringent budget caps.\n  It disappoints me greater than I can possibly express that the party \nI belong to that should be the conservative party doesn't appear to be \nconservative. This is a big problem.\n  I am traveling the country, and I have asked Republicans everywhere. \nI have yet to meet a single Republican who supports this deal.\n  In the House, they voted on this yesterday. Do you know what the vote \nwas? Two to one among Republicans say that this is a god-awful deal and \nthat we shouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. It is a terrible deal. \nHouse Republicans understood this.\n  We should be doing the opposite. We should be taking the leverage of \nsaying we are not going to raise the debt ceiling unless we get reform. \nInstead, we went to the President and said: Here, raise the debt \nceiling as much as you can possibly spend over the next year, and we \nwill let you exceed the budget caps. It is irresponsible. It shows a \nlack of concern for our country, for the debt, and it should go down in \ndefeat.\n  When I ran for office in 2010, the debt was an enormous issue. The \ndebt was $10 trillion. Some of us in the tea party were concerned \nbecause it had doubled in the last 8 years. It doubled from $5 to $10 \ntrillion under a Republican administration. Many of us were adamant \nthat Republicans needed to do a better job. We had added new \nentitlement programs, we added new spending, and the deficit got worse \nunder Republicans. Now we are under a Democratic President and it is \nset to double again. This President will add more to the debt than all \nof the previous Presidents combined. So we will go from $10 trillion \nnow to nearly $20 trillion. We may get close to $20 trillion, and now \nthat we have increased the debt ceiling an unspecified amount, we may \nwell get to $20 trillion by the time this President leaves.\n  Is that a problem? Some people say: It is just a big number. I don't \nknow what $1 trillion is.\n  If you want to imagine $1 trillion, take thousand-dollar bills and \nput them in your hand. Thousand-dollar bills 4 inches high is $1 \nmillion. If you want to have $1 trillion in thousand-dollar bills, it \nwould be 63 miles high. We are talking about an amount of money that is \nhard to fathom.\n  You say: What does that mean? How does that hurt me or my family?\n  Economists say we are losing 1 million jobs a year through the burden \nof debt. Economists also say that when your debt becomes as large as \nyour economy, you are in a worrisome place; that when the debt is as \nlarge as the economy, there is a possibility that you may enter into a \nperiod where you might suffer a panic or a collapse or a burden so \ngreat that your economy can't withstand it. In 2008 we were very close \nto a panic. I think we get closer with each day.\n  The No. 1 priority up here shouldn't be trying to scrounge around and \nfind new money to spend. It should be trying to conserve. It should be \ndoing something that some say is radical but I say is the absolute \nessence of common sense; that is, we should spend what comes in.\n  So often up here, things become partisan and people just want to \npoint fingers and say: Oh, it is that party that did it; they are the \nones responsible for the debt.\n  But I want to let you in on a secret. This is a secret that goes on \nand on and on up here. It is something I call the unholy alliance. It \nis the unholy alliance between right and left--they both have sacred \ncows they want to spend money on. Instead of saying: The debt is a real \nproblem, and we both have to conserve in both areas, they get together \nsecretly and raise the money for their sacred cows. So on the right we \nare busting the limits because the right wants more military spending. \nThe left wants more for welfare. The unholy alliance is the secret \nhandshake. And what gets worse? The debt. We are borrowing $1 million \nevery minute, and it is not going to end in a pretty way.\n  What do other conservatives have to say about this deal? Stephen \nMoore at the Heritage Foundation writes: ``It is the worst budget deal \nto be negotiated by the GOP since George H.W. Bush violated his `no new \ntaxes' pledge in 1990.''\n  Rush Limbaugh says: ``The Republican party cannot campaign by running \naround blaming the Democrats for destroying the budget, for \noverspending, for threatening the very fabric of the country.'' They \ncan't do it because they are now complicit.\n  We can't point fingers and say the Democrats are the big spenders. We \nnow, by this deal, become complicit. We become equally guilty of \nsupporting new debt.\n  Some say: Well, gosh, you have to raise the debt ceiling, right? If \nyou don't raise the debt ceiling, there will be a default.\n  Hogwash. Do you know how much money comes into this place every month \nthrough taxes? About $250 billion comes in in taxes. Do you know what \nour interest payment is? About $30 billion, might be as high as $60, \n$70, $80 billion. There is never not enough revenue to pay for \ninterest. People say we couldn't pay for everything. I say maybe we \nshouldn't spend it on everything. We have plenty of money that comes in \nevery month to spend on interest, to spend on Medicare, to spend on \nSocial Security, and to spend on soldiers' salaries and veterans \naffairs and the rest, but maybe government shouldn't be doing much \nelse.\n  These are the questions we would have to ask: What would happen if \nthe debt ceiling didn't go up? We would have a balanced budget. How bad \nwould that be? If your debt ceiling didn't go up, you would spend what \ncomes in. That is what every American family does--they spend what \ncomes in.\n  I think this is absolutely what we need to do, but even I am willing \nto compromise, so I have put forward a compromise. I put forward a \ncompromise that we tried in 2011 called cut, cap, and balance. My \ncompromise would cut the deficit in half in 1 year--a dramatic \nlessening of the burden of\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\ndebt. That is the cut. The cap is that my bill would actually cap \nspending at 18 percent of GDP--18 percent of the total amount of money \nspent on the economy. Why did we pick 18 percent? Because that leads to \na balanced budget. The last part of my bill of cut, cap, and balance is \nwe would pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I have \nkind of jokingly said--but probably seriously--if we pass a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution and we pass term limits, I will go \nback to being a doctor, which is my first love anyway.\n  We have to fix the country. We are destroying the country with debt. \nWe are drowning in a sea of debt, and neither party seems to be \nconcerned with it anymore.\n  So what I would do is I would say, yes, I will compromise. I will \nraise the debt ceiling under these three conditions: cut the deficit in \nhalf, cap the spending, and pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  People say: Well, there aren't the votes for that.\n  Why don't we have a vote? Why don't we allow a vote on cut, cap, and \nbalance, the conservative alternative to this deal we have on the \nfloor? Why don't we vote on an alternative? Because there won't be any \namendments allowed. This will be pushed through without amendments. I \nreally object to that. This is supposed to be a body of deliberation. \nWe are supposed to be able to deliberate over how we are going to fix \nthe problems of the country. And I think this is the No. 1 threat to \nus. We are accumulating debt at $1 million every minute. Someone has to \nstand up and do something about it.\n  Taxpayers for Common Sense says about this: ``We're not a fan of the \nBipartisan Budget Agreement of 2015.''\n  CATO writes: ``The Gipper's [Ronald Reagan's] ghost is probably \nlooking down from heaven at the new budget deal between congressional \nleaders and the Obama administration and saying `there they go \nagain.'''\n  ``So let's rephrase the question: What do advocates of fiscal \nrestraint get in exchange [for raising these spending caps]? Well, if \nyou peruse [this] agreement, it's apparent they don't get anything.''\n  What we have traded is an increase in the debt ceiling--not just an \nincrease, an unspecified increase in the debt ceiling. We have said to \nPresident Obama: You can spend as much money as you want throughout the \nrest of your Presidency--no limits.\n  The National Taxpayers Union writes:\n\n       If the question on the budget and debt ceiling package is \n     ``Deal or No Deal?'' taxpayers should clearly opt for the \n     latter.\n\n  While the agreement contains a few meritorious provisions, it fails \nother sufficient savings and structural reforms necessary to address \nour Nation's $18.1 trillion debt problem. The debt is without question \nthe No. 1 problem in the country. We will have a vote this evening, and \nthat vote will be: Do you care? Are you willing to do something to slow \nit down? Do you think we ought to use the leverage of the debt ceiling \nto slow down spending or are you a profligate spender who will vote to \nbust the caps and who will vote to give President Obama unlimited \nborrowing authority?\n  I think it is a clear-cut question. I will vote no, and I will \ncontinue this filibuster as long as there are enough votes to allow it \nto continue.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2182\n\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of my bill, Cut, Cap, and \nBalance, which is Calendar No. 274, S. 2182. I further ask that there \nbe 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form; that following \nthe use or yielding back of time the bill be read a third time and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering a bipartisan \nbudget agreement. I believe it is important to pass that bipartisan \neffort to avoid catastrophic default and to put an end to the mindless \nsequestration and pass funding to keep the government open. \nRegrettably, because I often agree with my friend from Kentucky and we \nteam up on so many issues, the request to take up the Cut, Cap, and \nBalance legislation is a step in the wrong direction.\n  When you push for cut, cap, and balance in this context, you are \npushing for default, recession, and joblessness because that is what \nall of the independent financial authorities tell us is what is ahead \nif we don't act in the Senate. The desire to set aside what we are \nworking on and pursue this other legislation is specifically an \napproach that would throw aside the bipartisan agreement before the \nSenate.\n  This bipartisan effort is exactly the kind of bipartisan work where \nDemocrats and Republicans come together to tackle a major issue. The \nAmerican people expect their leaders to find common ground on key \nissues. That is what this legislation does.\n  For those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Oregon that \nbipartisan agreement is necessary in this body, but I think we have in \nthis agreement bipartisan agreement in the wrong direction. The \nbipartisan agreement we need is to conserve across the board, for both \nsides to say that our sacred cow, whether it is military on the right \nor domestic spending on the left--that they all will have to be \nconserved. We will not be able to spend money we don't have.\n  I think we are becoming weaker as a nation the more we borrow. If we \npass this bill, it is not a difference or a choice between calamity and \ncontinuing to add to the debt--which this bill will do. I fully believe \nwe can continue to make our payments. We have $250 billion a month that \ncomes in. Interest payments are $30 billion. There is absolutely no \nreason we would ever default. In fact, I have a bill called the Default \nProtection Act, which would ensure that Social Security, Medicare, our \nsoldiers' salaries, and the interest on the debt were paid for. So I \nthink what we should be doing is doing the opposite kind of compromise. \nRight and left should come together and say: You know what. I really \nwant spending on this. The right says: I really want spending on the \nmilitary. They should come together and say: You know what. We don't \nhave any money. We are borrowing $1 million every minute.\n  So I think this bipartisan compromise goes in the wrong direction. \nWhat I would ask for is a bipartisan compromise to actually save money \nand borrow less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the conflict in Syria, \nand in particular what is happening over the next couple of days and \nweeks. We know that in the last 4 years, starting in 2011, this \nconflict has resulted in the deaths of a quarter of a million Syrians. \nMore than 4 million Syrians have fled and registered as refugees in \nneighboring countries. We are told that 7.6 million Syrian are \ndisplaced from their homes within Syria itself.\n  So when you combine those who have fled the country because of the \nviolence and combine that with the number of folks displaced in the \ncountry, you have about half the population of Syria. If we had the \nequivalent number here in the United States--of over 300 million \npeople--that would be something on the order of 150 million Americans \ndisplaced from their homes. We cannot even imagine the scale of that \nsuffering.\n  At the center of this horror, this horrific war and humanitarian \ncatastrophe, sits Bashar al-Assad, the dictator, who in the estimation \nof many experts and world leaders, and this is my opinion as well, has \nlost all legitimacy as the leader of Syria. A conflict that began with \npeaceful protests by Syrian young people for change quickly gave way to \nfighting on the streets of Homs, Daraa, and Aleppo.\n  Assad's security forces have attempted to quash dissent with brutal \nbeatings, imprisonment, starvation, use of chemical weapons, and \nwholesale destruction from indiscriminate barrel\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\nbombs, which, by the way, is a violation of international law. These \nactions prove to be a recruiting windfall for extremists and terrorist \ngroups like ISIS, which now operate along many major transportation \nroutes and cities in parts of Syria.\n  The Institute for the Study of War just this week assessed that ISIS \nis now challenging the Assad regime for control of the supply line to \nAleppo, expanding their reach westward. As I have said before and some \nothers have said--it is what I will continue to maintain--the conflict \nin Syria and the international effort to degrade and ultimately defeat \nISIS are inextricably linked.\n  We cannot expect to bring about a lasting defeat of ISIS without \nbringing about a political transition in Syria. The atrocities \nperpetrated by these two evils, one the Assad regime and also ISIS--\nthese atrocities are too numerous to catalog today. Neither entity \noffers a stable, secure, and prosperous future for Syria. Several times \nthe United States has participated in international negotiations with \nan eye toward ending this horror and paving the road toward a third \nchoice for Syria.\n  That is what this would be, a real political transition featuring \ninclusiveness, rule of law, and the primacy of citizenship over sect, \nethnicity, and other divisive categories. These conversations have yet \nto bear fruit, mostly because the regime in Iran and the Russians \ncontinue to offer a lifeline to the murderous Assad, but we must keep \ntrying. We must keep trying.\n  One look at the images of the destruction in Aleppo or the faces of \nSyrians fleeing to Europe for a better life reminds us of the human \ncosts of inaction. It is because of this that the Iranian and Russian \nescalation in recent weeks is so outrageous. These countries look at \nSyria as a ground line of communication to Hezbollah or a friendly host \nfor a warm-water naval outpost. They turn a blind eye to the suffering \nof ordinary men, women, and children in an effort to exert their \ninternational influence. Russia's warplanes have struck in areas where \nthe Syrian opposition, not ISIS, operates. Their strikes appear \nindiscriminate and have killed many civilians.\n  Now, in the case of Iran, the recent visit of a designated terrorist \nand IRGC commander, Qasem Soleimani--his movement to Syria indicates \nthat Iran and its proxies like Hezbollah are still central elements of \nthis fight. I am on the floor today as leaders from major countries \nmeet in Vienna. Yesterday in a speech at Carnegie Endowment, Secretary \nKerry described his diplomatic task as ``charting a course out of \nhell.'' That is how he described the way out through a political \nresolution in Syria.\n  Although news reports indicate that these talks will not deal \ndirectly with the question of Bashar al-Assad, our policy must remain \nfirm. Assad has no place--no place in Syria's future. No bombing \ncampaigns, no promise of sham elections should change that. I commend \nthe work Secretary Kerry is doing. I commend him for the speech he gave \nyesterday.\n  One month ago I wrote to him calling for greater U.S. leadership on \nat least three tracks: political, multilateral, and humanitarian. In \nthe response to my letter, the State Department emphasized, ``The only \nway to sustainably end the suffering of the Syrian people is through a \ngenuine political solution consistent with the Geneva principles.''\n  I appreciate and agree with this commitment. However, I am concerned \nthat the Governments of Syria, Iran, and Russia remain in clear \nviolation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions, including \nflouting arms control restrictions and travel sanctions. These regimes \ndo not appear to be ready for dialogue consistent with the Geneva \nprinciples. Secretary Kerry said during his Carnegie speech yesterday \nthat the United States and Russia have many points of common ground on \nSyria. However, the areas of divergence are stark.\n  We know there is no military solution to this conflict. Only a \npolitical settlement can heal the deep wounds across Syria. We must \ncontinually assert that no political solution can include a role for \nBashar al-Assad. For a ruler who indiscriminately barrel bombs children \nover and over again, presides over the death of over one-quarter of a \nmillion civilians, there must be no soft political landing.\n  We have said over and over again--and I will continue to say it--that \nAssad must go. It is important our negotiators in Vienna insist that \nthese talks are a vehicle to effectuate the removal of Assad, not \ncontinue his brutal rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and following my speech that Senator Lee from Utah be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to M.H. ``Woody'' Woodside\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, all of us know that back in our home \nStates today and every day, there are men and women working hard to \nplant the fields, manufacture the products, run the chambers of \ncommerce, sell the groceries, cut the lawns, make the beds, make our \nStates work, and make our economy work. We also know that as \npoliticians serving in the Senate, there is not one of us who doesn't \nowe our career to community leaders back home who take the time to lend \ntheir support to us, bring their communities to us, and give us the \nfortification we need to serve our great State.\n  Back in Georgia there is one such person who means a lot to me and \nwho meets all those criteria. His name is Woody Woodside. Woody is the \npresident of The Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce in \nBrunswick, GA. On November 5, he is going to be honored for 30 \nconsecutive years as president of that chamber. And Woody is one great \nchamber president, let me tell you.\n  He got his start right here in Washington, DC, working 11 years for \nBo Ginn, the Congressman from Georgia's coast, and for 3 years \nfollowing that for Bo's successor, Lindsay Thomas. Woody worked hard \nfor our State, he worked hard for his district, and he worked hard for \nthose members of commerce.\n  But he comes back to us every year now as the president of the \nchamber of commerce. He brings his board with him. He brings the issues \nthat are before them and he lobbies hard for his community. But he also \nlobbies hard for the environment. Woody represents a chamber that \npromotes tourism on the coast of Georgia but fights equally for the \npreservation of the estuary of the Atlantic, the Marshes of Glynn.\n  He is proud of his community and proud of the work he does. He is a \ntireless worker on behalf of his State and his community. He loves his \nbeautiful family--his wife Ellen, his daughter Mary Gould, his late son \nJay, his grandson James ``Woods'' Woodside, and his granddaughter Mary \nBremer Moorhead.\n  He is one of those priceless citizens who means so much to our State \nand so much to me personally. On this occasion on the floor of the \nSenate, I pay tribute to Woody Woodside for his 30 years of service to \nthe Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce and thank him for \neverything he has done for his country, his State, and his community.\n  May God bless Woody Woodside, and may God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the budget deal before the Senate today is \nnot just a horrible piece of legislation that is undeserving of this \nChamber's support, it also represents the last gasping breath of a \ndisgraced bipartisan beltway establishment on the verge of collapse.\n  The bill is the product of an unfair, dysfunctional, and \nfundamentally undemocratic process--a process that is virtually \nindistinguishable from what we promised the American people a GOP-\ncontrolled Congress would bring to an end. We made that promise \nprecisely because negotiating legislation behind closed doors without \ninput from the majority of Members and then rushing it through to final \npassage without debate or opportunity for amendments violates our \nparty's core principles. It also inevitably leads to bad policy.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 is a case in point. This bill would \nsuspend the debt limit for 17 months and increase government spending \nbeyond its already unsustainable levels. It would\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\ndo so while failing to make reforms that would put us on a path toward \nfiscal sustainability.\n  Many proponents of this budget deal challenge this claim. They say: \nWell, the bill isn't perfect, but while it isn't perfect it does \ninclude some meaningful entitlement reforms.\n  The sales pitch we hear most often alleges that this budget deal will \nsave the Social Security disability trust fund from insolvency, but we \nare never told exactly how this bill would do this. That is because, as \nalways, the devil is in the details.\n  I rise today to discuss these very details, details that prove this \nbudget deal's so-called entitlement reforms are nothing of the sort. At \nbest, they are well-intentioned but ineffectual tweaks to a program \nthat desperately needs fundamental, structural overhaul. At worst, they \nare accounting gimmicks unbecoming of the U.S. Congress.\n  According to the Social Security trustees, the Social Security \nDisability Insurance Program--or SSDI--is scheduled to run out of money \nin 2016, which means that without serious reform disability benefits \nwould be slashed across the board by nearly 20 percent.\n  Under the Budget Control Act of 2015, the bankruptcy deadline of SSDI \nwould be pushed off for an additional 6 years until 2022. But here is \nthe kicker: It would do so by raiding the Social Security trust fund to \nthe tune of $150 billion. That is right. Our grand, bipartisan solution \nto the impending insolvency of our Nation's disability insurance \nprogram amounts to stealing $150 billion from our Nation's largest \nretirement insurance program.\n  This isn't the only phony pay-for in this budget deal. There are \nothers that simply move money around from elsewhere in the Federal \nbudget, such as the Crime Victims Fund and the Assets Forfeiture Fund. \nThere are also new heavyhanded instruments that purport to implement \ncost savings in Medicaid reimbursements but actually only impose \nmisguided price controls on the generic drug industry. Only in \nWashington, DC, could something so deceptive and ineffective, something \nso unfair to America's seniors and future generations, be considered a \nreform.\n  To be fair, there are a couple of sound entitlement reforms in this \nbudget deal that deserve to be commended. First, there is a position \nthat would correct a design error in the Social Security program that \namounts to an unfair and wasteful loophole. Fixing this would save a \nsignificant amount of money over a 75-year window. There are also \nmeasures that would increase the penalties for fraud, create new pilot \nprograms, and prohibit doctors with felonies from submitting medical \nevidence. But these minor changes don't even come close to putting SSDI \non a path toward fiscal sustainability and sanity, and they represent \nonly a tiny fraction of the sensible reform proposals put forth by our \nconference.\n  Many of my colleagues, such as Senator Lankford and Senator Cotton, \nhave already spoken or will soon speak on the floor about the long list \nof structural reform ideas that are still sitting on the sidelines of \nthis debate. I wish to take a moment to touch on just a few of them.\n  Senator Coats has a proposal that would protect the SSDI trust fund \nfrom being drawn down by fugitive felons illegally receiving disability \nbenefits.\n  Senator Hatch has put forth a plan that would prevent an individual \nfrom receiving both unemployment insurance and disability insurance \nsimultaneously, ensuring that SSDI funds would remain focused on their \nintended population.\n  I also have a proposal that would expand the footprint of private \ndisability insurance program, which I intend to file as an amendment to \nthis bill.\n  That is not all. My friends, Senator Cotton and Senator Lankford, \nhave their own proposals, and there has been an equal amount of policy \ninnovation by our colleagues in the House of Representatives.\n  They are all commonsense ideas that would bring us much closer to \nreal SSDI reform than what is found in this budget deal, but you won't \nhear much about them in this debate because there won't be any real \ndebate on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015--no amendments, a fast-\napproaching deadline and, in the end, a take-it-or-leave-it choice \nforced upon us with our backs up against a cliff.\n  This is not how Congress is supposed to operate. This is not how we \npromised the country we would conduct the American people's business if \ngiven control of the House and the Senate. We should be the party of \nideas, but we won't be so long as we continue to tolerate a legislative \nprocess that stifles our most innovative proposals from getting a fair \nhearing. We should be the party of reform, but we won't be so long as \nindividual Senators are blocked from offering amendments to \nlegislation. We should be the party of fiscal sanity and responsible \ngovernance, but we won't be so long as we continue to govern by crisis \nand by cliff, delaying the inevitable while working only 3 days a week \nin our legislative calendar. We should be the party that looks out for \nthe most vulnerable among us, but we won't be so long as we lack the \ncourage to enact the structural reform that our retirement and \ndisability programs need to survive for generations to come.\n  We can be all of these things. I know we can, but it is going to take \nhard work--a fair, open, and inclusive legislative process, and all the \npolicy innovation we can muster. It is going to take something more, \nsomething better than this budget deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in recent weeks I have spoken three or \nfour or five times on the question of whether we are going to \nrealistically and honestly fund the transportation improvements our \ncountry so badly needs. I don't know if it is my imagination, but every \ntime I am here speaking on the subject, you are here. We have any \nnumber of people--50-some Republican Senators in the majority--who \ncycle in as Presiding Officer, yet you always seem to draw the short \nstraw and get to hear me wax eloquently about transportation \ninfrastructure. I am honored you would be back again today for more of \nthe same. Pretty soon, you will be able to give these talks for me and \nI will sit up there and preside. I won't ask unanimous consent for \nthat, but it is a good thought.\n  Mr. President, this is a picture that was taken, gosh, 60 or 70 years \nago, and there is a quote here by a fellow who was a great military \nleader for our country during World War II and later one of our \nPresidents. In fact, he was President when I had just about come into \nthe world and left as President a few years after that. The photograph \nsays, ``This is the first project in the United States on which actual \nconstruction was started under provisions of the new Federal Aid \nHighway Act of 1956.''\n  This is in Missouri. They have the contractor and some of the local \nfolks there. I don't see Ike anywhere, but his words are here at the \nbottom of this old photograph. His words that day were: ``A modern, \nefficient highway system is essential to meet the needs of our growing \npopulation, our expanding economy, and our national security.''\n  There is a word--``prescient''--that indicates something is wise and \nforward-looking. Those words are just that--wise and forward-looking--\nand they were first spoken almost 60 years ago by President Eisenhower.\n  This week, President Obama and leaders in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate reached a long-sought compromise on a \nbudget deal for 2 years, through 2017. And while there are certainly \nsome aspects of that budget deal that are disappointing, other aspects \nof it, at least for me--in terms of finding ways to save money, going \nafter program integrity, and looking for waste and fraud--bring a good \ndeal to like about it as well.\n  It is encouraging that Democrats and Republicans were able to come \ntogether to reach an agreement--any agreement--that will pause the \ncycle of crisis government, from crisis to crisis, where we find too \nmuch of our time across the Federal Government, as we run up to these \ncrises, spent not doing work--the work we ought to be doing--\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\nbut actually trying to figure out how we deal with a shutdown. At least \nwe can say this agreement will prevent that and for the next couple of \nyears enable people across the Federal Government to do their work, \nwhether it happens to be agriculture, environment, law enforcement, \nborder security, or you name it.\n  The other thing I would say is by preventing a default on our Federal \nobligations and lifting the harmful spending cuts--particularly in the \nareas of our budget where we actually invest money that create economic \nopportunity--this deal will help to encourage continued economic growth \nand recovering from low job creation and job preservation.\n  I heard today that this agreement is worth about an extra one-third \nof a million jobs, and in a little State like mine, Delaware, with \nfewer than a million people, that is quite a few jobs. However, if we \nreally wanted to focus on economic growth and job creation, we would be \ntalking a lot more about transportation, and I mentioned the words here \nof Dwight Eisenhower, but let's go on to the next poster.\n  While there is much to like in the budget agreement we are debating \ntoday and into the night, I am disappointed that it fails to offer a \nlong-term plan to increase investment in America's infrastructure, \nparticularly in our transportation infrastructure. A budget deal like \nthis offered a prime opportunity to address our chronic underinvestment \nin the roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems of this Nation.\n  I have looked high and low in this budget agreement, and when it \ncomes to transportation, there is a ``whole lotta nothing'' in there \nwith respect to transportation and infrastructure investment. Instead, \nCongress is now poised to pass not the 13th but the 14th extension of \nour Federal transportation programs since 2008. We have done this 14 \ntimes. Fortunately, this extension does not require us to add to the \n$74 billion we have spent since 2008 to bail out the highway \ntransportation fund time and again, but it only continues the cycle of \nuncertainty and crisis governing that prevented our States and our \ncities from planning major transportation projects.\n\n  I would just insert here that if you look at the country from coast \nto coast, our State transportation budgets use a mix of funds from \ndifferent sources, but on average, about half the money they spend--\nfrom Delaware and the other 49 States--comes from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We have missed another opportunity to give our Nation's economy a \nserious boost. This is a little bit of what I am talking about. This \nposter says: ``Here's why Congress needs to reauthorize funding to \nrebuild America's infrastructure.'' Here are a few numbers to keep in \nmind: 25 percent, 45 percent, and 65 percent. Twenty-five percent of \nour bridges require significant repair. Either that or they cannot \nhandle today's traffic at all. Twenty-five percent. Forty-five percent \nof Americans lack access to transit. Forty-five percent. Sixty-five \npercent of America's roads are rated in less than good condition. \nSixty-five percent.\n  There is an outfit called the American Society of Civil Engineers. \nOne of the things they do every year is to rate highways, roads, and \nbridges. They assign a grade. It could be an A.\n  We have our pages here. They are here doing their school work while \nthey are paging in the Senate, so they do double duty, but hopefully \nthey are all getting A's in their courses. Our roads, highways, and \nbridges do not receive any A's. They do not receive B's. Hopefully our \npages get B's and better, but our roads, highways, and bridges do not. \nIn fact, our roads, highways, and transit systems are earning a D. D is \ndisappointing. D is degraded. D is dogged. And our Nation's bridges \nearn a C-plus. Those aren't grades that our pages would be proud of or \nthat their parents would be proud of, and those certainly aren't grades \nwe should be proud of as a country.\n  In the most recent World Economic Forum ranking, in less than a \ndecade the United States has fallen from seventh overall in the quality \nof our transportation infrastructure. A decade ago we were No. 7; today \nwe are No. 18. In Billboard magazine, when they are rating the top \nrecord across the country--a record on the rise gets a vote. A No. 5 in \nthe vote means it is heading up the charts. Ten years ago we were No. \n7, and now, like a bullet, we are heading right the other way--from No. \n7 to No. 18. We are heading in a very wrong direction.\n  Here in this poster we can see that highways and transit spending as \na share of GDP has not been going up.\n  In 1962 John Kennedy was President and I was a junior in high school, \njust like you pages. In 1962 the share of GDP that we spent for \nhighways and transit was right at 3 percent--right at 3 percent. Over \ntime it started dropping. Around 1972, in the middle of the Vietnam \nwar--I spent some time overseas in Southeast Asia with my compadres--it \ndropped to 2 percent. We were trying to pay for guns and bullets. It \nreally dropped rather steeply there, probably because of the war. What \nhas gone on since 1972 is to trend down, down, and down, and now the \nnumber is somewhere between 1 and 1.5 percent. It has diminished by \nmore than half since 1962.\n  Let me mention a couple of other numbers. The infrastructure spending \nis only about 2.5 percent of GDP in the United States. Actually, it is \nonly about 1.5 percent in the United States. What is that compared to? \nCompared to what?\n  I have a friend, and when you ask him ``How are you doing?'' he says \n``Compared to what?'' Well, how is the United States doing? Well, \ncompared to what? We are at 1.5 percent--actually, a little less than \nthat--of GDP for transportation infrastructure. Where are our Canadians \nup to the north? They are at 4 percent--more than twice the number we \nare. Australia, South Korea--where are they? They are at 5 percent, and \n5 percent for most of Europe. China is at 9 to 12 percent. They are \nspending 9 to 12 percent of their GDP on transportation and \ninfrastructure. We are spending 1.5 percent. That is not a good thing. \nThat is not a good thing.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that their \ninvestments in roads and highways dropped significantly between 2003 \nand 2012. How significantly? By another 20 percent.\n  To meet our country's needs in ways that support American business \nand families, an outfit called McKinsey Global Institute--most of us \nhave heard of the McKinsey Consulting Company, but they have an arm of \ntheir company called McKinsey Global Institute--estimates that we need \nto increase infrastructure investment by $150 billion annually through \n2020 to catch up the backlog of projects that are badly needed--roads, \nhighways, bridges, and transit.\n  Our lack of transportation investment is hurting families, \nindividuals, and businesses. There is an outfit down in Texas, Texas \nA, which is famous in recent years for their football teams, but they \nare also well known because every year they give us a report on \ncongestion on the roads, highways, and bridges in the United States. \nThey found that the average commuter across the country wastes 42 hours \nper year in traffic--42 hours per year just sitting there or barely \nmoving. If you actually look at cities such as New York City or \nPhiladelphia or Dallas or Denver or L.A., that number is 82 hours per \nyear. Think about that--82 hours per year here in the greater \nWashington area and a lot of other places, such as L.A. and New York \nCity. The resulting wasted fuel and lost productivity cost the Nation's \neconomy $160 billion this year--$160 billion. That works out to about \n$960 per commuter.\n  In addition to congestion, we have other costs to commuters--people \nout on the roads, highways, and bridges--that come from our repairs.\n  Not everybody can see this, but obviously there is a guy working on \npotholes and talking to his supervisor. It says: Warning, potholes. But \nhere is the number that is really the key: There is $516 per driver in \nincreased repair and maintenance costs every year.\n  There was an editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer last week, \ntalking to consumers and voters, that said: The next time you get a \nbill for replacing your tires, your steering, your rims or whatever, \nsend the bill to your Congressman, your Congresswoman, your Senator.\n  Even if it is only half of that, it is still a lot of money. I don't \nhave reason to believe it is half, but even if it is, it\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\nis a huge amount of money that we are spending. Add to that the waste \nof time, and this adds up.\n  This is a sad commentary. Some of the charts I use are humorous; this \none is not. Poor roadway conditions were a significant factor in \napproximately one-third of the 32,000 traffic fatalities last year. \nAbout 10,000 people who would be alive today are not. The primary \ncontributing factor to their death was the poor condition of the \nhighways, roads, and bridges on which they were traveling.\n  I mentioned the McKinsey Global Institute a minute ago. They said \nthat if we were serious about making real progress and doing it \npromptly on the condition of roads, highways, bridges, and transit \nsystems, we ought to be investing about $150 billion a year. Here is \nanother report from the McKinsey Global Institute. It says that about a \n$150 to $180 billion in annual investment is needed for 15 to 20 years. \nThat is a lot of money for a long time. They say that if we are serious \nand consistent in robustly investing in transportation infrastructure, \nwe would add to GDP, not once but every year, somewhere between 1.4 \npercent and 1.7 percent per year, and we would add about 1.8 million \njobs if we are willing to make the kind of investments that we need. \nThose aren't my numbers. Those are McKinsey's.\n  Put it all together, and this explains why Senator Dick Durbin and I \nintroduced a month or so ago what we call the TRAFFIC Relief Act. It \nraises about $220 billion in new money, user fee revenue--revenue that \ncan only be used for roads, highways, transit, and bridges, and not for \nanything else--not for foreign aid, not for wars, not for some other \ndomestic program. But $220 billion would go into roads, highways, \nbridges, and transit systems.\n  The legislation Senator Durbin and I introduced permanently \neliminates the annual highway trust fund shortfalls. Every year we run \nout of money. We run out of money in the transportation trust fund and \ntake money out of the general fund to fill up the transportation trust \nfund. When the general fund runs out of money, we go around the world \ncup-in-hand borrowing money from people such as China to refill the \ntransportation trust fund. Then, when we call China on their \nmisbehavior--it might be manipulation, it might be dumping various \ngoods and services on our country, it might be messing around in the \nSouth China Sea and other places--we say to them: You can't do that.\n  If I were them, I would say to us: We thought you wanted to borrow \nour money. We shouldn't be in that position. So the TRAFFIC Relief Act \nSenator Durbin and I introduced raises an additional $72 billion over \n10 years for new transportation investments, over and above what would \notherwise be generated. We could use that $72 billion and more.\n  Not everybody can read the script here, but this one fellow here is \nsaying: ``There is no way I can afford an increase in the gas tax.'' \nThen over here it goes on to say, as his car is towed away: ``I spend \nall my money fixing my car because of these terrible roads.'' Think \nabout that. There are a lot of terrible roads, highways, and bridges, \nand some pretty lousy transit systems as well. I spent money on my \nminivan last year replacing a tire that cost me about $200 because of a \nproblem with the road. I am not the only person. That happens to a lot \nof folks during the course of the year.\n  Those are all the posters I have. I will close by saying that on the \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee, where I serve, we have \nreported out unanimously authorizing legislation that would authorize \ninvestments in transportation systems--roads, bridges, highways, and \ntransits--for the next 6 years. It is actually very smart legislation. \nI give Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, the lead Democrat and the lead \nRepublican on the committee, a lot of credit for leading that effort.\n  The House of Representatives is coming up with a 6-year \ntransportation authorization plan that reflects in many ways what we \nhave done in the Senate. To the extent that is the case, then we \napplaud their efforts as well.\n  Some may remember another poster I showed earlier, an enlarged \nphotograph of a fellow wearing a cowboy hat as if he were asleep on his \nback. The cowboy hat was covering his face. He didn't look like the \n``Marlboro Man.'' He looked like a cowboy who had been ridden hard and \nput up wet. The caption at the bottom of the poster was talking about \nthe hat: ``All hat, no cattle,'' suggesting the guy wasn't a real \ncowboy. ``All hat, no cattle.''\n  It is great that we have sound, smart transportation authorization \nlegislation, and we do. What is really disappointing is ``all hat and \nno cattle'' when it comes to paying for this stuff, not coming close to \nthe amount of money we need to invest. We are not even close. I think \nwe are going to look at a 6-year transportation authorization with \nmaybe 3 years of funding. Some of that funding we create by borrowing \nand spending, which is like 8, 9, 10 years down the road and bringing \nit forward to pay for spending today. I don't feel good about that. I \nexpect you don't either. In some cases we are taking money that is \nsupposedly being collected for TSA, for aviation safety and our \nsecurity in the skies, and using that money for roads, highways, \nbridges--taking TSA funding increases and using it for a couple of \nmonths on roads, highways, bridges, and improvements. We do the same \nthing with Customs fees along our border. People and a lot of commerce \ncome across our border. Another idea we have used in the past is taking \nmoney out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, maybe from oil we bought \nfor $80, $90 a barrel and turning around and selling it for half that \nprice. Buy high and sell low--I don't think that is a very smart \nstrategy for investing in or for funding transportation projects. The \nAmerican people deserve better than this.\n\n  Ronald Reagan, Eisenhower, and others--even Democrats--have said that \nthe way we have funded transportation for years in this country and \nimprovements to transportation--roads, highways, bridges--is a user \napproach. The folks and the businesses that use our roads, highways, \nand bridges ought to pay for it. That is what we have done. We have \ncome to a place in this country where we are finding it hard to pay for \nthe things we need and the things we want. Somehow we have to summon \nthe courage to do what the American people expect us to do, which is to \nwork together, to work smartly, and to make some tough decisions.\n  The legislation I alluded to that Senator Durbin and I and another \ncolleague or two have introduced and sponsored would raise the gas tax \nand diesel tax in this country. It hasn't been raised in 22 years. The \ngas tax, which 22 years ago was raised to 18 cents, because of \ninflation is now worth less than a dime. The diesel tax, which 22 years \nago was worth about 23 cents, is now not even worth 15 cents. \nMeanwhile, the cost of concrete, asphalt, steel, and labor have all \ngone up, and we are still stuck with the same purchasing power from \nthese user fees that we had 22 years ago. The math doesn't add up. As a \nresult, we earn nearly failing grades for the transportation system \nthat we have.\n  If we were to somehow wave a magic wand and the House and the Senate \nwould come to their senses and pass by acclamation an increase in the \nuser fee of 4 cents a year for 4 years, we would get to 2020 and we \nwould have added 16 cents over that period of time to what is one of \nthe lowest user fees on gas and diesel of any advanced nation in the \nworld. I think we are No. 33 out of 34 of the OECD nations. In 2020, \nafter an increase of 4 cents a year for 4 years was put in place, the \ncost to the average driver is the cost of a cup of coffee a week. Think \nabout it. For the average driver paying an additional user fee of 4 \ncents a year for 4 years, indexing for inflation, the cost is the cost \nof a cup of coffee a week.\n  The question I would ask my colleagues--and I think we would ask most \npeople--is this: Would you rather put up with really--one of my \nfavorite, good senatorial words--``crappy'' roads, highways, bridges? \nWould you rather continue to put up with that?\n  We could have a transportation system that we could be proud of for a \ncup of coffee. I don't think that is asking too much.\n  I don't have a magic wand. I don't think it is likely that my \ncolleagues will rush to the floor after these remarks today and say: \nLet's do something real. Let's see if we can't get our roads, highways, \nand bridges making the kinds of grades that our pages are making doing \ntheir schoolwork while they serve us here in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\n  In the Bible there is a parable where some seeds were sown on the \nhard ground and never bore fruit. Some came up for a little while and \nraised up some plants but then died away in the hot sun. But others \ntook root and grew a hundredfold. I am going to keep sowing these \nseeds, and hopefully someday soon--sooner rather than later--some of \nthese seeds will fall on fertile soil.\n  Until then, I look forward to joining the Presiding Officer on the \nfloor to keep this up until you say ``uncle'' and then we will change \nplaces.\n  I see my friend from Kansas--my many talented friend--here with our \nfriend from Nebraska. I am tempted to wait and see what they have to \nsay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in the morning we will vote on a budget \nagreement and I will vote no. I think it is useful and important for my \nconstituents to understand my thinking and the basis on which I reach \nthat conclusion.\n  In my mind, one of the most important issues that we face in this \ncountry today is the fiscal condition of our country. The amount of \ndebt that we incur and the amount of debt that we continue to incur is \na significant drag on our economy, on job creation, and, in reality, on \nthe American dream.\n  It is an economic issue. At some point in time, if we don't get our \nfiscal house in order, we will pay a significant price. We can either \ndeal with this issue in a gradual, incremental way, in which we set \nourselves on a path to right, or we can wait for the crisis to occur, \nwhich I have no doubt will happen.\n  While it is often said that this is an economic issue, and fiscal \nissues matter to the country, I also would point out that this is not \njust an economic issue. It is a moral issue. The borrowing of money to \npay for services and goods that the government provides the American \npeople is a selfish circumstance in which we take the so-called \nbenefits of government programs today and expect future generations of \nAmericans to pay for those benefits. It is wrong economically for us to \ncontinue down the path of fiscal irresponsibility, but it is also \nmorally wrong to expect someone else to pay for the so-called benefits \nwe receive today.\n  As to this issue today, this Bipartisan Budget Act--this bipartisan \neffort to resolve the circumstance we find ourselves in because we face \na debt limit problem--the problem is that if we don't do something, \nthen we reach the debt limit. There are those who will argue that the \nconsequences of not raising the debt ceiling are so dramatic, so \ndamaging that we need to do that regardless of the fiscal consequences \nof doing so.\n  I come down on the side of fiscal responsibility, and I want to \nexplain why. I want Kansans to know how I think about this issue. In \nfact, one of the first letters I ever wrote to President Obama as a new \nU.S. Senator, March of 2011, was an explanation to the President that \nhe needed to work with Congress, and I offered to work with the \nPresident and the administration and my colleagues in the Congress and \nthe Senate to see if we couldn't find a solution so that when we raised \nthe debt ceiling, we actually did something that would change the \ncourse, the path of spending we are on.\n  I explained to Kansans, by publishing that letter and explaining my \ncomments in the letter to the President, what I believed was important, \nmost important. Unfortunately, since 2011 we are no more on a course of \nfiscal sanity than we were when I wrote the letter to the President.\n  Here is the point I want to make. If we give up the leverage, the \nopportunity that this issue presents to us as Members of Congress, to \nforce us to do things that we apparently don't have the will, the \ncourage, the political desire to do, how do we ever get it done? Again, \nI guess there will be editorialists--certainly across the country and \nperhaps a few in Kansas--who will say that we need to raise the debt \nceiling because it is irresponsible not to. Isn't it also true that it \nis irresponsible simply to raise the debt ceiling every time we need \nit? If we don't take advantage of the circumstance we are in to force \nourselves to do the things that need to be done, we are irresponsible.\n  I read a lot of history. For a few years I have studied our country \nas a private citizen, and I have been involved in the political process \nin Washington in trying to resolve problems our country faces. Here is \nan observation: Things have changed over time. It used to be a \nbipartisan desire, a bipartisan understanding that balancing the budget \nwas important. One of things that has changed over time is there no \nlonger seems to be the desire on the part of many in Congress--many \ndon't see it and in my view Democrats in particular don't see deficits \nas a bad thing. We look the other way.\n  Maybe in days gone by, when there was broad consensus from Republican \nPresidents and Democratic Presidents that balancing the budget was \nsomething that mattered, that reducing the debt at least over time was \nimportant, that when we incurred expenditures going to war that we paid \nfor them, that was something that was generally believed across the \ncountry by the vast majority of Americans and by the vast majority of \nMembers of Congress, regardless of what political party they associate \nwith.\n  That consensus, that drive, that insistence that we do that no longer \nexists, which highlights for me that the necessity of using this issue \nof whether the debt ceiling should be raised to determine what we \nshould do about reducing spending, reducing the debt, figuring out what \nthe balance is between taxes and expenditures is all the more \nimportant.\n  If I had any faith that this Congress, this President were going to \ndeal with the deficit, regardless of what happened with the debt \nceiling, then I wouldn't be interested in using the debt ceiling as a \ntool to force change in behavior in Washington, DC, but unfortunately I \nhave no faith that there are enough people here who care enough about \nthe deficit to do something about it unless we are forced to do so.\n  At the moment, the only tool I have is to insist we use this \nopportunity, in which we are requested to raise the debt ceiling, to \nchange the course our country is on in regard to spending and deficits. \nAgain, the argument may be by some it is irresponsible. In fact, I have \nheard so many times that all we are doing is authorizing the borrowing \nof money to pay for the things we have already encumbered.\n  Wouldn't it seem a better solution for us to quit encumbering over \ntime rather than coming after the fact and saying let's raise the debt \nceiling? But the reality apparently is there is no will to do that. We \ncan say it is irresponsible not to raise the debt ceiling. We can say \nwe are only paying for the things we have already decided to spend \nmoney on, but if that is the only thing we say, we never take it to the \nnecessary step of doing anything about the problem.\n  It is irresponsible not to use this opportunity to force us to behave \nin ways that are good for the country today, that are economically \nsolid and sound, that are morally correct. Borrowing money ad infinitum \nis not an option for this country under either economic or moral \ncircumstances.\n  It is irresponsible for us to once again decide we will try to solve \nthis problem later. I have always thought that the most important \npolitical issue we face, the one that has been most important to the \ncountry since I was elected to the Senate, was how do we make certain \nthat the economy is growing, there are job opportunities, people feel \nsecure in their employment, they have the opportunity to advance their \ncareers, and they have the sense that they are saving for their kids' \neducation, that they are saving for their own retirement. This issue of \nthe fiscal condition of our country inhibits the ability for that \neconomic security to be available to Americans.\n  I wish to conclude by saying we need to do what is responsible. What \nis responsible is making certain we pay our way and that we don't \nexpect others to do so in the future. To only say that we have to reach \nthis agreement in order to avoid greater challenges in our country is \nto walk away from something that I think is a primary and important \nresponsibility of Congress and the President. It is unfortunate.\n  In my time and service in the Senate, President Obama has been the \nPresident, but I have seen no political will on the part of this \nadministration to do anything about the long-term consequences of \nspending more money\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\nthan we have. That means we have no choice but to insist that something \nbe done, and the only opportunity before us is this question of whether \nthe debt ceiling should be raised without corresponding reductions in \nspending.\n  In my view, those reductions in spending take priority. It is \nimportant. Our primary responsibility as American citizens, as an \nAmerican citizen, not just as a U.S. Senator but all of us as American \ncitizens--we have a responsibility to do two things for the future of \nour country: protect and preserve the freedoms and liberties guaranteed \nby our Constitution and make sure the American dream is alive and well \nso future Americans have the chance to pursue their dreams in this \ncountry.\n  To continue to borrow money to put our country's fiscal condition in \njeopardy once again means we will have failed that responsibility \nbecause the spending and borrowing of money inhibits our personal \nliberties and freedoms and reduces economic opportunity, the American \ndream for all Americans.\n  I will vote no.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                               Equal Pay\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to respond to the minority \nleader's earlier comments today regarding equal pay. Pay discrimination \nis wrong. It is also illegal. Republicans and Democrats alike believe \nthat violations of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act should be \npunished to the full extent of the law.\n  Let me be crystal clear. The lack of consensus on proposals like the \nPaycheck Fairness Act does not mean that Republicans do not support the \nprinciple of equal pay. I am tired of hearing that Republicans don't \nhave any new ideas on this issue.\n  I have offered legislation, the Workplace Advancement Act, which \nwould prohibit retaliation against employees who discuss their wages. \nMy proposal has a strong record of success, and unlike other proposals \nout there, it has bipartisan support.\n  In April of 2014, before Republicans had the majority, I, along with \nSenator Ayotte, Senator Collins, and Senator Murkowski, offered an \namendment to the Paycheck Fairness Act that would make it illegal to \nretaliate against employees for seeking or sharing information on their \nwages. Unfortunately, that amendment was not considered.\n  This March I offered a similar amendment to the budget that would \nreaffirm and strengthen equal pay laws and make it illegal to retaliate \nagainst employees for seeking or sharing information on their wages. \nThis nonretaliation measure was adopted to the budget resolution with \nbipartisan support. The legislative progress of my efforts to protect \nwomen in the workplace from retaliation for trying to ensure fairness \nin pay suggests a clear bipartisan way forward in this Chamber.\n  When women are fighting to be paid what they are worth, they need to \nknow what they are up against. Knowledge is power, especially in the \ncase of equal pay. Ensuring transparency will make it easier for \nworkers to recognize pay discrimination and ensure that they are being \npaid fairly. How can workers negotiate for fair pay when they don't \nknow how their industry or their employer compensates other workers? \nHow can a woman know that discrimination is taking place if she is \nprohibited from asking about what other workers are making?\n  I want to empower women to be their own best advocates, secure in the \nknowledge that they have every tool available to them as they negotiate \nfor the wages they deserve. It is time to remove this issue from our \nelection-year politics. Let's have a real conversation about a \nsubstantive policy change that will improve the lives of all workers. I \nhope the Senate will soon consider my legislation because I believe \nRepublicans and Democrats can come together on this issue and we can \nmake a real, needed difference in ensuring equal pay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, prior to being elected to the U.S. Senate, \nI spent 28 years in business. When you are in business, you know you \ncan't keep spending more money than you are taking in or you go broke, \nyou go out of business. I was elected to help get our country back on \ntrack and get the reckless spending and record debt of Washington, DC, \nunder control. In fact, the very first bill I introduced in the U.S. \nSenate was the Balanced Budget Accountability Act. It is pretty simple. \nIt requires that the Members of Congress pass a balanced budget or they \ndon't get paid. The people of Montana deserve real solutions to address \nthe failures of Washington, DC, not more budget gimmicks and backroom \ndeals. In fact, Montana's farmers will suffer because of this budget \ndeal. The crop insurance program was gutted as a way to make this deal \nwork. Where was the voice of Montana? Where was the voice of rural \nAmerica as this backroom deal was cut?\n\n  This deal takes our Nation in the wrong direction, and that is why I \nam voting no. This budget deal would increase our spending by $117 \nbillion over the next 2 years and raise the debt limit through 2017. \nHow big are these numbers? We are currently at about $18.1 trillion of \ndebt. By the end of this 2-year agreement, sometime in 2017, we will be \nabove $19 trillion. How big is 1 trillion? Do you know how long it \ntakes to count to 1 million? If we were to count to 1 million 1 digit \nper second, 24 by 7, it takes less than 30 days to count to 1 million.\n  How long does it take to count to 1 billion? To count to 1 billion \nwould take 32 years. Then the question is, How long would it take to \ncount to 1 trillion? We are throwing around these numbers without much \nsense of how big they truly are when we are talking about $18 \ntrillion--and soon to be $19 trillion--worth of debt. How long would it \ntake to count to $1 trillion? It would take 32,000 years.\n  It is irresponsible for Washington to increase the limit on the \nNation's credit card while at the same time busting the budget and \nincreasing government spending with the false promise of far-off \nsavings and new revenues that will never materialize. It is time that \nWashington, DC, takes a page out of Montana's playbook and stops \nspending more than we are taking in. It is time for commonsense \nsolutions that protect the taxpayer and make elected officials \naccountable for delivering results to the people they serve because \nAmericans deserve a thoughtful and open discussion, not one with \nbackroom deals, about how to best support the Nation's priorities while \nalso cutting wasteful spending and reining in this national debt. The \ncurrent budget fails to provide a more secure future for the next \ngeneration of Montanans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                    Environmental Protection Agency\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, back in August several western States \nand Indian tribes suffered an enormous environmental disaster. It has \nbeen called the Gold King Mine spill. In this disaster, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency spilled 3 million gallons of toxic \nwastewater into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado. This plume \nof toxic waste threatened people in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. It \nstretched to the land of the Navajo Nation and the southern Ute Indian \nTribes.\n  Last month, I chaired a hearing of the Indian Affairs Committee that \nlooked at the spill. The EPA was there to testify. The EPA claimed that \nit was taking full responsibility, and then it did everything it could \nto deflect actual blame. They said they were taking full \nresponsibility; then they did everything they could to deflect actual \nblame.\n  The agency administrator actually told our committee that this spill \nwas inevitable. She said it was ``inevitable.'' Does that sound like \nsomeone who is actually taking full responsibility?\n  Well, last week we got the results of the investigation by the \nDepartment of Interior about what actually happened at the Gold King \nMine. On Friday the Washington Post reported: ``EPA gets blame for mine \nspill into rivers.'' Well, according to this report, the EPA's crew \ndidn't take engineering into account when it was working on the mine. \nIt didn't take engineering into account. The agency didn't understand \nthat waters in these mines, according\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\nto the report, ``can create hydraulic forces similar to a dam.'' How \ncould the experts from the EPA, the U.S. Government's Environmental \nProtection Agency, not know that? The report also said that ``the \nconditions and actions that led to the Gold King Mine incident are not \nisolated or unique, and in fact are surprisingly prevalent.''\n  Remember, the EPA said it was inevitable. This spill was inevitable \nonly because the EPA is so inept, so negligent, and so incompetent that \nit was inevitable the agency would cause a disaster like this someday, \nand now they have. It is inevitable that the agency is going to keep \nmaking the same mistakes unless something changes at this \nirresponsible, incompetent agency.\n  What has changed? It has been almost 3 months since this disaster \nhappened. The Environmental Protection Agency has not named a single \nperson whom it is holding responsible for poisoning the river. If the \nEPA's incompetence is ``surprisingly prevalent,'' as the investigation \nfound, you would think that this agency should be trying to get its \nhouse in order before it takes on new jobs. That is not what the Obama \nadministration is doing. Oh, no, it is not slowing down at all. It is \nnot slowing down in its quest for power or in finding more ways that it \ncan control what people do.\n  On Friday, the Obama administration published the final rule for what \nit calls its Clean Power Plan. This regulation would create more \nWashington control over how electricity is produced across the country. \nThat very same day 26 States, including mine and that of the \nPresident's, filed lawsuits in Federal court to stop this disastrous \nrule. These States say that the Environmental Protection Agency went \nfar beyond anything that the law allows and far beyond anything \nCongress ever intended. I completely agree. This rule is too expensive, \nit is too extensive, and it is too extreme.\n  The EPA does have a job to do, and it is failing dramatically at its \njob. Instead of going back to basics and doing its job right, the EPA \nwants more power, more control, and less accountability. This so-called \nClean Power Plan will cost billions of dollars. According to one \nestimate, it will destroy the jobs of more than 125,000 Americans. None \nof that seems to matter to the President of the United States or his \nadministration and the EPA. They are driven by ideology, not by the \nfacts, and their ideology is driven by their desire for more control. \nThat is why it is so urgent that we focus our attention on all of the \nways this Washington bureaucracy is trying to restrict people's freedom \nand take more control for themselves.\n  The Obama administration isn't even satisfied telling States how to \nget their energy. Now the Obama administration wants to be involved in \nmaking these decisions for the whole world. It is trying to negotiate a \nclimate change treaty that will impose broad new limits on American \nenergy. This treaty will also do incredible damage to the American \neconomy. At the same time, the administration wants to pay billions of \nAmerican taxpayer dollars--hard-earned dollars--to other countries. In \nreturn for these other countries adopting green energy sources like \nsolar panels, the Obama administration will help prop up their \neconomies, not at their expense but at America's expense. It wants to \ndo all of this behind closed doors without any oversight from Congress \nor the American people.\n  The administration wants to make sure that nobody can do anything to \nstop it until after it is too late. It wants to tie the hands of the \nAmerican economy, dole out billions of taxpayer dollars, and not even \nask the American people if that is what they want. The U.S. Congress \ncannot stand for that. It is the wrong choice for America, and it is \nthe wrong choice for the rest of the world as well.\n  There was an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last Thursday by Bjorn \nLomborg. He is the director of a nonpartisan international group called \nthe Copenhagen Consensus Center. The headline is ``This Child Doesn't \nNeed a Solar Panel.'' It has a photo of a child in a slum in \nMozambique. The author points out that the Obama administration is \nwrongly focused on the kind of climate change payoff that the President \nis promoting.\n  In the op-ed he writes:\n\n       This effectively means telling the world's worst-off \n     people, suffering from tuberculosis, malaria, or \n     malnutrition, that what they really need isn't medicine, \n     mosquito nets, or micronutrients, but a solar panel. It is \n     terrible news.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       In a world in which malnourishment continues to claim at \n     least 1.4 million children's lives each year, 1.2 billion \n     people live in extreme poverty, and 2.6 billion lack clean \n     drinking water and sanitation, this growing emphasis on \n     climate aid is immoral.\n\n  That is the assessment coming out of the Copenhagen Consensus Center. \nThe President's actions are immoral. There are some very real dangers \nfacing the United States and other countries today, such as the threat \nfrom global terrorists and from countries like Russia, Iran, and North \nKorea. There are desperate humanitarian crises around the world. That \nis where the Obama administration should focus its foreign policy.\n  Here at home, the EPA should be cleaning up the environment, not \npoisoning America's rivers and lakes. Until the Obama administration \ngets its priorities straight, Congress will have to act to stop it.\n  Republicans have introduced legislation to block some of the \nadministration's most egregious new rules. Senator Ernst has filed a \nresolution against the so-called waters of the United States or the \nWOTUS rule. I have introduced legislation to replace the WOTUS rule \nwith one that actually protects waterways while preventing Washington's \ntakeover of nonnavigable waterways. Senator McConnell and Senator \nCapito have filed resolutions against the extreme limits on \npowerplants. Senator Flake has filed one on the burdensome new ozone \nstandard.\n  We are going to keep a spotlight on this administration as it \nnegotiates this new climate change treaty. We are going to stop it from \ncommitting this country to another bad deal--and the rest of us will be \npaying for that bad deal long after President Obama is out of office.\n  Congress is going to hold the Obama administration accountable--\naccountable--and rein in the Washington bureaucrats before they do \nadditional damage.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to express concern about the budget \ndeal that seems to have been reached that we will vote on later today \nor tomorrow morning.\n  This Senator has a broader concern that we simply aren't cutting \nspending and that we aren't holding to the budget agreements we made. \nWhat we are doing here is getting rid of or extending the budget caps \non the budget control agreement, spending about $80 billion more than \nwe would have otherwise.\n  We have told ourselves that we have offset this spending. Here is my \nconcern. It is clear that we haven't. Some of the so-called offsets are \nsimple budget gimmicks. Many have been tried and true in the past, such \nas just extending the sequester a little longer. One that is of \nparticular concern was raised earlier today. There is in this budget \nagreement a modest crop insurance savings provision. In farm bills over \nthe past few years, we have tried to rein in some of the massive \nsubsidies and waste that have gone on in terms of direct payments and \nsome of the other methods. A lot of that funding has gone toward crop \ninsurance, and it is quite a generous program. In fact, the taxpayer \nsubsidizes crop insurance on average of I think about 70 percent. \nSeventy percent of the premium is paid for by the taxpayers.\n  What we are doing in this agreement or what we have tried to do in \nprevious farm bills is say that the savings--if we reform these \nprograms through so-called standard reinsurance agreements, or SRAs, if \nwe realize some savings, than we plow those savings into the deficit or \nagainst the deficit. But what came out of the last farm bill was a \nprovision that said if there are any\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\nsavings in this program, they have to stay within the program.\n  Now, we don't have that type of provision in just about any other \nprogram of government, where if you realize some savings by reform, you \nhave to spend those savings on the program itself, just in another way. \nThat doesn't save the taxpayer any money overall.\n  In this case, we have tried to get those savings, but the farm bill \nsaid no, it had to be plowed back into the program. So the reform that \nwas agreed to in this budget deal was to do what we had been trying to \ndo--to make sure that any savings that result from a standard \nreinsurance agreement be plowed into or be put against the deficit to \nactually save some money.\n  There is also a small provision which set a target rate for crop \ninsurance companies at 8.9 percent rather than the 14.5 percent that it \nis currently at now. Opponents of this deal are saying that this minor \nchange will gut crop insurance. I don't think that is true at all. Crop \ninsurance is far from a suffering industry. It is a significant driver \nof the cost of our Nation's farm program.\n  Government costs for crop insurance have increased substantially over \nthe decades. In fact, after ranging from $2.1 billion to $3.9 billion \nduring fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2007, costs rose to a total of \n$14.1 billion by fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2013, the total costs \nwere $6 billion, and in fiscal year 2014, $8.7 billion. Taxpayers are \nfooting about 70 percent of the total costs of the program and 60 \npercent of all premiums paid.\n  This change would not impact the coverage that is received; it would \nsimply trim some of the profits. Some say that will drive crop \ninsurance out of business. I don't think so. There isn't a crisis here \nwhen taxpayers are footing 60 percent of the premiums and 70 percent of \nthe overall cost of the program. Typically, it is the type of program \nthe private sector would like to get into. If there is a problem with \npeople fleeing the program, it hasn't been demonstrated. This is not an \nindustry under siege; it is a industry which has seen dramatic \nexpansion and which now faces a slight trimming of its profits. Yet we \nare saying that we can't stand it. What we are saying is that we are \ngoing to undo that deal as part of the budget deal before we even vote \non the budget deal.\n  Earlier today on the floor, there was an agreement reached with the \nappropriators in the form of a colloquy that in the omnibus coming up \nin a couple of weeks, we would remove that provision, that savings of \nsome $4 billion or $8 billion would simply be made up somehow by \nextending the sequester.\n  This reminds me of the last budget agreement we had, the Ryan-Murray \nbudget, where there was a provision to very slightly adjust the cost-\nof-living increase for Active-Duty military retirees. This is something \nthat the military actually asked us to do because they wanted to take a \nportion of the savings and put them into other areas of the military, \nbut also it would realize a savings for us. This was a small adjustment \nfor just Active-Duty military retirees who retired before the age of \n62. If they made it all the way to 62, they could recover all the \nsavings that were there for the COLA adjustment.\n  Three months after the agreement, because of lobbying by one \nparticular small subset of those receiving these benefits, we reversed \nthat change. Just 3 months after we signed the deal, we reversed part \nof the deal.\n  In this case, what we are doing with the Crop Insurance Program is we \nare not even waiting 3 months after the deal. We are not having a \nseparate vote.\n  That vote, by the way, was 97 to 3 to reverse it, just because of \nsome lobbying against it. I was one of the three opposed to reversing \nthe program for the slight cuts.\n  But in this case, the Crop Insurance Program in this budget deal, we \naren't even waiting until the ink is dry. In fact, we aren't even \nwaiting until the ink is applied to the paper signing this deal. We are \nreversing this change before we even pass the deal. We are agreeing \nthat in the omnibus in a couple of weeks, we are going to reverse these \nsavings, we are going to reverse these offsets.\n  I had a lot of problems with this budget deal prior to today, but the \nmore I look at this and the more I learn, I don't know how we can vote \nfor this deal.\n  I don't know when we are going to get serious about our deficit and \nour overall debt. If we can't do it now, when will we do it? If we \ncan't get serious now, when are we going to get serious? If we have a \nbudget agreement with the BCA now and we can't stick to it now, what \nmakes us think we are going to in the future?\n  It makes me think, if we are reversing changes we made to get some \nsavings before we even have the deal signed, what are we going to do a \nmonth after? What are we going to do in the next month? Are there other \nprovisions in the other so-called offsets that we are going to address \nand say: We did not really mean it; we are going to reverse that as \nwell.\n  It is very discouraging to see what is happening with the budget. We \ncannot continue to simply spend, spend, and spend and just ignore the \nreal offsets that are needed. I would have been fine with spending \nadditional money on nondefense discretionary if we had been serious \nabout going into entitlement spending and the mandatory spending and \nfinding real savings, savings that were significant. We have a couple \nof reaches into mandatory spending but not significant reaches. Who \nknows whether they will last or whether we will reverse them as well in \na couple of months.\n  This is very discouraging. I will vote against this, and I would \nencourage my colleagues to vote against this agreement as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong opposition \nto the 2-year budget agreement before the Senate. This so-called budget \ndeal was negotiated at the last minute. It is now being rushed through \nCongress with inadequate time for proper scrutiny. While the devil is \ntypically in the details when Congress negotiates these eleventh-hour \ndeals, the flaws in this agreement are evident from merely taking a \nglance at what is in it.\n  This budget agreement would increase the current Budget Control Act \nspending caps, which we enacted in 2011 in an effort to restrain \nWashington spending, by approximately $80 billion or more over the next \n2 years. On top of raising the caps by $80 billion or more, this deal \nalso adds $32 billion in additional spending totals. That is $112 \nbillion in new spending over the next 2 years--yes, $112 billion in new \nspending over the next 2 years.\n  Not only would this agreement allow for increased spending, it would \nalso raise the debt ceiling through March of 2017--yes, through March \nof 2017--where we can borrow more money, adding an estimated $1.5 \ntrillion of borrowing.\n  President Obama has continually called for more government spending \nand a blank check, to raise our Nation's debt limit with no \ncorresponding reforms or spending cuts. The deal before us today \nrepresents a victory for President Obama and his liberal allies, not \nfor the American people. As long as Washington continues to spend far \nbeyond its means and remain on the same unsustainable track, our \neconomy will suffer.\n  While I believe we should safeguard the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States, I also believe we should do so in a manner that puts our \nNation on a more responsible fiscal path. We cannot--I repeat, we \ncannot continue to raise the debt limit without taking responsible \nsteps to tackle the underlying problems facing our Nation: wasteful \ngovernment spending.\n  Taking on more debt to facilitate more government spending is not the \nanswer and is simply unacceptable.\n  Hard-working Americans in Alabama and across the country are looking \nfor Washington to have serious conversations about how to tackle our \ncountry's $18 trillion debt that is growing. Instead, this deal before \nus continues the never-ending cycle of bad policies that grow our \nbloated government, impede job growth, and perpetuate a stagnant \neconomic recovery.\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\n  I believe our constituents deserve better than a last-minute, flawed \nbudget deal that not only exacerbates our debt crisis, but it adds more \nand more to our children's debt. There is absolutely no excuse for \ncontinuing to increase our Nation's debt. Americans are frustrated that \nCongress continues to push policies that empower Washington instead of \nthe people of this great country. This deal is more of the same. Borrow \nmore, spend more, be accountable less and less. That is why I adamantly \noppose this budget deal and will continue to fight for a smaller, more \neffective government that puts the American people first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I come to bring a very important subject \nto the attention of my colleagues.\n  ``Sequestration'' is just a fancy word for cuts, mindless cuts. That \nis why I have always opposed sequestration. This thoughtless, across-\nthe-board approach to the Federal budget has harmed States across the \ncountry, but its effect on Massachusetts has been disproportionate.\n\n  Sequestration significantly reduced Federal research and development \nfunding for science and medicine. That is Massachusetts. Investments in \nthose fields are critical to our economy with its world-class \nuniversities, medical centers, industry-leading bio- and high-tech \ncompanies, and clean-tech industries exploding with new technologies. \nThis is the future of our country. This is the future of the 21st \ncentury. This is what we must be investing in: research and technology, \nresearch and science.\n  I am pleased that for the next 2 years this budget agreement will \ngive us desperately needed relief from sequestration and will extend \nthe debt limit. This legislation will also protect vulnerable Americans \nwho rely on Medicare and Social Security. It will ensure that for the \nnext 7 years, millions who depend on the Social Security disability \nprogram do not face a benefit cut. The legislation will also help \nmillions of seniors by avoiding a Gronk-like spike in Medicare \npremiums. But this bill comes with a price: more unwanted calls and \ntexts to Americans.\n  Back in 1991, consumers were constantly harassed by unwanted \ntelemarketing phone calls that interrupted their family dinners. In \n1991, my bill, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, stopped these \nintrusive and unwanted calls from telemarketers.\n  Yes, this budget being debated today actually makes it easier to \nharass consumers on their mobile phones. That is wrong, just plain \nwrong. Current law contains important safeguards against abusive \npractices. Before a caller can make autodialed or prerecorded calls or \nsend texts, that caller must have the consent of whoever is being \ncalled.\n  Section 301 of this legislation before this body today removes that \nprecall consent requirement if someone is collecting debt owed to the \nFederal Government. The provision opens the door to potentially \nunwanted robocalls and texts to the cell phones of anyone with a \nstudent loan or a mortgage, calls to the cell phones of delinquent \ntaxpayers, calls to farmers, to veterans, or to anyone with debt backed \nby the Federal Government.\n  That is why, once the Senate takes action on this budget bill, I plan \nto file a bill that strikes that provision. I also intend to ask the \nmajority leader for a vote on my bill at the earliest possible time. We \nmust protect American students and consumers.\n  That rollback of protections against abusive telemarketers is not the \nonly problem with this legislation. The bill also would sell off part \nof our Nation's oil stockpile simply to raise revenue. The Presiding \nOfficer is an expert in this area. Our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is \nthere to protect American consumers and our security in the event of an \nemergency, but now it is increasingly viewed as a piggy bank to fund \nother priorities.\n  If we are going to sell oil from our strategic reserve, we should at \nleast do so strategically to get the best deal for our taxpayers, but \nthe budget deal that we are considering would require the sale of a \nspecific amount of oil each year from 2018 to 2025 regardless of its \nprice.\n  When the majority attempted to use similar Strategic Petroleum \nReserve sales to fund the highway bill, Senator Cassidy of Louisiana \nand I authored a bipartisan amendment to fix the problem. Our \ncommonsense amendment gave the Secretary of Energy flexibility to sell \nmore oil when prices are high and thereby maximize the return for \ntaxpayers.\n  Unfortunately, that bipartisan fix is not part of this legislation, \nbut I will continue to work with Senator Cassidy on this important \nissue. You know that we are right when a conservative Republican from \nLouisiana and a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts agree on an issue. \nIt is foolish to buy high and sell low. That is essentially what this \nlegislation is now mandating.\n  Rather than saying to the government that you have to find just the \nright time when the price of oil is high to sell it over the next 7 \nyears, it says sell it on this schedule regardless of whether or not \nyou are going to get a good return on your investment. That is not the \nway this government should be operated. We should be using some common \nsense, especially since the Senator from Louisiana and I had already \ndrafted the legislation and had already attached it to the \nTransportation bill when that was going to be the place where they use \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve money.\n  This is a very bad provision that is in a bill which is going to \npass--and it should pass--but this is a flaw. It is going to lose a lot \nof money if it continues on with the language that is in this bill.\n  I am going to continue to work with the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Louisiana, so that we can correct it. It will save a lot \nof money if we do it the correct way.\n  We need to ensure that we have a rational approach to budgeting--\nunlike sequestration--which will finally allow us to get back to the \nbusiness of legislating instead of lurching from crisis to crisis. That \nis not possible unless we begin a new era in this institution. \nHopefully, that is what today and perhaps tomorrow will represent. \nMaybe we can work together again across the aisle the way I think all \nAmericans want us to. I pledge to work on these two pieces of \nlegislation going forward to correct real flaws that are built into \nthis legislation.\n  Thank you for allowing me to have the floor at this time. I hope the \nPresiding Officer and I can partner to correct at least one of the \nproblems in this bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before we move to a vote on the Bipartisan \nBudget Act of 2015, I want to take a moment to discuss the part of the \nbill that is intended to be an offset for partially lifting the budget \ncaps established under the Budget Control Act.\n  Under current law, large partnerships are subject to a special set of \ntax procedural rules. They are known as the TEFRA partnership rules \nbecause they were included in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility \nAct of 1982.\n  These rules are complex and unwieldly for both the taxpayers and the \nInternal Revenue Service. Most tax experts agree that these rules are \nin bad need of reform. I agree.\n  The Treasury Department, former House Ways and Means Committee \nChairman Dave Camp, and Congressman Jim Renacci have all put forward \nreforms of the TEFRA partnership rules. And, on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, we have been looking at those reforms and other proposals as \nwell. We have also held discussions with the Ways and Means Committee, \nas well as tax professionals and members of the business community. \nThese efforts, so far, have been bipartisan.\n  Because any such reforms would have a significant impact on a large \nnumber of taxpayers, we were prepared to tackle this problem the same \nway the Finance Committee has dealt with other widely applicable tax \ncompliance measures. Specifically, we had planned to release various \ndiscussion drafts that would be open for public comment and subsequent \nmodification. That is the way the Finance Committee handled issues like \nstock basis reporting and\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\nmerchant credit card reporting, and the process has worked well in the \npast.\n  However, as these efforts were ongoing, bipartisan leaders from both \nthe House and Senate identified TEFRA partnership reforms as a \npotential offset for this budget legislation. As per usual, the Finance \nCommittee was consulted, and we provided assistance in drafting the \noffset language. I am pleased to say that many of our recommendations \nwere adopted in the final version of the bill.\n  However, for those who might be concerned about this process, it is \nimportant to note that the effective date for the TEFRA partnership \nreforms in the budget bill is delayed for 2 tax years. In the coming \nweeks and months, the Finance Committee will treat the TEFRA \npartnership reforms as a work in process. As planned, we intend to hear \ncomments and will be prepared to address issues raised by taxpayers, \nespecially those issues that may not have been anticipated.\n  As an example, we have heard from stakeholders who were concerned \nthat particular partner-level tax attributes that may be known by a \npartnership, such as certain passive losses under tax code section 469, \nshould be identified in the legislation for purposes of modifying the \nso-called imputed underpayment amount with respect to the partnership.\n  In sum, I want the record to be clear: The TEFRA partnership reforms \nare not effective for a couple of years. We plan to use that window to \nproperly address problems raised by affected parties.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for months, Democrats have called on \nRepublican leaders in both the Senate and the House to work with us to \navert the economic crisis that default would have wrought on this \ncountry. With our backs against the wall, congressional leaders and the \nWhite House have reached an agreement to not only raise the debt \nceiling--ensuring that our government can pay its bills--but to limit \nthe devastating impacts of sequestration for the next 2 years.\n  This agreement is far from perfect. This deal uses funding identified \nand supported by the Senate to extend the critical highway trust fund. \nThe trust fund has limped along, one short-term extension after \nanother, for far too long. Despite the progress made on advancing a 6-\nyear authorization, we will now have to move back to square one to find \na way to pay for it. I am as concerned now as I was in July that we are \nstealing from ourselves by selling off strategic oil preserves at a \ntime of low prices when we purchased at a time of high prices, and I am \ndeeply concerned that this deal raids the Crime Victims Fund of $1.5 \nbillion. Democrats and Republicans alike have long supported the Crime \nVictims Fund--unique in that it comes not from taxpayer dollars, but \nfrom penalties and fines paid by the criminals themselves. This fund \nwas set up to be a dedicated resource to help victims of crime. Given \nthe ongoing level of unmet need in that community, it is simply \nunacceptable that this fund was raided to pay for unrelated things. \nThis one-time rescission must not become a new precedent. We cannot \nturn our backs on the victims of crime.\n  Nonetheless, I support the Bipartisan Budget Act. It is the product \nof compromise that will offer a measure of stability and help pave the \nway for an omnibus appropriations bill to keep our government open past \nDecember 11. But this is only the first step. While we will avert a \ncalamitous default next week, we now must undertake the difficult \nprocess of crafting an omnibus spending bill that will meet our \nfinancial obligations and properly invest our resources. We have come \ntogether--across the aisle and across Congress--to support this budget \ndeal. Let's not squander those bipartisan efforts in the next phase by \nderailing the appropriations process with needless partisan policy \nriders intended to do nothing more than score political points.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to address a small but \nimportant aspect of the hospital outpatient policy that is included in \nthe budget agreement. The legislation does not address what happens to \noutpatient departments that are currently under construction. The bill \nallows current outpatient departments to continue to receive the \nMedicare outpatient payment rate because hospitals rely on those \npayments. Hospitals that want to build new facilities in the future go \nin with ``eyes open'' because they know they will not receive the \nhigher outpatient rate. But that is not the case for outpatient \ndepartments that are currently being constructed as we speak. These \nhospitals made the decision to build, understanding that these \nfacilities would receive the outpatient rate--they had no idea that \nCongress would be voting on this policy as part of this bill at this \nexact time. Facilities under construction should be treated the same as \ncurrent facilities. I think it is unfortunate that this was not \naddressed when the bill was drafted, and I hope my colleagues will join \nme in ensuring this issue is addressed, either through regulations or \nthrough a technical legislative fix.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. This is a credible \ncompromise that accomplishes three key objectives: it prevents an \neconomically catastrophic default, establishes 2 years of rational \nbudgets for defense and domestic priorities, and provides our military \nwith the resources they need without an overreliance on the emergency \nwar fund accounts.\n  Specifically, the agreement takes the threat of default off the table \nuntil March 2017 and provides $80 billion in sequester relief over the \nnext 2 years, evenly split between defense and domestic spending. \nThroughout this process to reach a budget agreement, I have urged my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to find a \nbalanced, responsible way to address defense and domestic spending--\nbecause they are both essential to the security and financial well-\nbeing of the American people. And while this bill relies on emergency \nwar fund accounts, it more accurately reflects the costs of our \noverseas military operations and provides the Department of Defense \nwith some additional budgetary stability and flexibility to plan for \nthe future. With the sequester relief that the bill provides, we will \nhave greater fiscal certainty and the additional resources we need to \nmaintain a strong defense and economy.\n  The bill also contains offsets that improve tax compliance among \nlarge partnerships and reforms federal crop insurance. These are the \nsorts of new revenue and spending cuts we should see more of instead of \nrevenue and spending cuts that come off the backs of seniors and the \nmiddle class.\n  Now, while I would prefer to eliminate the sequester all together, \nthis compromise sets an encouraging precedent for future sequester \nrelief, which is balanced and allows the government to keep making \ninvestments in areas that spur economic growth like education, \ntransportation, health care, and defense. And that is why it's \nimportant for the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to quickly \nreach a consensus and produce a detailed spending package before the \nexpiration of the continuing resolution on December 11.\n  I urge my colleagues to quickly approve this budget agreement and \nmove on to a bill to fund the government.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I want to speak about the compromise budget \nlegislation we are debating on the Senate floor. This is a good deal \nthat covers so many important topics: sequester relief for defense and \nnondefense accounts, the debt limit, Medicare premiums, Social Security \nDisability Insurance, and many more items. These are all items the \nSenate needed to address, and I am happy to support this bipartisan \nbudget accord.\n  In my 3 years in the Senate, I have done everything I can to address \nthe nonstrategic sequester cuts that have been hurting our national \nsecurity and economy. When I was sworn into the Senate and put on the \nBudget Committee, we were about to let go into effect the arbitrary \nsequester cuts set forth in the Budget Control Act of 2011. So in 2013, \nwe got to a bipartisan Murray-Ryan budget deal. I supported that deal \nbecause it provided sequester relief for 2 years and gave certainty to \nbusinesses and families, teachers and shipbuilders, around the \nCommonwealth and Nation to plan for their needs.\n  Since 2013, we have seen the uncertainty presented by short-term \nbudget deals and continuing resolutions has\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\nactually been shown to harm the economy. In addition, the world is a \nvery different place now than it was in 2011 when the Budget Control \nAct passed, and we need to adjust our budget policies to respond to \ntoday's challenges, from the rise of ISIL to increasing cyber attacks.\n  The deal before the Senate today provides more than $100 billion in \nsequester relief over 2 years for both defense and nondefense accounts, \nwhich will provide much-needed certainty to Virginia's families while \nhelping businesses and the defense community better plan for the \nfuture. It also prevents certain Medicare beneficiaries from \nexperiencing a significant increase in premiums next year and protects \ndisabled Americans from a potential 20 percent reduction in benefits. \nIt raises the debt ceiling, avoiding a default on our debt and disaster \nin financial markets. The agreement is not perfect. But that is the \nnature of compromise.\n  Everyone can find something in this bill they dislike, and that is \nusually the marker of an honest compromise. I wish we were able to \nfully replace sequestration and reach that long-term budget deal which \nwould fully replace sequester cuts, make Medicare and Social Security \nsolvent over the long term, and reform the Tax Code. But that budget \ndeal will take time to negotiate, and we face government debt default \nin less than a week. Given that reality, this compromise is a dramatic \nimprovement over a government debt default, across-the-board budget \ncuts, and crisis budgeting.\n  I especially applaud the fact that we will do a 2-year budget deal, \njust like we did when we reached the Murray-Ryan compromise in December \n2013. Two-year budgets provide certainty, and that has a significant \npositive impact on the economy. I came to the Senate a strong supporter \nof 2-year budgeting due to my experience as Governor, and it is good to \nsee others in Congress finally embracing this helpful reform. I support \nthis budget compromise and look forward to moving this bill to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, people in my home State are trying to \nfigure out what they missed on this budget deal. It was announced by \nthe White House today that this is a great job-creating achievement, \nbut all they see is more spending and no change in the status quo.\n  Everyone throws around numbers, but here is the one number people in \nmy State want to hear. How much does it save the American taxpayer? Put \nanother way, does it help us to balance our budget or to address the \ndebt problem?\n  We need two things to be able to balance our Federal budget: spending \nrestraint and a growing economy. Right now we have neither. We have \n$18.5 trillion in debt and over $430 billion in deficit in this year. \nTo start paying down our debt, we have to first balance our budget.\n  The Presiding Officer knows very well that we passed a budget earlier \nthis year that took the next 10 years to be able to balance our budget. \nLet's play pretend for a moment in this body. Let's say we put that \nbudget into place, and over the 10 years we work down a little bit each \nyear and get to a balanced budget 10 years from now. Let's take a guess \nin this body, and let's say the year after that we had a $50 billion \nsurplus. It took us 10 years to get back to balance, and in year 11 we \nhad a $50 billion surplus. How many years would we have to maintain a \n$50 billion surplus until we paid off our debt? The correct answer \nwould be: 360 years in a row we would have to have a $50 billion \nsurplus to pay off our debt. We need to start doing budgets that \nactually deal seriously with our debt and deficit.\n  Today, our GDP growth was announced again. It is a whopping 1.5-\npercent growth in the American economy. With new regulations on every \nbusiness, the assault on American energy, new loan restrictions on \nbanks, and ObamaCare cost increases--including in my State of Oklahoma, \nwhere premium increases are hitting 35 percent for next year on \nindividuals--people know inherently that if you keep overspending, it \nlimits our economic growth in America. We have fewer jobs because of \nit. It is harder to start a business because of it.\n  The President keeps saying if we will just spend a little more, we \nwill have more jobs. But people don't believe it anymore because they \nhave seen it is not true. After 6 years of ``if we just spend a little \nmore, spend a little more, this will get caught up'' we still have a \n1.5-percent growth rate in the American economy. That is pathetic.\n  While we have a great number of terrific people in the Federal \nworkforce, people inherently know if you just keep adding jobs in the \nFederal workforce, it hurts our economy because it continues to take \nmoney out of private hands and puts it into government control. What \npeople want is not unreasonable. They just want a plan. People want to \nknow that if we are going to spend money, we use it efficiently and \nthat there is a plan to be able to get us out of debt.\n  What we heard through the negotiations was that any increase in \nspending would be offset with pay-fors that were real. The spending \nnegotiations that were done were supposed to develop that plan. What we \nhave as a final document is not a plan to get us out of debt. In fact, \nit increases our debt again. What we have is not a plan to handle the \nlong-term consequences of deficit. In fact, it obfuscates that again. \nWe need a plan to deal with entitlements, and what we have done is just \nscratched the surface dealing with entitlements.\n  What I have heard over and over is that at least the pay-fors are \nreal, that for any increased spending that was done, at least there \nwere offsets for that. Let me give a couple of examples of these real \npay-fors, as I read the bill.\n  Here are a couple of real pay-fors. One is called pension payment \nacceleration. This is listed as one of the real pay-fors in the \ndocument. Pension payment acceleration in section 502 changed the due \ndate for pension premiums from October 15, 2025, to September 15, 2025, \nin order to get another $2.3 billion into the 10-year budget window.\n  You see, this is all laid out to say that in the next 10 years we \nwill pay this off. So they took a payment that was due 10 years and 2 \nweeks from now and moved it forward a month. So literally, yes, it adds \n$2.3 billion into the 10-year window, but if we had a 10-year-plus-2-\nweek time period, it would be exactly the same. It is actually zero \nsavings. It is not real. They moved the payment a month and said that \nis a pay-for. It is not a pay-for. That is the pension payment \nacceleration.\n  How about this one? We have this one in the Federal Government called \nthe Crime Victims Fund. The Crime Victims Fund is money seized from \ncriminals and designated not for general use but to compensate the \nvictims of crime--hence the name Crime Victims Fund. Apparently, this \nbudget agreement qualifies as a victim of crime because $1.5 billion is \ntaken from the Crime Victims Fund and dedicated not to victims of crime \nbut to spending in other areas.\n\n  We literally take $1.5 billion out of the Crime Victims Fund and \nspend it on the EPA, the IRS, and silent Shakespeare festivals out \nthere in Federal funding--so much for helping crime victims.\n  We have 12 appropriations bills we have done in the Senate. It is the \nfirst time in a very long time that the Committee on Appropriations has \ndone all 12 appropriations bills through committee. In this agreement, \nall 12 of those appropriations bills will have to be redone. Here is \nhow they will be redone. The defense bill will be cut, and the other 11 \nwill all go up in spending. The top of that debt ceiling is without \nreform.\n  The final straw for me in looking at this deal is Social Security \ndisability. The Presiding Officer knows full well I have worked for 3 \nyears on Social Security disability reform, knowing that the day was \ncoming when we would have to fix Social Security.\n  The CBO has warned us for 4 years that Social Security disability \nwould reach insolvency in 2016, so my office has spent the last 3 years \npreparing for\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\nhow we could actually reform this program to make sure we stabilize the \nSocial Security disability program. I have interviewed individuals \nwithin the disability program--attorneys that work with it, Federal \njudges, administrative law judges, representatives, Social Security \nstaff in all of those cubicles across the Social Security \nAdministration offices, advocacy groups, parents of the disabled, and \nwe held bipartisan hearings to look for common-ground solutions and \nworked with the inspector general and the GAO to hear other practical \nsolutions they had discovered. We have a long list of real solutions to \nsolving Social Security disability for the disabled and for the \ntaxpayer. We have submitted those solutions as an amendment to this \nbill because there are real answers to solving Social Security \ndisability, if you do the work. We have actually done the work to \nprepare for this.\n  Instead, this budget bill renews a few demonstration programs, \nchanges a few names, transfers some funds from retirement Social \nSecurity over to disability Social Security, and calls it reform. If \nyou look at the way the actuarial tables work out, of the 100 percent \nthat needs to be done to bring solvency, they do 1.5 percent of what \nneeds to be done to bring the program to solvency. The estimate is 1.5 \npercent of the 100 percent that needs to be done, and it is called real \nsignificant disability reform. I wish it were, because it is \ndesperately needed.\n  Everyone knows this Congress only seems to do anything when they have \nto. A deadline is coming to deal with Social Security disability. This \nis the time we have to do the reforms. This opportunity will not come \naround again for 7 years, because this extends out this program for 7 \nyears with almost no reforms at all. We are missing our window.\n  These are the most vulnerable individuals in our society who are on \ndisability. These are individuals who literally cannot work in the \neconomy in any way, and they need our help and they need real reform in \nthis program, and we have punted. There is 1.5 percent of reform of the \n100 percent that is needed to actually stabilize the program.\n  What does real reform look like? It helps those stuck in the painful \nprocess of disability applications and gets them the help they need at \nthe time they need it. Real reform helps with those who game the system \nto get out of the system. It gives clarity, accountability, and \noversight to the system itself. That is what real reform would look \nlike.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. The grid--it is called a vocational \ngrid--which is used to determine if someone can work in the economy, \nhas not been updated since 1978. It needs to be updated not just now \nbut every 10 years in order to have a regular cycle of updating, and \nnot every 40 years. But that is not required in this bill.\n  We need to have good record keeping--evidence for disability. That is \nnot required in this bill. We need to have a standard to be able to \nrotate off disability and to bring some clarity to it. Right now it is \nmedical improvement. The problem is there are no good records often for \nthose individuals on disability. So there is no way to rotate off of \nit. An individual is permanently trapped in it because the records were \nso bad at the start. There is no change in that.\n  What does that look like in real life? Let me give a couple of real-\nlife examples. In Puerto Rico, the Office of the U.S. Attorney accepted \na case for prosecution about 4 years ago. The inspector general \ninitiated a Federal grand jury investigation, working closely with the \nOffice of the U.S. Attorney, the FBI, and the Puerto Rico Police \nDepartment. In August of 2013, 74 individuals, including 47 medical \nprofessionals and a nonattorney claimant representative, were indicted \nand arrested for their involvement in a large-scale disability fraud \nscheme.\n  On January 15, 2015, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico \nannounced the indictments of an additional 40 individuals, including a \npsychiatrist, for their alleged involvement in this conspiracy when \nthey undertook an early-morning arrest operation for those individuals. \nAll of these individuals were apprehended, and at the end they estimate \nthe cost to the taxpayer is $100 million of fraud in that one case \nalone.\n  In Huntington, WV, in May of this year, the Social Security \nAdministration mailed letters to approximately 1,500 individuals \ninforming them of their need to redetermine their eligibility for \nSocial Security disability--many of those individuals have been on \ndisability for years--because the Social Security Administration and \nthe Inspector General's Office noted that many of these individuals \nwere put on in a case that did not match facts with what actually \nhappened in their lives. They were led to believe this by a \nrepresentative, an attorney in this case, fraudulent work behind the \nscenes by physicians, and the inside work of individuals within Social \nSecurity who tracked them through the process. What happened? There \nwere hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud.\n  These things still continue. Nothing changes on this. I wish this \nbill would correct some of these issues today, but it doesn't. Those \nindividuals were told by someone that they fit into the disabled \ncategory, only to find out later that they had also been defrauded in \nthe system.\n  There is nothing in this bill mandating the Social Security \nAdministration to update its medical and vocational listings. There is \nnothing in this bill to prevent people who receive unemployment \ninsurance, who by definition must be employable, from also receiving \ndisability insurance--people who by definition cannot also work.\n  There is nothing in this bill to streamline the adjudication process \nor to eliminate the second level of appeal, which is called \nreconsideration. Many individuals within the process who are \nlegitimately disabled and who just want to have their cases heard get \nstuck in this long process. There are actually more appeals in Social \nSecurity Administration, in the Social Security disability program, \nthan there are on death row, which puts people in this cycle of endless \nappeals, year after year, and continues to rack up the cost to the \ntaxpayer and the effect on those who are disabled.\n  There is nothing in this bill to ensure that a claimant's medical \nrecord is well developed so that when they come up for a continuing \ndisability review, a disability determination service examiner can make \nan informed judgment and actually evaluate whether they are medically \nimproved.\n  There is nothing in this bill to conduct oversight of the \nadministrative law judges or claimants' representatives. The bill \nincreases the number of administrative law judges but not the \noversight. I am not sure if many in this body are aware that some of \nthe administrative law judges in this country have an overturn rate of \n95 percent or higher, and we are adding more but not increasing the \noversight.\n  There is no opportunity given for greater accountability or even to \nimprove the Code of Judicial Conduct--a basic element of reform that \nshould be in this.\n  As for the claimant representatives, according to the Social Security \nAdministration's Office of Inspector General, in tax year 2013, the top \n10 highest earning claimant representatives made $23 million. Remember \nthat the payment for the claimant representatives comes directly out of \nthe money that should go to the disabled individual, not from another \nfund. It is from the individual who should have received that money as \ndisability. So the more the reps make, the less tax money that actually \ngets to the disabled individual. There is no change in this model. It \ncontinues to provide funding for claimant representatives and attorneys \nand continues to leave the disabled exposed.\n  By the way, today in Social Security Administration offices all \naround the country, they are processing the money from the disabled and \nsending checks to the representatives because although the reps are \nhired by the disabled individual, they are paid and processed by the \nFederal workforce from the disabled person's money. We can do better \nthan this. We should do better than this.\n  This is not a deal the American people are looking for. This is not a \nbudget agreement the people of Oklahoma say fixes our debt and deficit \nissues and stabilizes disability. This is a deal that is done, \napparently, but not a deal that is done well. Based on where we are in \ndebt and deficit, we need to do better, and I pray we do in the days \nahead. We have much to get fixed. It is time to\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\nactually fix some things, not just to stay operational.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Free Exercise of Religion\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, there is a football coach in Washington \nState. He is the head coach of the JV team, and he is the assistant \ncoach of the varsity football team. Tonight is the last game of the \nseason for them, but he will not be coaching on the sidelines today \nbecause last night he was dismissed from his duties in Bremerton, WA. \nAccording to the attorneys at the school, he was dismissed from his \nduties because last Friday night at the football game, he had the \naudacity to kneel down at the end of the game and silently pray at the \n50-yard line when the game was over, when the school had instructed him \nthat he was not to silently pray at the end of a game.\n  Help me understand this. The night before the last game of the \nseason, they kick the football coach off the field because he had the \naudacity to silently pray when they told him not to.\n  To his defense, this is not brand new. Since 2008, this same coach, \nat the end of the games--each game--has had the habit of kneeling and \npraying at the 50-yard line after the kids have gone, after the game is \nover, to thank God for the safety of his kids. It is a habit he started \n7 years ago, but for some reason the Bremerton School District has \ndetermined this is completely unacceptable. Their perspective is that \nyou can only have faith if no one sees it. They have literally set a \nnew standard. What they are taking from the Borden case, which I will \nexplain in a moment--they are saying that if you are a school official, \nno one can see that you have faith because if anyone sees that you have \nfaith, they will take that as the establishment of religion from the \nschool district. That is a standard no court in America has set. That \nwould mean any individual who is Jewish couldn't wear a yarmulke if \nthey were also a teacher. That would mean anyone who is Muslim couldn't \nwear a head scarf because clearly that is a visual display of faith. \nThat would mean no teacher could bow their head and pray before their \nmeal in the school lunchroom. That would mean no football coach could \nkneel down with 5 seconds to go in the game in, the fourth quarter, \nbefore their 16-year-old is about to kick a field goal. They would say: \nNo, you can't kneel down and pray on the sidelines.\n  The absurdity of this is they set this brandnew standard that says \nyou cannot have anyone see you have faith. That would mean that in this \nsituation, this district has created a new legal standard that no one \nelse has ever agreed to, literally created in the school district a \nfaith-free zone, put up a sign on the front door that says ``No one can \nexpress any type of faith in this building.'' That is absurd.\n  The school district quoted multiple times from the Borden case, which \nis the Borden v. School District of the Township of East Brunswick \ncase. This is what the actual case was. It was a football coach who, \nbefore the game, at a mandatory meeting of the team, led them in a \nprayer. The only similarity here is prayer and football because this is \nnot a mandatory meeting before the game; this is not a required closed \ntime; this is an individual, after the game is over, kneeling down on \nhis own and freely expressing his faith without requiring anyone else \nto be there, anyone to listen. This is an individual living their \nfaith. That is free in America, whether you are Muslim, whether you are \nWiccan, whether you are Hindu, whether you are Christian, whether you \nare Jewish, whether you are a Federal employee or a State employee or a \nprivate citizen. Every individual retains their constitutional right to \nthe free exercise of their religion. Does that mean they can coerce \npeople or proselytize in that situation? No, it does not. The Court has \nbeen very clear on that. But that is not what this was. This is not a \nsituation where the coach was coercing his players to participate in a \nprayer or proselytizing his players while he was on school time. He was \nsimply kneeling down to pray, and for whatever strange reason the \nschool district has put him on paid administrative leave and has \nstarted the process of firing the coach.\n  I bring this up because it suddenly becomes a national issue when a \nschool district creates a new legal standard for every person of faith \nin America. Every person of faith in America has the right to live \ntheir faith. A school district does not have the right to say to \nsomeone: Your constitutional right ends here.\n  I can go through in great detail the different standards they leave \nout there, but their accommodation was this one simple thing: He could \nprivately pray in a room of the school district's choosing. If he \nwanted to pray, they would put him in a spot and say: You can pray in \nthere, in a place we pick, but you can't pray out there.\n  May I remind Americans that we do not have freedom of worship in \nAmerica; we have the free exercise of religion in America. The \ngovernment does not have the authority to confine your faith to the \nlocation of the government's choosing. A government entity like a \nschool district cannot say to an employee: You can only live your faith \nover there, where we pick.\n  I don't know what the school district is going to do in the days \nahead, but I know what Americans of all faiths and people of no faith \nshould do. They should rise up and say: We are a nation that protects \nthe free exercise of religion. And people who disagree with that coach \nshould rise up in the same way with people who agree because I can \nassure you--if they will silence a Christian who is silently praying on \nthe 50-yard line, I can assure you they will be after every other faith \nin the country and say: You can only practice your faith in the place \nof the government's choosing. That is not who we are.\n  Coach Joe Kennedy has the right to pray anywhere he wants to pray as \nlong as it doesn't interrupt his school responsibilities. I pray that \nthis school district and the attorneys who are trying to manufacture a \nnew requirement on people of faith will see that in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                Senior Airman Quinn Lamar Johnson-Harris\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute \nto one of the finest among us, a young man from Wisconsin whose service \nto his country was cut short by tragedy in Afghanistan.\n  SrA Quinn Lamar Johnson-Harris, a 21-year-old from Milwaukee, was \namong six airmen and five civilian passengers who lost their lives when \na C-130 crashed on takeoff from Jalalabad Airfield in Afghanistan \nearlier this month. Every one of those individuals was a grave loss to \nour country. Every one deserves to be remembered and revered before the \nSenate.\n  Today it is my solemn duty and particular honor to tell you about \nAirman Johnson-Harris. Quinn graduated from Homestead High School in \nMequon, WI, in 2012. The very next year, he joined the Air Force. It \nwas a foregone conclusion that he would serve his country long before \nthat, however. His grandfather served in Vietnam. His oldest brother, \nJeremy, is a proud marine. His other older brother, Lamar, graduated \nfrom West Point just last spring and is now proudly serving in the \nArmy.\n  His mother told the story about how her three sons--Quinn was only 2 \nyears old at the time--saluted at the grave of their grandfather and \nvowed to serve their country.\n  For men such as these, our Nation is eternally grateful.\n  Quinn went to rebuild houses in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina \nwhile he was still in school. Later one of his comrades, a sergeant who \nserved with him in the Air Force, said he was: ``the heart of the \nsquadron'' and that ``He was the best of us.''\n  For 239 years, our service men and women have guarded our freedom, \nmore than 42 million of them. Since the Revolutionary War, more than 1 \nmillion of those heroes have given their lives, including more than \n27,000 sons and daughters of Wisconsin. Now Airman Johnson-Harris has \nbeen added to that terrible toll. His brothers, his sister Fatia, his \nparents Yvette and LaMar, and all his family and friends grieve their \nloss. Our hearts go out to them, and we pray that they will find \ncomfort and peace.\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\n  I saw the grief of Airman Johnson-Harris's family this past weekend \nduring his funeral service at Christian Faith Fellowship Church in \nMilwaukee. I saw the respect they had for him and the honor granted him \nby a family who knows the meaning of earned honor. Quinn swore to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States, to put his \nlife on the line for the liberties we all enjoy. We must never take \nthat type of dedication for granted. We owe him the honor of taking our \nown corresponding oath of duty as seriously as he took his.\n  May God bless Airman Johnson-Harris's loved ones, may He guard all of \nthose in our Armed Forces who defend our Nation's liberty, and may God \nbless America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I spoke a few moments ago on the Senate \nfloor, and as I was leaving I was made aware of an article in which the \nminority leader, Senator Reid, was quoted. I wish to highlight \nsomething I want my colleagues to hear and know.\n  What the Senator from Nevada indicated was--the article begins: \nHaving secured their goal of getting a budget deal addressing the debt \nceiling and sequestration cuts, Democrats are now looking forward to \nthe appropriations process.\n  As an appropriator, so am I. I am interested for us to have the \nopportunity, if this budget agreement passes, to make decisions about \nthe priorities of spending within those budget numbers. What is so \ntroublesome to me is that the indication was that President Obama and \nDemocrats stand firm against efforts to target environmental \nregulations and other contentious riders.\n  I am quoting the Senator from Nevada:\n\n       We're holding hands with the president, we're all holding \n     hands. We are not going to deal with these vexatious riders. \n     We feel comfortable and confident. . . .''\n\n  He goes on to talk about the agreement.\n  This is a Congress that is supposed to deal with contentious and \nvexatious issues. Why does anyone have the opportunity to say it is off \nthe table? It happened in these budget agreements in which we were told \ndealing with mandatory spending is off the table. Yet it is one of the \nmost important issues we need to address, and you ought not start \nnegotiations by saying we are not even going to talk about an issue. In \nthis case, ``off the table, not subject to discussion'' is the issue of \ncontentious or environmental regulations.\n  Congress--Republican and Democratic Members--ought to care about the \npower of Congress that is granted to us by the Constitution in our \nrepresentation of the American people. We need the days in which the \nCongress and Members of Congress are not wedded to a Republican \nPresident or a Democratic President just because they happen to be \nRepublicans or Democrats. We need to make decisions based upon what is \ngood for the country, not whether we are backstopping a President who \nhappens to be a Member of our political party. Where are the Members of \nCongress who say congressional authority is the constitutional grant of \npower to act on behalf of Americans?\n  We need not only to establish priorities as a Congress when it comes \nto the spending process, but we need to make decisions when an agency \nor a department exceeds their authority, when they operate in ways that \nare contrary to what we believe is in the best interest of the country, \nin circumstances in which they are doing things that lack common sense. \nThe role of Congress is to direct the spending. It is granted to us by \nthe Constitution of the United States. We are saying that while we are \npleased we have a budget agreement, we will not stand for Congress \ndetermining whether the money can be spent in a certain way, whether it \ncan be prohibited from being spent in a certain way. We are taking \nvexatious riders off the table.\n  This is our responsibility. It is just as important for us to \ndetermine whether money should be spent at all as it is for us to \ndetermine how much money can be spent on a government program. It is \nparticularly true, I don't think there is any question but that this \nadministration has been the most active, many of us would consider \nacting in an unconstitutional way in the development of regulations, of \npolicies, of the bureaucracy of what the departments and agencies are \ndoing. This is an administration that cries out for congressional \noversight, not for someone who says it is not even on the table to be \nconsidered.\n  I would think Republicans and Democrats both ought to have an \ninterest in determining how money is spent as well as whether we should \ntell an agency, a department they can't spend that money at all. Many \nof my Democratic colleagues have indicated they support a number of \nriders, including ones that are considered environmental.\n  Waters of the United States is one that I have been told numerous \ntimes that my colleagues on the Democratic side of this Congress \nsupport the rider that is in the appropriations bill. Numerous times I \nhave been told that many Democrats support reining in the regulations \nthat are coming from the Department of Labor related to a fiduciary \nrule. Now we hear that vexatious environmental riders are off the \ntable. We ought not allow that to stand. It is not that I expect every \nrider that I am for to receive approval of Congress, but those votes \nought to be taken. That is our responsibility and majority rules.\n  Again, the circumstance we now find ourselves in, this is nothing \nthat we are even going to talk about. It is troublesome to me that \nthose of my colleagues who have expressed support for those riders--I \nguess I should explain to Kansans and to Americans, a rider is a \nprovision--language in the appropriations bill that oftentimes says no \nmoney can be spent to implement this idea, to implement this \nregulation.\n  It is an absolutely important responsibility for Congress. It is not \nunusual. It is not something outside the boundaries of what we are \nsupposed to be doing. It is absolutely a significant component of our \nresponsibility. Now those who claim they are for a rider, say the \nWaters of the United States or the fiduciary rule that the Department \nof Labor is promulgating--we have colleagues who say they are for that. \nNow they will be able to say: I am for it, but I never had a chance to \nvote on it because it was off the table.\n  I would again ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, don't \nfall into this trap in which we are here to support ad hoc, at every \ninstance, the executive branch just because they happen to be a Member \nof our political party. When there is a Republican President, I hope to \nabide by those same rules. I am here on behalf of Kansans and on behalf \nof Americans, not on behalf of an administration regardless of their \npolitical party, and we ought to demand that Congress do its work. We \nhad an election, the people of this country asked for something \ndifferent, and once again we are back in the circumstance in which no \nlonger are we able to move forward on legislation.\n\n  I assume by what the former majority leader is saying that when he \nsays it is off the table, he means there will not be 60 votes for us to \neven consider an omnibus bill in which those riders are included. Now, \nwhat I will say is that before long, we are going to be hearing about \nhow Republicans are interested in shutting down government because they \nwant these riders. Well, the reality is that the Senator from Nevada is \nindicating there is no discussion, and the blame ought not fall on \nthose of us who actually wanted Congress to work. The allegation of \nshutting down government ought to rest on those who say: We won't even \ndiscuss an appropriations bill that includes vexatious or contentious \nriders.\n  Who would want to be a Member of a Congress that is unwilling to deal \nwith contentious issues? It is our constitutional responsibility. The \nAmerican people ought to demand the opportunity for us to address \nissues of importance to them, and it ought not be off the table before \nthe conversation even begins.\n  Again, the point is that we have a constitutional responsibility that \nwe\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\nfailed to exercise. When the decisions are made, it is off the table. \nWe need a Congress that works, and we need a Congress that puts the \nAmerican people above defending a President, regardless of his or her \npolitical party.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n      Measure Discharged and Placed on the Calendar--S.J. Res. 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2159(i) and section \n601(b)(4) of Public Law 94-329, S.J. Res. 20 is discharged and placed \non the calendar, 45 days of the review period having elapsed.\n  Mr. MORAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nthe cloture vote on the House-passed budget and debt limit package will \noccur an hour after we reconvene, which is at 1 a.m. under the regular \norder. Once cloture is invoked, the Senate will remain in session and \non the message until we vote on passage.\n  Senators will be permitted for up to an hour to speak postcloture. \nThat is after 1 o'clock, under the rules. It is my hope that the debate \ntime will be extremely limited and that we will be able to move to a \npassage vote almost immediately after 1 a.m. The timing, however, is up \nto any individual Senator who claims debate time after the 1 a.m. vote.\n\n\n                  Orders For Friday, October 30, 2015\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its \nbusiness today, or at 11:55 p.m. today, whichever comes first, it \nadjourn until 12:01 a.m. on Friday, October 30; that following the \nprayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be \nreserved for their use later in the day; finally, that following leader \nremarks, the Senate resume consideration of the House message to \naccompany H.R. 1314, with the time until 1:01 a.m. equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           Order For Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So if there is no further business to come before the \nSenate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess subject to the \ncall of the Chair, following the remarks of Senator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Costs\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we are embarked on a significant \nbudget agreement that has as one of its components adjustments to \nAmerica's health care costs. In the case of this particular agreement, \nI support the adjustments that have been proposed--things such as \npreventing drug manufacturers from raising their costs higher than the \nrate of inflation. We have seen people come in and buy companies and \njack up the costs 10 times because they can. They haven't added any \nvalue to the products; they have just raised the costs. I support that. \nPaying hospitals the rate for physician practices that the physician \npractices were paid before the hospital bought them--nothing changed in \nthe physician practices; just ownership changed, and that shouldn't \nallow a windfall to the buyer. I think we have done well with what we \nhave done to reduce health care spending in this particular bill, but I \nrecall that in the sequester we did an across-the-board haircut right \nacross Medicare. Whatever you were being paid before, you got paid 98 \npercent of that afterward if you were a Medicare provider.\n  I want to come today to offer a thought that I hope can percolate a \nbit, and if we go back and look at those costs again I would like to \nget this thought into the conversation. The backdrop of this is the \nextraordinary increase of health care costs that we have seen more or \nless in my lifetime.\n  This chart shows 1960, and it is a $27 billion American expenditure \non total health care. Here it is in 2013, with $2.9 trillion, an \nincrease of more than 100 times over those years in what we spend on \nhealth care. And as we have done that, what we have done is we have \nbecome the most expensive per-capita health care country in the world--\nand not by a little but by a ton. Over at the far side of the chart is \nthe United Kingdom, then Germany, Japan, Switzerland, France, the \nNetherlands, and here is the United States. Again, this is 2013 data. \nWe are way above the most expensive competitors that we have. So there \nis something that can be done here with this excess cost, because \npeople aren't getting bad health care in Germany. They are not getting \nterrible health care in the United Kingdom. They are not suffering in \nJapan or Switzerland or France or the Netherlands. These are \ncompetitive systems with ours, but ours costs half again as much. There \nis a big target in savings here.\n  Here is another way of describing it. If you look at the cost and you \ncompare it to a quality measure, here the quality measure is life \nexpectancy in years, how long people can expect to live in these \ndifferent countries, and this is the same per-capita cost information I \nshowed in the last bar chart. What you see is that most of the \ncountries that we compete with are grouped right up in here, as shown \non this chart--Greece, Great Britain, Japan. Most of the EU is right in \nhere. As you run up the cost curve you get to Switzerland and the \nNetherlands. They are the two most expensive countries in the world in \nper-capita health care, not counting us. Look where we are. We are out \nhere. Our costs are about half again as much as the least efficient \nhealth care providers in the industrialized world. We are more \ninefficient by nearly a factor of a third than the least efficient \nhealth care providers in the industrialized world. That is not a prize \nwe want to own. We want to be able to move this back.\n  If you look at this gradient of life expectancy, we compare with \nChile and the Czech Republic. Where we want to be is up here. Where we \nare is here. So once again, it proves there is enormous room for \nimprovement in our health care system and we know that because other \ncountries are doing it. They can do it. Darn it, we ought to be able to \ndo it too.\n  Now we change the scope of this a little bit. This chart shows the \nAmerican health care system State by State. Each State is marked as one \nof the dots on this graph. This graph has the same thing across the \nbottom--Medicare spending per beneficiary. The last one was national \nspending, and this is Medicare spending per beneficiary. Here are the \nquality rankings of the States. There are a variety of quality \nrankings, and this assembles them into a consolidated quality rating.\n  What you see is that within the United States of America you have the \nStates. This goes back a bit. This is an old ranking that the Journal \nof the American Medical Association produced. It shows that there are \nsome States that were just under $5,000 per capita. They were doing \nsomething right. There are other States here, including an outlier, all \nthe way over to $8,000 per capita. But there is a bulk of States here \nthat run about $7,000 per capita. That is a $2,000-per-Medicare-\nrecipient difference between this group of States and that group of \nStates. That is interesting. Why is it that there is this big \ndifference?\n  Here is another interesting factor. Look who is doing better on \nquality--the States that spend less. The lesson from this is if you are \ndelivering high quality health care, you can deliver it less \nexpensively than if you are delivering low quality health care. At a \n$2,000-per-beneficiary increase in costs, these States are way at the \nbottom on quality compared to the others. The relationship between \nquality of the care people receive and the cost it takes to deliver it \nto them is reversed. This\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\nisn't like Lexus and Mercedes, where you pay more and you get a better \ncar. This is the opposite. You have a really crummy car and it costs \nmore to run it, it doesn't work, and it is expensive because it is not \nworking well. It is backward. It is interesting that way.\n  If you bring that forward, this shows a recent graph from the \nCommonwealth Fund that shows the same thing, overall quality score \nrelative to the U.S. median and costs in total Medicare spending. Here \nis the average right here for cost and the average for quality, and \nhere you have these States down here in the bad box. They are way out \nhere in costs. They are very expensive States. They are all above \naverage. Some of them here are way above average--25 percent above \naverage, 15 percent above average, 20 percent above average. Look what \ntheir quality measure is. They stink. They deliver terrible quality \nhealth care. Over here you have a bunch of other States that are way \nabove the quality median and at the same time they are way below the \ncost average. So the principle from that first graph back in 2000 still \nholds true, according to the Commonwealth Fund.\n  With that background, here is another way to describe it. These are \nthe 10 worst States in terms of highest cost per capita, and these are \nthe best 10 States. I know we have a country with 50 States. This is \nonly 20. We leave out the middle 30. These are the worst 10 in terms of \ncost, and these are the 10 best in terms of cost.\n  Here is the idea. Why should we be reimbursing above average the \nStates that have a per-capita cost above average, instead of the way we \ndid it on the sequester, by taking a 2-percent cut on everybody across \nthe board that nobody can do anything about--just a cold, wet blanket \nof funds denial? Why not look and say this is the most that a State \nwould get paid--whatever the cost would be--if it were at the average. \nThe rest, you just take it back per capita across the entire \nreimbursement for that State.\n  This is what would happen with these high cost States. The very next \nmeeting of the State medical society, the very next time the State met \nwith the Governor, the very next time the Medicaid program got \ntogether, they would be hollering, saying: What on Earth? I do a good \njob. I am going to get my reimbursement cut because of that?\n  No, we have to fix this. It would give them a massive incentive to \nstop behaving like this and start behaving like this. If we built in \nsome lead time so they had the chance to actually get there, they might \nactually never have to cut. They might not ever have to face that cut \nbecause what they would have done in the time leading up to when the \ncut was scheduled to be imposed is begin to behave like the States that \nhave lower costs than average.\n  We know this could be done because so many States are already doing \nit. Why would we ever again look at an across-the-board Medicare-\nprovider cut when we have an enormous discrepancy between these high-\ncost, low-quality States and these low-cost, high-quality States--like \nthis one all the way over here? Oh, my gosh, it is a bargain there; it \nis top quality care.\n  That is my point for the day. I hope that anybody listening who is \nlooking at the proposed cuts in the budget and who is looking at the \nneed to manage this exploding health care cost curve that America has \nhad for the last 50 years--steepening health care cost curve--starts to \nthink about ways to do not just dumb and bloody cuts, but smart cuts--\nsmart cuts that give the States that are costing us much more money \nthan their peers the inventive to actually start behaving like their \npeers and bring down the cost for everyone. That is what I would \nconsider to be a serious win-win.\n  I look forward to continuing this discussion. We have a couple of \nyears before we are going to face this again with any luck, but I think \nthis is an idea that is worth considering.\n  Once again, if you give the States enough warning within the 10-year \nbudget period so we can score it but with enough warning that they have \ngot the chance to react--I encourage anybody to read Atul Gawande's \nlast article about Texas. He wrote an article about the terrible cost \ndifferential between--I think it was El Paso and a town called McAllen, \nTX--huge. Then they brought in the ObamaCare affordable care \norganizations--accountable care organization models and down came the \nprice in McAllen.\n  So it can be done. We have seen it being done.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7643-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, for many months I have been speaking about \nwhat I call the Washington cartel. The Washington cartel consists of \ncareer politicians in both parties who get in bed with lobbyists and \nspecial interests in Washington and grow and grow and grow government. \nI believe the Washington cartel is the source of the volcanic \nfrustration Americans face across this country, and it is difficult to \nfind a better illustration of the Washington cartel than the charade we \nare engaged in this evening. This deal we are here to vote on is both \nshockingly bad on the merits and it is also a manifestation of the \nbipartisan corruption that suffuses Washington, DC.\n  What are the terms of this budget deal? Well, in short, what the \nHouse of Representatives has passed, and what the Senate is expected to \npass shortly, is a bill that adds $85 billion in spending increases--\n$85 billion to our national debt, $85 billion to your children and my \nchildren that they are somehow expected to pay. I don't know about your \nkids, but my girls don't have $85 billion lying around in their rooms.\n  This bill is put together in a way only Washington could love. The \nspending increases, when do they occur? Surprise to nobody, $37 billion \nin 2016, $36 billion in 2017, and $12 billion in 2018. But we were \ntold, fear not; there are some spending cuts to offset them. And \nwonderfully, miraculously, ostensibly there are supposed to be a few \nspending cuts in 2020, then 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. At the very \nend, 10 years from now--when my daughter Caroline will be getting ready \nto graduate high school, she is 7 now--we are told $33 billion will be \ncut in 2025.\n  If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn and I \nhave some beachfront property in Arizona. Nobody in this Chamber \nbelieves that. Nobody in the House of Representatives believes that. No \nmember of the press believes that. Everyone understands this is a lie. \nIt is an agreed-to lie by everyone. We will spend now for a promise \nthat 10 years hence we will magically cut spending that will never \never, ever occur.\n  That is on the face of it, but beyond that it is worth thinking about \njust how much $85 billion is. It is more than the Senate negotiated \nwith the House when Harry Reid was majority leader. When Harry Reid was \nmajority leader the Ryan-Murray budget agreement--which was a flawed \nagreement and an agreement I voted against--increased spending by $63 \nbillion over 2 years.\n  So what does it say that a supposedly Republican majority of the \nSenate negotiates a bigger spending bill than Harry Reid and the \nDemocrats? When Harry Reid and the Democrats were in charge of this \nbody they jacked up spending and our debt $63 billion. When the \nRepublicans take charge, whoo baby, we can do it better--some $85 \nbillion.\n  Not only that, this deal is not content with spending increases. It \nalso takes the debt ceiling and essentially hands President Obama a \nblank credit card. It says to the President: You can add whatever debt \nyou like for the remainder of your term with no constraint from this \nbody. We are abdicating any and all congressional authority over the \ndebt that is bankrupting our kids and grandkids.\n  Now the Presiding Officer and I both campaigned telling the citizens \nof Nebraska and the citizens of Texas that if we were elected we would \nfight with\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\nevery breath in our body to stop the spending and debt that is \nbankrupting our kids and grandkids. How, pray tell, does handing \nPresident Obama a blank credit card for the remainder of his tenure do \nanything to follow those commitments?\n  Let me note that for the remaining 15 months we are going to see a \nbinge from this President that makes the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years pale. \nFor 6\\1/2\\ years we have seen an assault on rule of law, an assault on \nour constitutional rights, a retreat from the world stage, all of which \nI think will pale compared to what is coming in the next 15 months. In \nthe next 15 months abroad, I have said before, we are essentially in a \nHobbesian state of nature, where the enemies of America have made the \njudgment that the Commander in Chief is not a credible threat, so they \nare limited only by the limits of their own strength. It is like ``Lord \nof the Flies.''\n  On the regulatory side, we are seeing a press on every front to go \nafter economic freedom--to destroy small businesses, to destroy jobs, \nto destroy our constitutional liberties. When it comes to spending, I \nshudder to think what President Obama for the next 15 months will do \nwith a blank credit card that the Republican majority in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Republican majority in the Senate are preparing \nto send him.\n  American Express has a whole series of credit cards. It has the green \ncard, the introductory card. I remember when I was a freshman in \ncollege--I was 17 years old. I got an application for an American \nExpress card. I was really excited. I got an AmEx when I was 17. It was \na green card. Now, if you spend more and you spend more, eventually you \ncan upgrade to a gold card, then you can upgrade to a platinum card, \nand then you can actually upgrade to a black card above that.\n  Well, I have to say, a multi-trillion-dollar Presidential card has to \nbe an extraordinary card. I assume it is encrusted in diamonds and \nglows in the dark. That is what the Republican majorities have just \ngiven President Obama--a diamond encrusted, glow-in-the-dark AmEx card, \nand it has a special feature. The President gets to spend it now, and \nthey do not even send him the bill. They send the bill to your kids and \nmy kids. It is a pretty nifty card. You don't have to pay for it. You \nget to spend it, and it is somebody else's problem.\n  Not only is this bill spending us deeper and deeper into a hole, it \nis chock-full of gimmicks. These are gimmicks that everyone writing \nthem knew were there. For example, it contains a spending gimmick that \ntargets single-employer pension plans while ignoring the oncoming union \nmulti-employer pension plan funding tsunami.\n  Beyond that, this bill also addresses ObamaCare. But what does it do? \nIt provides a targeted ObamaCare fix for big business--those with more \nthan 200 employees. By repealing the law's automatic enrollment \nprovision, which requires employers to automatically enroll new full-\ntime employees in one of the company's health plans unless the employee \nopts out.\n  What does it say that the Congress of the United States exists to \nprovide a special exemption for giant corporations but turns a blind \neye, turns a deaf ear to the small businesses being driven out of \nbusiness over and over and over again by ObamaCare? What does it say? \nIf you are a giant corporation in America, if you have armies of \nlobbyists, then fear not, the Washington cartel is here for you--a \nspecial carve-out, no doubt just as soon as you hand over your campaign \ncontribution.\n  For the small business we are facing a time unique in recorded \nhistory, where more small businesses are going out of business than are \nbeing created. For as long as they have kept records, that has never \nbeen true until recent years under the Obama economy. Why does that \nmatter? That matters because over two-thirds of all new jobs come from \nsmall businesses. When you hammer small businesses, you end up getting \nthe stagnation, the misery, the malaise we have right now. When you \nhammer small businesses, you have young people coming out of school who \ncan't find jobs, who have student loans up to their eyeballs but can't \nfind a job. When you hammer small businesses, you have people like my \nfather, who in the 1950s was a teenage immigrant washing dishes, unable \nto find a job.\n  What does it say that Congress will pass a special exemption for \ngiant corporations, but for the single moms, for the teenage \nimmigrants, for the young African-American teenagers struggling to \nachieve a better life there is no answer to their plight? To some 6 \nmillion Americans who had their health insurance canceled and their \ndoctors canceled because of ObamaCare, there is no answer to their \nplight. To the millions of Americans who have seen their health \ninsurance premiums skyrocket so they can no longer afford them, there \nis no answer to their plight. But fear not, the cartel is here for the \ngiant corporations.\n  Let us be abundantly clear. The cartel is not a partisan phenomenon. \nIt is not just the Democrats--although it is most assuredly the \nDemocrats--but there are far too many Republicans as well who are card-\ncarrying cartel members who, when the K Street lobbyists summon action, \nsnap to attention.\n  Look at what else this deal does. This deal additionally takes $150 \nbillion the next 3 years from the Social Security trust fund and moves \nit to the disability insurance fund. I would advise all Members of this \nbody the next time you are home and visiting with a senior, the next \ntime the topic of Social Security comes up, if you vote for this deal \ntonight, be sure to say: Ma'am, just so you know, I voted to take $150 \nbillion out of your Social Security. Because that is what they are \ndoing.\n  That is what they are doing. They are saying to seniors: Well, there \nis a little bit of money here, and we are going to take it and move it \nover here. Why? Because actually fixing the disability program, \nreforming the program would be too difficult. Stepping forward to \naddress the fraud in that program would be too difficult. Stepping \nforward to put in place work incentives to help people with \ndisabilities find meaningful work, even if it is not everything they \nare capable of--a great many people with disabilities are capable of \nmeaningful work--reforming that program to help people work to provide \nfor their families makes a difference in people's lives, but that isn't \neasy. That is hard work. That is actually what we were elected to \ndo. It is far easier just to raid the Social Security trust fund, far \neasier to pull $150 billion from our seniors and reallocate it and do \nnothing, zero, to fix the underlying problem.\n\n  The deal also sells 58 million barrels of oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. It is always interesting to see the Federal \nGovernment selling off Federal assets. I have argued for a long time \nthat we should be selling off Federal land, far too much of which in \nthis country is owned by the Federal Government. I am not talking about \nnational parks, which are a treasure that should be preserved; I am \ntalking about the vast amounts of land that are held, utterly \nnonproductive, by the Federal Government.\n  So it is a good thing that this bill is selling some assets, but it \nis interesting, No. 1, that they estimate that will yield $5 billion \nbecause they estimate it will be selling at $86 a barrel. I have to \nsay, representing the State of Texas, if you know how to sell oil today \nat $86 a barrel, you are truly a magician because it is selling at \nabout half that right now. But when it comes to budget trickery, just \nmake up a number and put it in there. As I said before, on this chart \neveryone knows it is a lie. Nobody believes it is true. It is a game. \nIt is the Washington game.\n  I would note that in selling 58 million barrels of oil, they are not \nusing that revenue to pay down our national debt. If they are actually \nselling assets, we would think it would go to something at home. If you \nsell an asset and have a massive credit card debt, the prudent thing to \ndo would be to use the revenue from that asset to pay down that credit \ncard debt. Oh, no. It is just more and more spending.\n  A group called the Conservative Action Project consists of the CEOs \nof over 100 organizations representing all of the major elements of the \nconservative movement, the economic, social, and national security \nconservatives. They sent a letter to this body. The letter reads as \nfollows:\n\n       The latest budget deal negotiated by the White House and \n     outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, the bipartisan Budget \n     Act of 2015, proposes increasing spending by $85 billion over \n     the next three fiscal years. What\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\n     the deal doesn't include are meaningful accountability \n     measures that ensure responsible spending levels.\n       The deal would allow Treasury unfettered borrowing power \n     until 2017 in exchange for theoretical budget cuts down the \n     road. The included offsets are spending gimmicks, at best. \n     According to budget analyses from the Congressional Budget \n     Office and The Heritage Foundation, the deal would result in \n     spending increase of $85 billion over the next three years, \n     while significant spending cuts would not take place for \n     another ten years--until 2025. Furthermore, we cannot \n     reasonably expect that a future Congress will abide by these \n     measures. Moreover, the busting of the caps presently is \n     proof that the gimmicks which promise reform later are \n     hollow.\n       This ``bipartisan deal'' indicates a dangerous trend that \n     has become commonplace in Washington--rather than hard \n     questions about spending, the Congress is choosing to \n     eliminate the possibility of those conversations or votes for \n     the next two years. Furthermore, the deal represents total \n     surrender on important conserve principles, while \n     capitulating to every demand of the White House.\n       It is this sort of irresponsible spending that has resulted \n     in a national debt of over 18 trillion dollars. For the first \n     time in nearly six years, Republicans have control of both \n     Houses of Congress and a real chance to send responsible \n     budget reforms to the President's desk. A responsible \n     alternative would acknowledge the importance of appropriating \n     funds for government operations while simultaneously \n     addressing our statutory debt limit and staying within the \n     budget caps.\n       Instead, lawmakers have forgone the chance at meaningful \n     reforms and instead are digging us deeper into the mire of \n     debt our nation has already accrued.\n       In potentially the most egregious portion of the deal, the \n     Overseas Contingency Operation or ``OCO'' fund, which is \n     dubious in and of itself, is typically designated for efforts \n     to support troops on the ground in emergency situations, is \n     turned over to a slush-fund for non-defense spending.\n       We oppose the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 not only \n     because it fails to curtail spending, but it prevents future \n     reform for an entire two years. Lawmakers should reject this \n     deal, and attach earnest, meaningful reform to any hike of \n     the debt limit.\n\n  It is signed by former Attorney General Edwin Meese, the Honorable \nBecky Norton Dunlop, and dozens of respected conservative leaders \nacross this country, across the full spectrum of the conservative \nmovement--across fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, national \nsecurity conservatives, all united, the conservative movement.\n  Many of the people who worked very hard to elect us to this body, \nmany of the people who worked very hard to give us a Republican \nmajority in the Senate are now all speaking in unison saying: What in \nthe heck are you doing? Some of them may be using stronger language \nthan that.\n  This bill we are voting on was not cooked up overnight. This wasn't a \nslap-dash on a Post-it last night. This represents days or weeks or \nmonths of negotiations. This represents the cartel in all of its glory \nbecause this is the combined work product of John Boehner and Nancy \nPelosi and Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid.\n  The entire time Republican leaders have been promising ``We are going \nto do something on the budget; we are going to rein in the President,'' \nthey have been in the backroom negotiating to fund every single thing \nPresident Obama did. I am reminded that it wasn't too long ago that we \nsaw El Chapo dug out of his prison cell. One of the first things you \nrealized when El Chapo was dug out is that tunnel wasn't dug overnight; \nthe drug cartels spent many weeks or months digging that tunnel. Well, \nour leadership, the leadership of the Washington cartel, has spent many \nweeks and months breaking El Chapo out on the American people, digging \nus deeper into debt. It is contrary to the promises our leaders have \nmade.\n  In August of 2014, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was quoted as \nsaying:\n\n       So in the House and Senate, we own the budget. So what does \n     that mean? That means that we can pass the spending bill. And \n     I assure you that in the spending bill, we will be pushing \n     back against this bureaucracy by doing what's called placing \n     riders in the bill. No money can be spent to do this or to do \n     that. We're going to go after them on healthcare, on \n     financial services, on the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     across the board. . . . All across the federal government, \n     we're going to go after them.\n\n  Let me ask, have we done any of that--any of that at all? Now wait, \nleadership might come back and say: Well, sure. We have appropriations \nbills. There are riders. But the Democrats are filibustering.\n  Everyone understands why the Democrats are filibustering \nappropriations bills. When Republican leadership begins the negotiation \nby peremptorily surrendering, by saying, ``We are going to fund \neverything, 100 percent of what you want,'' what rational Democrat \nwould ever agree to allow an appropriations bill to go forward?\n  I am reminded of a football game. In a football game, if the coach \ncomes out at the beginning of the game when the coin is being flipped \nand forfeits, we know the results in 100 percent of those games. In 100 \npercent of those games, that team will lose. Sadly, that team is the \nAmerican people because it is Republican leadership that goes out and \nforfeits at the coin toss over and over again.\n  That was in 2014.\n  In 2015, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed ``some big \nfights over funding the bureaucracy,'' saying that his party would use \nspending bills now being written in the GOP-controlled Congress to \nextract policy concessions from President Barack Obama. Where are those \npolicy concessions? Where are those fights? I don't recall seeing any \nfights. Actually, that is not fair. There are fights--fights against \nconservatives; fights against efforts to rein in the Obama \nadministration; fights against efforts to stop the spending; fights \nagainst efforts to turn around our debt. On that, Republican leadership \nfights ferociously. But where are the promised fights against the Obama \nagenda, on anything? Name one concession.\n  Let's go back to the substance of this deal. One of the things this \ndeal does is it utterly makes a mockery of the Budget Control Act. It \nabrogates the budget caps. It wasn't too long ago that Republican \nleadership was touting the Budget Control Act as one of the greatest \nsuccesses of Republican leadership. Indeed, when asked ``Well, why does \nit matter to have Republicans in control?'' typically the answer would \nbe ``Look at the Budget Control Act.''\n  Here is another quote from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell:\n\n       Politicians regularly come to Washington promising fiscal \n     responsibility, but too often they can't agree to cut \n     spending when it counts, and that is why the Budget Control \n     Act is such a big deal.\n\n  Mind you, a big deal that right now the Republican Congress is \nabrogating.\n\n       Since Congress passed the BCA with overwhelming bipartisan \n     majorities in 2011, Washington has actually reduced the level \n     of government spending for 2 years running. That is the first \n     time this has happened since the Korean war.\n\n  Leader McConnell continuing:\n\n       The BCA savings are such a big deal, in fact, that the \n     President campaigned on it endlessly in 2012.\n\n  Yet the lone fiscal accomplishment supposedly of the Republican \nmajority, this deal throws overboard. They didn't have much to point \nto, but they had this one: We have the budget caps. Guess what. We \ndon't have those either.\n  Then there is the debt ceiling. In 2011, then-Minority Leader Mitch \nMcConnell talked about what the debt ceiling should be used for. This \nis a quote from an op-ed he wrote:\n\n       What Republicans want is simple: We want to cut spending \n     now.\n\n  Does this do this? No.\n\n       We want to cap runaway spending in the future--\n\n  Does this do this? No--\n\n     and we want to save our entitlements and our country from \n     bankruptcy by requiring the nation to balance its budget.\n\n  Again, this does not do this.\n\n       We want to finally get our economy growing again at a pace \n     that will lead to significant job growth.\n\n  Well, surely there are some pro-growth measures in this. No.\n  That wasn't an isolated statement. Earlier in 2011, Leader McConnell \nexplained that ``no president--in the near future, maybe in the distant \nfuture--is going to be able to get the debt ceiling increased without a \nre-ignition of the same discussion of how do we cut spending and get \nAmerica headed in the right direction.'' That was 4 years ago.\n  Why is it that the Republican leadership is giving President Obama \ntrillions in more debt without any--let's go back to Leader McConnell's \nwords--``re-ignition of the same discussion of how do we cut spending \nand get\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nAmerica headed in the right direction''? That was a clear promise made \nto the American people, and this deal makes that promise a mockery. It \nmakes it an utter mockery. Instead, Republican leadership is taking the \nlead to remove the debt ceiling from Barack Obama. He will never have \nto worry about it again.\n  Why do these matter? Why do we have these fights? To understand why, \nwe have to understand the dynamics of Congress today.\n  In Congress today, there are essentially three types of spending \nbills. No. 1, there are show votes. Show votes are a particular \nfavorite of leadership. Show votes are anything, frankly, that men and \nwomen who are elected care about. They will tee up a show vote. We have \nhad show votes on Planned Parenthood. We have had show votes on the \nIran nuclear deal. We have had show votes on amnesty. Show votes are \ndesigned for all the Republicans to vote one way, all the Democrats to \nvote the other, and for us to lose. Show votes are a game of political \nposture.\n  Leadership is happy to give show votes. Frankly, leadership is irked \nthat the men and women who elected us are not satisfied with show votes \nanymore. There was a time when politicians in Washington could look \ndown at our constituents and say: They don't understand what is going \non. If we give them a show vote, they will be satisfied with that.\n  Well, a funny thing happened on the way to the floor: The electorate \nhas gotten much more sophisticated, much more educated, and much more \ninformed. With the advent of the Internet, with the advent of social \nmedia, people can now tell a show vote. A vote that is designed to lose \nfrom day one, that is an exercise in political theater, in Kabuki \ntheater, is not, in fact, honoring the commitments made to the men and \nwomen who elected us.\n  There is a second type of legislation which is simply a collective \nspending bill that pays off the Washington cartel, pays off the \nlobbyists, and that can often get bipartisan agreement. If you are \ngiving money to giant corporations, it is amazing how many Democrats \nand Republicans can come together to say: Hey, these corporations write \ncampaign checks; we are all for that. The pesky taxpayers don't know \nenough to fight against this. We can keep them in the dark, so let's \nkeep robbing the single moms waiting tables to take her paycheck and \ngive it to the giant corporation. That stinks. Do you want to know why \nAmerica is mad? That is it right there, the legalized looting that \noccurs in this city every day.\n  Then there is a third type of vote. That is the must-pass \nlegislation. I would note that this year in the Senate there are a \nnumber of Senate freshmen. Senate leadership has done what Senate \nleadership always does, which is wrap their arms around Senate freshmen \nand bring them into the bosom. One of the things I am hoping Senate \nfreshmen observe firsthand--I have not been here much longer than \nSenate freshmen, but one of the things you quickly realize is the only \nfights that have any chance of actually changing law, the only fights \nthat have any chance of actually changing policy are must-pass bills.\n  If you want to do more than a show vote, if you want to actually fix \na problem, if you want to actually address a wrong, you either fight on \nthe must-pass votes or you do nothing. Those are the choices. \nLeadership knows that must-pass votes are typically one of three \nthings: They are continuing resolutions, they are Omnibus \nappropriations bills, or they are debt ceiling increases.\n  If you look historically at how Congress has reined in a recalcitrant \nPresident, it has been through continuing resolutions, Omnibus \nappropriations, or debt ceiling increases. If leadership foreswears \nusing any of them, we will not use any must-pass legislation to do \nanything. Do you know what that means? That means Congress in the \nUnited States has become all but irrelevant. That is what leadership \nhas done.\n  It is all captured in one innocuous little statement: no shutdowns. \nThat is what leadership has promised. We are going to have no \nshutdowns. Listen, to most folks that sounds like a very reasonable \nproposition. In the private sector, you generally don't shut a business \ndown. Saying we are not going to shut things down seems very \ncommonsensical, but here is the problem. When you are dealing with \nzealots and when you are dealing with ideologues and you tell them if \nthey do the following, I will surrender--if you tell them ``if you say \nthe word `zucchini,' I will give in,'' we all know what will happen. \nImmediately they will begin saying ``zucchini, zucchini, zucchini.''\n  That is Washington today. Republican leadership in both Chambers has \ntold President Obama we will never ever allow a shutdown because, Lord \nknows, the last time we had a shutdown, it resulted in us winning nine \nSenate seats, taking control of the Senate, retiring Harry Reid as \nmajority leader, winning the largest majority in the House, and, \ngoodness gracious, we don't want that to happen again.\n  Once Republican leadership tells Obama we will never ever allow a \nshutdown, then suddenly the President has a little furry rabbit's foot \nin his pocket. On any issue, any fight, any topic that comes up \nwhatsoever, all the President has to do is whisper quietly in the wind \n``shutdown'' and Republican leadership runs to the hills. It is a \nwonderful negotiating tactic. Why is this happening? Because President \nObama whispered ``shutdown,'' and leadership said, ``We surrender.''\n  If you are not willing to fight on any must-pass legislation, we will \nnot win anything. Leadership responds, though, that it is not \nreasonable. You cannot win. You can never win a fight on must-pass \nlegislation.\n  The problem with that is history is to the contrary. As John Adams \nfamously said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' Of the last 55 times \nCongress has raised the debt ceiling, it has attached meaningful \nconditions to that 28 times. It has historically proven the most \neffective leverage Congress has.\n  When leadership says--and by the way, when press outlets echo \nleadership in saying that it is hopeless, nothing can be done, do not \nfight on these issues, they never seem to address the reality of \nhistory that is directly to the contrary. Gramm-Rudman, one of the most \nsignificant spending restraints in modern times, came from the debt \nceiling. If Congress wasn't willing to fight on the debt ceiling, you \nwould have no Gramm-Rudman. Yet leadership might respond: OK. Fine. \nHistorically that was true but not with Barack Obama, not with Harry \nReid. This current incarnation of Democrats--they are too partisan, \nthey are too extreme, they are too zealous, and it will never work with \nthem. The only problem is that is not true either.\n  Indeed, what we are talking about right now--the Budget Control Act--\ncame from the debt ceiling. The newly elected majority in the House of \nRepresentatives used the debt ceiling to extract the Budget Control Act \nfrom President Obama, which until just recently leadership hailed as \ntheir greatest fiscal success in modern times.\n  If the tool that yielded their greatest fiscal success was the debt \nceiling, why would leadership say we will never use it again? It is \nlike the San Francisco 49ers of great saying that we are never going to \nagain allow Joe Montana to throw to Jerry Rice. That worked too well--\nnever again.\n  If you discover a tool that works, who in their right mind would say \nwe will take off the field forever the tool that has proven most \nsuccessful in reining in the President? I don't know if anyone in their \nright mind would, but that is in fact what congressional Republican \nleadership has done. This debt ceiling is kicked down the road until \nthe end of the Obama Presidency.\n  I would note that when Speaker Boehner announced his resignation on \nthat day, I predicted this outcome. On that day, within minutes of \nSpeaker Boehner announcing his resignation, I stated publicly that what \nthis means is that he has cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to raise the \ndebt ceiling and to fund the entirety of Obama's agenda for the next 2 \nyears.\n\n  It was interesting. When I said that, there were those in the media \nwho criticized me: Oh, you don't know that. Why are you so cynical? Why \nwould you say such a thing?\n  I would say such a thing because I understand how the Washington \ncartel operates, how it is not two parties, but it is in fact one \nparty--the party of Washington. I mentioned that this deal\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\ntook months to negotiate. We are seeing the fruits of it right here. \nThis is exactly what I predicted the day John Boehner resigned. Why? \nBecause that then freed the Speaker to pass this through the House of \nRepresentatives. How many Democrats do you think voted for this? I will \ntell you. It was every single one of them. One hundred percent of House \nDemocrats who voted, voted for this, and 79 Republicans voted for it--a \nhandful, a small minority of Republicans. So how did this pass the \nHouse? With all the Democrats, House leadership, and a handful of \nRepublicans. How is it likely to pass this body? Every Democrat will \nvote for it. Republican leadership will vote for it, and they will get \nsome of the Republicans. That pattern--a lameduck Speaker of the House \ncutting a deal with a lameduck President to add $85 billion to our \nnational debt and to give away any and all leverage for the Obama \nadministration--that is what this deal means.\n  It is worth understanding. This deal means Republican majorities in \nCongress will extract nothing of significance from President Obama. \nThis deal means that Republican leadership has fully surrendered.\n  It is interesting. They call it clearing the decks. That is a \nuniquely Washington term. You recall back in December the trillion-\ndollar CRomnibus bill. The very first thing we did after winning \nmajority in both Houses was also called clearing the decks. Boy, these \ndecks need a lot of clearing. I have to say, these chairs get \nrearranged like they are on the deck of the Titanic, and no one \naddresses the fact that the ship of the United States is headed toward \nthe iceberg.\n  With $18 trillion in debt that the party of Washington, the \nWashington cartel, has created--and it is complicit and growing--the \nonly people losing are our kids and their kids and the future of this \ncountry and the future of the free world. That is all that is being \nlost. But, hey, there are cocktail parties in Washington this week. \nLobbyists are hosting them. They are writing checks.\n  If we actually stood up to that, that would be difficult. There is a \nreason so many politicians talk about standing up to Washington. Yet so \nfew actually do it because it is far easier to take the path of least \nresistance. It is far easier to go along to get along. It is far easier \nsimply to agree, to be agreeable, to get along. Why can't you get along \nwith the politicians who are bankrupting your children and my children? \nDo you know what? I don't make it a habit to acquiesce to people who \nare doing enormous damage to this country. That is what we are seeing.\n  What could have been done instead? Imagine a hypothetical. Imagine we \nhad Republican leadership that wanted to fight on something, on \nanything. For Pete's sake, at this point, I think most voters would \nsay: Give me something that matters and fight on that, whatever it is. \nThey are so frustrated. How can it be that we won majorities in both \nHouses and there is nothing, nothing that matters to the people that we \nare willing to fight on?\n  Do I think the continuing resolution or the debt ceiling could have \nmagically transformed this country? Do I think we could have done \nfundamental, wholesale reforms? Probably not. That would have taken \ntruly inspired leadership. That may be asking too much. If we couldn't \nhave solved every problem, is the alternative really that we could have \nsolved nothing? Is the alternative really that we had to give Obama \neverything and do nothing to fix the problems?\n  Let me suggest seven things this deal could have included. How about \nthe Default Prevention Act? It is legislation Pat Toomey introduced. He \nalso calls it the Full Faith and Credit Act. Every time we have a debt \nceiling fight, the Democrats scaremonger. They say: If you don't raise \nthe debt ceiling, America will default on its debt.\n  Let's be clear. That is a blatant lie. They know it is a lie. I will \nnote that when Barack Obama was Senator Obama, he voted against George \nW. Bush raising the debt ceiling. He said it was unpatriotic to raise \nthe debt ceiling. That is when the debt was about half of what it is \nnow.\n  Everyone who votes here later tonight, you should remember that \nSenator Obama said that if you are voting to raise this debt ceiling, \nwhat you are doing is unpatriotic. Those are the words of a young \nBarack Obama, but there is reason it is a lie. Every month's Federal \nrevenue is about $200 billion. Interest on the debt runs between $30 \nbillion and $40 billion a month, which means in any given month there \nare ample revenues to service the debt. No responsible President would \never allow a default on the debt. Indeed, what a responsible President \nshould do is stand up at the very outset and say: Let me be clear. \nUnder no circumstances will the United States ever, ever default on its \ndebt. That is what a responsible President would do. Sadly, that means \nthat is not what President Obama has done. Instead, what he does \nconsistently when we approach a debt ceiling is to threaten to default \non the debt if we don't give him a blank credit card.\n\n  What does the Default Prevention Act do? It says that in the event \nthe debt ceiling is not raised, we will always, always, always service \nour debt. We will never ever, ever, ever default on the debt. I \nrecognize that there are some skilled demagogues in Washington, but how \nexactly does the Democratic Party demagogue Republicans for risking a \ndefault on the debt in order to pass legislation preventing defaults on \nthe debt? That is some slick talking. But you know what. The Republican \nleadership didn't want to do that, because if we did that, then when we \nface the next debt ceiling, conservatives would expect us to say: OK, \nlet's use this leverage to fight for something, and they don't want to \nfight for something.\n  The Democratic scaremongering is useful because they are working to \nmeet the same priorities. If you pass the Default Prevention Act, then \nsuddenly some spines might stiffen and people might be prepared to \nfight, and that is a nightmare to leadership--that we would actually \nfight. So, no, no, no, no, we will not attach the Default Prevention \nAct.\n  How about another one--shutdowns? Senator Portman has legislation \npreventing government shutdowns. There is one promise that Republican \nleadership has made that is carved in stone, and that is that we will \nnever, ever, ever, ever allow a shutdown. So if there was anything on \nEarth to attach to this deal, it would be that. Senator Portman's \nlegislation says: In the event a continuing resolution isn't passed, in \nthe event that appropriations expire, funding will continue, but it \nwill gradually ratchet down slowly over time. If we pass that bill, \nthere will never ever, ever again be a government shutdown.\n  Gosh, if I listened to the rhetoric of leadership, I would think they \nwould want to pass that bill. Why isn't it in this? The answer is \nsimple: Because if it were in this, Members of this body would actually \nexpect us to stand up and fight for something. Instead, leadership \nwants to be able to tell the freshmen--the new Members of the Senate--\nthat a shutdown is terrible. It is the worst thing in the world. So we \ncan't fight for anything; so you must acquiesce in everything that \nObama wants. If we actually passed legislation prohibiting shutdowns, \nthat scaremongering would be taken off the table. Democrats don't want \nthat because Democrats support shutdowns.\n  If we look at the last shutdown over ObamaCare--revisionist history \naside, because the media loves doing revisionist history--Republicans \nvoted over and over and over to fund the government, and it was Harry \nReid and Barack Obama who shut down the government. Reporters scoff at \nthat when they hear it without ever acknowledging that Harry Reid very \npublicly said: Gosh, we think shutdowns help Democrats politically. Why \nis it a difficult proposition? If the leader of the Democratic Party \nsays that we think a shutdown is politically beneficial, why is it \ndifficult to understand that they are the ones forcing a shutdown? The \nlast thing Democrats want is to take shutdowns off the table.\n  The dirty little secret--the mendacity in this body--is that the \nRepublican leadership doesn't want that either. They don't want us \nstanding and resisting anything because it is not two parties; it is \none party.\n  What else could we have done? How about growth? Remember Mitch \nMcConnell's comments about economic growth? Why doesn't this bill have \na provision lifting the ban on\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\ncrude oil exports? That would produce economic growth across this \ncountry. It is a no-brainer economically. Is this in there? No. Did we \ntry? No. Maybe it was brought up behind closed doors, and the Democrats \nlaughed and said no and we surrendered. I don't know. It doesn't matter \nbecause leadership is not willing to fight for it. If you are not \nwilling to fight for it, it won't happen.\n  What else could we have done? We could have repealed the waters of \nthe United States rule, one of the most crushing rules that is \nhammering farmers and ranchers and poses an immense threat to jobs \nacross this country. By the way, there is even some bipartisan \nopposition to it in this body. But fear not, next week we have a show \nvote on the waters of the United States bill scheduled. Leadership is \nvery happy. We will have a show vote. We will get to vote, and it will \nfail.\n  Every farmer and rancher that is facing hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in costs because of this rule should rest assured that our show \nvote will allow us to pretend to be with them. Why not attach to this a \nprovision rescinding the waters of the United States? Because that \nwould actually prompt a fight.\n  How about another option on the spending side? How about putting in a \nwork requirement for welfare? In the mid-1990s, welfare reform was one \nof the most successful policy reforms in modern times. It moved \nmillions people off of welfare and into work, out of poverty and into \nthe middle class. It lifted their spirits, their hopes, their dreams. \nIt provided the dignity of work. It provided children with homes that \nwere more stable, had more future and more opportunity. We could have \nadded that to this. Is that here? No. Why? Because President Obama \nwould fight it. It is contrary to his big government agenda to expect \nanyone receiving welfare to work or look for work.\n  By the way, let me say as an aside, that you are not helping anyone \nwhen you make them dependent on government. You are not doing them a \nfavor when you sap them of the dignity and self-respect of going to \nwork. Arthur Brooks has a wonderful new book out. One of the things \nthat he talks about is the happiness that comes from going to work and \nworking hard, the dignity that comes from looking your kids in the eyes \nand having a job.\n\n  The Democrats are not helping the people they trap with dependency; \nthey are hurting them profoundly. I have said many times that when my \ndad was a teenage immigrant in the 1950s, washing dishes and making 50 \ncents an hour, and he couldn't speak English, thank God some well-\nmeaning liberal didn't come put his arm around him and say: Let me take \ncare of you. Let me make you dependent on government. Let me give you a \ncheck. Let me sap your dignity and self-respect. It would have been the \nmost destructive thing you could have done to my father.\n  We could have fought that fight. But did we do that? No.\n  What about adding a provision of Internet tax freedom--permanently? \nThe Internet will be tax free in perpetuity. I tried to bring that up \nnumerous times. The Democrats can be expected to routinely block it. \nWhy? Because they want to threaten taxing the Internet. That is some \nmoney. Ain't nothing politicians in Washington like more than a chance \nto get their grubby little hands on our dollars and our freedom.\n  How precisely did we lose this fight if in the course of this we \nsimply attached permanent Internet tax freedom to this fight? Are \nRepublicans really that lousy at political battle that we fear the \nPresident would shut down the government, blame us, and we would \ncollapse in ignominy because we fought for Internet tax freedom? Holy \ncow--if we are that bad at this, why are we doing this?\n  I have one other option. How about auditing the Federal Reserve? That \nis something else that has bipartisan support, something else that \nwould address the effects of debasing the currency. One of the effects \nof debasing the currency is seniors, people who saved their whole lives \nare seeing their savings devalue. They are people who are struggling \nand living paycheck to paycheck. Single moms are finding it harder and \nharder to make ends meet. Those are seven things we could have added to \nthis.\n  By the way, I would note that when leadership says, ``Gosh, you are \nbeing unrealistic to expect us to fight,'' I didn't say any one of \nthose is a must-have. I gave a choice of seven. Is it really the case \nthat we could have fought for nothing? Is that really the case? That is \nwhat leadership tells us. No, nothing pro-growth, nothing limiting \nspending, nothing addressing any of the promises we make--that is the \nposition of leadership.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues to name one thing President Obama is \nunhappy with regarding this deal. There is an old line that if it is a \ngood negotiation, both sides are unhappy, both sides will have given \nsomething. Name one thing that President Obama is unhappy with. What \ndid we get in return? Name one thing. The answers to both questions are \nexactly the same--nothing.\n  The fact is, President Obama has already told us what he thinks of \nthis deal. Just this week he stated: ``I'm pretty happy about the \nbudget deal because it reflects our values.'' Whose values are those? \nHe is right. This budget deal reflects the Obama values. Who negotiated \nthis budget deal? That would be Republican leadership. What does it say \nthat Republican leadership's budget deal gives President Obama \neverything he wants because it reflects Obama's values? This is why the \nAmerican people are so frustrated. We keep winning elections and \nnothing changes.\n  In 2009, we were told that if only you had a Republican majority in \nthe House of Representatives, then things would be different. We rose \nup, and millions of us in 2010 won a majority. And very little changed. \nThen we were told the problem was the Senate--Harry Reid and the \nSenate. If only we had a Republican majority in the Senate, then things \nwould be different. In 2014, millions of Americans rose up again, and \nwe won another historic tidal wave victory. We won nine Senate seats \nand retired Harry Reid as the majority leader. The Presiding Officer \nand I have been here 10 months. Is there one single accomplishment we \ncan point to that the Republican majority has given to the men and \nwomen who elected us? Mind you, there are things we have accomplished. \nIt just wasn't anything we promised the men and women back home.\n  One of the things I discovered as a freshman is how often leadership \nwould effectively pat you on the head and say: Now, son, that is what \nyou tell the folks back home. We don't actually do it. You don't expect \nus to actually do those things.\n  A few weeks back, I was meeting with a number of House Republicans. I \nsuggested to them to go back to their districts and convene a townhall \nand set up a whiteboard and just ask their constituents: What should be \nthe top priorities of Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress? \nMake a list. If you make a list of 20 things from your constituents--\nthe Presiding Officer is from Nebraska and I am from Texas--I guarantee \nyou that of those 20 things at least 18 of them will be nowhere on the \nleadership's priority list. They are simply not what majorities are \nendeavoring to do.\n  The second thing I suggested to the House Republicans was to go down \nto K Street and assemble the biggest lobbyists in Washington. Take out \nthat same whiteboard and ask them: What are your top priorities? Write \na list of 20 things, and 18 of them will be leadership's priorities. \nThat is the divide.\n  People ask me: Is it that leadership is unwilling to fight? Is it \nthat they are not very good? Do they not know how to fight? Sadly, it \nis worse than that. They know how to fight. They are actually quite \ncapable of it. They are willing to fight. It is whom they are fighting \nfor. Washington is working, but it is just not working for the American \npeople. It is working for the giant corporations, it is working for the \nlobbyists, and it is working for the rich and powerful. Six of the 10 \nwealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, DC. That \nis whom the Washington cartel works for. That is the basic divide.\n  Indeed, as we look back over the last 10 months, one is left with the \nconclusion--and a rather shocking conclusion--that Majority Leader \nMcConnell has proven to be the most effective\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\nDemocratic leader in modern times. Now, that is, in the parlance of \nWashington, a surprising statement.\n  Let's take a moment to review the statistics. Between January and \nSeptember 30 of this year, there have been a total of 269 rollcall \nvotes. In the same time period in the prior Congress under Harry Reid, \nthere were 211 rollcall votes. Let's look at the differences, and in \nparticular, I want to focus on the total number of times a majority of \nDemocrats voted aye, a majority of Republicans voted no, and the \nmeasure passed.\n  Now, if someone is an effective Democratic leader, you would expect \nthem to be able pass legislation when a majority of Democrats support \nit and a majority of Republicans oppose it. Indeed, if you are a \npartisan Democrat, that would be almost the definition of an effective \nDemocratic leader. Nineteen times in the last 9 months, this so-called \nRepublican majority has passed legislation and has had a vote succeed \nwhere a majority of Democrats supported it and a majority of \nRepublicans opposed it.\n  One example we can look to is DHS funding--funding for the Department \nof Homeland Security when President Obama issued his lawless and \nunconstitutional Executive amnesty.\n  Republicans across the country campaigned, promising to stop it. The \nPresiding Officer and I campaigned together in his home State of \nNebraska. I spent 2 months in the year 2014 campaigning with Republican \nSenate candidates all over this country. I think for those 2 months \nbefore that election I slept in my own bed about 5 days. Over and over \nagain, Republican Senate candidates said: If you give us a majority in \nthe Senate, we will stop this unconstitutional amnesty.\n  I have to tell my colleagues I shared with Republican leadership, How \nabout we honor that commitment. The response from leadership was, I \ndidn't say that. I can tell my colleagues Senate candidates across this \ncountry did because I was standing next to them when they said it.\n  What happened? When we voted, all 45 Democrats voted aye; 100 percent \nof them. That is impressive for a leader to get 100 percent unanimity \namong his party. Notice I said ``his party.'' There is a reason I said \nthat. Right now, sadly, the majority leader Mitch McConnell is the most \neffective Democratic leader we have seen in modern times. One hundred \npercent of the Democrats were united. How about Republicans? Well, 31 \nvoted no and 23 voted yes. So under this majority leader, the Democrats \nhad their way and a majority of Republicans lost.\n  Surely that is an outlier. Yes, the President was behaving lawlessly. \nYes, he was behaving unconstitutionally. Yes, indeed, he was behaving, \nin his own terms, like an emperor. Let me note calling a President an \nemperor, that is fairly overheated rhetoric, but it is not my rhetoric, \nit is President Obama's.\n  President Obama was asked by activists, could he decree amnesty \nunilaterally, and he said: I don't have the constitutional authority to \ndo so. I am not an emperor. Those are Barack Obama's words: I am not an \nemperor. Just months later, magically, that same power he said he \ndidn't have under the Constitution--just months before a Presidential \nelection--it materialized. Suddenly, the man who said ``I am not an \nemperor'' apparently became an emperor, in his own assessment. Yet what \ndid the Republican majority in the Senate do? It joined with 100 \npercent of the Democrats to overrule a majority of the Republicans in \nfunding President Obama's lawless amnesty, acting as an emperor.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both sat through a Republican lunch a \ncouple of weeks ago where our colleagues were quite puzzled why \napproval of the Republican majority is at such low levels. They \ncouldn't understand why right now Republicans in Congress have a 10-\npercent lower approval rating than we had in the middle of the \nshutdown. They were utterly befuddled by this. I am going to suggest a \nvery easy reason. When our leader acts like an effective Democratic \nleader, the people who elected us, their heads explode. Surely one \nmight say this is an isolated example.\n  Well, let's look at the next example, yet another example, the Bennet \nclimate change amendment. This climate change amendment said climate \nchange is real, it is manmade, it is a national security threat, and we \nneed to act to stop it. Listen, let me say something on global warming. \nI am the son of two mathematicians and scientists. I believe we should \nbe driven by the scientific evidence. Sadly, the far left is not \ninterested in science or evidence, they are interested in politics and \npolitical power. So when it comes to global warming, they do not want \nto confront the inconvenient truth, as Al Gore might put it, that the \nsatellite data demonstrates there has been no significant warming \nwhatsoever for 18 years. They get very angry when we point that out.\n  We had an amendment on that. How many Democrats voted for it? Oh, \nlook, again, 46, 100 percent, every single Democrat. How many \nRepublicans voted against it? Forty-seven and just seven Republicans \nvoted for it. Yet it passed.\n  That is an impressive victory for a Democratic leader. We just have \n46 Democrats. For a Democratic leader to get a win with just 46 \nDemocrats, that is impressive. That is what the current majority leader \ndid. He produced a win, ran over the wishes of 47 Republicans.\n  Let's use another example: a motion to waive the budget rules on H.R. \n2. This was the so-called doc fix. The doc fix has been a perennial \nchallenge in Congress. It is part of Medicare that assumed unreasonable \ncuts in doctor reimbursement rates. For a time, it served a purpose. It \nactually allowed Washington politicians to shake down the doctors \nelection after election after election to write checks. So for a time \nthe Washington cartel liked the doc fix, but it came time to get rid of \nit, and getting rid of it was a good thing. Here is the problem. When \nwe got rid of it, we didn't pay for it. We just put it on a credit \ncard. We didn't do the hard work of figuring out how to pay for it, we \njust accepted more debt. Well, but at least it is not that much more \ndebt. Well, unfortunately, it is. This so-called doc fix will spend \nmore than $200 billion and add more than $140 billion to our deficits \nover the first 10 years and more than $500 billion to our Nation's \ndeficits over 20 years--$500 billion. Look, even in the world of \nWashington, $500 billion is real money, but surely it is unreasonable \nto expect anyone to figure out how to pay for a doc fix.\n  It is interesting that since 2004 Congress has passed periodic doc \nfixes, and since 2004 doc fixes have been fully offset 94 percent of \nthe time--and 98 percent of the time if we count some of the budget \ngimmicks. If we count the gimmicks, it is 98 percent of the time. Just \nthis time, $500 billion, no, we are not going to offset that. We are \njust going to put it on the credit part. After all, Obama has a \nplatinum-encrusted, glow-in-the-dark AmEx. We will put it on your kids \nand my kids.\n  What does that irresponsible profligate spending do? Well, how many \nDemocrats voted for it? There is a surprise, every single one of them: \n46 Democrats. The Republicans: 29 Republicans vote no, 25 vote yes. \nNow, for a Democratic leader, what a great victory. A Democratic \nleader, with just 46 Democrats, added $500 billion in spending without \npaying for it. Holy cow. I don't recall Harry Reid ever being able to \ncampaign saying: Give me a Democratic majority and I will add $500 \nbillion in spending without paying for it. This is an accomplishment \nthe prior Democratic leader, Harry Reid, was not able to achieve. Yet \nthe current majority leader got this win for the Democrats.\n  Let's look at the next example: Confirmation of the Attorney General, \nLoretta Lynch. I serve on the Judiciary Committee. I participated in \nmultiple hearings where Ms. Lynch over and over again refused to \nacknowledge any limits on President Obama's authority whatsoever. When \nMs. Lynch was asked how she would differ from Eric Holder, who has been \nthe most lawless and partisan Attorney General this Nation has ever \nseen, she said: No way whatsoever. When pressed repeatedly if she could \narticulate even a single limit on the authority of this President, who \nhas since implicitly declared himself an emperor, she refused to \narticulate even a single limit. When asked if she would appoint an \nindependent prosecutor to investigate the IRS for wrongfully targeting \ncitizens because of their free speech, because of their political \nviews--mind you, something\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\nthat when Richard Nixon tried to do it, the career professionals at the \nIRS refused. Richard Nixon was rightly denounced in bipartisan terms \nfor attempting to use the IRS to target his political enemies. When the \nObama administration not only attempted but succeeded in doing so, no \none has been held to account. Instead, the Holder Justice Department, \nappointed and charged with the investigation a major Democratic donor \nwho has given over $6,000 to President Obama and the Democrats. There \nis a Yiddish word for that, ``chutzpah.'' When you appoint a major \nObama donor to be in charge of the investigation as to whether the \nObama administration is targeting the political opponents of the \nPresident, miraculous, miraculous, the results we just saw: a \nwhitewash, everyone was exonerated.\n  Mistakes were made, we were told. It was rather classic. They used \nthe same passive tense, passive voice as in the Watergate scandal: \nMistakes were made. Yes, mistakes were made. Well, Ms. Lynch told us, \nno, she would not appoint a special prosecutor.\n  Now, a number of Members of this body, a number of Republicans voted \nto confirm Eric Holder. That may or may not have been a mistake. I was \nnot here at that time. I did not have the opportunity to examine his \nrecord prior to his being appointed Attorney General. I can understand \nthose who voted yes. Prior to becoming Attorney General, Eric Holder \nhad built a reputation, by and large, as a law-and-order prosecutor, \nand so we can understand Senators who would believe that his tenure as \nU.S. attorney, his tenure as Deputy Attorney General might suggest he \nwould not be partisan in laws. With Ms. Lynch it was qualitatively \ndifferent. With Ms. Lynch she told us she would do the very same thing.\n  I suspect that quite a few people on this side of the aisle have \ngiven speeches about the IRS target. No one should be surprised the \nDepartment of Justice has now exonerated everyone, because, you know \nwhat, we confirmed the Attorney General who basically told us she would \ndo that. I would note, by the way, the majority leader had complete and \nunilateral authority. If we hadn't taken up this nomination, she would \nnot have been confirmed. Indeed, when President Obama put in place his \nillegal Executive amnesty, I publicly called on the soon-to-be majority \nleader. If the President violates the checks and balances of the \nConstitution, if the President usurps the authority of Congress, if the \nPresident ignores our immigration laws, then the majority leader should \nhave responded and said the Senate will not confirm any Obama nominees, \nexecutive or judicial, other than vital national security positions, \nunless and until the President rescinds his illegal amnesty.\n  Now, that would have been strong medicine, to be sure. That is a \nserious pushback. It happens to be an authority directly given to the \nCongress by the Constitution as a check and balance. How do we get an \nimperial Presidency? We get an imperial Presidency when the other \nbranches of the government lie down and hand over their authority. \nNothing prevented the majority leader from doing so, other than that \nviolates the norms of the Washington cartel, and so instead it was the \nmajority leader who brought this up for a vote. And what happened? \nSadly, there is no drama or suspense anymore in looking to what \nhappened. With the Democrats, all 46 Democrats voted to confirm Loretta \nLynch--all 46--and 34 Republicans voted no. Yet she is confirmed, and \nthe lawlessness continues at the Department of Justice.\n  I have to say for a Democratic leader, it is not clear to me Harry \nReid could have gotten this done. Harry Reid, in charge of this floor, \nwith just 46 Democrats, it is not clear to me at all he could have \ngotten this done, but I have to say, Leader McConnell has proven to be \na very effective Democratic leader. With just 46 Democrats, the outcome \nis exactly what Harry Reid and the Democrats would want.\n  Is this not a curious state of affairs? Why is a Republican majority \nleader fighting to accomplish the priorities of the Democratic \nminority?\n  We will look at one other example, the Export-Import Bank. Now, \nPresident Obama, when he was Senator Obama, described this as a classic \nexample of corporate welfare. Over $100 billion in taxpayer-funded loan \nguarantees going to a handful of giant corporations, predominantly. Yet \nas we talked about before, if there is one thing the Washington cartel \nis good at, it is corporate welfare. The Export-Import Bank, how many \nDemocrats? Here is a shot: Only 42 Democrats, not 100 percent. We had \none, I believe it was Bernie Sanders. I will commend Senator Sanders \nfor standing up against this corporate welfare. On that, he and I are \non exactly the same page. Yet 42 Democrats, just 22 Republicans in \nfavor of this corporate welfare; 28 Republicans voted no. Yet what \nhappens? It passes. Now, it is not at all clear that Harry Reid, as \nDemocratic leader with just 42 Democrats--it is not at all clear he \ncould have gotten this done, but Leader McConnell, once again, is a \nvery effective Democratic leader.\n  And I would note one of Speaker Boehner's parting farewells was to \ntee up the Export-Import Bank in the House of Representatives. It \nexpired this summer. We talked before about how the Budget Control Act \nwas one of the few victories Republican majorities could point to. \nActually, the expiration of the Ex-Im Bank is another one. An example \nof over $100 billion of taxpayer loan guarantees to a handful of giant \ncorporations, and it expired.\n  What does it say that in the period of 2 weeks Republican majorities \nin both Houses are working to undo not one but both of the only two \nmeaningful victories the Republican majorities have produced? And, mind \nyou, for the same reason--because the cartel demands it, because the \ngiant corporations want it, and because they want checks.\n  What does that say? What does that say, indeed. Well, if you want to \nknow what it says, we can look to the previous Democratic leader, Harry \nReid, who tweeted out:\n\n       I commend Senate majority leader for setting up a vote to \n     reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. This bill is critically \n     important for U.S. businesses.\n\n  Set aside how rich it is for the Democrats to be claiming to be \nfighting for U.S. businesses. Any time they say that, what they mean is \ncronies, because when Washington, particularly under the Obama \nadministration, fights for U.S. businesses, it is giant corporations \nand not the little guys. Over and over and over again it is those who \nemploy armies of lobbyists and lawyers and accountants who get favors \nfrom Washington, because when Washington is handing out favors, it \nempowers politicians. Ayn Rand wrote in ``Atlas Shrugged'' about how \nproductive members of society, business owners, would be forced to go \nto parasitical politicians--although some suggest that is a redundant \nphrase--to go to parasitical politicians on bended knee begging for \nspecial dispensation. When you are standing for business, it means \ngiant corporations that pay little to no taxes because they have tax \nloopholes carved in. It never means the mom and pop, it never means the \nlittle guy, it never means the Sabina Lovings of the world.\n  Who is Sabina Loving? Sabina Loving is a woman who testified before \nthe Senate in a hearing I chaired a couple of weeks ago. Sabina Loving \nis an African-American woman, a single mom who started a small tax \npreparation company on the South Side of Chicago. The Obama IRS put in \nplace new rules regulating tax preparation authority, rules for which \nthey had no legal authority. In fact, they used a statute called the \nDead Horse Act as their justification for regulating tax returns.\n  The Obama IRS regulation exempted lawyers, it exempted high-priced \naccountants, it exempted the rich and powerful, the giant accounting \nfirms, but Ms. Loving, who started this business on the South Side of \nChicago, was facing thousands of costs--costs she felt that would drive \nher out of business. Ms. Loving sued the IRS and Ms. Loving won. If you \nwant a historic and incredible story of a single mom standing up \nagainst Big Government and the lawless regulations of the Obama IRS--\nwell, you know what. Sabina Loving has no lobbyists in Washington. The \nWashington cartel doesn't listen to the Sabina Lovings. It listens to \nthe rich and powerful corporations that write checks to both parties \nbecause it is one party, the party of Washington. That is the sad \nreality of where we are.\n  You want to know why the American people are frustrated. You want to \nknow why they are ticked off. You\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\nwant to know why they cannot understand. It is not that we keep losing \nelections. That would be frustrating, but you could understand. We have \nto do a better job. We have to motivate people. We have to convince \npeople. We have to get a message that resonates. We keep winning and \nthe people we elect don't do what they said they would do.\n  By the way, to leave the Ex-Im Bank unauthorized all Congress had to \ndo was do nothing. If there is one thing the U.S. Congress is good at \ndoing, it is doing nothing.\n  Yet the phrase that gets repeated so often--Washington is broken--is \nactually not true. Washington is working. It is just not working for \nthe American people. It is working for the cartel, it is working for \nthe lobbyists, the giant corporations, and those with power and \ninfluence in the Obama administration. This deal is a classic example \nof the Washington cartel.\n  I would note, by the way, today we have a new Speaker of the House, \nPaul Ryan. I congratulate Paul Ryan on his speakership. I hope we see \nbold, principled leadership from the new Speaker. One of the things \nSpeaker Ryan articulated was the Ryan rule, that under Speaker Ryan \nthey would not bring to the floor of the House any bill that didn't \nhave majority support among the Republican conference.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer: Why doesn't Majority Leader Mitch \nMcConnell articulate a similar rule for the U.S. Senate? If the Ryan \nrule is good enough for the U.S. House, why is the Ryan rule not good \nenough for the U.S. Senate?\n  In every one of the examples I just gave were a majority of \nDemocrats--in fact typically unanimous Democrats--beat a majority of \nRepublicans. Every one of those would never have come to the floor if \nthe Senate followed the Ryan rule. How about that for a meaningful \nreform; that if the majority leader disputes the characterization that \nhe is the most effective Democratic leader modern times has seen, how \nabout the majority leader promulgate a similar rule to the Ryan rule, \nthat we will not bring to the Senate floor something that does not have \nmajority support from Republicans. That would be a sensible reform. \nSadly, I think the odds of it happening are not significant.\n  Here is the reality that the American people understand and it \nfrustrates them. The cartel is all one happy home. The lameduck Speaker \non his way out will no doubt land in a plush easy chair in the \nWashington cartel, will soon be making millions of dollars living off \nthe cartel. The lameduck President when he moves on, like Bill Clinton \nbefore him, will make hundreds of millions of dollars. The cartel \noperates as one. In the Senate we have one leadership team. It is the \nMcConnell-Reid leadership team, and in the House we have had the \nBoehner-Pelosi leadership team. They operate in complete harmony in \nWashington. That frustration is what is driving the growing and growing \nrage of the American people every day.\n  The truth is Republican leadership does not spend time thinking, How \ndo we beat President Obama? How do we beat Harry Reid? How do we beat \nNancy Pelosi? How do we change any of these disastrous policies that \nare hurting millions of Americans? Instead, leadership spends all their \ntime thinking, How do we beat the conservatives in the House? How do we \ncrush this freedom caucus--these crazy radicals who actually believe we \ndo what we said we would do. What a shocking, revolutionary, radical \nstatement for Washington, DC, that elected officials actually do what \nwe told our constituents we would do.\n  Republican leadership with recent deals on Planned Parenthood--\nRepublican leadership led the fight to fund Planned Parenthood. Indeed, \ntheir press team went to the press and said: Isn't it great, we boxed \nout conservatives. We played the procedural game so there was nothing \nconservatives could do to stop $500 million in taxpayer funding for \nPlanned Parenthood. What does it say when I said Majority Leader \nMcConnell is the most effective Democratic leader we have seen in \nmodern times? You know what. Harry Reid didn't spend that much time \nthinking about how to beat Republicans. Leader McConnell spends more \ntime focused on how to defeat conservatives than Harry Reid ever did. \nThat is the problem. It is our own leadership that cooks up deals.\n  Why do you think we are voting at 1 o'clock in the morning? Is that \nan accident? It is by design, 1 o'clock in the morning. Pay no \nattention to the man behind the curtain. Pay no attention to another \n$85 billion in debt. Pay no attention to the fact that it is the \nRepublican majority giving a blank credit card to Barack Obama. Votes \nat 1 in the morning, Republican leadership hopes no one notices, so \nright after we vote on it we can run out, get on planes, and fly home \nto our constituents, and say: We have to stop the debt.\n  I shudder to think for anyone standing too close to a politician who \nsays we have to stop the debt after voting for this, the lightning \nstrike that may hit them--the mendacity of this city.\n  Leadership always counsels prudence and reasonableness. How is it \nprudent to continue bankrupting this Nation? How is it prudent to have \ngone from $10 trillion to over $18 trillion in debt? How is it prudent \nto stay with languishing economic growth. From 2008 to today, the \neconomy has grown on average 1.2 percent a year. That is prudent? How \nis it prudent to watch as your children and my children's future is \nwashed away? How is that reasonable? How is that pragmatic?\n  Why are we not instead trying to fix these problems and not even just \nfix them all, not even solve everything with a perfect magical bow--\nbecause leadership plays this game: ``You can't let the perfect be the \nenemy of the good.'' Where is the good?\n  Leadership's position is we can't do anything. Leadership's position \nis that with Republican majorities in both Houses, we should spend \nmore--$85 billion--than we did with a Democratic majority, $63 billion. \nLeadership will harumph us about expectations. You shouldn't set \nunreasonable expectations. Gosh, it seems to me it was leadership who \nsaid if we had a Republican majority in the Senate then we would fight.\n  On what are we willing to fight? We may have some more show votes. By \nthe way, we just had a show vote on sanctuary cities and Kate's Law. \nWhy wasn't Kate's Law attached to this bill? Why wasn't sanctuary \ncities attached to this bill? Because that was something we actually \ncampaigned on and we promised our constituents and the Democrats \nwouldn't like that.\n  Remember my question: What in this is Barack Obama unhappy about? \nNothing. Because leadership's position is we can do nothing. If we can \ndo nothing then it makes one wonder what was all the fuss about winning \nthe majority?\n  I don't believe we can win every fight. I don't believe we can \nmagically transform everything--at least not without winning the \nPresidency--but surely the alternative is not we can do nothing. Is \nthere not a reasonable middle ground that we can accomplish something?\n  I would note the last time we had Republican majorities in Congress \nand a Democratic President was Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House \nand Bill Clinton as President. We accomplished a great deal. We \naccomplished welfare reform. We balanced the budget. What have these \nRepublican majorities done? Made the problem worse.\n  As a result, with apologies to the late great journalist Michael \nKelly, I want to sum up my views as simply saying I believe.\n  I believe. I believe what Republican leadership tells us. I believe \nthat every time the mainstream media echoes, leadership listens. Of \ncourse it is right that we cannot set expectations too high. We cannot \npromise too much. We cannot be expected to deliver on any of our \npromises.\n  I believed Republican leadership when they said if only we had a \nRepublican majority in the House, then we would stand and fight. After \nwinning the House in 2010, I believed the leadership, that if only we \nhad a Republican majority in the Senate also, then we would stand and \nfight.\n  Today I believe Republican leadership that if only we had 60 votes in \nthe Senate, then we would stand and fight. And if we were to get 60 \nvotes, I will believe Republican leadership when they tell us, that if \nonly we had 67 votes in the Senate, then we will finally stand up and \nfight.\n  I believe that there is no way Congress could do anything whatsoever \nto\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nstop ObamaCare or even to try to provide meaningful relief to millions \nwho are hurt by that failed law every day.\n  I believe that Congress has no power to do anything about the \nPresident's unconstitutional Executive amnesty or sanctuary cities or \nanything else that might secure our borders.\n  I believe that Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress can \ndo nothing meaningful on spending or the debt or tax reform or \nregulatory reform, that we can do nothing to rein in the EPA or CFPB, \nno matter how many millions of jobs they kill.\n  I believe that Congress must acquiesce to the Obama administration's \ndeclaring the Internet to be a regulated public utility and the \nadministration's attempt to give away control of the Internet to an \ninternational cartel of stakeholders, including Russia and China.\n  I believe that Congress can do nothing--absolutely nothing--to stop \nthis catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. Yes, it will send over $100 \nbillion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who chants ``Death to America'' in \nfront of mobs burning American and Israeli flags, and even though it \nthreatens the security of Israel and potentially the lives of millions \nof Americans.\n  I believe that Congress has the constitutional power of the purse, \nbut I believe Congress can still do nothing whatsoever to protect the \nAmerican citizens.\n  I believe that Congress can do nothing to protect religious liberty \nor free speech, that Congress must quietly accept an IRS that targets \ncitizens for exercising their constitutional rights and a President who \nignores Federal law and Federal judges who disregard the text of the \nConstitution.\n  I believed Republican leadership when they promised the American \npeople that if only we had congressional majorities, we would fight \nObamaCare and amnesty and lawlessness. And today, I believe Republican \nleadership when they say: Of course we cannot and will not do any of \nthat. It was unreasonable for anyone to have believed those promises in \nthe first place.\n  I believe that anytime President Obama threatens a shutdown, \nRepublican leadership is exactly right to surrender and fund all of \nObama's Big Government priorities, to fund ObamaCare and amnesty and \nPlanned Parenthood and the Iranian nuclear deal. Otherwise, Obama might \nshut down the government and it would be our fault. So we must do \nwhatever he demands no matter what.\n  I believe that it is unreasonable--radical even--to expect Congress \nto do any of the things we promised the voters on the campaign trail.\n  I believe that when a Republican Speaker joins with Nancy Pelosi and \nthe Democrats to fund all of Obama's priorities, that it is the \nRepublican Freedom Caucus who are the crazy ones saying we should stand \nfor something.\n  I believe that when the Republican Senate majority leader publicly \npromises there is no secret deal to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank \nand then 1 month later contorts procedural rules to force through the \ndeal that he had claimed did not exist, that it is not his public lie \nthat matters but, rather, it is the junior Senator who has violated \ndecorum by pointing it out, out loud.\n  I believe that the only thing we can expect Republican majorities to \ndo is expand government, reauthorize corporate welfare, and grow the \ndebt. That is called governing--always said one octave lower in \nWashington. Governing is measured by how many bills you pass, and one \ncannot govern without agreeing with Democrats across the board. If we \npass a lot of bills, even if they do nothing to address the debt or \nbring back jobs or economic growth and even if they actually expand \nWashington power and make the problem worse, then I believe we should \ncelebrate.\n  I believe that Democrats can never be forced to compromise on \nanything, that it is always unreasonable to ever try to win a political \nbattle with them, and so it must always be the Republicans who agree to \nthe Democrat's Big Government priorities. I believe the only way \nRepublicans can win is to continue making these same mistakes over and \nover and over again.\n  Of course, I do sometimes wonder why it matters if we have Republican \nmajorities in Congress. After all, leadership has told me that they \ncannot accomplish anything different from the Democrats, that it is an \nunreasonable demand to expect them to fight Obama on anything. Since it \nis only the crazy ``kamikaze caucus'' who thinks we can fight Obama on \nany issue, anything whatsoever, I believe that leadership is right to \nfight on nothing, to pass the very same bills filled with pork and \ncorporate welfare, the Export-Import Bank, ObamaCare funding, and \namnesty, and confirm the very same Attorney General the Democrats would \nhave confirmed.\n  I do wonder sometimes, as Hillary Clinton would have put it, what \ndifference does it make? But then I put aside such foolish thoughts. \nInstead, I believe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7652-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRUZ.

Mr. President, Republicans continue to object to requests \nfor unanimous consent on basic things we should be able to do in a \nbipartisan manner here in the Senate. In addition to my request about \ngender discrimination, Republicans have previously objected to \nunanimous consent requests to allow votes on noncontroversial judicial \nnominees with bipartisan support to fill vacancies in our Federal \njudiciary. These requests are not remotely controversial; yet the \nRepublicans continue to obstruct for obstruction's sake.\n  Since the Republicans took over in January, their leadership has \nallowed only nine judges to be confirmed. A few district court judges \nhave been confirmed in the last few weeks, but this recent increase in \nactivity is in sharp contrast to their inaction all year. When Senate \nDemocrats were in the majority during the last 2 years of the Bush \nPresidency, we had already confirmed 34 judges by this point--nearly \nfour times more judges than Republicans have confirmed this year.\n  Republicans have tried to justify their poor record by accusing \nSenate Democrats of scheduling votes for 11 judges during the lameduck \nsession last December. They suggest that those 11 confirmations under \nlast year's Democratic majority should somehow be counted towards this \nyear's confirmation numbers. First, it is well-established Senate \nprecedent to approve all pending consensus nominees before the end of a \nyear. And second, even if we did ignore reality and count these 11 \njudges towards the Republicans majority's record, that would only bring \ntheir count up to 20 confirmations this year. That is still far behind \nthe 34 nominees that Democrats confirmed in the last 2 years of the \nBush administration.\n  The glacial pace in which Republicans are currently confirming \nuncontroversial judicial nominees is a failure to carry out the \nSenate's constitutional duty of providing advice and consent. We should \nbe responding to the needs of our Federal judiciary so that, when hard-\nworking Americans seek justice, they do not encounter the lengthy \ndelays that they currently face today. Because of Republican \nobstruction, judicial vacancies have increased by more than 50 percent \nsince they took over the majority this January and caseloads are piling \nup in courts throughout the country.\n  We can and should take action right now to alleviate this problem by \nholding confirmation votes on the 16 judicial nominees pending on the \nfloor. A number of these pending nominees have the support of their \nRepublican Senators; yet they continue to languish on the calendar \nwithout a vote.\n  If Republican obstruction continues and if home State Senators cannot \npersuade the majority leader to schedule a vote for their nominees \nsoon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified nominees with \nRepublican support will be confirmed by the end of the year. These are \nnominees that members of the majority leader's own party want \nconfirmed, including several from Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Last \nweek,\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nwe had a hearing for two Iowa nominees. I expect they will be reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee soon. We also have nominees from \nMassachusetts, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Hawaii, \nand Maryland who are waiting for their confirmation hearings. None of \nthese nominees are likely to be confirmed by the end of the year if \nSenate Republicans continue at this historically slow pace.\n  I hope Republican Senators will implore their leadership to vote on \nthe pending judicial nominees without delay for the sake of the \nAmerican people who seek justice before those courts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7653-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       60TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and commend the \nNational Association of Social Workers, NASW, which is celebrating its \n60th anniversary this year. Today NASW is the largest membership \norganization of professional social workers in the world, with 130,000 \nmembers, including 3,500 in my home State of Maryland. As a social \nworker myself, I am proud to be a dues-paying, card-carrying member of \nNASW, and I congratulate them on 60 wonderful years.\n  In 1955, seven organizations had the vision to come together to form \nNASW in an effort to unify and strengthen the social work profession. \nThe visionary leaders of those organizations understood that we can \nachieve more when we work together.\n  And they have achieved so much. In the six decades since NASW's \nfounding, members have been on the front lines, advocating and \norganizing for just causes such as fighting for child welfare and \njuvenile justice, working to end poverty, and protecting victims of \ndomestic violence. NASW was directly involved in passing the Civil \nRights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the Violence Against Women Act \nand supported the creation of Medicaid and Medicare. I have seen the \nimportance of this work firsthand, as I began my own career as a social \nworker in Baltimore, helping at-risk children and educating seniors \nabout the Medicare program.\n  NASW has been there time and again, to help social workers do what \nthey do best--care for people at every stage and every age. Social \nworkers reach every part of our communities, from hospitals and mental \nhealth clinics to corporations and schools. Working every day and in \nevery way for others, social workers truly put service above \nthemselves. They meet people where they are--in their communities, in \ntheir homes, in their everyday lives.\n  I am so glad that NASW has been such a wonderful champion and \npartner, fighting to make sure social workers have what they need to \nmake a difference for countless people nationwide. From professional \ndevelopment, to ethics consultation, to publications on standards and \nchanging trends in the profession, NASW continues to make a difference \nin the social work profession as it reaches its 60 year mark.\n  Social workers do so much, and they deserve someone in their corner \nwho works as hard for them as they work for others. That is why I was \nproud to reintroduce the Social Work Reinvestment Act this year, which \nwould create a National Coordination Center for supporting and sharing \nthe good work and research that social workers are doing around the \ncountry. The bill also includes grant funding for education, training, \nand research; and it is going to help address the social worker \nshortage with better recruitment, retention, and compensation. Just \nthis month, I was also glad to be an original cosponsor of the \nImproving Access to Mental Health Act of 2015, which would help seniors \ngain access to vital mental health services provided by social workers \nthrough the Medicare Program.\n  Social workers constantly seek solutions that reduce economic \ninequality, racism, hunger, and all forms of discrimination. They also \nensure access to health care and mental health care for our Nation's \nmost vulnerable populations. For the past 60 years, NASW members have \ncleared paths to brighter days in America. And I am excited for what \nsocial workers and NASW will do in the next 60 years. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7653-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMEMBERING WWII VETERANS IN UMATILLA COUNTY, OREGON\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the honorable \nveterans and civilians of Umatilla County, OR, who worked tirelessly \nand fought valiantly for their community and country during the Second \nWorld War. These brave men and women served in a variety of capacities \non all fronts, working to support the war effort at home, defending our \ncoastlines from attack, and risking their lives in battle overseas. As \nthe country continues to mark the 70th anniversary of World War II this \nyear, I am proud to raise my voice to pay tribute to the men and women \nof Umatilla County for their part in the Allied victory.\n  Umatilla County played a unique and important role in helping our \ncountry achieve victory in World War II. In 1941, the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers created an airport in Pendleton, OR, which became home to \nthe U.S. Army Air Forces 17th Bombardment Group. Following the attack \non Pearl Harbor, the 17th Bombardment Group was called upon to defend \nthe west coast from Japanese submarines. The group's aircraft and many \nof its members participated in the daring Doolittle Raid on Tokyo--the \nfirst U.S. bombing of the Japanese homeland. All 80 of Jimmy \nDoolittle's raiders trained in Pendleton, and 5 of them were \nOregonians.\n  Umatilla County also played home to another facility vital to the war \neffort: the Umatilla Army Depot, located near Hermiston, OR. The \nUmatilla Army Depot was a repository for munitions and supplies in \nhundreds of semisubterranean silos. The depot created an economic boom \nfor Hermiston--then a town of 800--which ended up harboring 7,000 new \nworkers. The Umatilla County Depot became the largest munitions \nfacility in the world and stayed active in Hermiston until 2001.\n  Umatilla County lost 86 people during World War II, but their spirit \nand stories live on through their families and in their communities. \nOne of these men, SGT Modie L. Hubbard, even has a great nephew who now \nworks in my office. Sergeant Hubbard was killed in action, and his is \njust one of many stories of those fearless men and women who died \npreserving the freedom of future generations.\n  There is sometimes a temptation to focus on the massive scale of \nevents like World War II, on the number of tanks built or brigades in \nthe field. As we reflect on these and other aspects of America's war \neffort, I would encourage people to remember the communities across \nthis country--communities like Umatilla County--that built those tanks \nor provided those soldiers. It must be our responsibility to honor \nthese communities and their sacrifices to this great country, and it is \nmy hope that their stories will continue to live on and inspire future \ngenerations of Americans to service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7653-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7653-S7654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ALEX COLLIE\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the incredible \nservice of Alex Collie from Mackenzie, MT. Mr. Collie is the recipient \nof the National Weather Service's General Albert J. Myer award for \ncompleting 65 years of service as a cooperative weather observer.\n  The cooperative weather observers consists of 11,000 nationwide \nvolunteers who record official weather observations across the country. \nMr. Collie joins an elite group of cooperative weather observers and is \ncurrently the longest serving observer in Montana's history. \nNationally, only 16 others have served in Mr. Collie's capacity or 65 \nyears or longer. His services are critical to Montana--from supporting \nour farmers and ranchers by providing accurate forecasts and helping \nour truck drivers complete their routes safely and on schedule.\n  This prestigious award was established in honor of General Myer, who \nwas an observer at Eagle Pass, TX, and became the chief of the Signal \nService. In 1870, by a joint resolution of Congress and signed by \nPresident Ulysses S.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 40th \nanniversary of an important organization to southern Nevada, Las Vegas' \nLatin Chamber of Commerce. I am proud to honor this chamber that \ncontributes so much in support of Las Vegas' Hispanic business \ncommunity. As the premier Latin Chamber serving our Great State, it is \na key contributor to the success of Nevada. I am pleased to see the \nLatin Chamber of Commerce reach this significant milestone, continuing \nto serve as an important ally to Las Vegas' Hispanic community.\n  Without a doubt, the many Hispanic businesses, both small and large, \nlocated throughout the southern Nevada valley have greatly contributed \nto our State's achievements. With the help of the Latin Chamber of \nCommerce, Las Vegas' Hispanic business community has continued to grow \nand thrive, contributing to our State's economy. Even in difficult \neconomic times, the Latin Chamber of Commerce was there to support \nlocal Hispanic businesses and keep hard-working southern Nevada \nbusinessowners on their feet. The chamber has helped to cultivate a \nflourishing Hispanic business community through innovation, creativity, \nand ingenuity. The strong foundation it has built will be felt for \nyears to come.\n  Aside from helping local businesses expand, the Latin Chamber of \nCommerce also brings southern Nevada's Hispanic entrepreneurs unique \nopportunities. The chamber provides numerous networking events, \nincluding luncheons, leadership programs, and seminars. It also \nprioritizes Nevada's Hispanic youth by providing an academic \nscholarship program for students, which offers opportunities for those \nwishing to pursue higher education. Alongside this program, the Latin \nChamber of Commerce sponsors the Latino Youth Leadership Conference \nthat brings together students from high schools across Nevada to \nprovide them tools for a prosperous future.\n  I have attended multiple Latin Chamber of Commerce events where I \nhave spoken with the men and women who participate in this chamber, and \nI can attest to the incredible role they play within our community. \nSixteen members serve on the Board of Directors, bringing structure and \ndirection to this significant entity. I am thankful for their \nleadership and for the great things they are doing for businesses in \nsouthern Nevada.\n  For the past 40 years, Las Vegas' Latin Chamber of Commerce has \nproven its unwavering dedication to the great State of Nevada. The hard \nwork of those that have served this chamber has greatly contributed to \nthe excellent growth that we see in the city of Las Vegas today. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring the Latin Chamber of Commerce on \nits 40th anniversary and thanking it for all it does to make Nevada's \nbusiness community the best it can be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/29/senate-section/article/S7654-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3819.
