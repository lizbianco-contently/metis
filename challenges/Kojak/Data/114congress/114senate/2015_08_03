Mr. President, in just a few minutes, President Obama \nwill deliver another blow to the economy and to the middle class. He \nwill unveil regressive regulations that are set to harm struggling \nworkers and families. They are projected to cost literally billions. \nThey threaten to ship good middle-class jobs overseas and will likely \nmake it harder to maintain reliable sources of energy to meet demand. \nThey will also likely result in higher energy bills for those who can \nleast afford them, potentially raising electricity rates by double \ndigits for people I represent.\n  All of this, and for what? Not only will these massive regulations \nfail to meaningfully affect the global climate, but they could actually \nend up harming the environment by outsourcing the energy production to \ncountries with poorer environmental records like India and China.\n  They may also be illegal. That is why I wrote the Governors earlier \nthis year, suggesting they take a responsible wait-and-see approach and \nallow the courts to weigh in before subjecting their citizens to such \nunnecessary pain.\n  The Supreme Court's rebuke to the White House in June on another \nenvironmental regulation underlines the wisdom of this approach. Even \nthough that mercury regulation was ultimately tossed out, most of its \ndamage had already been done. It reminded Governors that it would be \nreckless not to take a wait-and-see approach this time.\n  Now, several Governors have already decided they will not allow the \nadministration to rush them into adopting these regulations, and I \nexpect more to follow. I was recently able to place language in the \nSenate Interior appropriations bill that would prohibit the \nadministration from arbitrarily imposing its will on States that take \nthis responsible approach.\n  Senator Capito also has a bill that would prohibit the regulations \nfrom moving forward until the courts have ruled on their legality. \nThese aren't the only legislative options Congress can consider. We can \npursue other avenues like CRA resolutions and further appropriations \nriders as these regulations are published and as they wind their way \nthrough the courts.\n  Here is the bottom line about today's announcement. If the Obama \nadministration were actually serious about advancing renewable energy, \nthen it would follow the example of what leaders like Senator Murkowski \nhave been achieving in the Energy Committee. She is showing how we can \nmake big strides on energy diversification and that we can do it in a \nbipartisan way and that we don't have to punish the middle class to do \nit.\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\n  This White House seems to want good politics, not good policy. \nOfficials in this administration have said they want to make \nelectricity rates skyrocket, and they want to make examples out of \npeople who get in the way. They are tired of having to work with the \nCongress the people elected. That is why the administration is now \ntrying to impose these deeply regressive regulations--regulations that \nmay be illegal, won't meaningfully impact the global environment, and \nwill likely harm middle and lower class Americans the most--by \nexecutive fiat. It represents a triumph of blind ideology over sound \npolicy and honest compassion.\n  In Kentucky, these regulations would likely mean fewer jobs, \nshuttered powerplants, and higher electricity costs for families and \nbusinesses. I am not going to sit by while the White House takes aim at \nthe lifeblood of our State's economy. I am going to keep doing \neverything I can to fight them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/03/senate-section/article/S6214-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the revelations we have seen from \nPlanned Parenthood are deeply disturbing. They raise fundamental \nquestions about what kind of society we want to be, so I want to thank \nSenators Ernst, Paul, Lankford, and a number of others, for accepting \nmy invitation to lead the effort on the Senate's response.\n  The legislation they worked to develop is all about restoring \nAmerica's commitment to care and to compassion. It would fund women's \nhealth, not Planned Parenthood, and we will take a vote to advance it \ntonight. Instead of subsidizing a political group, this bill would \nprotect Federal funding for health services for women. Instead of \nsubsidizing a political group, this bill would ensure funds continue to \nflow to community health centers and hospitals that provide more \ncomprehensive health services and may have many more facilities \nnationwide. Instead of subsidizing a political group, this bill would \nhelp women receive health services, such as screenings, prenatal and \npost-natal care, well-child care, diagnostic laboratory and radiology \nservices, immunizations, and other care they need. That is a true \ncommitment to women's health. That is real compassion.\n  I know Democrats have relied on Planned Parenthood as an ally \nrecently, but they must be moved by the horrifying images we have all \nseen. They must be shocked by the utter lack of compassion that has \nbeen on display. They must care about women's health as much as they \ncare about some scandal-plagued political organization. That is why \ntonight I am asking them to truly reflect on what is important. I am \nasking them not to block this funding for women's health just to \nprotect some political group mired in scandal. Women deserve better, \nand our country deserves better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/03/senate-section/article/S6214-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, here is an excerpt from an article in the \nRepublican leader's hometown newspaper, the Louisville Courier-Journal:\n\n       Sara Hall started going to Planned Parenthood when she was \n     in her late teens and needed birth control, and she's gotten \n     care there ever since.\n       Without them, ``I wouldn't have a doctor to see. I don't \n     know where I would have gone. It would have meant I wouldn't \n     get the care I needed.''\n\n  Like Sara, millions of American women depend on Planned Parenthood \nfor much needed health services. Every year, Planned Parenthood helps \nwomen, just like Sara, get the important services they need, such as \nbirth control measures, but it is more than just birth control.\n  Here are a few of the health services Planned Parenthood provides to \nAmerican women, and they did it, for example, in 2013. Half a million \nwomen went to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screening, 400,000 \nwomen received a cervical exam from Planned Parenthood's medical staff, \nand 4.5 million treatments and tests for sexually transmitted diseases \nand infections were performed. Yet, here we are once again, faced with \nanother Republican attempt to limit women's access to health care.\n  A few hours from now, the Senate will vote on a Republican bill to \ndefund Planned Parenthood. Let's understand what that vote means. \nDefunding Planned Parenthood would limit American women's access to \ncritical health services, such as contraception, breast and cancer \nscreenings, and well-women visits. This legislation is just another \nRepublican attack on the health care of millions of women, like Sara \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Over the past few months, Republicans have worked to trick American \nwomen into believing Republicans don't want to limit women's access to \ncontraceptives or other critical health services provided by Planned \nParenthood, but votes like the one we are going to take in a couple of \nhours lay bare the truth. The cold, hard fact is that a vote to defund \nPlanned Parenthood is a vote to limit women's access to cancer \nscreenings, contraceptives, and other important services that Planned \nParenthood provides.\n  Our Nation is already facing a shortage of primary care providers. \nFor many women, Planned Parenthood is their preferred medical provider. \nOne in five American women will go to Planned Parenthood for services \nat some time during their lives. Defunding Planned Parenthood and \nreducing the number of providers available for women to receive \ncontraceptives and other critical health services would reduce women's \naccess to good health, and more importantly, their access to care, \nwhich is very direct and to the point.\n  To put it another way, the demand for care would still exist, but \nthere would be fewer providers to render this care. And for many women, \nPlanned Parenthood may be the only provider where they can seek medical \nhelp. Republicans are trying to eliminate their access to health \ncenters.\n\n  Last Thursday, I listened to the senior Senator from Texas, where he \nclaimed this bill we are going to vote on soon would actually increase \naccess to care for women. I am surprised this distinguished Member of \nthe Senate, a longtime member of the Texas Supreme Court, would say \nsomething like that.\n  He and other Republicans believe, I guess, that clinics like \ncommunity health centers will pick up the slack should Planned \nParenthood be defunded. That is simply not true. I am a strong \nsupporter of community health centers. It is part of ObamaCare, the \nAffordable Care Act, because I believe in community health centers. We \nput billions of dollars in that bill, and during the years it has been \nin existence, it has done so much to provide help for community health \ncenters, but we still have far, far much to do. There are not enough \ncommunity health centers, even with what we have done, to increase \ntheir ability to meet the current demand. To throw in a few more women \nwho have been knocked out of Planned Parenthood--and ``a few'' is a \npejorative term; it would be millions of women--is wrong.\n  The director of women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation \nsays: ``Across the nation, Community health centers are already at \ncapacity.''\n  Take a look, for example, at the assistant Republican leader's home \nState of Texas. A recent report from George Washington University \ndetailed what it would take for other providers to replace Planned \nParenthood--exactly what the senior Senator from Texas has suggested.\n  For example, in Midland County, TX, there would have to be an \nincrease of 537 percent by non-Planned Parenthood clinics, if Planned \nParenthood is defunded. Lubbock County would see an increase of 250 \npercent. Community health centers cannot handle that, nor can they \nhandle that increase in heavily populated Dallas County, where it would \nbe an almost 200-percent increase.\n  What the Republican legislation does is makes it nearly impossible \nfor women who need medical attention to get the care they need. If \nwomen cannot go get health care from Planned Parenthood, where do they \ngo?\n  Take a look at what happened in the State of Indiana in 2011, when \nthat State's legislature voted to deny State funding for Planned \nParenthood health centers. Republicans then argued that\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\nother health care providers would bridge the gap and absorb Planned \nParenthood patients. They asserted that other providers would take care \nof those women just fine.\n  So what are those other health care providers for women that the \nIndiana Republicans said could take the place of the State's Planned \nParenthood health centers? Prisons--listen to this--prisons, they \nsuggested, juvenile detention centers, and homeless shelters. These are \ncertainly not the kinds of places my Republican colleagues would want \nto send their daughters, sisters or wives for care.\n  It is common sense--if you take away Planned Parenthood health \ncenters, women will have no ability to access care, and most will go \nwithout the care they need.\n  The Republican senior Senator from Maine agrees. Here is what she \nsaid:\n\n       The problem is, in my state and many others, Planned \n     Parenthood is the primary provider of women's health services \n     in certain parts of my state. So I don't know how you would \n     ensure that all of the patients of Planned Parenthood could \n     be absorbed by alternative care providers.\n\n  In Nevada, Planned Parenthood centers there serve about 22,000 \npatients a year. Where will these patients go if the Republicans' \nlegislation passes? I do not know. They will not get the care they \nneed, that is for sure.\n  Senate Republicans are not being fair to American women. They are \ntrying to shift the responsibility to someone who does not exist.\n  It is our responsibility in the Senate to ensure that American women \nhave access to care. It is our obligation to protect our wives, our \nsisters, our daughters, and our granddaughters from the absurd policies \nof a Republican Party that has lost its moral compass. Today, Senate \nDemocrats will do just that. This Planned Parenthood bill is not going \nanywhere in the Senate. Senate Democrats will fight this vigorously and \nany other attempt from Republicans to deprive American women health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anyone here to speak. I would ask the \nChair to announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/03/senate-section/article/S6215-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6215-S6228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROHIBITING FEDERAL FUNDING OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION OF \n                       AMERICA--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1881, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 169, S. 1881, a bill to \n     prohibit Federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of \n     America.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss Federal funding for \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Every now and then we see something that is so horrific that we must \nanswer it. And by now, we are all familiar with the deeply disturbing \nvideos of Planned Parenthood doctors cavalierly discussing their \npractice and methods of harvesting baby body parts.\n  Like so many Nebraskans, I am shocked by the lack of compassion for \nthese women and their unborn babies.\n  My colleague and friend from Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst, has introduced \nlegislation that takes immediate action and cuts off funding for this \nscandal-plagued organization. I am proud to join her in sponsoring this \nvery important legislation.\n\n  This bill has nothing to do with whether one is pro-life or pro-\nchoice. It is not going to settle the issue of abortion, which has \ndivided our country for over 40 years. This bill simply says that \ntaxpayer dollars should not go to organizations mired in scandal and \nlikely illegal activity. This has nothing to do with ideology. It has \nnothing to do with religious conviction. This is about the responsible \nand conscientious use of Federal tax dollars.\n  Elected officials have a responsibility to be wise stewards of public \nfunding. I believe it is irresponsible to continue to support funding \nfor a group that has lost the public's trust and engages in violations \nof Federal law.\n  I believe it is important to note that Federal law clearly prohibits \nabortion providers from the intentional manipulation of the bodies of \nunborn children for the purposes of obtaining body parts. Section 498A \nof title 42 of the U.S. Code clearly states:\n\n       In research carried out under subsection (a) of this \n     section, human fetal tissue may be used only if the attending \n     physician with respect to obtaining the tissue from the woman \n     involved makes a statement, made in writing and signed by the \n     physician, declaring that--No alteration of the timing, \n     method, or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy was \n     made solely for the purposes of obtaining the tissue.\n\n  A video released on July 21, 2015, details a Planned Parenthood \ndoctor discussing using a ``less crunchy'' abortion technique to get \nmore whole specimens. Let me repeat the law: A doctor must certify that \n``no alteration of the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate \nthe pregnancy was made solely for the purposes of obtaining the \ntissue.''\n  Senators can reach their own conclusions.\n  I think the truth is pretty self-evident, and I believe the law and \nthese videos speak for themselves.\n  I wish to address another important point. This legislation is not an \nattack on women's health. To the contrary, as a mother and a \ngrandmother, I am steadfastly committed to ensuring that all women have \naccess to high-quality medical care. The legislation I intend to \nsupport today redirects funds to local health departments, hospitals, \nand community health centers.\n  Our focus should be on supporting organizations that prioritize \nwomen's health, not organizations hiring pricey PR firms for damage \ncontrol.\n  Across the country there are 1,200 Federally qualified health centers \nand 9,000 clinic sites. These community health centers vastly outnumber \nthe roughly 700 Planned Parenthood facilities nationwide. In Nebraska, \nwe have 6 health centers and 36 clinic sites that have served over \n64,000 people. These centers serve all of Nebraska--from the panhandle \nto our metropolitan areas in Omaha and Lincoln. Fifty-two percent of \nthose patients are uninsured and 30 percent are on Medicaid. Meanwhile, \nthere are only two Planned Parenthood centers in Nebraska.\n  So it begs the question: Wouldn't patients be better served if that \nmoney was redirected to community health centers? I believe the answer \nis yes. These health centers deliver many--and sometimes more--of the \nhealth services provided by Planned Parenthood. In 2012 alone, \nfederally qualified health centers performed 400,000 mammograms and \nover 2 million cervical cancer screenings.\n  These health centers are better able to respond to the needs of these \nwomen because they are closer to the communities they serve. They are \nindispensable in providing preventive health services and preventive \nscreenings to the uninsured and our medically underserved populations.\n  In conclusion, I believe elected officials have a basic duty to stop \nsending tax dollars to an organization mired in scandal and likely \nillicit activity.\n  It is time for us to come together and support truly compassionate \ncare for women and their unborn children. It is time to cut funding for \nPlanned Parenthood and to use that money for its original intent, which \nis providing resources and care for women's health.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that has \nshaken the moral compass of our society. The phrase ``it's a boy'' is \none we often use when celebrating new life. Instead, this was spoken by \na Planned Parenthood employee as the body of an unborn baby boy was \npicked apart and harvested for organs, such as a liver, kidneys, and \nheart. We have watched\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\nas other Planned Parenthood employees talked about ``less crunchy'' \ntechniques to preserve baby organs for buyers and grumbled about a \n``war torn'' unborn baby before being sold for parts.\n  While it would be easier to ignore these videos, today we are \nstanding up and shining a light on what is really happening. This is \nhuman life, and Planned Parenthood--the Nation's single largest \nprovider of abortion services--is harvesting baby body parts. The \nAmerican people are shocked and horrified by the utter lack of \ncompassion and disregard shown by Planned Parenthood for these women \nand their babies. This gruesome footage resonates with our collective \nconscience and goes against the very principles we stand for.\n  As a mother and grandmother, I believe the gravity of Planned \nParenthood's callus and morally reprehensible behavior cannot be \nignored. I am committed to defending life because protecting the most \nvulnerable is an important measure of any society.\n  I am proud to stand before you today with 45 cosponsors and offer \nlegislation that will defund Planned Parenthood while safeguarding \nfunding for women's health services. This legislation prohibits Federal \nfunding for Planned Parenthood, protects Federal funding for women's \nhealth services, such as prenatal and post-partum care, cervical and \nbreast cancer screenings, diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, \nand guarantees there will be no reduction in overall Federal funding \navailable to support women's health.\n  This legislation redirects Federal funding taken from Planned \nParenthood to other eligible entities that provide health services for \nwomen, such as community health centers and hospitals. There would be \nabsolutely no reduction in overall Federal funding available to support \nwomen's health. Community health centers provide more comprehensive \nprimary and preventive health care services--except abortion--\nregardless of a person's ability to pay. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood \nfacilities do not perform in-house mammograms.\n  The American taxpayers should not be asked to fund an organization \nsuch as Planned Parenthood that has shown a sheer disdain for human \ndignity and complete disregard for women and their babies. These videos \nare hard for anyone to defend and pull back the curtain on Planned \nParenthood's careless practice of rummaging for unborn baby organs to \nbe harvested and sold at a price.\n  I leave you with this one question: Who do we want to be as a nation? \nBefore us today is an opportunity to vote for legislation that will \nprotect the most vulnerable and women's health.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, even in the greatest deliberative \nbody in this Nation and likely the world, there are moments of profound \nsadness and regret, and this moment is one for me. I am deeply dismayed \nthat the Republican leadership is engaging in an effort--an effort \ndoomed to fail in just a couple of hours--to defund probably the most \ntrusted provider of health care for women in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  It is misguided because there are so many significant issues that \nshould be front and center for this body: making sure that we invest in \nour roads and bridges, making sure that we improve our education \nsystem, making sure that we keep faith with our veterans. So many of \nthem are going nowhere because of this partisan paralysis and gridlock. \nDismayingly to the American people, that has prevented real action. I \nregret that we are, in effect, distracted from those goals and those \nmissions that the American people expect us to fulfill.\n  Once again, many of my colleagues across the aisle have aligned \nthemselves with the most extreme of the anti-choice movement to \nundermine access to critical health care services for women--for \nmillions of women in this country and thousands in Connecticut who \ndepend on Planned Parenthood for basic health care screenings, cancer \ndiagnosis, family planning, and contraception services, which \ndistinguish it as one of the most trusted health care providers in the \nUnited States.\n  It is the Republican leadership--not just a few Senators but the \nRepublican leadership--that has set up this vote to defund Planned \nParenthood. So instead of the Senate moving forward to provide \nadditional health care services to women, it has engaged in this \nonslaught and assault on women's health care, taking a step back with \nlegislation that is really--let me say bluntly--a political charade, a \nstunt, a bill or legislative measure that will go nowhere and is as \nmuch a sham for the supporters as it is for opponents. The fact is \nPlanned Parenthood provides health care services to women across this \ncountry. Only 3 percent of its activity relates to abortion. So 97 \npercent of what it does is to provide screenings, diagnosis, and family \nplanning. If this measure goes through, millions of women will be \nundiagnosed with cervical and breast cancer, millions of women will be \ndenied access to contraception and family planning, and millions of \nyoung women will be denied the kind of education they need to prevent \npregnancy.\n  It is in preventing pregnancy that so often Planned Parenthood is \nengaged, and to make it safe, legal, and rare. Eliminating $528 million \nfrom the largest women's health care provider in the country would \ncreate a public health crisis. Pure and simple, a public health crisis \nwould be the inevitable consequence of this measure to defund Planned \nParenthood. Of the 2.7 million women Planned Parenthood serves every \nyear, 78 percent are low-income women who depend on Planned Parenthood \nfor breast cancer screening, testing for sexually transmitted \ninfections, hepatitis B vaccines, family planning counseling, education \non how to recognize and leave abusive relationships, domestic violence, \nreferrals to other medical specialists, and many other essential \nservices that would be unaffordable and inaccessible without Planned \nParenthood.\n  Over half of Planned Parenthood's clinics serve women in medically \nunderserved areas or in health provider shortage areas. So 13 of \nConnecticut's 17 women's health centers serve women in rural or \nmedically underserved parts of my State. Defunding Planned Parenthood \nwould mean 64,000 of my constituents could lose access to quality \nhealth services.\n  Because there is no network of health care providers with the \ncapacity to serve this population if Planned Parenthood is denied \nfunding, millions of women--particularly Medicaid recipients--would \nlose access to quality health services, and the result would be a \npublic health crisis. That is the stark reality of these numbers and \nstatistics. Dry and abstract as they are, they stand for real-life \nconsequences--real women whose lives will be inevitably transformed for \nthe worse if this measure were to pass.\n  Beyond the din of this place that so often consumes us--the confusion \nand the noise--there are real people whose lives will be affected by \nthese kinds of measures and whose lives are affected even by the effort \nto defund Planned Parenthood because of the uncertainty and doubt that \nit creates.\n  These real people are women such as Elizabeth A., who said:\n\n       When I didn't have health insurance 3 years ago, I went to \n     Planned Parenthood where I had access to safe, affordable, \n     reproductive health care. I still go there for my health \n     needs! I was able to get STD testing and birth control when I \n     couldn't afford it anywhere else.\n\n  Rachel S. of Naugatuck, CT:\n\n       Birth control helped my husband and me put off having a \n     family until we were financially ready to care for a child. \n     The effects of pregnancy, both physically and financially, \n     mean that free or low-cost birth control is an important \n     factor in a successful future for both the woman and her \n     family.\n\n  And Nicole B. of West Haven, CT:\n\n       I come to Planned Parenthood because it is a safe place to \n     get birth control and exams. Everyone is helpful and non-\n     judgmental. The city needs a place like this and many women \n     benefit from Planned Parenthood services.\n\n  These stories are from real people whose lives we in the Senate are \nsupposed to care about. I care about them\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\nbecause I know so many women whose lives have been affected by Planned \nParenthood. I know so many of the staff and dedicated professionals who \nwork at Planned Parenthood clinics.\n  One spoke to me on Saturday afternoon--one of the low points last \nweek during the controversy that has enveloped Planned Parenthood--\nabout how she was inspired and revived by simply passing by a room \nwhere one of the counselors was talking to a group of young people, \nboth men and women, about the education that was important to them as \nfar as preventing unwanted pregnancy and how seeing Planned Parenthood \nat work in that setting--the real work of providing health care and \neducation--inspired her to keep going despite those difficulties.\n  The fact is that over and over my constituents, the people of \nConnecticut, have told me they choose Planned Parenthood because of the \nprofessionalism, dedication, and nonjudgmental approach to their \npatients. Many view Planned Parenthood as a safe space to come when \nthey need advice, when they need medical examinations.\n  If Republicans succeed in defunding it, women will be without their \nmost trusted health care provider. So many of them are relying on it \nbecause it is trustworthy, professional, and dedicated to them--first \nand foremost to them.\n  Today I stand with Planned Parenthood and the thousands and thousands \nof women in Connecticut and around the country who benefited from their \nservices. I will vehemently oppose these efforts to allow a secretive \nand dishonest group to discredit and to dismay so many. They have \nmanipulated the facts, put employees and volunteers in danger, and have \neliminated the organization's ability to provide essential services. \nBut the important point is that we resist this effort today to defund \nan organization that has provided so many services to so many people in \nneed and has enabled this Nation to avert a public health crisis that \nwill ensue if we follow this misguided effort, and that we follow our \nbetter instincts and make sure that we keep the faith with women who \nneed health care in this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, William Wilberforce is a man whom I have, \nover the years, looked to as a role model and an example of what public \nservice should be and what public servants should be.\n  Wilberforce served as a Member of the British Parliament from 1784 to \n1812. After an early career marked by what he described as doing \nnothing of purpose, Wilberforce then went through a transformational \nperiod of self-reflection. He emerged with a deepened faith, greater \nmoral courage, and an unshakeable passion for ending the slave trade. \nHe said:\n\n       So enormous, so dreadful, so irremediable did the [slave] \n     trade's wickedness appear that my own mind was completely \n     made up for abolition. Let the consequences be what they \n     would: I from this time determined that I would never rest \n     until I had effected its abolition.\n\n  It took Wilberforce 20 years of blood, sweat, tears, and even death \nthreats, but he succeeded in pushing the House of Commons and the House \nof Lords to put abolition into law when the Slave Trade Act of 1807 \npassed.\n  I believe today, just 2 hours from now, we will have a William \nWilberforce moment facing the Senate. Through a series of video \nreleases over the past few weeks, the American people have learned \nabout the shocking and barbaric practices Planned Parenthood uses to \nterminate innocent human lives. In several different videos, senior \nPlanned Parenthood officials openly and candidly discussed the organ \nharvesting of fetuses.\n  In one video, the senior director of medical research for Planned \nParenthood explained the process by which aborted body parts are \nharvested. I am not going to describe that process on the floor. I \ntalked about it last week. But for those who have seen the video and \nthose who have read about the practices, it is abhorrent to hear the \ncold, calculating consideration of how best to disassemble, to tear \napart, to rip apart a growing life so that they could harvest certain \nbody parts and then sell them for research. And they were negotiating \nprices.\n  It was like describing to somebody how they could go to Home Depot \nand pick things off the shelf: Let's see what this costs; no, maybe we \ncan get a better price for this. But in this case we are talking about \nliving human tissue being taken, harvested, and sold from aborted \nbabies.\n  So let's consider for a second what is the bottom line. The bottom \nline is we are talking about an organization that is embracing the \ndismembering of human life with taxpayer support. Millions of Americans \nwho have seen these videos are outraged by the cavalier attitude that \nPlanned Parenthood has about human life. Americans from all walks of \nlife, Americans of different faiths and, maybe, even of different \npolitical parties abhor this.\n  Then we learned that our tax dollars, our hard-earned tax dollars, \nare sent to an organization that practices these methods. Surely, we \ncan come to a conclusion that this is something that violates the faith \nand beliefs of many millions Americans and is subsidized by the Federal \ntaxpayer?\n  Now, over the past few days, we have heard many who say they object \nto what Planned Parenthood is doing here. But, you know, we can't \nafford to stop funding many of the very important women's health \nservices that Planned Parenthood provides. And this is an important \nconsideration because I am sure every Senator here believes in ensuring \nthat all women, regardless of their status and regardless of their \nfinancial situation, deserve to have access to vital services that \nhealth care providers provide.\n  The bill before us that we will be voting on today, offered by the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Ernst of Iowa, addresses these concerns. Her \nlegislation would transfer money provided to Planned Parenthood to a \nwhole range of women's health care providers. I have the bill here in \nfront of me. It is very simple, a very basic bill.\n  I want to read from this bill:\n\n       State and county health departments, community health \n     centers, hospitals, physicians offices, and other entities \n     currently provide, and will continue to provide, health \n     services to women. Such health services include relevant \n     diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child \n     care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family \n     planning services including contraception, sexually \n     transmitted disease testing, cervical and breast cancer \n     screenings, and referrals.\n\n  The bill goes on to say that such entities provide services to all \npersons, regardless of their ability to pay and provide services in \nmedically underserved areas and to medically underserved populations.\n  So what is being offered here and what we will be voting on this \nevening doesn't take anything away from women's ability--regardless of \ntheir financial situation or where they live--to have the services that \nare needed and need to ensure their health and the future health of \ntheir children.\n  In the United States there are five times as many community health \ncenters as there are Planned Parenthood operations. In my own State, we \nhave 108 community health centers in urban and rural areas all \nthroughout the State of Indiana--5 times the amount of Planned \nParenthood facilities. So the issue of denying women needed health care \nsimply is not the case under this legislation.\n  The barbaric practice of conducting abortions in a way that promotes \nharvesting fetal organs or profiting from such practice has no place in \na modern society. Planned Parenthood's practices, I would suggest, \nshould not receive a dime of taxpayer money. The question is, Do we \nwant taxpayer dollars to continue to support an organization that \ntreats human body parts like a product on the shelves of a store?\n  Today the Senate will decide if we fight for what we believe is \nmorally right or whether we stand by and allow the trivialization of \nlife to continue.\n  I am here to urge my colleagues to vote yes on this vitally important \npiece of legislation that we will be taking up in less than 2 hours.\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to S. 1881, \nthe bill that will be coming before us this afternoon, and I have \nseveral quick points that I think need to be made.\n  The first is that this bill has nothing to do with abortion. Ninety-\nseven percent of the activities of the Planned Parenthood Federation of \nAmerica and its associated facilities have nothing to do with abortion. \nThey have to do with women's health, they have to do with cancer \nscreening, and they have to do with contraception and early detection. \nThe 3 percent that do involve abortion have no involvement whatsoever \nwith Federal funds. This is not a case where Federal funds are going to \nsupport abortion or any of the related activities.\n  The net effect of this bill is simply to deny basic health care, \nincluding contraception, to millions of women, particularly low-income \nwomen. And the irony is that it will undoubtedly increase abortions in \nthis country.\n  I have never understood why people who are opposed to abortion also \nseem to be opposed to the provision of family planning and \ncontraceptive information which can prevent unwanted pregnancies and, \nindeed, prevent abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, a respected, \nnonpartisan institution, estimates that without family planning \ninformation supplied by organizations such as Planned Parenthood, \nabortions would increase in this country by 345,000 a year. That is not \na result anybody wants. It is certainly not one I want. That would mean \nan increase in abortions--345,000 a year.\n  I understand the bill does make funds generally available to a whole \nhost of different organizations, some of which may or may not provide \nthe kinds of family planning services that have been provided for over \n70 years by Planned Parenthood. It is a narrower network. It eliminates \nclinics that have been available to women and doctors who have been \navailable to women for many years.\n  Ironically, amidst all the discussion about the Affordable Care Act, \na criticism which was ``Maybe you can't keep your own doctor,'' this is \na bill designed to keep you away from your doctor, the doctor you have \nbeen seeing and have confidence in at a clinic run by Planned \nParenthood.\n  The issue, which my colleague from Indiana noted, is not about \nabortion. It is not about Planned Parenthood. It is not about \ncontraception. It is about fetal tissue and the uses of fetal tissue \nand how fetal tissue should be controlled and whether it should be \nallowed to be used for medical research. But that is a debate we should \nhave on that issue. There is no reason we should be defunding Planned \nParenthood because of a debate we may or may not want to have in the \nfuture about the use of fetal tissue. We are denying medical services \nto women--particularly low-income women--because of an issue that has \nnothing to do with the 97 percent of services this organization \nprovides. To me, this bill is like attacking Brazil after Pearl \nHarbor--it is a vigorous response, but it is the wrong target.\n  If the concern is Planned Parenthood or any other organization having \naccess to fetal tissue and then using that tissue in medical research--\nby the way, designed to save lives and ameliorate the effects of \ndiseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's--then let's focus on that. \nLet's talk about whether it should be legal, how it should be \ncontrolled, what the limitations should be. But we should not eliminate \nan organization which for many years--almost 100 years--has been \nproviding health care for women, particularly low-income women, basic \nfemale health care such as cancer screenings and contraception and \nfamily planning.\n  This is a straightforward attack on women's health, in my view, \nparticularly the health of low-income women.\n  ``No American woman should be denied access to family planning \nassistance because of her economic condition.'' That radical statement \nwasn't made by me. It wasn't made by Jimmy Carter. It wasn't made by \nJohn F. Kennedy. It was made by that known radical Richard M. Nixon in \n1970. So access to family planning information goes back almost 50 \nyears. If people in this body don't think that is appropriate, then \nlet's debate that, but let's not use this collateral issue of fetal \ntissue, which we can debate, to defund an organization that serves the \nneeds of many women in my State and in States across the country, \nparticularly low-income women. Two-thirds of Planned Parenthood's \npatients are low-income women. They serve the needs of those women in a \nresponsible, legal, and thoughtful way.\n  This is targeting an organization for the wrong reason. If we want to \ndiscuss fetal tissue and how to deal with it and what the pros and cons \nare, then let's do so, but I don't believe it is appropriate to do it \nin the context of legislation that will basically crush an organization \nthat has been enormously helpful in maintaining women's health \nthroughout this country and will not, in fact, end whatever concerns \npeople have about the use of fetal tissue.\n  Again, Madam President, this bill has nothing to do with abortion. It \nhas everything to do with women's health. I hope my colleagues will \nmove on, debate the real issues, and oppose this ill-founded and I \nbelieve unsupported piece of legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 1917 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am informed that it is in order for \nme to file the substitute amendment that I just described, and I send \nthat to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be received.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this weekend I watched the Planned \nParenthood videos that are in the news, including one in which the \norganization's leadership says very clearly that the statements made by \nsome of their staff are totally unacceptable. I believe that is \nimportant for everyone to hear.\n  With that said, here is the great danger with the legislation before \nthe Senate today: This bill paints a big red target on some of the most \nbasic, essential health care services for women in America: birth \ncontrol, gone; pregnancy tests, gone; prenatal services, gone; HIV \ntests, gone; breast cancer screenings, gone; cervical cancer \nscreenings, gone; ovarian cancer screenings, gone; vaccinations that \nprevent cancers, gone; treatment for urinary tract infections, gone; \ntesting and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, gone; basic \nphysical exams, gone; treatment for digestive or breathing problems, \ngone; treatment for chronic conditions, gone; pediatric care, gone; \nadoption referrals, gone; nutrition programs, gone; referrals to \nhospitals and specialists, gone.\n\n  When you wipe out Planned Parenthood's funding, you dramatically and \npainfully reduce women's access to services that have absolutely \nnothing to do with abortion--nothing to do with abortion. This bill \nwill take away the guarantee that Medicaid patients have their free \nchoice of doctors in the program. The people who this bill will hurt \nthe most are poor women who have nowhere else to turn.\n  I urge my colleagues today to drop this misguided campaign. Instead \nof restricting women's access to health care services--such as the ones \nI have just outlined--let's work on a bipartisan basis to improve \naccess to health care services for women in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as the Presiding Officer knows, we will \nhave a very important vote about an hour and a half from now on a bill \nthat would eliminate taxpayer funding for abortions, consistent with \nfour decades of U.S. law. Contrary to the comments made by our friend \nfrom Oregon who just spoke, rather than withhold those funds, it would \ntake that same amount of money and redirect it for women's health \nservices and actually give them better access to health services at the \nsame time. In other words, this legislation will fund women's health \ncare but not abortions on the taxpayers' dime.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Ernst, Senator Lankford, Senator \nFischer, and Senator Paul for their leadership on this important issue. \nThis is the beginning of the fight to regain America's conscience and \nthe fight to restore the law that has been on the books for 40 years \nwhen it comes to taxpayer funding of abortions.\n  We all understand that the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade has held that \nabortion is a right. But we also know that there is a rare area where \nthere is a consensus between pro-choice and pro-life people, such as \nmyself, and that is that we draw the line--and have since 1976--when it \ncomes to taxpayer funding of abortions. Of course, what brought us to \nthis point most immediately was that our collective conscience was \nshocked by videos depicting Planned Parenthood executives discussing \nthe harvesting and sale of the organs of unborn babies--an abhorrent, \ndisgusting practice that we cannot ignore. Perhaps the only thing more \nshocking than the actual dismembering of unborn children for sale is \nthe cavalier attitudes by the Planned Parenthood staff who seem to have \nsacrificed their humanity and show so little regard for the sanctity of \nhuman life.\n  What was shown in these videos is an outrage, and it demands our \naction. Many of our colleagues from across the aisle have cited their \nown disapproval of what has been presented in these videos. They will \nbe given an opportunity at 5:30 when we vote on the motion to proceed \nto get on this bill to demonstrate that their actions actually match \ntheir words.\n  According to one report, the junior Senator from Indiana said he \nfound the comments by Planned Parenthood personnel in the video \ndisgraceful. Similarly, the junior Senator from Virginia said that he \nfound the videos ``extremely troubling.'' When asked about the videos \nlast week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also called them \n``disturbing.'' And they are.\n  Like our recent successful bipartisan efforts to fight the scourge of \nhuman trafficking, we have a rare opportunity to make a difference and \naddress the moral imperative to defend those who cannot defend \nthemselves.\n  It is important--because I have already heard some of our colleagues \nmisrepresent what is in the bill--to remind everybody what this bill \nactually does. First and foremost, it eliminates Federal funding for \none of the country's largest abortion providers--Planned Parenthood. In \nfiscal year 2014, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions. At \nthe same time, Planned Parenthood received $528 million from Federal \ntaxpayers.\n  Planned Parenthood reported revenue in fiscal 2014 of $1.1 billion. \nIn other words, almost half of its income came from tax dollars from \nthe Federal Government at the same time they performed 327,653 \nabortions.\n  You will hear some of our friends who are defending Planned \nParenthood say: Oh, well, this is different because the money is kept \nseparate. But we know that money that comes from the Federal Government \ncan keep the lights on and keep the doors open so the abortions can \ncontinue to be performed. It is simply a fiction to claim that Federal \ntax dollars are not supporting conduct proscribed by the Hyde amendment \nfor the last 40 years.\n  We don't stop there, though, when it comes to this legislation. As I \nmentioned at the outset, we would actually redirect the money to ensure \nthat taxpayer dollars that once went to Planned Parenthood now go to \nprovide for women's health, such as in thousands of community health \ncenters across the country.\n  I am a big fan of community health centers because they really \nrepresent one-stop shopping when it comes to primary health care needs. \nThe ironic thing is we can actually provide better access and more \naccess for women by transferring the money from Planned Parenthood to \ncommunity health centers and other nonabortion providers. For example, \nin my State, we have as many as eight times more community health \ncenters as there are Planned Parenthood providers. We can provide women \nwith eight times more opportunity to see that their health care needs \nare taken care of and at the same time respect the law that prohibits \ntaxpayer dollars to be used for abortions and to support abortions.\n  In fact, according to data from 2013--the most recently available \nnationwide--every State in the country has more community health \ncenters than Planned Parenthood clinics.\n  Since I didn't want to mention all 50 of them here--that would be a \nlittle overwhelming and be hard to read at the same time--I just picked \nout two States, along with the nationwide statistic--13 community \nhealth centers to every 1 Planned Parenthood provider that would still \nbe able to provide primary health care services to women under this \nlegislation. But if we look at Indiana, for example, we would have four \ntimes more providers under this legislation. In the State of Virginia, \nwe would have 20 times more providers by simply defunding Planned \nParenthood, the abortion provider, and using tax dollars and \ntransferring that money to community health centers. We can actually \nprovide greater access for women's health care.\n  Let's be clear, because I suspect, as I have already heard when I \ncame to the floor, that there will be a lot of misrepresentation about \nwhat is in the bill. We need to be clear. This legislation defends \nwomen's health and ensures women access across the country to essential \nhealth services.\n  As I said a few moments ago, in many respects the debate that we are \nhaving was already decided in 1976, the year of the Hyde amendment, \nnamed after Henry Hyde, which, as my colleagues all know, prevents \ntaxpayer dollars from funding abortions, except in rare circumstances. \nWe talked about that a lot during the course of the anti-human \ntrafficking bill. But this has been the law of the land for 40 years.\n  I strongly encourage all of our colleagues to vote to get on this \nbill. An organization that so callously reduces our most vulnerable to \nspare parts for sale has no business receiving any money from the \nFederal taxpayers. If people want to raise money from other private \nsources to support this effort, then let them do that. But tax dollars \nare not available and should not be available to fund Planned \nParenthood's abortion practice--again, the largest single abortion \nprovider in America.\n  While many of our colleagues on the other side have agreed that the \nvile practices that we witnessed in these videos are disturbing, still \nsome have tried to put off having this discussion at all. I think what \nwould be the biggest failure on our part--no matter what the outcome of \nour vote on the underlying legislation--would be to fail to have this \ndiscussion and this debate for the American people to hear so we can \nget their input. The real travesty would be if we shut off debate \nbecause 60 Senators didn't see fit to vote to get on the bill. That \nvote will be in roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n  There are others who say we simply have more important things to do. \nI disagree. For example, the senior Senator from New York said \nconsideration of this bill was ``wasting valuable time'' and that we \nshould instead ``[start] urgent budget negotiations.''\n  Really? Really? I hardly know what to say. To those who share my \ndisgust for the conduct depicted in these videos and who agree they are \ndisgraceful, disturbing, and extremely troubling, how can you now turn \naround and refuse to vote with us to get on this legislation so we can \nhave that discussion, so we can have that debate, and so we can vote \nour conscience? If your conscience is shocked by the footage in these \nvideos, I really can't see how anybody could possibly vote no on this \nlegislation at 5:30 when we vote to get on the bill.\n  Somehow, we as a nation have been lulled into a sense of complacency \nand have become somehow so desensitized to these barbaric practices \ndepicted in these videos that they no longer stimulate us to act. But \ntoday we have a\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nchance on behalf of the American people, the people we collectively \nrepresent, to act and to act in a way that protects the most \nvulnerable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, thanks to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, the Senate is unfortunately taking a vote on whether \ncritical health care services should be taken away from millions of \nwomen across the country. We will be voting on whether a young woman \nshould be able to go to a provider she trusts to get birth control, \nwhether cancer screenings should be more or less available to women \nacross the country, and whether the U.S. Senate is going to turn back \nthe clock on women's health.\n  To me--and to many Democrats and even some Republicans who want to \nhelp women get the care they need--it is deeply disappointing that we \nare even having this debate because extreme Republicans have attacked \nPlanned Parenthood and women's health so many times before--on the \nbudget, the highway bill, the Affordable Care Act, and even on the \nlegislation I introduced last week to help wounded veterans start \nfamilies. That is right. Some of my Republican colleagues were more \ninterested in scoring political points with their extreme base by \npicking fights over women's health than they were in helping our \nwounded veterans.\n  Unfortunately, it is clear they will jump at any opportunity to put \npolitics before women's health. The bill we are talking about this \nevening that would defund Planned Parenthood is just more of the same.\n  My Republican colleagues who support this bill claim it would simply \nredirect funding for Planned Parenthood to other providers. Let's keep \nin mind that 2.7 million people visited Planned Parenthood for their \nhealth care last year, and 1 out of every 5 women in the United States \nwill visit a Planned Parenthood center at some point in her life. So \nPlanned Parenthood is a critical source of health care in communities \nacross this country, and claiming that other providers can simply \nabsorb those patients is like saying you can pour a bucket of water \ninto a cup. It will not work. Instead, what this bill would actually do \nis take access to birth control, cancer screenings, STD tests, and \nother important preventive care away from women. It would leave \nfamilies and communities without trusted, quality health care providers \nthey rely on, and it would mean that in the United States of America in \nthe 21st century the tea party gets to tell women what doctors they can \nor cannot go to.\n  I am not going to let that happen, and I know many of my colleagues \nhere today agree. So this legislation is going nowhere, and, just as we \nhave every other time they have tried these partisan tactics, we are \nsending a very clear message to those who choose political pandering \nover women's health.\n  Political attacks and threats to shut down the government are not \ngoing to get in the way of women's access to the care they need--not on \nour watch. Why? Because we know millions of women and their families \nare counting on us, and we are going to keep standing up for them.\n  I will close today by sharing the story of a woman from my home State \nof Washington. Shannon is from Tumwater, WA. When she was a teenager, \nshe experienced ``unbearable pain'' and went to see a doctor to find \nout whether she had endometriosis. That is a serious disease that can \nkeep women from having children if it goes untreated. Her doctor told \nher she was far too young to have endometriosis and sent her home. A \nfew years later when she turned 18, Shannon tried again, and this time \nshe went to a Planned Parenthood center. There, her provider confirmed \nthat she did indeed have endometriosis. Her lesions were removed, and \nShannon got the medication to manage her condition, thanks to Planned \nParenthood. She no longer has to live with chronic pain, and now she is \nthe proud mother of a little girl.\n  Shannon said, ``My daughter is truly a gift, and I really have \nPlanned Parenthood to thank for her.''\n  So today, as many Members on the other side of the aisle vote to take \nhealth care away from women and their families, as they try as hard as \nthey can to appeal to the extreme fringe of their party no matter the \ncost, I hope they think of women like Shannon whose lives are happier \nand healthier because of the services Planned Parenthood provides to so \nmany communities in our country. That is whom I will be thinking about. \nI am very proud to vote no tonight and will continue to keep fighting \nfor women, their health care, and their rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor to ask my \nRepublican colleagues a question: Do you have any idea what year it is? \nDid you fall down and hit your head and think you woke up in the 1950s \nor the 1890s? Should we call for a doctor? Because I simply cannot \nbelieve that in the year 2015, the U.S. Senate would be spending its \ntime trying to defund women's health care centers.\n  On second thought, maybe I shouldn't be that surprised. The \nRepublicans have had a plan for years to strip away women's rights to \nmake choices about their own bodies. Just look at the recent facts. In \n2013, Republicans threatened to shut down the government unless they \ncould change the law to let employers deny women access to birth \ncontrol. In March of this year, Republicans held up a noncontroversial, \nbipartisan bill to stop human trafficking. Why? Because they demanded \nnew anti-abortion restrictions to cover private funding meant to help \nthe victims of human trafficking. In June, House Republicans passed a \nbudget eliminating funding for the Title X Family Planning Program, the \nonly Federal grant program that provides birth control, HIV tests, STD \nscreening, and other preventive services for poor and uninsured people.\n  Over the past few years, Republicans have voted to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act more than 50 times, including the portions that \nrequire insurers to cover contraception. Let's be clear. It is not just \nCongress. Over the past 5 years Republican State legislators have \npassed nearly 300 new restrictions on abortion access. This year alone \nRepublican State legislators have passed more than 50 new restrictions \non women's access to legal health care.\n  Let's be really clear about something. The Republican scheme to \ndefund Planned Parenthood is not some sort of surprised response to a \nhighly edited video. Nope. The Republican vote to defund Planned \nParenthood is just one more piece of a deliberate, methodical, \norchestrated, rightwing attack on women's rights, and I am sick and \ntired of it. Women everywhere are sick and tired of it. The American \npeople are sick and tired of it.\n  Scheduling this vote during the week of a big FOX News Presidential \nprimary debate, days before candidates take trips to Iowa or New \nHampshire, isn't just some clever gimmick. This is an all-out effort to \nbuild support to take away a woman's right to control her own body and \naccess to medical care she may need.\n  This affects all of us, whatever your age, wherever you live. I \nguarantee that you know someone who has used Planned Parenthood health \ncare centers. No one may mention it at Thanksgiving dinner or post it \non Facebook for the whole world to know, but just look at the facts. \nOne in five women in America is a Planned Parenthood patient at least \nonce in her life. Every single year nearly 2.7 million women and men \nshow up for help at Planned Parenthood.\n  Why do so many people use Planned Parenthood? Because they are \nnonprofit and they are open. More than half of Planned Parenthood \ncenters are located in areas without ready access to health care. Women \nwho can't get appointments anywhere else go to Planned Parenthood for \npap tests and cancer screenings. Couples go to Planned Parenthood for \nSTD treatments or pregnancy tests. Young people go to Planned \nParenthood for birth control. And, yes, 3 percent of patients visit \nPlanned Parenthood for a safe and\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\nlegal abortion with a doctor who will show compassion and care for a \nwoman who is making one of the most difficult decisions of her entire \nlife.\n  To be clear, even though the abortions performed at Planned \nParenthood are safe and legal, the Federal Government is not paying for \nany of them--not one dime. For almost 40 years the Federal Government \nhas prohibited Federal funding for abortions except in the cases of \nrape, incest or life endangerment.\n  Most of the money Planned Parenthood receives from the government \ncomes in the form of Medicaid payments for medical care provided to \nlow-income patients, the same payments any other doctor or clinic \nreceives for providing cancer screenings or other medical exams. The \nrest of Planned Parenthood's Federal funding comes from title X that \nprovides birth control to low-income and uninsured people, the same \nprogram the House Republicans voted to cut in June.\n  The government doesn't fund abortions, period. A vote today to defund \nPlanned Parenthood is not a vote to defund abortions. It is a vote to \ndefund cancer screenings, birth control, and basic health care for \nmillions of women.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues: The year is 2015, not 1955 and not \n1895. Women have lived through a world where backward-looking \nideologues tried to interfere with the basic health decisions made by a \nwoman and her doctor, and we are not going back--not now, not ever.\n  The Republican plan to defund Planned Parenthood is a Republican plan \nto defund women's health care. For my daughter, for my granddaughters, \nfor people all across Massachusetts, and all across this country, I \nstand with Planned Parenthood, and I hope my colleagues will do the \nsame.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, Congress provides billions of dollars in \ntaxpayer money for many different programs in various areas, including \nwomen's health. Sometimes, however, we have to draw the line, rearrange \nour priorities, and put some things off-limits. This is one of those \ntimes. The taxpayers should not be funding an organization engaged not \nonly in the abortion business but, as we now know, in the baby body \nparts business.\n  In the last fiscal year, Planned Parenthood received more than one-\nhalf billion dollars of taxpayer money in the form of government \ngrants, contracts, and Medicaid reimbursements. That is nearly $1.5 \nmillion per day, every day, and more than 40 percent of Planned \nParenthood's revenue. The group's annual reports reveal what it does. \nIn the last 3 years, it performed nearly 1 million abortions. In fact, \nthis taxpayer-supported organization is the nation's largest abortion \nprovider.\n  Some of Planned Parenthood's propaganda suggests the group focuses \nmore on promoting pregnancies than ending them. But the numbers reveal \nthe truth. Abortion accounts for 94 percent of Planned Parenthood's \npregnancy services. The number of Planned Parenthood abortions dwarfs \nits recipients of prenatal care by more than 15 to 1. Planned \nParenthood performs 174 abortions for every 1 adoption referral. In \nfact, Planned Parenthood's abortion business is growing while its \nadoption referrals and prenatal care services are shrinking.\n  We are also told that Planned Parenthood provides other women's \nhealth services. Those same annual reports, however, show that cancer \nprevention services are down 17 percent over the year before. Planned \nParenthood does not provide what the American Cancer Society calls a \n``very effective and valuable tool'' for breast cancer screening: \nmammograms. That procedure requires an FDA certification and no Planned \nParenthood clinic in America has such a certification.\n  It is no wonder that Planned Parenthood has fought anything that \ncould conceivably reduce the number of abortions. That is the business \nthey are in. They oppose measures to inform women about abortion \ndangers or alternatives, they oppose any kind of involvement by parents \nwhen children seek an abortion. They even oppose restricting the \nhorrible practice of partial-birth abortion.\n  We have learned recently what such a commitment to abortion produces.\n  Not one, not two, not three, but four videos released so far show \nPlanned Parenthood's own leaders discussing the harvesting and selling \nof baby parts as casually as a mechanic sells car parts. They discuss \nhow Planned Parenthood abortionists arrange their procedures and \ntechniques to obtain the intact baby body parts that they need. These \nvideos are revolting. They reveal an attitude toward human life that I \nthought we left behind long ago, when we decided human beings were not \ncommodities to be traded.\n  Planned Parenthood has responded to these videos with propaganda and \ndistraction. After the first video was released, for example, they said \nthat it had been heavily edited, and their comments were taken out of \ncontext. That is often the first response by someone exposed by their \nown words. I urge my colleagues and fellow citizens not to be \ndistracted. The Center for Medical Progress, which released the video, \nhas made the full video and complete transcript available.\n  Planned Parenthood also claims that it receives cost reimbursement \nfor the ``services'' it provides. I remind my colleagues of two things. \nFirst, even if that were true, these are costs associated with the \nharvesting of baby body parts. We must never forget what is at the \nheart of this whole thing--the harvesting and selling of pre-born body \nparts. Second, Planned Parenthood's senior director of medical services \nsays in one of the videos that if they can ``do better than break \neven,'' they are ``happy to do it.'' It appears that Planned \nParenthood's only guideline is that ``this is not something that you \nshould be making an exorbitant amount of money on.''\n  In the fourth video, a Planned Parenthood medical director talks \nabout how ``a little bit of training'' will make sure that fetal organs \ncan be removed intact. She says that charging a fee for each body part \n``works a little better, just because we can see how much we can get \nout of it.'' And to top it all off, this medical director talks about \nhow calling this gruesome business ``research'' helps to avoid getting \ncaught.\n  The truth about Planned Parenthood is finally coming out, and \nCongress should respond in two ways. First, we should exercise our \noversight authority to investigate how Planned Parenthood is using the \nhundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars it annually receives. Federal \nlaw, for example, makes it illegal ``for any person to knowingly \nacquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any fetal tissue for valuable \nconsideration.'' If our investigation turns up any evidence of possible \ncriminal wrongdoing, such evidence should be turned over to the proper \nauthorities.\n  Second, we should stop giving Planned Parenthood taxpayer money. Even \nif the investigations show that Planned Parenthood has broken no laws, \nregulations, or other rules, we should get American taxpayers out of \nthe business of harvesting and selling baby body parts. Senator Ernst's \nbill would do just that.\n  The abortion lobby's misdirection, distraction, and spin are already \nin high gear. Last week here on the Senate floor, one of my Democratic \ncolleagues said that this bill is an ``attack on women's health.'' It \nis no such thing. Planned Parenthood is not the only provider of \nprenatal services or cancer screenings. It is, however, the only \norganization financed by American taxpayers that traffics in baby body \nparts.\n  Just as everyone should judge Planned Parenthood's words for \nthemselves, everyone should also read this bill for themselves. It says \nthat while Planned Parenthood will no longer receive taxpayer money, \noverall funding for women's health will not decrease. This bill \nsupports women's health but defunds Planned Parenthood.\n  This bill does not prohibit Planned Parenthood from performing \nabortions, it does not even prohibit Planned Parenthood from continuing \nits practice of harvesting and selling baby body parts. But if Planned \nParenthood wants to be in this gruesome business, it should do so \nwithout being subsidized by American taxpayers.\n  I reiterate that this bill does not reduce services for women's \nhealth by a single dime. Healthcare providers all over this country, \nincluding community health centers, offer all sorts of services for \nwomen. These include the very services that my Democratic colleague \nmentioned here last week, such\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nas cancer screenings, vaccinations, breast exams, and HIV testing. \nUnder this bill, Federal funding for such services will not be reduced, \nbut rather re-directed to providers who are not involved in the sordid \nand contemptible baby body parts business.\n  The recent revelations about Planned Parenthood have pulled back the \ncurtain on something very ugly in our culture. Millions of abortions \nover multiple decades have devalued human life to the point where--at \nleast to some--preborn babies are little more than commodities, \ncollections of parts that can be harvested and sold. Is that the kind \nof country we want? No, it is not. We should use this opportunity to \nexamine our values to chart a better course.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are now 7 months into the 114th \nCongress, and our Nation is faced with many challenges. Less than 1 \nyear ago, the American people were promised that if Republicans took \ncontrol of the Senate, our focus would be on committee-reported bills \nand promoting bipartisanship. Leader McConnell pledged not to fill the \namendment tree and instead to allow for an open amendment process when \nbills were brought to the floor. These promises have already been \nbroken and this week we will likely see them broken again.\n  We are just a few days before the first debate for the many \nRepublicans seeking their party's nomination for President. Given the \ncrowded stage, they have already resorted to attention-getting attacks \ndesigned to excite the most extreme right wing of their base. It should \nsurprise no one then that at the top of the Senate's agenda this week \nis a bill that would jeopardize the health and well-being of women \nacross the country.\n  I spoke in opposition to this misguided, partisan effort last week. \nIt is disappointing that instead of using the few remaining weeks \nbefore the end of the fiscal year working to reach an agreement on how \nto fund the government, we are considering ideologically-driven \nlegislation to bar funding for Planned Parenthood health centers. This \nissue is unfortunately all too familiar. A few years ago, a small but \nvocal minority nearly shut down the Federal Government over a provision \nprohibiting funding for Planned Parenthood. Thankfully, we prevailed in \nthe end, removing the rider and assuring women's access to vital health \ncare. I hope the Senate makes the right choice again today.\n  This latest attack on women's health is fueled by an extreme \norganization that is in the process of releasing surreptitiously \nrecorded videos, which the group heavily edited in a misleading way to \nsuggest wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood. The Attorney \nGeneral is currently reviewing the matter, and I have every confidence \nthat if there is credible evidence to warrant an investigation of any \nof the parties involved in the videos, the Justice Department will act.\n  The bill before the Senate today would affect the lives of millions \nof American women, men, and young people who trust and depend on \nPlanned Parenthood for their basic health care needs, including annual \nhealth exams, cervical and breast cancer screenings, and HIV \nscreenings. Last year in Vermont, Planned Parenthood centers provided \ncritical primary and preventive services to over 16,000 patients. In a \nsmall State like Vermont, this impact cannot be overstated.\n  Proponents of this bill argue that if we defund Planned Parenthood, \nwomen will find care at other health centers. This is simply not the \ncase. Planned Parenthood centers overwhelmingly serve populations in \nrural and medically underserved parts of the country where access to \nhealth care, especially for low-income individuals, is difficult. In \nfact, over 90 percent of Vermont's Planned Parenthood centers are \nlocated in rural or medically-underserved areas. Many women in my State \ndescribe Planned Parenthood as their primary source of health care. \nWhat this partisan bill would do is force the women in Vermont who have \ntrusted Planned Parenthood for their health care to try to find another \ndoctor where few are available, or, more likely, go without care at \nall. That undermines all of our efforts to strengthen our Nation's \nhealth care system, and ensure access to care for everyone.\n  Planned Parenthood health centers are eligible for Federal funds in \ntwo ways, and under the Hyde amendment, funds cannot be used for \nabortion services except in very limited circumstances. First, Planned \nParenthood centers can receive Federal grant funding through title X of \nthe Public Health Service Act. Title X is the only Federal grant \nprogram dedicated to offering people comprehensive family planning and \nrelated preventive health services. President Nixon was instrumental in \nenacting this legislation, and it has long been supported by lawmakers \nand Presidents of both parties. It cannot be emphasized enough that \ntitle X was a remarkable breakthrough in women's health care. The \nsecond way Planned Parenthood receives Federal funding is through \nMedicaid reimbursements, when women using Medicaid choose a Planned \nParenthood provider as their doctor.\n  The federally supported services offered by Planned Parenthood are \nthe core of their work and mission. Despite the misleading and \nblatantly false statements of some ideologically-driven advocates, more \nthan 90 percent of the care Planned Parenthood health centers offer is \npreventive care like cancer screenings, annual checkups, and \ncontraception. As noted by several observers over the weekend, the \nirony is that defunding Planned Parenthood would result in more \nunintended pregnancies, and probably more abortions.\n  Should we walk back from the remarkable progress we have made as a \nnation in women's health? Of course not. But I am concerned that we \nstill see this same irresponsible attack surfacing again and again. It \nis 2015. It is time for the mean-spirited and ideological assaults on \nwomen's health care to end.\n  The arrogance and shortsighted attitude of a minority has put at risk \nthe lives and health of millions of women. Does this Congress care more \nabout what looks good on a bumper sticker or what matters in the daily \nlives of real people? My wife Marcelle is a cancer survivor. We were \nlucky. We had good health care and the ability to pay the bills when \nshe got sick. Others are not so lucky. Without the services that \nPlanned Parenthood provides, thousands of low-income women in Vermont \nwould lose their ability to have regular cancer screenings that could \nsave their lives too. That we are even considering the elimination of \nthese health services to America's women is shameful.\n  What a travesty it would be to gut health services that have \nliterally meant the difference between life or death, health or grave \nillness, to countless American women. This bill is merely an effort to \nscore political points at the expense of women's health. I hope the \nSenate rejects this irresponsible, partisan legislation. I urge the \nSenate majority leadership to return to its promise that it would lead \nthis Chamber responsibly and act through regular order.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am strongly opposed to the bill \nbefore us today, S. 1881, introduced by Senator Ernst.\n  I stand in strong support of Planned Parenthood, which every year \nprovides 2.7 million people--including over 30,000 Marylanders and one \nin five women--with important health care services, such as breast and \ncervical cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease, STD, testing \nand counseling, and birth control.\n  The bill before us today does one thing. It defunds Planned \nParenthood.\n  Every year Planned Parenthood health centers receive approximately \n$520 million in Federal funds to provide preventive health services to \n2.7 million people in the United States, including one in five women. \nThese services include cancer screenings, STD testing and counseling, \nand birth control. If the Ernst bill passes, Planned Parenthood would \nlose that money and could no longer provide those services to women and \nmen in need.\n  For decades, anti-choice activists have looked for any excuse to \neliminate funding to Planned Parenthood health centers because they use \nnon-Federal funds to provide legal abortions. This time around, the \nexcuse is that we should defund Planned Parenthood because of some \nmisleading videos. Videos that, while uncomfortable in nature, have \nshown nothing illegal to date.\n  Let us talk about what Planned Parenthood means to Maryland. In my\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\nState, Planned Parenthood is a leading provider of high-quality and \naffordable health care for so many women, men, and young people. Every \nyear in MD, more than 33,000 patients receive health care from Planned \nParenthood health centers. And what types of health care are \nMarylanders getting from these health centers? Approximately 5,000 \nbreast exams every year. Nearly 4,000 cervical cancer screenings and \nPap tests. More than 34,000 STD tests and counseling sessions. And more \nthan 26,000 Marylanders rely on Planned Parenthood health centers for \nbirth control.\n  The bill before us today is just the latest in a series of \nunrelenting attacks on Planned Parenthood. Those supporting this bill \nare simply latching on to yet another misguided attempt to try and \neliminate Planned Parenthood in an effort to undermine women's \nreproductive rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill on behalf of the 2.7 million \npeople, and 1 in 5 American women, who rely on Planned Parenthood for \ntheir health care.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, before us this evening is a decision \nwhether or not to take money away from Planned Parenthood.\n  For close to 100 years, Planned Parenthood has provided critical \nhealth services to millions, providing care to 2.7 million people in \n2013 alone.\n  In fact, many Planned Parenthood affiliates operate in rural and \nmedically underserved areas. In some cases, closing these facilities \ncould cause patients to travel great distances to receive health \nservices.\n  Now, that said, I find the videos at issue to be extremely disturbing \nand I believe we have a responsibility to determine all the facts.\n  More investigation is needed before we even start talking about \ntaking away vital health services like annual wellness exams and cancer \nscreenings from the millions who rely on them for care.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to express \nmy sincere disappointment in Planned Parenthood's apparent disregard \nfor human life. As a father of four and a strong advocate for the \nsanctity of life, I am deeply disturbed by reports of the gruesome and \ninhuman actions being performed by Planned Parenthood and their \naffiliates.\n  I am proud to be a lead coauthor of Senator Ernst's bill that we are \nconsidering today to defund this organization and hope my fellow \nSenators will put the sanctity of life ahead of any political \ninterests.\n  Last year, Planned Parenthood received $528 million in taxpayer \nfunding, or more than $1.4 million per day, accounting for 41 percent \nof Planned Parenthood's overall revenue. Although the organization \nclaims to use this funding to provide necessary health services to \nwomen, the fact is that abortions made up 94 percent of Planned \nParenthood's pregnancy services in 2013, while prenatal care and \nadoption referrals accounted for 5 percent and 0.5 percent, \nrespectively.\n  Given our current fiscal climate and the level of division among \nAmericans on this issue, there is no justification for continuing to \nsubsidize Planned Parenthood's profitable venture with taxpayer \ndollars. It is time for big abortion businesses like this one to be \ninvestigated and defunded.\n  Senator Ernst's bill, of which I am very proud to be a lead co-\nauthor, would prohibit Planned Parenthood, or any of its affiliates, \nsubsidiaries, successors, or clinics, from receiving any Federal funds. \nInstead, funds that are currently offered to Planned Parenthood would \nbe available to other eligible entities to provide women's health care \nservices, including diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-\nchild care, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, and cervical \nand breast cancer screenings.\n  The sanctity of human life is a principle that Congress should \nproclaim at every opportunity. The time has come to respect the wishes \nof the majority of Americans who adamantly oppose using taxpayer \ndollars for abortions by denying Federal funds to these abortion \nproviders. I strongly encourage the support of my fellow Senators on \nefforts to defund Planned Parenthood and protect these innocent babies \nfrom being the target of Planned Parenthood's gruesome practices.\n  Ms. WARREN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in strong \nopposition to legislation that would defund Planned Parenthood and \njeopardize women's access to health care.\n  Each year Planned Parenthood opens its doors to millions of \nAmericans, including more than 54,000 people in my State of Minnesota, \npeople who need affordable, quality health care, such as breast and \ncervical cancer screenings, pregnancy tests, and family planning \nservices. One in five women in this country has received that care at \nPlanned Parenthood, and for many women Planned Parenthood is their \nprimary source of health care. Yet today the Senate is considering \nopening debate on a proposal to defund Planned Parenthood--a proposal \nto block this health care provider from continued participation in our \nFederal safety net health programs. It is a proposal that would close \nPlanned Parenthood's doors and leave millions without a provider.\n  Make no mistake, this proposal has nothing to do with protecting \nwomen's health. Instead, it advances a political agenda that threatens \nwomen's ability to receive often lifesaving care. In my State of \nMinnesota alone, Planned Parenthood provided more than 9,000 cervical \ncancer screenings and nearly 14,000 screenings for breast cancer in \njust 1 year. These screenings save women's lives, women such as Liz \nSteele from Minneapolis.\n  Liz's first job after graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Eau \nClaire didn't offer health insurance, so she relied on Planned \nParenthood for basic health care services. When a blood sample taken \nduring a routine physical exam more than 25 years ago indicated that \nLiz had a deadly form of leukemia, the nurse practitioner who cared for \nLiz at Planned Parenthood tracked her down and connected her with a \nphysician who treated her cancer and saved her life. Liz said, \n``Without [the nurse's] persistence, I quite frankly wouldn't be here \nright now. Planned Parenthood is responsible for saving my life.''\n  Unfortunately, the bill we are discussing today ignores women like \nLiz. Rather than recognizing Planned Parenthood's role in protecting \nwomen's health, the legislation continues a series of unrelenting \nattacks on Planned Parenthood and on women's access to basic health \ncare. We have seen this strategy before. In 2007, the Senate voted on a \nmeasure that would have eliminated support for any health care \nprovider--including Planned Parenthood--that provides safe, legal \nabortion services. In 2011, the Senate voted on a proposal that singled \nout Planned Parenthood by name and would have disqualified it from \nreceiving Federal support. Each time, these attempts to place political \nhurdles between a woman and the health care provider of her choice \nfailed--by a vote of 41 to 52 in 2007 and 42 to 58 in 2011. Today's \nattempt will fail as well.\n  Recently, antiabortion activists secretly recorded videos of Planned \nParenthood doctors and staff. In these videos, some of the physicians \ncaptured on tape did not treat the issue of reproductive health \nservices with the appropriate level of sensitivity. I was glad to see \nthat the president of Planned Parenthood apologized for the tone of \nthose remarks. But these videos--deceptively edited to paint a \nmisleading picture of the organization--were designed to distort the \ntruth and create controversy, a controversy that opponents of \nreproductive rights are now exploiting by pushing the same failed \nstrategy, only this time they have focused their opposition to \nreproductive rights in disingenuous rhetoric that purports to value \nwomen's health.\n\n  The bill's lead sponsor claimed that ``[t]here will be no reduction \nin overall federal funding available to support women's health.'' \nAnother cosponsor of this legislation claimed the bill would ``provide \nadditional money for women's primary health care services,'' but the \nbill's operative language makes no\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\nsuch commitment. It merely provides that ``no federal funds may be made \navailable to Planned Parenthood.'' What the bill's proponents choose \nnot to acknowledge is that Planned Parenthood health centers serve 36 \npercent of all patients who receive health care from a federally \nsupported women's health center--more than any other provider--but \nthose sponsors have no plan for where the millions of patients \ncurrently receiving health care from Planned Parenthood would go if \nthis legislation were successful--no plan.\n  Moreover, claims that opponents of Planned Parenthood support \ncontinuing or even increasing funding for women's health services are \nespecially hard to believe in light of the fact that some of the same \npeople also support cutting the very programs that fund women's health \nservices now. Just a little over 1 month ago, House appropriators \napproved a spending bill that would completely eliminate the title X \nfamily planning program--the Nation's only Federal program exclusively \ndedicated to reproductive health care. Senate appropriators proposed \nslashing title X--a program that is already running on fumes--by $30 \nmillion. So claims that a bill to ban one of America's most trusted \nhealth care providers from Federal programs would support women's \nhealth--claims made while the bill's proponents are working to gut \nFederal programs that provide services like breast and pelvic exams, \ncontraceptives, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted \ninfections and HIV--are nothing short of preposterous.\n  It is no secret that attacks on Planned Parenthood are part and \nparcel of a longstanding campaign to make safe and legal abortion in \nthis country virtually impossible to access. Ironically, the defunding \nof Planned Parenthood would interfere with the delivery of health care \nthat actually prevents unintended pregnancy and reduces the need for \nabortion. If the proponents of this bill were truly sincere in their \ndesire to support women's health, they would embrace efforts to improve \ncontraceptive coverage and increase access to birth control rather than \ncontinue to attack the Nation's No. 1 provider of basic women's health \nservices.\n  The ability to access reproductive health care by the services that \nPlanned Parenthood provides has a powerful effect on the choices women \nand families make every day--choices about finishing college or \ngraduate school, whether to buy a home or start a business. The ability \nto decide whether or when to start a family shapes lives, and for \nnearly 100 years Planned Parenthood has played an important role in \nensuring that women are able to make that decision for themselves and \nshape their own destinies. I urge my colleagues to resist the impulse \nto let politics stand between a woman and her health care and to oppose \nlegislation to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield to my colleague from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Once again, this 114th Congress is proving its priorities are \ncompletely misguided. Last week the House of Representatives adjourned \nfor a 6-week recess instead of taking up the Senate 6-year highway \nbill. That bill would strengthen our transportation infrastructure and \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which helps businesses compete \nglobally and returns hundreds of millions of dollars to the Treasury. \nBy skipping town, the House forced another short extension, delaying \nlong-term investments and denying States and businesses long-term \ncertainty.\n  Today we are debating whether to defund Planned Parenthood and deny \nthousands of women access to primary health care. Outside of these \nwalls, this debate was settled decades ago. Most voters--including over \n70 percent of Independents--oppose this effort because they see it for \nwhat it is: an aggressive assault on women's health care.\n  If you don't believe me, let me tell you the story of one of my \nconstituents named Liz from Billings. Planned Parenthood has been Liz's \nprimary health care provider for 30 years. The doctors and nurses at \nher local facility found precancerous cells and got her the treatment \nshe needed to prevent a life-threatening disease. Despite a complicated \nmedical history, she was able to start a family thanks to the prenatal \ncare she accessed at Planned Parenthood. Now she has a daughter of her \nown and trusts the providers of Planned Parenthood to provide critical \nhealth care to her and her family. But Liz isn't alone.\n  In 2013, in my home State of Montana, over 15,000 men and women were \npatients at Planned Parenthood for everything from affordable primary \ncare to cancer screenings, to family planning services. Four out of ten \nwomen who receive care at a title X-funded health care center consider \nit their only source of health care. Taking away this funding is \npolitical, shortsighted, and outright dangerous. Unfortunately, it is \nnot their only attempt to rob women of their health care choices. As it \nsits now, next year's U.S. House appropriations bill for Health and \nHuman Services eliminates all of the title X family planning health \nclinics. While that is the kind of shortsightedness we have come to \nexpect from the House in recent years, the Senate Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill isn't much better because it significantly cuts \ntitle X funding. It cuts teen pregnancy prevention funding by 81 \npercent. In a large rural State like Montana, access to quality health \ncare is always a serious challenge. Without a serious effort to recruit \nmore doctors and nurses, we could soon be facing a crisis-level \nshortage of qualified medical providers.\n  This bill is designed to score political points, no doubt about it. \nIt is certainly not designed with women's health or public health in \nmind. This is crazy. We need to be giving the American people more \noptions when it comes to their health care, not fewer.\n  I would urge my colleagues to stop the political gaming and simply \nvote no on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, there comes a time in the history of nations \nwhen a civilized people must stand up and decide whether life is \nimportant, whether life is something special, and whether there is \nmaybe something greater than just us that has to do with life.\n  It sickens me to see what has been going on with Planned Parenthood. \nSome of my first memories of my children were the ultrasounds I saw \nbefore they were born. We still keep those. We now find out, though, \nthat this technology that can do wonders, that can save babies--now you \ncan perform surgery in the uterus and the baby can survive. These same \ntechniques are being used by Planned Parenthood to manipulate the baby \ninto a position to harvest the baby's organs. I think all America \nshould be sickened by this. It should also trouble us if we are a \nsociety that is not sickened by this.\n  I think the time has come to have a full-throated debate. The time \nhas come to end all taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. Some will \nsay: Well, where will people get their health care? We have 9,000 \ncommunity health centers and 700 Planned Parenthood clinics. The only \ndifference is abortion. In fact, you can get many things at a community \nhealth center you cannot get at Planned Parenthood, but the only thing \nyou get at Planned Parenthood that you cannot get anywhere else is an \nabortion.\n  But this debate is not just about abortion; this debate is about \nlittle babies who have not given their consent.\n  It is about time we had a debate in our country about this, and it is \nabout time we said enough is enough. The question is, Can a \ncivilization long endure that does not respect life? Do we lose \neverything else that makes us human if we are unwilling to protect \nlife? Can we stand up and defend our other rights if we are not willing \nto stand up and defend the most basic of rights?\n  I come here today to ask my fellow Senators to vote to defund Planned \nParenthood. I hope they will.\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to have a colloquy with several Members on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I would first like to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Daines. This is an issue which many of us here in \nthis body feel extremely passionate about. We will talk about Planned \nParenthood and what is going on and the basic issue of children.\n  This has been spun multiple different ways, but really this is not \nabout a lot of other issues other than one thing. This is about \nchildren--children who are recognizable outside of the womb, and once \nthey have been carved up and set out on a table to be sold as parts, \nthey can be plainly seen to be children.\n  So my conversation today will circle around a little bit about what \nwe are doing, where we are headed, what this vote this evening is all \nabout, and what this debate is that should begin here in America about \nwhat happens with Planned Parenthood.\n  So I would like to entertain a conversation with Senator Daines.\n  Mr. DAINES. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for having this \ncolloquy today because I do believe we are at a crossroads. With this \nvote we will have in about 20 minutes, we have a choice set before us, \none that each one of us must make as a Senator and one that each \nAmerican must make with us.\n  With a ``yes'' vote--a ``yes'' vote is to defund Planned Parenthood--\nwe reaffirm our dedication to women's health. In fact, we recommit \nevery dollar made available to support things such as well-baby care, \ncervical and breast cancer screening, prenatal and postpartum care, \nimmunizations, family planning services, including contraception, \nsexually transmitted disease testing, and relevant diagnostic, \nlaboratory, and radiology services.\n  This bill does not take a single dollar away from women's health. I \nthink it is very important, as we debate this decision in front of us, \nthat we do not get caught up in rhetoric. Let's get focused on the \nfacts, on what this does and what it does not do. This is a vote about \nour culture. This is a vote about our ethics. Most importantly--and I \nsay this as a daddy of four children, two boys and two girls--this is \nabout the value of our children.\n  Over the last few weeks, we have seen these videos. Americans have \nbeen horrified at high-level Planned Parenthood executives who are \ncallously discussing the price of baby organs harvested from the tiny \nbodies of aborted babies. In fact, just last week we witnessed an \nabortion doctor poking through the pieces of a tiny and broken body. He \nwas pointing out the heart and lungs and discussing what each of them \nshould cost when sold, meanwhile exclaiming it is a baby.\n  We have heard so many arguments today: Well, this is about the \nwoman's body. We respect the body of the woman, and we want to make \nsure that the proper services are allowed to protect a woman's health. \nBut this is not about the woman's body. This is about a different body \nwith a different DNA. This is about a little baby--a baby who now has a \nprice not just on its head but on literally every part, as these videos \nexposed.\n  When we place a price on the outcome of the destruction of our \nchildren, we incentivize it. In another setting, we would call this \nprice-per-specimen arrangement a bounty scheme, because with potential \nfor such financial gain, there is little wonder why there are 149 \nabortions to every 1 adoption referral at these clinics--149 abortions \nto every 1 adoption referral at these clinics.\n  The discussions we heard are not exceptions or even the actions of a \nsingle clinic. This is a systemic issue within Planned Parenthood. We \nheard direct testimony that clinics act in concert, with the consent of \ntheir corporate headquarters at Planned Parenthood, and that no single \nclinic acts alone.\n  We learned that an overarching legal department works to build layers \nupon layers of defenses so that no one clinic is left holding the bag. \nSuch a culture shows little regard for women's health. This is a \nculture that has been embroiled in a number of lawsuits about making \nfalse reimbursement claims to the Federal Government and helping to \nfacilitate the covering up of sexual abuse and statutory rape. In fact, \njust last week a complaint was filed with the Colorado Department of \nRegulatory Agencies against one of these clinics regarding a little 13-\nyear-old girl who was sexually abused, had an abortion, and was \nreturned to her abuser. No report was made by the clinic or the \nabortionist. Her parents were not contacted--all in violation of the \nlaws of Colorado.\n  So a ``no'' vote on this bill supports this culture. It devalues both \nthe woman and that tiny little baby, that child.\n  We do have a choice today. We can work to change that culture if we \nchoose to vote for women, if we would choose to vote yes, because a \n``yes'' vote redirects--again, let's get the facts straight here and \nseparate them from the rhetoric--funds from Planned Parenthood and \nprovides that money for women's health services to the numerous \ncommunity health centers.\n  You heard Senator Paul talk about 9,000 community clinics around the \ncountry versus 700 Planned Parenthood centers. It would provide these \ndollars to those clinics, to local clinics, to hospitals, to other \nproviders that already serve the majority of women.\n  I must tell you I was deeply disturbed--as a daddy of four--with this \nmost recent video where a doctor pokes around the aborted baby's parts \nuntil she finds the legs, and she shouts and exclaims: It is another \nboy.\n  There can be no denying what she was saying. We hear those words for \nthe first time. I heard those words for the first time from a doctor \nduring an ultrasound when Cindy and I were seeing the doctor as we were \npregnant or in that ecstatic phone call that comes from an expecting \nmom or as the new father takes that newborn son into his arms. That \ndoctor was the same one to say: It is a baby.\n  There is no doubt that this is what the little boy is; it is a baby.\n  I cannot support an organization that would place a dollar amount on \nbody parts. I cannot support an organization that would incentivize his \ndeath. That is why I will vote for this bill, and my vote will be a \nvote for women's health.\n  To be very clear, this bill won't touch 1 cent of funding for women's \nhealth--not 1 cent. That means that this vote is for one thing and one \nthing only. A ``yes'' vote is a vote for women. It is a vote for our \nchildren. I urge my colleagues: Let us vote for women. Let us vote for \nour children. Let us vote yes.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, this ongoing conversation has happened. \nI would like to be able to demonstrate what we are really up against \nand what this really looks like in practical terms.\n  I brought a chart with me here for when we talk about women's health \nbecause there is an accusation that is sitting out there that this is \nabout cutting off access to women's health. The chart I have on the \nright shows all Planned Parenthood licensed mammogram facilities. They \nwould be a dot on this map. If you were looking close at the map, you \nwould see no dots on it. It is clear there is not a single one. The \naccusation is, over and over, that if women are going to get access to \nmammograms, they have to be able to get to Planned Parenthood. The \ndirty secret is they are referred to other locations. They recommend \nthat you go get a mammogram, but Planned Parenthood doesn't do any of \nthem. On the left, these are the 8,000-plus facilities--the dots on the \nmap here--where you can actually get a mammogram. We are talking about \ntaking funding from a location that refers patients to the location \nthat actually does the mammogram.\n  This is about women's health, but it is also about the health of \nchildren. I have a very difficult time talking about things such as \nearly childhood education on this floor with individuals who are \npassionate about early childhood education, but if that child was just \na couple of years younger, they would have no issue with them being \naborted and their body parts being sold.\n  That is the same child. That is the same child whose early childhood \neducation we are passionate about. That is the same child whom we are \npassionate about in the Women, Infants, and Children funding to make \nsure that they get proper nutrition at birth. That is\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\nthe same child. The only difference between the child in the womb and \nthe child who is a preschooler is time. We just think it is important \nin this incredibly divisive issue of abortion that we treat this \nseriously as a nation.\n  What has happened in the last couple of weeks with the Planned \nParenthood video coming out is that for the first time in a long time, \nthis is not an invisible thing that is happening somewhere in secret. \nNow it is something that is actually happening where people can see it. \nI think our culture, for the first time in a while, is having to slow \ndown and deal with the reality of this: Is it possible that this \nculture has been wrong, that this really is a child?\n  I spoke last week to a friend of mine. His child was born a year ago \nat 14 ounces. So 14 ounces was the birth weight. The child was born \nvery, very premature. Their child is now 14 pounds, a year later, and \ndoing extremely well. That 14-ounce child is a child that everyone sees \nnow, but that 14-ounce child is exactly what Planned Parenthood was \nharvesting, was turning in the womb so they could crush the head to be \nable to gather the organs to be able to sell them.\n  As a culture, we have to deal with this one simple reality. That \nchild is important. This is not about Cecil the lion. This is not about \nwhales at SeaWorld. This is about children.\n  Maybe we as a culture should slow down and be able to answer that one \nsimple question and at least for this moment with Planned Parenthood to \nsay this to an organization where there are a couple of things that are \nhanging over them right now that are very serious. One is that it is \nnot legal under Federal law to sell parts of a human for profit. Now, \nit is still yet to be determined what was done. But it is also not \nlegal to be able to change the timing, procedure or method of an \nabortion to be able to gather organs to be sold. That is very clear in \nFederal law as well.\n  So if the method is changed, if the timing is changed, if the \nprocedure has changed, specifically to harvest organs, that is not \nlegal. In the videos, over and over you hear doctors talking about how \nthey changed the method, how they used the ultrasound to turn the child \naround, how they used a different technique than they would have \nnormally done because they wanted to be able to gather these organs for \nsale.\n  Those are serious accusations. These are children--children. We think \nit is entirely reasonable to say let's take the funding that has been \ncommitted to Planned Parenthood, which is the single largest abortion \nprovider in the country--40 percent of their revenue comes from the \nFederal taxpayer, 40 percent. Let's take that funding and let's commit \nit to organizations that do full women's health--mammograms, testing, \ncontraceptives, and the works--not just recommending it to others and \nalso do abortions, but we would commit it to those individuals.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Louisiana in this colloquy. I \nsee my colleague from California as well. I think she would also like \nto have a moment in our colloquy.\n  Would the Senator like to be able to speak for a moment in our \ncolloquy?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I was going to ask unanimous consent that following \nmy friend from Louisiana I be given 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Could we just swap and go straight to the Senator now? \nWould that be appropriate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Whatever the Senator wants.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Let's do that then.\n  I have a unanimous consent for an ongoing colloquy, and I would be \npleased to have the Senator join this conversation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his generosity here. \nI tell him that I would really rather work with him on transportation.\n  I gave birth to two premature kids, and I just don't like lectures \nfrom men about what it is like--and thank God they made it.\n  I am pro-choice. I just have to say that using pregnancy as a \npolitical football doesn't sit well with the people I represent and the \npeople of this country.\n  We have to respect one another. I respect your view entirely. I am \nasking you to respect mine. Keep Uncle Sam out of my private life, and \nthat of my children, my grandkids, and yours.\n  Families will make these decisions with their God and their doctor. \nNinety-seven percent of the work Planned Parenthood does has nothing to \ndo with abortion. It is primary health care.\n  I have to say that in 2011 Republicans threatened to shut down the \ngovernment if Planned Parenthood wasn't defunded. I heard my friend \nfrom Washington, Patty Murray, say they were serious. They were going \nto shut down the government to deny health care to 2.7 million women \nand men every year--for some of them, basic health care.\n  I will show you a particular person, Doreen from California, who \nsaid:\n\n       I went to Planned Parenthood and I talked to the clinician. \n     . . . She gave me a referral to a breast care center where I \n     had a mammogram and a biopsy [and] was ultimately diagnosed \n     with breast cancer. . . . I was scheduled for a lumpectomy in \n     about two weeks.\n\n  That woman could have died, and you say: Go to community health care \ncenters. First, I find it ironic because they were set up in ObamaCare \nand all of you voted no on ObamaCare. We expanded community health \ncenters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the community health care center association in \nCalifornia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           California Primary Care\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                                    July 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The California Primary Care Association \n     has recently become aware of new legislation by Senator Joni \n     Ernst that would redirect federal funding from Planned \n     Parenthood to other health care providers. The purported goal \n     of such legislation is to prevent a decrease in federal \n     funding for women's health services, while eliminating \n     Planned Parenthood as a health care provider.\n       As the state-wide representatives of community clinics and \n     health centers in California, who serve 5.6 million patients \n     annually, we believe this action would negatively impact the \n     health of our community.\n       Planned Parenthood currently operates 115 health centers in \n     California and serves nearly 800,000 patients through 1.5 \n     million encounters annually. Eliminating Planned Parenthood \n     from our state's comprehensive network of care would put \n     untenable stress on remaining providers. We do not have the \n     capacity for such an increase in care and building such \n     capacity would require significant capital investment on par \n     with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     expansion.\n       Even then, the legislation would still eliminate patient's \n     ability to choose the provider with which they feel most \n     comfortable. Planned Parenthood is seen by many as women's \n     health centric, which provides their patients with a level of \n     comfort that cannot be easily duplicated. The women's health \n     focus allows them to be a provider of choice to hundreds of \n     thousands of women who seek out a variety of services that \n     include well woman exams, breast exams, birth control and \n     sexually transmitted disease testing.\n       In 2013 alone, Planned Parenthood conducted 733,641 tests \n     for Chlamydia--the leading cause of preventable infertility--\n     that resulted in 37,014 positive results and follow-up \n     treatment.\n       Planned Parenthood is a vital component of the health care \n     system in California and for that reason, we are opposed to \n     legislation that will diminish their capacity to provide care \n     in our state. We respectfully request that you oppose this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Andie Martinez Patterson, MPP,\n                                   Director of Government Affairs.\n\n  They say they cannot take any more patients. They cannot take those \n800,000 patients.\n  So they say to the women: Go to the community health care centers. \nThey voted against ObamaCare, which expanded the community health care \ncenters, and the health care centers are saying no, they are sorry, \nthey cannot do it. Planned Parenthood does a great job.\n  So this is a continuation of the Republican war on women. I hope we \nwill defeat this ill-considered bill that is about to come our way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to be able to continue this \nconversation because it is extremely important that we continue this as \na nation.\n  I wish to make a couple of comments to you as well.\n  I am a dad with two daughters. I had something to do with the birth \nas well\n\n[[Page S6227]]\n\nand was also there. I was there during the sonograms. My wife and I are \nextremely close. As a dad of two daughters, I am very passionate--not \nonly about my own wife but about my mom, who is a cancer survivor. She \nis a multiple-time cancer survivor. I am passionate about my daughters \nhaving every single opportunity. So this is important to us as well. \nThis is not just a women's issue. This is a men's issue as well because \nthis is a family issue, and families are extremely important to all of \nus.\n  But I would say that community health centers don't serve 3.2 million \npeople, like Planned Parenthood. Community health centers serve 23 \nmillion people around the country. There are around 650 Planned \nParenthood locations around the country. There are 9,000 community \nhealth centers around the country. The Planned Parenthood facilities \nrefer people to go get breast cancer screenings. The community health \ncenters actually do that testing there. They actually do the mammograms \nthere and not just say that you should get one.\n  So this is about women's health. It is also about the efficiency of \nwhat we are going to be about.\n  I would also say one other thing on this issue about ObamaCare and \nthe community health centers. The community health centers were funded \nunder ObamaCare, but they long preexisted before ObamaCare. Community \nhealth centers are not an invention of ObamaCare. There was a section \nof ObamaCare that funded some of them an additional amount, but they \nhave been around for decades and decades. They are an extremely \nefficient form of health care, especially to those on Medicaid.\n  I yield to my friend and fellow Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I am a physician, a doctor. For the last \n25 years, I have worked in hospitals for the uninsured. So when my \nfriend from California mentions the need to ensure access for those who \nmight not otherwise afford it, that is what I have been attempting to \ndo in my medical practice for the last 25 years.\n  As a practicing physician, one of the first things you are taught in \nmedical school is ``first, do no harm.'' Tragically, these videos \ndemonstrate that some do not share that perspective.\n  When patients see their doctors, they want an honest, objective \nopinion. But what the video suggests is that Planned Parenthood puts \nprofits and special interests before the women who call on them for \ntheir advice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised that the time \nfor the vote, scheduled for 5:30, has arrived. He can ask unanimous \nconsent for additional time if he so wishes.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Oh, is it 5:30 now? I am sorry. I ask unanimous consent \nfor another 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Now, again, for 30 years, I have been working to get \nhealth care for folks, and I think it is important we ensure access for \nwomen to health care.\n  Currently, Planned Parenthood gets $500 million in Federal funding \nper year. If we redirect this funding to the community health centers, \nwhich I have worked with for 30 years, their health can be better \nserved.\n  There are two Planned Parenthood facilities in Louisiana, and there \nare 160 community health centers. The two Planned Parenthood offices, \none in New Orleans and one in Baton Rouge, are in the southeastern \nportion of the State. The community health centers are scattered all \nover the State, and, again, there are 160 of those.\n  For every American who is troubled by these videos, we should be \nequally troubled by the fact that the Planned Parenthood provision of \nhealth care is geographically centered in some areas but not as broadly \nas the community health centers.\n  I will also point out, as a physician, that the Planned Parenthood \nmodel of care is outdated. We now talk about clinics which are medical \nhomes, not which are siloed into only the provision of birth control \npills and, in the case of Planned Parenthood, abortion. The community \nhealth centers can provide the whole range of services including those \nfor diabetes, hypertension, et cetera.\n  It is time for Congress to act. I ask my colleagues to support this \nredistribution of money, sending it closer to where those patients \nlive, to better ensure a woman's access to health care, and to address \nthe troubling issues raised by these videos.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I will not object if \nSenator Blumenthal can respond with 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, the question before us today is clear: Who \ndo we want to be as a nation?\n  It is hard for anyone to defend these morally reprehensible videos as \nPlanned Parenthood callously harvested the organs of unborn babies to \nbe sold at a price. The American people, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, are horrified by the blatant disregard and utter lack of \ncompassion shown by Planned Parenthood for these women and their \nbabies.\n  It is wrong. The American people know it, and they should not be \nasked to foot part of the bill. We can no longer turn a blind eye. This \nis human life, and Planned Parenthood, the Nation's single largest \nprovider of abortion services, is harvesting baby body parts.\n  Before you now is a critical opportunity to vote for legislation that \nwill protect the most vulnerable in our society and fund women's \nhealth.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am tempted to say there they go \nagain, because we have seen this attack on women's health care again \nand again and again. It is a very weak excuse to defund Planned \nParenthood.\n  We know 97 percent of Planned Parenthood's activities have nothing to \ndo with abortion. Let's stand strong for women's health care to protect \nwomen against cancer, against hepatitis, against sexually transmitted \ndiseases. Eighty percent of Planned Parenthood's clients have nowhere \nelse to go for those vital services. We will not tolerate this attack \non women's health care under the guise of stopping abortion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I am grateful for this conversation \nabout children.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is regular order at this point?\n  Parliamentary inquiry. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is that all time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. I would advise my colleague from California I have a \nunanimous consent request under rule XXII.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 1881, a bill to prohibit Federal funding of \n     Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n         Mitch McConnell, James M.

Hatch, Roy Blunt.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I understand why our colleagues want to respond in some way to the \nhorrendous hack at the Office of Personnel Management. I wish to say to \nmy colleagues that it needs to be a response that is going to work. My \nconcern is that this bill, in its present form, will create more \nproblems than it solves, and it would be a mistake to bring it up \nwithout agreeing to an inclusive process for considering relevant \namendments.\n  I appreciate that the sponsors of the bill have been working on a \nmanagers' amendment to address some of the very serious concerns that \nhave been raised. My own view is that the bill needs a lot more work. \nFor example, the managers' amendment does not fix the provision of this \nbill that will allow private companies to hand over large volumes of \ntheir customers' personal information to the Government with only a \ncursory review, even if that information is not necessary for cyber \nsecurity.\n  Cyber security experts and privacy advocates have been raising \nconcerns about these issues for many months. They state that they have \nsent something like 6 million communications to the Hill in the last \nfew days.\n  For me, the bottom line is that the legislation, as it stands today, \ndoesn't do a whole lot to protect U.S. networks against sophisticated \nhacks, and it will do a lot to undermine the privacy rights of the \nAmerican people.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from California here, and I \nknow she has a different view. My colleague from North Carolina is \nhere. I look forward to working with both of them and the Senate and \nhope that we will have an inclusive debate that will ensure that all \nsides get a chance to raise their concerns.\n  Cyber security is a very real problem in America. My constituents \nhave been hacked. In fact, the Chinese were indicted for hacking my \nconstituents. Information sharing can play a valuable role. Yet \ninformation sharing without vigorous and robust privacy safeguards will \nbe seen by the American people as a surveillance bill. That is a fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                     Drinking Water Protection Act\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I have come back to the floor again this \nafternoon to plead with my colleagues to pass legislation that deals \nwith the toxic algal blooms that affect many of our States, including \nmy State of Ohio.\n  It turns out this is the 1-year anniversary of the water crisis that \noccurred in Toledo, OH. I see my colleague from Ohio is now on the \nfloor also. He will remember this well. But it was a year ago when we \nfound that there were toxic algal blooms around the intake valve in \nToledo, OH, making the water unsuitable. There was an advisory sent out \nto 500,000 people that said: Do not drink the water.\n  You can imagine the chaos that occurred. You can imagine how \ndifficult this was for the people who live in the Toledo area, who rely \non this water. By the way, there are about 3 million Ohioans who rely \non Lake Erie water and more than twice that many around the country and \nin other States, such as Michigan.\n  This is a critical issue. Last week it turned out that there were \nalgal blooms that were moving within a few miles of this same intake \nvalve--the same kind of blue-green toxic algal blooms. I was on the \nlake the weekend before last to see some of this. Within a couple of \ndays, the city of Toledo changed the city's water quality status from \n``clear'' to ``watch.'' We are on a ``watch'' status right now because \nof the amounts of toxins that have drifted closer to the intake valve.\n  We have a problem right now. We know that the toxic algal blooms \nprediction for this year in Lake Erie is projected to be worse than it \nwas last year, almost as bad as it was during another crisis period in \n2011, when a lot of the beaches were closed down and people weren't \nable to take their pets to the water and when fishing was pretty much \nshut down because of the algal blooms. This is a huge issue. It is an \neconomic development issue. It is a health and safety issue. It is an \nissue that goes to the heart of the economy in this part of Ohio where \nwe have relatively high unemployment and where Lake Erie is the single \nbiggest driver of economic activity. In fact, it is the biggest \ndestination in the State of Ohio. It is our biggest resource for \ntourism.\n  It is not just Lake Erie. We now have this in Grand Lake St. Marys. \nThere is an advisory out on water in Grand Lake St. Marys, which is a \nreservoir that is inland that is a freshwater reservoir south of Lake \nErie. It is the same thing--toxic algal blooms. We had a lot of rain \nearlier this spring and\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nsummer, as those of us in the Midwest will remember, and that washed a \nlot of effluent into the lakes, a lot of nitrogen, a lot of \nphosphorous--the things that cause algal blooms to grow. Then we had \nsome hot weather. That is a bad combination.\n  Again, I see my colleague Senator Brown is on the floor too. We \ndrafted legislation to get the EPA more engaged in this issue, to help \nOhio more, and to help all of the States represented here.\n  We have had this legislation on the floor of the Senate for over 40 \ndays--45 days, I think. We have had it cleared on both sides of the \naisle. In other words, there is no substantive concern about it. It \ntook a while to do that.\n  We had to work with some people on my side of the aisle who thought \nmaybe EPA didn't have a role here. But EPA does have a role. It is a \nreally important role. It can bring best practices, and it certainly \ncan bring the best research done in the country. It happens to be done \nin Cincinnati, among other places, at EPA. We have required EPA under \nthis legislation to come up with a plan to deal with this issue \nimmediately for Lake Erie, working with the other agencies, such as \nUSGS, NOAA, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and \nUSDA, and to come up with a plan that helps us to deal with this issue \nright now.\n  If you live in the Toledo area this evening, you are worried. There \nis a watch on. Once again, you are worried that you are not going to \nhave water supply that is safe for you and your kids. If you live \nsomewhere else along the lake--say, in Cleveland or Sandusky--you are \nworried too because these same toxic algal blooms know no barriers, \nknow no boundaries, and they move around the lake.\n  All we are asking tonight is that we be able to pass legislation that \nis straightforward, that is nonpartisan. It is not just bipartisan. I \nwould say it is nonpartisan. It is very sensible, and it highlights the \nneed for us to take immediate action because it talks about some of the \nissues that are involved.\n  There are 42 water systems in Ohio that are now susceptible to \nharmful algal blooms, for instance. It talks about the fact that we \nhave to be sure that we are not just protecting Lake Erie but other \nbodies of freshwater, and it forces the EPA to come up with a plan that \nhelps us deal with this issue right now.\n  This legislation passed the House already. It didn't just pass the \nHouse; it passed the House with a vote of 375 to 37. Not many pieces of \nlegislation pass the House with those kinds of numbers. Again, Senator \nBrown and I have been trying for more than 4 months to get that House-\npassed bill passed here in the Senate. We have worked through the \nsubstantive problems. I tried to do this on Thursday evening, and I was \ntold I had to stop and I was going to get blocked from doing it because \nthe other side had other legislation they wanted to consider that had \nnot been passed in the House--much less passed in the House 375 to 37.\n  If we pass this legislation tonight and if we are able to get it \nthrough with a voice vote and get it done, it will go to the President \nand he will sign it. In other words, it will become law. That is what \nthe people I represent are looking for.\n  Again, I notice my colleague Senator Brown is on the floor. If he is \ninterested, I would certainly yield to him. Any comments he has, I \nwould appreciate hearing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I will be brief and turn it back to Senator Portman.\n  We worked on this issue for a long time. We remember what happened \nwith algal blooms 4 years ago. We remember just last year--1 year ago--\nin August, 500,000 people in northwest Ohio didn't have drinking water. \nImagine what that does to a community for 2\\1/2\\, 3 days.\n  We know that the Western Basin of Lake Erie is the shallowest part of \nany of the Great Lakes--only 30 feet deep in the Western Basin. \nContrast that with Lake Superior, where 600 feet deep is the average. \nYou can see the vulnerability of Lake Erie and what it means. Whether \nit is from runoff, whether it is from agriculture and homeowners and \ncommercial and industrial establishments, the Maumee River Basin is the \nlargest river feeding any of the Great Lakes. Whether it is coming \ntogether on climate change and heating of the water and all the issues \nthat affect the short term and long term, our legislation will help us \nthis year and help us the next couple of years. We obviously need long-\nterm solutions. This is critical.\n  I called the mayor of Toledo today, and I know Senator Portman is \nworking with the city, the county, the State EPA, and the U.S. EPA on \nthis. This is very crucial for people in our State and ultimately \nthroughout the Great Lakes as these problems proliferate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his \ngood work on this bill. He helped to improve this legislation and make \nit more effective. It is about having the EPA play a bigger role on not \nonly how we monitor but also how we treat the water and how we \nestablish when there is a problem. This is needed, it is needed now, \nand it is immediate.\n  This is a photograph that was taken about 8 days ago--not this past \nweek but the weekend before--on the lake. The jar in the photograph was \ncollected by the charter boat captain. He is actually one of the \ncharter boat captains who go out every day and collect samples that are \nthen used by the experts to determine not just where the algal blooms \nare but the level of toxicity. This is what we found. As you can see, \nthat doesn't look very appetizing. It is thick and green. It is filled \nwith the kinds of toxins that can affect people in very negative ways \nif they get in the drinking water. We know that people are getting \nrashes right now from some other freshwater reservoirs in our area, \nfrom being in contact with the water.\n  If we don't deal with this issue, we know we are going to have more \nof this. We know it has already cost our communities a lot to mitigate \nit. In Grand Lake St. Marys, as I mentioned earlier, they have already \nshut down some of the beaches because of this. The city of Celina \nspends $450,000 annually to deal with this. So this is also a taxpayer \nissue. Columbus was recently forced to spend $700,000 to mitigate an \noutbreak in their reservoir. This is happening right now as we speak.\n  We just want this legislation to be out there as one of the tools in \nthe toolbox to deal with it, and it is a very sensible one. It gets the \nEPA engaged in a way so that Republicans and Democrats in both the \nHouse and Senate can agree on it. Let's get this done tonight.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 212\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that we get this legislation done now by asking \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to H.R. 212, which is at the \ndesk, and that the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we have been through this before, so I \nthink the Senator from Ohio knows what I am going to say. The bill he \nproposes to go forward on these terms has been paired by our side with \nthe National Estuary Program, which, like his bill, is bipartisan and, \nlike his bill, is not controversial. It has been passed over and over \nagain by the Senate. Indeed, I think it was originally the work of \nRepublican Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island. It has been passed by \nthe House over and over again. This is a reauthorization. If we clear \nit through the House, it will go to the President for signing.\n  Our bill came through the Environment and Public Works Committee in \nregular order, whereas this came over from the House, was held at the \ndesk, was never reviewed by the committee of jurisdiction, and is now \nbeing hotlined, which is fine except that I understand it to be a \ntradition around here that we compare noncontroversial bills.\n  I don't understand. Our bill, the estuary bill, is noncontroversial \nalso. Our bill is also bipartisan. It is the work of Senator Vitter, \nwho is the chairman of the committee. Why is there this effort week \nafter week to separate the two rather than just pass them both?\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\n            Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 212 and S. 1523\n\n  So I ask that the Senator amend his unanimous consent request to read \nas follows: I ask unanimous consent that the EPW Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 212, which is the \nDrinking Water Protection Act, a bill to provide for the assessment and \nmanagement of the risk of algal toxins in drinking water, and S. 1523, \na bill to reauthorize the National Estuary Program; further, that the \nSenate proceed to their immediate consideration en bloc, the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bills, and the motions to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  If the Senator will agree to that so that the pairing is maintained, \nthen I will have no objection. If he will not agree to it, then I must \nobject because I don't know why these bills are being repeatedly taken \napart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Ohio modify his request?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. No, I can't modify my request because his bill has not \ncleared, and he knows that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Look, this is ridiculous. We have a health and safety \nissue on the floor of the Senate that is ready to go. You just heard \nfrom me and Senator Brown. It is bipartisan, bicameral, and is ready to \ngo to the President.\n  I must say to my friend the Senator from Rhode Island, who talked \nabout his legislation, that I have no problem with his legislation, but \nhe hasn't had it cleared. The Senator said this has been going on for \nweeks and weeks, and that is not true. This came onto our radar screen \non Thursday night of last week when, after over 40 days on the floor \nwith our bill, we got it all cleared, and then we found out just prior \nto my going and asking to have a voice vote on it that now they want to \npair it with another piece of legislation that has nothing to do with \nhealth and safety. It is a reauthorization of a program that has not \nbeen passed by the House. The Senator from Rhode Island said it has \nbeen passed by the House. It has not been passed by the House. It may \nhave been passed by the House in a previous Congress, but that doesn't \ncount. What counts is that our bill passed the House with a vote of 375 \nto 37, and it is now on the floor.\n  The people I represent deserve to have our government work for them \nright now to help deal with this algal bloom problem, and they are \nblocking my bill with legislation they say is nonpartisan and \nnoncontroversial?\n  I am happy to support their bill. In fact, what I did last week when \nI found out about it on Thursday was I started clearing it for them \nbecause they hadn't done it. I put it in the clearance process. As of \ntoday, there are some concerns on my side of the aisle. Nobody has seen \nit yet. They are seeing it for the first time. We went out of session \nright after I started clearing it, and we are back in session now and \npeople are looking at it. I am happy to support the Senator's bill, but \nthe Senator from Rhode Island shouldn't block our bill because they are \nlooking for me to support their bill. I am happy to support their bill \nbut not if it is going to keep us from moving forward tonight. I can't \nagree to pair it because there will be an objection because people \nhaven't had a chance to look at it. I know the committee sometimes \nlikes to pair legislation. They don't always pair legislation, by the \nway.\n  I think it is ridiculous that we can't move forward on a very simple \npiece of legislation that we worked on for over 40 days. And everybody \nis fine with it. There are no substantive problems. It is a health-and-\nsafety issue. Let's go ahead with this. In this instance, let's put \npartisanship aside.\n  I support the Senator's bill. I will support his bill. I will vote \nfor his bill. I will continue to try to clear it even though they \ndidn't clear it. I am the one trying to clear it. I don't know if they \nhave even cleared it on their side. I don't know if they even put it in \nthe process yet. But obviously you have to do that in order for this to \nhappen.\n  I am amazed that we are going to actually stop legislation that is \nneeded right now for legislation that has not passed the House, is not \ngoing to the President for his signature, and is not due to an imminent \nhealth-and-safety issue.\n  The Federal Government is not going to be there for the people in \nnorthern Ohio and throughout our State who are worried about the algal \nblooms right now, because of some disagreement on the floor of this \nChamber where at the very last minute Democrats stepped forward and \nsaid: No, we are not going to let this bipartisan bill go forward \nbecause we want to insist that it be paired with one that has not gone \nthrough the clearance process.\n  I commit to my friend that I will support his bill. I have had a \nchance to look at it over the weekend. I am OK with it. But it has not \nbeen cleared, and it is not going to go to the President for signature.\n  The House of Representatives is not in session this week, so even if \nby some miracle they could get their bill cleared here, they can't get \nit cleared by the House because the House is out of session. They are \ncoming back in September. We are in session. We can get this done. We \ncan send it to the President. We can let people know they can sleep a \nlittle more comfortably at night, with a little more peace of mind, \nknowing that we have actually taken action here to get this expert \nagency that deals with water quality engaged and involved to help the \nlocal folks, the State folks, and experts back home to be able to do \nthe right thing so they can avoid another water crisis and all of the \nissues Senator Brown and I saw when we were up there.\n  I went up with bottles of water, threw them in the back of my pickup, \nand they were gone like that. Why? Families were desperate to be sure \nthey had water for their kids. Mothers were desperate to make sure they \nhad water to be able to ensure that their families weren't going to be \nleft without access to what is perhaps the most important thing any of \nus can imagine, which is clean water one can drink and use for cooking.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 212\n\n  I again ask unanimous consent that my colleague yield and that we \nallow this bill to go forward. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to H.R. 212, which is at the desk, that the bill be read a \nthird time, and that the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I am sorry to hear that. I will be back again tomorrow \nand the next day. I will be back again and again because we want to get \nthis done. This is simple. There is no real mystery here. This is an \nopportunity to get something done that helps people not just in my \nState but around the country deal with a very real problem they are \nfacing this summer, now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I suggest to my friend the Senator \nfrom Ohio that if he is going to keep coming back every day, it might \nbe productive if during the course of the day he were to get his side \nto clear the paired piece of legislation, which, as I have said, is \nbipartisan. His colleague Senator Vitter, for instance, is the co-\nauthor of it. It has cleared the EPW Committee, which is chaired and \nrun by the Republicans now. If their side isn't aware of this bill, it \ncame through regular order through the committee that they run. If \ntheir side isn't aware of this bill--it has been sitting over here ever \nsince it cleared the committee. All they have to do is clear it, and we \nwill be done.\n  So perhaps if the Senator will put his effort into clearing a \nnoncontroversial, bipartisan bill that for decades has been passed and \nreauthorized by this body, then we can move forward. It should be a \nfairly easy task. I would be very happy to support him in any way I \ncan.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. So this is all about leverage--to leverage me to be able \nto help you on your bill, which I told you I support, in order for us \nto get something done that has been on the floor for over 40 days.\n  Look, I am happy to talk to my colleagues. I am the one who started\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\nclearing this on our side of the aisle. You guys didn't. I am happy to \ntalk to colleagues who have concerns. But they get a chance to look at \nit, just as you had a chance to look at our bill over the last 45 days.\n  So if this is all about leverage, you got me. You have leveraged me. \nYou have already done it. You have succeeded. I already started \nclearing it. I support it. I am happy to help, and I am sure Senator \nBrown is happy to help also, but let's not block this in the meantime.\n  We will be able to get your bill done; I am sure of it. I am sure, if \nit is as popular as you say it is, we can get it done in the House too. \nIt has not cleared the House at this point. In the meantime, let's not \nblock this legislation. This is ridiculous. This is not the way this \nSenate ought to operate.\n  We have a smart bill on the floor that has been looked at over 40 \ndays. It is ready to go. It has been cleared by both sides. There are \nno substantive concerns. And it is time that we deliver for the people \nwe represent.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Ohio \ngreatly. I know this lake is important to him. We are a State that is \nwrapped around the estuary, Narragansett Bay, and that, too, is \nimportant to us. If my friend is sure, as he just said, that this bill \nwill clear on his side, then I urge him to please go ahead and clear \nit, and let's clear this unnecessary blockage and move both good bills \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, just a short time ago, the Senate rejected \nlegislation that would promote and protect women's health and protect \nthe lives of unborn children. The legislation introduced by Senator \nJoni Ernst would deny the Nation's largest abortion provider taxpayer \nfunding and shift that funding to local health organizations to provide \nnecessary health care and medical treatment for women.\n  This issue arises once more after the release of several undercover \nvideos that successively have become more gruesome than the last. The \nvideos of Planned Parenthood that have been released so far reveal the \nbreadth of institutionalized disregard for human life at its earliest \nstages.\n  At the basic level of decency, we are repulsed by these videos \nbecause science and reason inform our consciences and lead us to the \ninescapable conclusion that lives are being ended through this \nexploitation. If individual organs and tissues can be harvested from \naborted babies, it is impossible to make the case that this is not a \nhuman life that is being destroyed. Why do we place more value on the \nparts and the pieces of a human life than the life as a whole?\n  In one of those videos, Planned Parenthood's senior director of \nmedical services noted: ``We've been very good at getting heart, lung, \nand liver, because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm \ngoing to basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna \nsee if I can get it all intact.''\n  Another Planned Parenthood official in another video--this one from \nCalifornia--said this:\n\n       It's been years since I talked about compensation, so let \n     me just figure out what others are getting. If this is in the \n     ballpark, it's fine. If it's still low, then we can bump it \n     up. I still want my Lamborghini.\n\n  These words by two different officials in two different settings \nreflect a view that unborn children are nothing more than a commodity \nto be exploited and abused and they seemingly would do that for \nmaterial gain. Is this where we would want our scarce tax dollars to \ngo? In fact, if we had an abundance, is this a place we would want \nthose dollars to go?\n  Critics contend that the videos are heavily edited. Yet the videos \nhave been released in their entirety and the transcripts of the full \nconversations have been provided. It is telling that despite full \naccess to what was discussed, these critics have not been able to \njustify their grotesque practices being described, nor the \ninappropriate tone adopted with regard to selling tissues and organs of \nan unborn child.\n  This isn't news. We have long known of the hundreds of thousands of \nabortions Planned Parenthood performs each year. If we can only avert \nour eyes and look the other way, as critics would have us do, we can \navoid what is obscene and hugely uncomfortable. That can no longer \nhappen. Light needs to be shed on an organization that destroys human \nlives while hiding behind the veil of women's health services.\n  It is alarming that Politico reports that Planned Parenthood's public \nrelations firm is requesting that members of the media refrain from \nairing the videos that expose the truth of Planned Parenthood \npractices. We cannot allow atrocities such as this to be swept under \nthe rug because of the power this organization wields.\n  Kansans have long made it clear they don't want their tax dollars \ncontributing to abortion providers, and I have worked to make their \nvoices heard in Washington. Taxpayers should not fear that their money \nis going to fund actions they find sincerely and seriously morally \nwrong. This legislation would prevent taxpayer dollars from funding \nPlanned Parenthood, allowing our taxpayers peace of mind and a sense of \nmorality that their hard-earned money is not facilitating something \nthey abhor.\n  Instead, S. 1881 would reallocate the funds Planned Parenthood \nreceives through grants back into their communities. The money would go \nto local health care providers that offer important women's health \nservices, allowing them to care for more women in their communities. By \ndistributing the funds Planned Parenthood currently receives through a \ngrant process to community health centers, we can increase the number \nof women's health care providers instead of funding a contentious \norganization that ends life. In fact, in our State, there are two \noffices of Planned Parenthood, but there are 50 community health \ncenters. It would actually be more available. Women would have more \naccess to health care services if the money was provided through \ncommunity health centers. We are a rural State and only through that \nprocess would many women be able to access this service. Hard-working \nAmericans--our constituents--deserve to have their taxpayer dollars \ngoing toward local community centers and county health departments, \nplaces that value life instead of destroying it.\n  Women deserve affordable health care, and it is being provided by a \nnumber of organizations that have nothing to do with abortion. We can \nand should support these health providers and we can and should protect \nthe unborn. We can do both. S. 1881 would be a significant step, an \nimportant step, in accomplishing both of those goals, and I believe it \nshould have passed with broad support.\n  Though I am deeply disappointed by the result of tonight's vote, I \nremain hopeful for a solution that will advance the life and health of \nboth mother and child. In fact, as science improves our understanding \nof the unborn and the practices of abortion providers are further \nexposed, I think a solution will be inevitable.\n  Unfortunately, that time apparently has not yet come, but I and \nothers will remain focused on this goal. I encourage my colleagues in \nthe Senate to act appropriately to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n Honoring Vietnam Veterans and North Dakota's Soldiers Who Lost Their \n                            Lives in Vietnam\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise to speak again about the 198 \nNorth Dakotans who died during the Vietnam war. In a moment I will \nspeak about some of the things I have learned about who they are.\n  I also wish to thank Vietnam veterans who have served our State and \nour country, and one of those Vietnam veterans is Robert ``Bob'' Wefald \nof Bismarck.\n  The year Bob graduated from the University of North Dakota, he \nenlisted in the Navy. He served 3 years on Active Duty during the \nconflict in Vietnam. In Bob's 2010 autobiography titled ``Moments,'' he \nwrote: ``Going to WESTPAC and Vietnam was the biggest and most intense \nexperience of my 27 years in the Navy.'' After his Active-Duty service, \nBob continued to serve his country in the Naval Reserve.\n  In 1970, Bob began law school at the University of Michigan and saw \nhis\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\nclassmates being drafted to serve in Vietnam. As a part of the \nuniversity's student board of governors, Bob led the movement for the \ndean to promise to allow drafted students to return to law school after \ncompleting their service.\n  While in Michigan, Bob met and married the love of his life, Susan. \nThey moved to Bismarck, ND, and spent their careers and even now their \nretirement in public service.\n  Bob's first job after law school was clerking for the North Dakota \nSupreme Court. He later worked in private practice as an attorney. In \n1981, he was elected North Dakota's Attorney General. I have him to \nthank for appointing me as assistant attorney general in the tax \ndepartment and for fighting for me to earn a decent wage while I was in \nthat position. Bob made me say that.\n  In 1998, Bob was elected as a district court judge and served there \nuntil his retirement in 2010. While working, Bob and Susan, who was \nNorth Dakota's public service commissioner for 16 years, raised three \nchildren. Throughout their careers, and now, Bob and Susan have both \nvolunteered to serve on many boards and organizations throughout our \nState, including the Boys and Girls Scouts, the American Legion, and \nBoys State.\n  Bob was the spark that lit the fire in making two significant \nmilitary projects a reality for North Dakota. One was establishing a \nState veterans cemetery and the other was having a Navy ship named \nafter North Dakota--the USS North Dakota. Both ideas became a reality. \nFor over 20 years, the vets cemetery outside my community of Mandan has \nbeen a beautiful resting place for those who gave so much to our \ncountry. In 2013, I had the honor of attending the 2013 christening of \nthe USS North Dakota, and I could see Bob's involvement in every \nthoughtful detail.\n  Bob is an example of a true public servant. Thank you, Bob, for your \ncontinued drive and your dedication to service. North Dakota loves and \nappreciates you.\n  Bob also wanted to make a point to publicly recognize other people's \nservice and sacrifice. One of Bob's University of North Dakota Sigma \nChi Fraternity brothers, Bill Potter served in the Air Force and died \nserving in the Vietnam war. Bob regularly writes about Bill to \nencourage others to remember and honor Bill.\n  Now I am going to conclude my series of speeches on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate by remembering Bill Potter, as well as other North Dakotans \nwho died during the Vietnam war. Today is the last of my weekly trips \nto the Senate floor to talk about the men from our State who died \nduring the war. I have taken to the floor 15 times to honor these \nfallen soldiers, these fallen heroes, and every time has been an \nenormous and special privilege. I have made it a point to reach out to \nthe families of each of the 198 North Dakotans who lost their lives in \nVietnam. I wanted to speak about each man so his family, friends, and \npeople who served with him would know how much we appreciate who he was \nand what he did for us. Learning from family members about each man has \ntruly been a great honor. To everyone who shared with us, I imagine it \nwas difficult to speak about your loved one, and I can honestly say \nthat doing so made a difference to my staff, made a difference to so \nmany people, made a difference to many of the Senators who have \nlistened to these speeches, and I hope it has made a great difference \nto the young pages who have been so patient as I have talked about \nthese fallen heroes.\n\n\n                        William ``Bill'' Potter\n\n  Today I begin with William ``Bill'' Potter. Bill was from Grand \nForks. He was born December 28, 1942. He served as a pilot in the Air \nForce's 432nd Tactical Recon Wing. Bill was 25 years old on February 5, \n1968, when his plane was shot down and burned.\n  The Air Force awarded Bill the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying \nCross in recognition for his heroism in aerial flight. For 7 years \nafter Bill's plane crashed, the Air Force listed Bill as missing in \naction.\n  Bill was survived by his wife Betsy. Betsy wrote the following poem \nregarding the need in her life to file for divorce from Bill while he \nwas listed as missing. Eyewitnesses had described watching his plane \ncrash and burn. This is her poem:\n\n     In my adult life as a serviceman's wife\n     I stayed home so ``the man'' could deploy.\n     Had dependent I.D. card--and first passport got stamped\n     '66 was a year of some joy\n     '67 not bad--'68 very sad\n     Potter's body got lost in Nam's shuffle\n     MIA was the status, completely non-gratis\n     And the Air Force told me that I should muffle.\n     Crashed in Laos (the site)\n     and try as I might\n     D.O.D would not call it a death.\n     Civil court was my choice if I wanted a voice\n     for my life to move forward with breadth.\n     As I saw no dishonor to distance myself\n     from a pilot flown into the earth.\n     The life I have led since Bill Potter was dead\n     Second husband, kids/grandkids and mirth.\n     Peter Rice career Navy,\n     now our son in the Army\n     continued our serviceman's code\n     As a widow, wife, mother, North Dakotan or OTHER\n     I have carried my share of the load.\n\n\n                         Herbert ``Herb'' Lapp\n\n  Herbert ``Herb'' Lapp was from Hebron. He was born February 1, 1923. \nHe served in the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Herb was 43 years old \nwhen he died on July 3, 1966.\n  He had seven brothers and eight sisters. Herb's sister Betty \nremembers him as someone with a great sense of humor and that he was \neasy to get along with.\n  Herb enlisted in the Army as a young man and served in World War II \nprior to serving in Vietnam. Five of his brothers served their country \nby serving in the military, and Herb's younger brother Edwin was killed \nin action in the Korean war.\n  Herb was then killed early in the Vietnam war, when he was shot in \nthe stomach.\n  In addition to his mother and siblings, Herb was survived by his wife \nJuanita; daughter Diana; and son Marcus.\n\n\n                             Roger Alberts\n\n  Roger Alberts was from Fort Totten. He was born on July 11, 1947. He \nserved in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. Roger died on February 5, \n1968. He was 20 years old.\n  Roger was the ninth of 10 children, and his older sister Winona \nhelped her parents raise Roger. Winona remembers Roger as a quiet \nperson who did many great things, including helping his family around \ntheir home. Winona said, ``Everything was good about that young boy.''\n  Roger had a desire so strong to serve his country that he enlisted in \nthe Army before he graduated from high school. At the same time that \nRoger was serving in Vietnam, his brother Allen was serving in the Navy \non a ship close to Vietnam. Allen remembers looking toward Vietnam and \nseeing flares and wondering where Roger was and if he was OK.\n  When he had less than a month to serve in Vietnam, Roger was shot. On \nFebruary 2, his family received notice that Roger was missing. Finally, \nat the end of February, the Army confirmed that they found his body and \nthat Roger had been killed. They later learned from another North \nDakota soldier, Wesley Howling Wolf, that when Roger died, Wesley hid \nhis body so the opposing forces would not be able to find his body, but \nafter hiding Roger's body, Wesley was hurt and went into a coma. When \nhe awoke, he told the Army officials that he had hidden Roger's body to \nprotect him and Roger was found.\n  Roger's family appreciates the Army for sending an escort to remain \nwith Roger's body until he could reach them in North Dakota, and to \nRoger's girlfriend for giving them the letters he wrote while Roger was \nserving in Vietnam.\n\n\n                        Mitchel ``Mitch'' Hansey\n\n  Mitchel ``Mitch'' Hansey was a native of Scranton and was born March \n25, 1947. Mitchel died December 14, 1968. He was 21 years old.\n  He grew up on his family's farm and was the oldest of eight children, \nborn to Dennis and Bertha Hansey. In his early years, he attended \ncountry school, and later graduated from Scranton High School.\n  His youngest sister Gwyn laughs and remembers the time she felt \nMitchel saved her life by kicking a grasshopper off her leg despite his \narms being full of the groceries he was carrying.\n  Mitchel's family is dedicated to serving their country. His father \nDennis served in the Army during World War\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\nII. His brother Terry served in the Marines, and his brother Gail \nserved in the Army.\n  Mitchel's siblings remember him sending them letters from Vietnam \nwith pictures of himself on a boat. They understand that when he was on \nhis way to mail them Christmas cards, Mitchel fell off a plank as he \nwas walking between two ships and drowned.\n\n\n                       Michael ``Mike'' Wolf, Jr.\n\n  Michael ``Mike'' Wolf, Jr., was from Beulah, and he was born June 27, \n1946. He served in the Marine Corps H Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th \nMarines, 1st Marine Division. He was 21 years old when he died on \nSeptember 10, 1967.\n  He was the fifth of 12 children. Mike's sister Laurel said Mike was a \nquiet man who was involved in just about every sport offered in high \nschool. His dream was to work as a high school coach someday. Mike \nenlisted at the same time as his cousin Rick Wolf and two of their \nfriends from Beulah enlisted. The day he died, Rick was sent ahead as a \nscout and was killed in an ambush. He had been expected to return home \nabout 3 weeks later.\n  Mike's 1955 Pontiac Chieftain sat in the yard for 30 years. Laurel's \nhusband spent 10 years restoring Mike's car and gave it to Laurel's son \nDonovan, who is currently having it painted. As a tribute to Mike, they \nmade a scrapbook which shows the process of restoring his car.\n\n\n                       Randolph ``Randy'' Marthe\n\n  Randolph ``Randy'' Marthe was from Esmond. He was born November 17, \n1950. He served in the Army's 52nd Artillery Group. Randy died March \n31, 1971. He was 20 years old.\n  He was the youngest of his family of 10 children. His older siblings \nenjoyed spoiling him and treating him like the baby of the family. \nRandy's sister Rita said he was a good, quiet boy who liked to have fun \nand never caused his parents any problems. Rita remembers that after \nshe was married and living on a farm, Randy and two of his brothers, \nPat and Dale, would go to Rita's farm to help. Rita's basement bathroom \nshower had a window in it, and Randy had a great time surprising his \nshowering brothers with a blast of cold water from the garden hose.\n  Randy's family appreciates the calls he made and letters he sent them \nfrom Vietnam. Rita remembers Randy calling her from Vietnam. He said he \nwould be going on duty for a while, so she would not hear from him \nagain for a while. She never heard from him again.\n  The Army awarded Randy the Silver Star for gallantry due to his \nheroic actions the day he was killed in Vietnam. That day, Randy's \nfirebase was under heavy attack and he defended his position, despite \nbeing injured and ultimately sacrificing himself, which saved the lives \nof many of his fellow soldiers.\n  In 2010, Randy's family was touched to read a Benson County Farmer's \nPress column written by a young woman, Shell Eyl, who was born after \nRandy died but thought about Randy because she spent time as a child at \nthe Randy Marthe Memorial Park in Esmond. Shell wrote about what giving \nup your life for country truly means. She described a lifetime of \nmoments Randy didn't get to have, such as hot summer days by the lake \nand walking his daughters down the aisle. Shell concluded her column \ndescribing that Randy didn't die so his name would be etched on a \ngranite wall or for a park named after him. He died and gave up \neverything so you and I could have it all.\n\n\n                          Thomas ``Tom'' Senne\n\n  Thomas ``Tom'' Senne was from Valley City, and he was born November \n14, 1948. He served in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. Tom died on \nOctober 26, 1968. He was 19 years old.\n  Tom worked at the Red Owl store in Valley City and was looking \nforward to a future in that business. He was a great athlete and top \nwrestler at his high school. Everyone knew and loved Tom. He made \nfriends easily. He was so well liked that sometimes folks would look \nthe other way when he did things like take part in an impromptu drag \nrace down Central Avenue in Valley City on a Sunday morning. Now, I \nwould just tell you that is hearsay.\n  Tom came from a family with a deep history of serving their country. \nHis dad served in World War II, his uncles from both sides of his \nfamily served in either World War II or Korea, and two of his brothers \nserved with the National Guard.\n\n\n                              Cleo Levang\n\n  Cleo Levang was from Forman. He was born February 6, 1946. He served \nin the Marine Corps, Company I, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine \nDivision. Cleo died on January 5, 1967. He was just 20 years old.\n  He was the third of four children born to Cliff and Leckny Levang and \ngrew up on his family's farm northwest of Forman. His sister Bev said \nCleo loved to tease in good fun. She recalls Cleo visiting her, \nsneaking around behind her in the kitchen and opening the cupboard \ndoors behind her. After closing them several times, she finally \nrealized her jokester brother was behind the recurring problem. Bev's \nson Rick also went into the Marine Corps. Bev said that seeing Rick \nwearing a marine uniform is a striking similarity to Cleo in his \nuniform.\n  My friend from Rutland, Bill Anderson, remembers Cleo well. He said \nthat Cleo was a tall, good-looking guy with a ready smile. He \nparticularly remembers Cleo's exceptional musical talent, playing \n``Bugler's Holiday'' in a trumpet trio with the Sergeant Central Cadets \nMarching Band. Bill said that band, ``The Governor's Band,'' was, in \nfact, the best in the State.\n  After high school, Cleo moved to Wisconsin to work, but his love of \nthe trumpet and music drew him back to North Dakota and he enrolled in \ncollege to study music. With the Vietnam War beginning, Cleo joined the \nMarines. After learning of his death, his family said the 2 weeks it \ntook for his body to arrive felt like an eternity.\n  Bev appreciates the meaningful yet difficult phone call she received \nabout 10 years ago from the marine who was with Cleo the day he died.\n\n\n                         David ``Dave'' Nesset\n\n  David ``Dave'' Nesset was from Fargo. He was born April 16, 1942. He \nserved in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. Dave died on April 19, 1968, \n3 days after his 26th birthday.\n  Dave and his sister Arlene grew up in Fargo. Their father Oscar \nworked for the North Dakota State University Extension Service and \nlived in different parts of the world, including Iran and Korea, with \nhis wife and children. After graduating from Fargo Central High School, \nDave earned a degree from NDSU. He enlisted in the Army and became a \nhelicopter pilot.\n  Dave's sister Arlene named her son David after her brother. The \nyounger Dave remembers his uncle's infectious smile and said it was \nalways a pleasure to see him. He was their ``cool'' uncle. He still \nclearly remembers when he was in the third grade and his mother \nreceived a call in the middle of the night from her parents in Korea \nexplaining that Dave was missing and, a few hours later, an officer \ncoming to his door to deliver his mother a telegram explaining her \nbrother had died.\n  Dave and Arlene's mother Ruth lives in Colorado and is 104 years old. \nShe is a woman who has buried both of her children during her lifetime.\n\n\n                             David Johnson\n\n  David Johnson was born August 20, 1950. He spent his high school \nyears in West Fargo. He served in the Army's 25th Infantry Division. \nDavid was only 19 years old when he died on May 17, 1970.\n  Right after high school, David chose to enlist in the Army. His \nsister Eva believes David's trip to basic training in California was \nhis first airplane ride. While David was serving in Vietnam, Eva's \nfirst daughter, Stephanie, was born. David became Stephanie's godfather \nby proxy. About 2 months later, Dave was wounded and died. When she had \nchildren of her own, Stephanie named her son Nelson David in honor of \nthe uncle she never met.\n  In the 1980s, the Fargo area Armed Forces rededicated a building the \nDavid F. Johnson United States Armed Forces Reserve Center. Fargo \nresidents chose David for his contributions, recognizing his Army \nmedals, including the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Army \nCommendation Medal, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.\n  Members of David's 3rd Platoon, called the Bobcats, maintain contact \nwith David's family. In June, the Bobcats held their annual reunion in \nFargo. They held a memorial service and visited David's grave. His \nsisters and their families were thankful to the Bobcats for inviting \nthem and helping David's memory to live on.\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\n                              Jon Robbins\n\n  Jon Robbins was from Dickinson, and he was born November 22, 1947. He \nserved in the Army's 56th Postal Unit as a clerk. Jon died February 23, \n1969. He was 21 years old.\n  Lester Davies is a man who calls himself Jon's Army buddy.\n  I want to read a poem that Lester shared that he wrote about Jon the \nday Jon died. I think Lester's poem is a tribute to all of the people \nwho served in the Vietnam War who had little to no combat training. \nThese people were nurses, clerks, and other staff. Lester's poem is \ntitled, ``The February Awakening.''\n\n     From peaceful sleep and dreams of home\n     I'm thrown into the night.\n     At two A.M. the twenty-third\n     I know that I must fight,\n     For sirens blow, as rockets fall\n     And flares illume the night.\n     I still recall with saddened heart\n     The night I went to war\n     And how I lost, so thoroughly,\n     My innocence before.\n     I know that I will ne'er forget\n     The UGLINESS of war.\n     When charlie hit from out 'the night\n     He came intent to kill.\n     Just office clerks who'd never fought,\n     We met him on our will.\n     And so the price we paid was dear--Jon Robbins did they kill!\n     A shocking hell to see him fall, But one of many more.\n     And now I wonder why I made it\n     Through that night of war.\n     Yes I'm alive and free to do\n     What Jon will do no more--\n     And so I'll ne'er forget my friend\n     Who wanted so to live.\n     Who gave for us his precious life\n     The most a man can give.\n     In freedom's name my buddy died\n     In his name must I live.\n\n  This is the 50th commemoration of the Vietnam War, and we all have an \nimportant part to play in recognizing those soldiers and families who \ngave so much and who were rewarded so little at the time.\n  This has been a project of great emotion for me and great love, and I \nencourage other people to pick up the mantle and remember those \nsoldiers who gave their all.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1881, which would \ntransfer Federal funds now granted to Planned Parenthood to other \nwomen's health care and counseling centers. It is a modest, commonsense \nresponse to the blood-chilling scandal besetting America's leading \nabortion provider.\n  To date, only 4 of the promised 12 undercover videos of Planned \nParenthood officers and facilities have been released. To be sure, in \ncoming months there will be more revelations about Planned Parenthood's \nprofiteering, violence, and fraud. There will be congressional \ninvestigations to cut through the obstructions and obfuscations of \nPlanned Parenthood's army of lawyers, spokespeople, and friends in the \nmedia. There will be criminal investigations into whether physicians \naltered procedures in violation of the law and in violation of medical \nethics to maximize the prices they could charge for the remains of \ntheir victims. There will be inquiries into Planned Parenthood's army \nof clerks, lawyers, and bookkeepers who turned barbarism into commerce. \nThere might well be civil litigation brought against Planned Parenthood \nby former patients who did not realize their harrowing personal ordeals \nwere being exploited for profit by people they thought they could \ntrust.\n  It may be some time before all the facts come out about the full \nscope of Planned Parenthood's moral and economic corruption, but the \nrevelations exposed in just the first four videos all by themselves are \nmore than enough to disqualify Planned Parenthood from continued \ntaxpayer support. After all, nobody is entitled to taxpayer money. \nNobody is entitled to it. Nobody can just assume that it is theirs. \nRecipients have to continually demonstrate their worthiness for public \nsupport.\n  I think we can all agree it is not too much to ask that our women's \nhealth care grants not finance a criminal conspiracy against American \nwomen and children. So, of course, we should pass Senator Ernst's bill. \nNow, it does not cut any funding. We have to remember that. It does not \ncut anything; it just transfers Planned Parenthood's grants to other \nwomen's and community health centers.\n  This is a no-brainer. This is something every Member of this body \nshould be able to vote for and do so enthusiastically. Yet this bill \ndid not pass today. It did not get past the cloture vote. Planned \nParenthood's defenders don't even want to debate it. They are not \nwilling even to bring it to the floor to allow it to be debated, \ndiscussed, and voted on on the merits at the end of the day.\n  Now, in a sense, I cannot say I blame them, but the fear of open \ndialogue on the other side of the aisle is itself part and parcel of \nthe unfolding scandal. Now, let's be honest. Let's be honest about the \nfact that the multibillion-dollar abortion industry includes grisly \nrevenue streams, legal corner-cutting, and the bullying dehumanization \nof the human family's most vulnerable members. This should not surprise \nanyone who gives the matter 5 minutes of concentrated thought. For all \nof the political spin, at the end of the day, Planned Parenthood makes \nits money doing things any child could tell you are simply \nindefensible. That is why those things are almost never actually \ndefended, including on this floor today. Defenders of Planned \nParenthood offer, instead, gauzy rhetoric about ``care'' and ``access'' \nand ``choice,'' which are totally irrelevant to Senator Ernst's \nthoughtful, focused compromise proposal.\n  On the other hand are the shocking words at the heart of this \nscandal. Shocking words like ``abortion,'' ``organ,'' ``price,'' \n``crunch'' are carefully, almost religiously avoided. That is what you \ndo when you are forced to defend the indefensible. You distract, you \nconfuse, you talk about anything else besides the facts at hand. In \nthis debate, Planned Parenthood's defenders' true adversary is not the \nCenter for Medical Progress or the pro-life movement or the millions of \neven pro-choice Americans outraged by the scandal. Like all defenders \nof institutional violence, their real adversary is the truth.\n  The pro-life movement today may love different sinners and hate \ndifferent sins than previous social reform movements, but they fight \nfor the same truth: that not only are all men created equal but that \nall human beings are, in fact, human beings. Abortion on demand \nsurvives today as other peculiar institutions once did, violating a \nuniversal moral principle by disguising a biological fact.\n  Such is the nature of violence. As the Russian writer Aleksandr \nSolzhenitsyn put it in his Nobel lecture in 1974:\n\n       [L]et us not forget that violence does not live alone and \n     is not capable of living alone: it is necessarily interwoven \n     with falsehood. Between them lies the most intimate, the \n     deepest of national bonds. Violence finds its only refuge in \n     falsehood, falsehood its only support in violence. Any man \n     who has once acclaimed violence as his method must inexorably \n     choose falsehood as his principle. At its birth violence acts \n     openly and even with pride. But no sooner does it become \n     strong, firmly established, than it senses the rarefaction of \n     the air around it and it cannot continue to exist without \n     descending into a fog of lies, clothing them in sweet talk. \n     It does not always, not necessarily, openly throttle the \n     throat, more often it demands from its subjects only an oath \n     of allegiance to falsehood, only complicity in falsehood.\n\n  Complicity in falsehood, Mr. President, that some of us created in \nthe image and likeness of a loving God are not; that some of us endowed \nwith inalienable human rights weren't; that because of the color of our \nskin, the arrangement of our genes, the content of our prayers or the \ntiny size of a little girl's hand, some of us become them--all to \nabsolve ourselves from doing to them, to the weak, the vulnerable, the \nvoiceless, terrible, unspeakable things that we know are terrible. That \nis what violence demands.\n  Because the inhumane but all too common logic goes: If we all do it, \nand we all agree only to speak of it in comforting words, then, maybe, \njust maybe, we can tell ourselves it isn't wrong. ``Clump of cells,'' \n``tissue specimens,'' ``products of conception''--but even as we grope \nthrough this fog of lies, we all know the truth. We know that one day, \nthat truth is going to burn through the euphemisms like the sun through \nthe clouds. When that day comes, we are going to have to choose whether \nto stay complicit in the falsehood, to crouch down a while longer in \nour comforting fog or stand up and face the searing truth of what is \nbeing done to these little hands and hearts, our\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\nfellow passengers to the grave, still so fresh from God.\n  The day will come when, in an act not of reckoning but of love, \nAmerica finally sets these things right in full. That day is not yet \nhere. For now, even though Planned Parenthood apparently breaks some \nlaws, its lucrative business remains protected by others.\n  So even when we do pass the Ernst bill, and we will one day soon, \nPlanned Parenthood will nonetheless continue at least for a while in \nits grisly work, but not in our name, and not with our money. Planned \nParenthood has betrayed our trust and the trust of the women who came \nto them for help. Within the community of women's health and services, \neven among those who support its mission, Planned Parenthood now stands \napart.\n  Planned Parenthood has chosen a path we cannot follow, crossed a line \nwe cannot ignore, and profited from an unspeakable business we cannot \nsupport. We can, and under the Ernst bill we will, support health care, \nespecially for vulnerable women and children who are always targets for \nexploitation. That is why we must pass the Ernst bill, and why I urge \nmy colleagues to support it, to protect America's women and children \nfrom Planned Parenthood's ongoing abuse and to protect American \ntaxpayers from financing it.\n  We no longer have to be complicit in the lie of Planned Parenthood or \nthe violence that it protects. The Ernst legislation, S. 1881, finally \naccepts the facts, embraces the truth, and would help move our Nation a \nsmall step forward toward the culture of life America's every mother \nand child deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the University of \nSouthern Indiana, USI, on its 50th Anniversary. I also want to \nrecognize the outstanding faculty and staff for the extraordinary \nimpact they have had on the education and lives of hundreds of \nthousands of students.\n  USI was founded September 15, 1965, in Evansville to respond to the \nneed for a public higher education institution in southwestern Indiana. \nIt began first as a regional campus of Indiana State University and \nthen on April 16, 1985, legislation was signed into law making USI a \nseparate State university. The university started out small, but \nquickly expanded, sitting on 330 acres by September 1969 and today \ncovering 1,400 acres.\n  USI is home to four academic colleges: the Romain College of \nBusiness, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Nursing and \nHealth Professions, and the Pott College of Science, Engineering, and \nEducation. USI is a Carnegie Foundation Community Engaged University \nand offers continuing education and special programs to more than \n15,000 participants annually through outreach and engagement. USI also \nhouses the Indiana University School of Medicine-Evansville.\n  More than 9,300 students are currently enrolled at USI, and the \nuniversity serves full-time, part-time, commuting and continuing \neducation students. USI takes great care to keep class sizes small to \nmaintain a high quality of individualized instruction; 40 percent of \nclasses have fewer than 20 students and only 7 percent have more than \n50. These numbers reinforce an institution committed to its vision of \n``Shaping the future through learning and innovation.'' The USI \ncurriculum offers a wide variety of classes in 70 undergraduate majors \nin the areas of liberal arts, preprofessional, professional, technical, \nand occupational programs at both the associate and baccalaureate \nlevels, in addition to its 10 master's programs and a nursing \ndoctorate. With more than 140 student groups on campus, USI's student \nbody is living up to the university's mission to be an ``engaged \nlearning community,'' one that always strives to achieve its goal of \n``advancing education and knowledge, enhancing civic and cultural \nawareness, and fostering partnerships through comprehensive outreach \nprograms.''\n  USI has exceled outside of the classroom as well. The Screaming \nEagles compete as a member of the NCAA Division II athletics in the \nGreat Lakes Valley Conference. USI boasts 17 varsity teams and has \nclaimed three national championships--men's basketball in 1995 and \nmen's baseball in 2010 and 2014. The Screaming Eagles have finished as \nnational finalists three times--men's basketball in 1994 and 2004 and \nwomen's basketball in 1997. In addition, the USI men's and women's \ncross country/track teams have combined to capture seven individual \nnational championships since 1997. These teams have accomplished much \nover the past 50 years, all the while meeting high academic standards \nin the classroom.\n  USI has, for the last five decades, provided its students from \nsouthwestern Indiana, across our State, and around the country with the \nopportunity to achieve their dreams through higher education. USI \nremains representative of the hard work, dedication, and innovation \nthat are such integral parts of the Hoosier spirit. I congratulate \npresident Linda L. M. Bennett, the entire faculty and staff, and \nstudents both past and present, on this important anniversary. I am \nconfident USI will continue to be a fixture in southwestern Indiana and \nknow the faculty and staff will continue to provide an outstanding \neducation to our students in the years to come. On behalf of the \ncitizens of Indiana, I congratulate each and every member of the USI \ncommunity on this 50th anniversary. I wish the University of Southern \nIndiana continued success and growth for many more years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/03/senate-section/article/S6235-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BOB FRAUMANN\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Bob was married to the \nlove of his life, Jan, and they raised two sons, Rick and Greg, who are \nboth Christian musicians.\n  Many have enjoyed Bob's music but none more than those at the \nNational Prayer Breakfast on February 4, 2010, where Bob played \nselections from his great CD ``To God Be the Glory.'' Over 3,000 \ndignitaries including the President and many Members of Congress joined \nChristians and leaders of all faiths to enjoy Bob's testimony through \nmusic.\n  Bob's friendship and music have been a blessing to me, and I am proud \nto honor him in the Senate Chamber.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nNational Association of Community Health Centers, NACHC, for their hard \nwork and dedication to providing Americans with the care they need and \ndeserve. The association is celebrating 50 years of providing support \nthrough health centers across the Nation. A series of events will be \nheld during National Health Center Week, scheduled for August 9 through \nAugust 15, to recognize the importance of health care and to celebrate \n50 years of support.\n  The NACHC was organized in 1965 and held demonstration programs under \nthe Federal Office of Economic Opportunity to help Americans receive \nmedical support regardless of their income. Also during this time, the \nfirst four health care centers opened in Massachusetts, Mississippi, \nColorado, and New York. Since 1965, the NACHC has worked to address our \nNation's widespread lack of access to basic health care services.\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\n  Devoted to the mission of, ``promoting the provision of high quality, \ncomprehensive and affordable health care that is coordinated, \nculturally and linguistically competent, and community directed for all \nmedically underserved populations,'' the NACHC helps educate Americans \non the importance of health care. The NACHC also provides health \ncenters with a unified voice and a common source for research, \ninformation, training, and advocacy.\n  Maine currently has 19 organizations that run 135 health center \nsites. The 19 federally-funded health center organizations in Maine \nserve 184,546 patients, 17.8 percent of whom are uninsured, and create \nover 200 jobs. Mr. President, 89 percent of people relying on these \ncenters live in extremely rural areas of the State. These Mainers would \nnot be able to access adequate health care services if these sites did \nnot exist. The work that has been done in Maine continues to help the \nState become healthier and smarter.\n  The theme for this year's National Health Center Week is ``America's \nHealth Centers: Celebrating Our Legacy, Shaping Our Future.'' This \ntheme showcases the numerous ways in which America's health centers are \ndriving and empowering healthier communities and Americans. With more \nthan 9,000 delivery sites throughout the Nation, health centers employ \nhundreds of thousands of individuals nationally which, in turn, powers \nlocal economies.\n  During the National Health Center Week, health centers in all 50 \nStates will be hosting a variety of public events to highlight their \nwork in local communities and to honor the elected officials who have \nsupported the work of the health centers. I would like to join the \nNational Association of Community Health Centers in highlighting the \nsuccess that has been demonstrated over the last 50 years by local \nhealth centers throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/03/senate-section/article/S6236-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DAVID ALLEN WALKER\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize David Walker of \nFenton, MI, as he nears the end of his term as the 110th chairman of \nthe Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, also known as \nthe Big ``I.'' Mr. Walker was installed as chairman of the Big ``I'' in \nSeptember 2014, and has been a strong and thoughtful leader for \nindependent insurance agents across the country throughout his term.\n  Mr. Walker is president of the Hartland Insurance Agency which is \nheadquartered in Hartland, MI. Throughout his career, he has been an \nactive leader at both the State and national level. He previously \nserved as president of the Michigan Association of Independent Agents, \npresident of the Genesee County of Independent Agents, and as the \nMichigan director on the Big ``I'' national board.\n  Mr. Walker has also held numerous leadership positions within the \nMichigan Association of Insurance Agents, including chairman of the \neducation committee and as a member of the Michigan Legislative Affairs \nCommittee. In all his roles, David has sought to promote an environment \nwhere independent insurance agents in Michigan and across the country \ncan thrive by providing excellent customer service.\n  As I recognize Mr. Walker, I would also like to acknowledge his \nactive involvement in his community. He has served on the board of \ndirectors for the Hartland Area Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Walker has \nalso worked as a trustee and president of the Fenton Area Public \nSchools. He currently serves as a Tyrone Township trustee and sits on \nthe board of the Michigan Basic Property Association. He is also a \nfounding member of the Hartland Rotary.\n  I am pleased to join Mr. Walker's colleagues from across Michigan and \nthe United States in congratulating him as he finishes his term as \nchairman of the Big ``I.''

Mr. President, I am a firm believer in the power of \nhigher education. It is our Nation's responsibility to honor the \ninstitutions that consistently provide America's youth with the skills \nnecessary to make our country a better place. I am thrilled to \nrecognize the achievements of Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine \nScience Center, on its 50th anniversary as a center for marine studies.\n  Over the last half-century, thanks in large part to early \ncollaboration with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, the Hatfield Center has served students from community \ncollege to post-doctoral candidates. In addition to providing \neducational opportunities, the Hatfield Center works closely with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to research the most pressing \nenvironmental issues of our generation. As climate change and \nsustainability increasingly impact our Nation's agriculture and energy \npolicies, Oregonians can take comfort in knowing that OSU's Marine \nScience Center has the technology and partnerships necessary to \nspearhead State, national and global initiatives.\n  It always amazes me how quickly novel ideas transform into success \nstories. Since its establishment in 1965, the Hatfield Marine Science \nCenter has worked extensively with the colleges of Oregon State \nUniversity and various State and Federal agencies to produce seawater \nsystems, experimental wet labs, and other programs that have attracted \nsome of the Nation's top scientific minds. It gives me great pleasure \nto say that the Hatfield Marine Science Center is home to the Coastal \nOregon Marine Experiment Station--a program recognized internationally \nfor its innovative approach to the study of marine mammals.\n  I am particularly excited to witness the results of OSU's world-class \nMarine Studies Initiative. In addition to the construction of a top-\nnotch research and teaching facility, the Marine Studies Initiative \nwill offer students the opportunity to see how marine studies \nintersects with the other elements of a liberal arts education. \nThousands of young adults, as well as experienced professionals, will \ngain a greater appreciation for the role of business, government, and \nbig data in the world of marine studies. The addition of an \nundergraduate degree program in marine studies, projected to attract \n500 students in-residence to Newport by 2025, will yield tremendous \npartnerships in the years ahead. The Federal Area Redevelopment \nAdministration must be incredibly proud of the intellectual profit that \nits $960,000 investment has produced.\n  The future of our planet depends upon unique and innovative \napproaches to the environmental challenges of our era. Higher education \nis an integral part of the solution. But more specifically, \ninterdisciplinary programs that promote awareness of agricultural, \nenergy, and oceanic issues, and that simultaneously connect the \nenvironment to the liberal arts, are a key to building the training \nnecessary to solve imminent problems. I could not be prouder of what \nOSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center means for our State, our Nation, \nand for the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/03/senate-section/article/S6236-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO REBECCA ACKERMAN\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

A bill to prohibit the provision of Federal funds to an \nentity that receives compensation for facilitating the donation of \nfetal tissue derived from an abortion; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will be voting \non a motion to proceed to a bill that would completely eliminate all \nFederal funding for Planned Parenthood. While I do not support this \nlegislation, I have received assurances from the majority leader that \nshould the motion to proceed succeed, there will be ample opportunity \nto offer amendments. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity \nto propose an alternative approach which Senator Kirk and I will offer \nas a substitute for the bill.\n  Throughout my service in the Senate, I have been a strong proponent \nof family planning and measures to promote and protect women's health. \nThe fact is that the best way to reduce the number of abortions in this \ncountry is to ensure that women have access to family planning services \nthey need to protect against unintended pregnancies. That is why I have \nlong supported title X family planning programs.\n  My support for family planning aside, however, I was sickened when I \nviewed the recently released videos featuring Planned Parenthood \nphysicians in both their edited and unedited versions. The callousness \nwith which Planned Parenthood employees discuss the sale of fetal \ntissue is appalling. It deserves our attention. The videos also raise \nvalid questions about the ethics and legality of Planned Parenthood's \npractices in some of its clinics, albeit a minority of its clinics. As \na result, I believe a full investigation is warranted to determine \nwhether Planned Parenthood broke the law prohibiting the sale of fetal \ntissue.\n  Reviews by State medical boards are also warranted because it appears \nthat some Planned Parenthood doctors may have been putting the \nprocurement of fetal organs ahead of the well-being of their patients.\n  We do, however, need to keep in mind the fact that Planned Parenthood \nprovides important family planning, cancer screening, and basic \npreventive health care to millions of women across this country. For \nmany women, Planned Parenthood clinics provide the only health care \nservices they receive. The title X Federal family planning funding that \ngoes to Planned Parenthood already cannot be used for abortions, and \nthe Federal Medicaid funding it receives can only be used for abortions \nin the case of rape, incest, and where the life of the mother is at \nrisk. In other words, the Hyde amendment--which has been on the books \nfor so many years--applies fully to this Federal funding.\n  Some contend that other health care providers such as community \nhealth centers could somehow fill the gap in family planning and other \nwomen's health services if Federal funding were to be cut off to \nPlanned Parenthood. In my State, the four Planned Parenthood clinics \nsee almost 40 percent of the patients seeking title X family planning \nservices, and they treat virtually all of the patients seeking those \nservices in southern Maine. By way of contrast, the 20 community health \nsites in Maine that receive title X funding see just 17 percent of the \npatients seeking those services. If we were to defund Planned \nParenthood, other family planning clinics in Maine, including community \nhealth centers, would see a 63-percent increase in their patient load. \nThey would be forced to absorb 8,583 more patients if Federal funds to \nPlanned Parenthood were eliminated. Moreover, these other family \nplanning clinics are predominantly in central, western, and the \nnorthern parts of my State. None is in the area that is served by \nPlanned Parenthood in southern Maine. I don't see how we can ensure \nthat all of the patients currently served by Planned Parenthood can be \nabsorbed by alternative health care providers.\n  The bill that has been proposed by several of my colleagues would \nrequire women to give up the health care provider of their choice, when \nwe don't yet know all of the facts about Planned Parenthood's actions.\n  Therefore, I am joining my colleague from Illinois Senator Kirk in \nintroducing legislation, which we intend to turn into an amendment if \nwe proceed to this bill, that would require the Department of Justice \nto investigate whether Planned Parenthood or its affiliates have \nengaged in any illegal activity pertaining to fetal tissue and support \na report to Congress on its findings within 90 days.\n  Activities involving fetal tissue have no relationship to Planned \nParenthood's primary mission of promoting and protecting women's \nhealth. While Planned Parenthood claims that only a very small number \nof its affiliates engage in the sale of fetal organs and tissue, let's \ndetermine the facts. Those organizations that do engage in this \nreprehensible practice are the ones that have sparked this outrage and \nrightly so. I believe these are the organizations that should be the \nfocus of our efforts. I know none of the Planned Parenthood clinics in \nmy State engage in the practice of the procurement and sale of fetal \ntissue. I think we should keep in mind that we can come up with a more \ntailored and targeted approach that is\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\naimed at those clinics that do engage in this practice.\n  Therefore, our legislation would defund any affiliate or subsidiary \nof Planned Parenthood Federation of America that received any \ncompensation for engaging in these activities.\n  So the more targeted approach proposed by Senator Kirk and me \naccomplishes three important goals: First, it would not cause women \nserved by Planned Parenthood clinics that do not engage in these \nreprehensible fetal tissue sales to lose their health care provider for \nbasic services like family planning and cancer screening. After all, \nmany of us have been critical of ObamaCare because it has forced \nfamilies in this country to give up the doctor of their choice. Well, \nthat is what this amendment would do. It would require women and other \npatients to find alternative health care providers, even if their \nPlanned Parenthood clinic has done nothing wrong and is not engaged in \nthe reprehensible sale of fetal tissue. How is that fair? How is that a \ntargeted approach?\n  Second, our legislation would allow Congress to get the facts to \ndetermine if those few Planned Parenthood affiliates that do engage in \nfetal tissue procurement have broken Federal law and violated medical \nethics. We need to know the answer to those questions, and we need to \nknow how widespread this practice actually is.\n  Third, our legislation would defund those affiliates, subsidiaries, \nand clinics that do receive compensation for procuring fetal organs and \ntissues, thus putting an end to this reprehensible trafficking in fetal \ntissue.\n  I believe the proposal that Senator Kirk and I offer to our \ncolleagues is a more targeted approach, a fairer approach, an approach \nthat will be based on the facts, and is the best way forward as we deal \nwith this important issue. I encourage my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of our more targeted legislation.\n  This is the bill that should we proceed to the underlying \nlegislation, would be offered as a substitute to the bill by Senator \nKirk and me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/03/senate-section/article/S6242-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 240--RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE \n ADMINISTRATION AND ITS PARTNERS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE HISTORIC FLYBY \n                OF PLUTO BY THE NEW HORIZONS SPACECRAFT\n\n  Mr. MARKEY (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Gardner, Mr. \nPeters, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. Bennet) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation:\n\n                              S.
