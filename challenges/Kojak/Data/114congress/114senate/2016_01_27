Mr. President, the Energy Policy Modernization Act is \nthe result of months of hard work across the aisle. It passed committee \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support. Congress hasn't passed \nlegislation to update America's energy policies in nearly a decade. It \nis time we change that.\n  This broad, bipartisan energy bill offers a good way forward. It will \nhelp Americans produce more energy. It will help Americans pay less for \nenergy. It will help Americans save energy. Not only will this \nbipartisan legislation help bring our energy policies in line with the \ndemands of today, it will also position us to benefit from the \nopportunities of tomorrow. So let's work together and pass it.\n  The Senators from Alaska and Washington are proven bill managers. I \nask our colleagues who have amendments they would like to be considered \nto bring them to the managers. Let's get going and pass this important \nlegislation for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S215-9", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He was a weight lifter. He \ntook care of himself as well as anybody could. It is such a shame that \nhe is no longer going to be able to take care of his family. As Senator \nMcConnell said, our hearts go out to him.\n  But, as I said, if nothing else, please, everyone, focus on this: Be \nvery careful. There is still lots of snow out there, and if there is \nnot snow now, there will be at some subsequent time. Please be very \ncareful. You may think that you are powerful and you lift weights and \nall of that stuff, but be\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\ncareful because that snow is very hard to shovel. It is very heavy, and \nit can create problems.\n  My condolences go out to the family of Officer Alston. He was a \npolice officer, and we look out for our own. I am very sorry he passed \naway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S216-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, making America's clean energy future \nsustainable for our children and grandchildren has long been a priority \nfor Senate Democrats.\n  Today the Senate will begin consideration of a bipartisan bill that \nmakes progress doable on this important goal. We have long sought to \npass a number of priorities included in this bill. Through the stimulus \npackage, we made one of the largest investments in clean energy in the \nentire history of the country. In fact, let me just say it this way: It \nis the largest investment in the history of the country in clean air \nenergy.\n  When Democrats were in the majority, we fought valiantly to pass a \nbipartisan piece of legislation called Shaheen-Portman. It was an \ninnovative efficiency bill that would have reduced carbon emissions, \nwould have saved families and businesses huge amounts of money, and \nsupported 200,000 jobs in America.\n  We tried to get this done. The Senator from Ohio came to me and said: \nWe need to get this done. I said: I agree with you; so what do you \nneed? He told me what he needed, and we agreed to that. But I am sorry \nto report that on at least two separate occasions, my Republican \nfriends chose obstruction that prevented the Senate from passing this \nbipartisan piece of legislation. Then, even the Republican sponsor of \nthe bill wouldn't vote for it--his own bill. He voted against it.\n  Today we have another opportunity. This is the third or fourth time \nthat we are moving to this. I hope we can get this done. I think there \nis no reason we shouldn't be able to, because we are a responsible \nminority. We want to get things done. We want to pass legislation. We \ndon't want to obstruct everything.\n  Senators Murkowski and Cantwell have worked very hard to pass this \nbill called the Energy Policy Modernization Act. They did it through \nthe committee they are responsible for leading. I commend both Senators \nfor their sound leadership.\n  I am also happy--and I will just mention a few other things that this \nlegislation addresses. Part of it includes permanent authorization of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. We did some very good things in \nthe omnibus that we passed to take care of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. We funded it for 3 years, and that is more than we \nhave done in a long time. But my Republican colleagues allowed the \nauthorization legislation to expire last year for 3 months before we \nwere able to finally renew it. So I hope we can pass this part of the \nbill untouched.\n  Most of the key provisions included in the Shaheen-Portman energy \nefficiency bill are in this bill. That is really important. There is \n$40 billion in energy authorizations, including for basic research, \nhome energy efficiency, and clean vehicles. Those are just a few of the \nitems. Through these provisions, this legislation will save consumers \nas much as $60 billion. And not only that, it reduces a significant \namount of carbon pollution generated by dirty fossil energy sources.\n  It is estimated that passing the Energy Policy Modernization Act \nwould reduce carbon emissions equal to taking every car and truck in \nthe United States off the road for a year. That is a pretty big deal. \nOver the next 15 years, the energy sector will need to replace 2 \nmillion workers and hire an additional 1.5 million for new jobs. That \nis what this legislation will allow. This bill makes progress toward \ntraining a skilled workforce fully equipped to take advantage of high-\npaying job opportunities in the energy sector.\n  The Senate works best when Democrats and Republicans, the majority \nand the minority, work together on behalf of the American people. As \nwritten, the Murkowski-Cantwell energy bill could win bipartisan \napproval on the Senate floor, and we can do it right now.\n  As with all legislation, there is no question that the energy bill \ncould be improved, and there will be efforts made to do that. I \ncertainly solicit amendments, as did the Republican leader, but get \nthem over here. It is my understanding the majority leader is now \npromising to allow amendments. That is what the Republican leader said \na few minutes ago, and I am sure that is appropriate. Members of my \ncaucus welcome opportunities to help strengthen the bill. However, we \ncan't allow extreme Republican ideological amendments to poison this \nopportunity. The Murkowski-Cantwell energy bill must remain a \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  Clean energy, infrastructure, and conservation are priorities of the \nmiddle class and all Americans. So I urge my Republican colleagues to \nrecognize the good work of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell and work \nwith Democrats to pass this bipartisan legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S216-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PUERTO RICO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on another matter, the island of Puerto Rico \ncontinues to face billions of dollars of debt. I don't know the \nnumber--$17 billion. We hear all kinds of numbers. Puerto Rico is part \nof America. We must work together to address the severe economic and \nfiscal crisis that has gripped our fellow citizens.\n  I was in a meeting yesterday where I was told that on the island of \nPuerto Rico there is a shortage of suitcases--luggage--because people \nare leaving and most of them are coming to Florida. They are desperate. \nMany have said that the dire state of Puerto Rico's economy could \nbecome a humanitarian crisis, and that is really true.\n  The time to act is now. I joined Senator Cantwell and all of my \nDemocratic colleagues in calling on the Republican leader to advance \nlegislation that gives Puerto Rico the protection it so desperately \nneeds. We did send a letter to the Republican leader.\n  Any solution that doesn't provide Puerto Rico the ability to \nrestructure debt would be an abject failure. Legislation that empowers \nPuerto Rico to adjust a significant portion of its debt would not cost \nthe Federal Government a single penny. This is far from a bailout. It \nwould save U.S. taxpayers from the growing cost of inaction.\n  Over 3 million Americans live on the island of Puerto Rico, and they \nare looking to Congress for help in their time of need.\n  I spoke to the Speaker myself, and he has made a commitment to \naddress the economic emergency in Puerto Rico before the end of March. \nThis has to be more than a hearing. We need to have something done \nsubstantively to help that territory.\n  Today Democrats call on the Republican leader to make the same \ncommitment Paul Ryan has made to address the economic emergency in \nPuerto Rico soon. There is really no time to spare. Republicans should \njoin us in our commitment to assist our fellow Americans.\n  Earlier this month, I sent a letter separate and apart from the one \nall Democrats sent, outlining the steps the Senate can take to help \nPuerto Rico. If the Republican leader is unsure where to begin, he \ncould heed what I have suggested and appoint a task force to find a \nbipartisan solution to this economic crisis. But as far as I am \nconcerned, that is way down the list. I am not someone who favors task \nforces. I think the work should be done by committees and by our \ncommittee chairs and ranking members. I believe anything that one would \ntry to do--that is, having another hearing, appointing a task force--is \nonly an effort to stall the inevitable.\n\n  Puerto Rico needs help. They need to be treated as other American \ncitizens and be able to file bankruptcy. It would not apply to any \nState. It would apply only to this territory. We must act now to \nrelieve the hardships facing these people and avoid additional costs to \ntaxpayers because there will be additional costs if we don't resolve \nthis now.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S216-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S216-S217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2012, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2012) to provide for the modernization of the \n     energy policy of the United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:15 \np.m. will be for debate only.\n  The Senator from the great State of Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is good to welcome the Presiding \nOfficer back to Washington, DC. This Senator knows that the Presiding \nOfficer was back home in Alaska, and while they may not have had snow, \nthey got everybody else's attention with a 7.1 earthquake. I know it \nwas an interesting weekend for the Presiding Officer as well.\n  Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor this morning with a fair \namount of excitement and enthusiasm. We are beginning the debate on \nenergy reform legislation, S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization \nAct. This is the first time the Senate has debated energy policy reform \nin more than 8 years. It has been more than 8 years since we have had \nthis kind of debate.\n  I was here yesterday morning and had an opportunity to open the \nsession. I opened the session and Senator Collins was the Presiding \nOfficer in the chair. It was one of those interesting mornings where \neverybody else seemed to be female on the floor, and the press has \ntaken note of that. But that is not my point.\n  I left the floor and went out in the hallway where there was a group \nof eight or nine young kids with a fellow who works on the House side. \nI think he was giving them a little bit of a field trip, but I think he \nhad kid duty because so many schools were still closed on account of \nthe incredible amount of snow we got in Washington. I had a fabulous \nconversation with the kids who at that age are excited about being in \nthe Capitol and understanding the difference between a House Member and \na Senate Member.\n  They asked: Well, what are you working on?\n  I said: It is really exciting because we are going to be taking up \nenergy reform legislation that we have not done in a long time.\n  I asked the kids when they were born, and one little girl said 2007. \nI said that 2007 was the last time we had energy legislation on the \nfloor.\n  And since it sometimes helps to understand the passage of time in \nrelation to our kids I said: Look what has happened to you in the 8 \nyears since you were born. You have grown, gotten smarter, and been \nexposed to a lot of things.\n  Debate on energy legislation is long overdue on the floor of this \nSenate. This is a good bill, it is a timely bill, and it is a \nbipartisan bill. It deserves overwhelming support from this Chamber. I \nwas encouraged by the minority leader's comments and his encouragement \nthat through the process that we have built on the energy committee to \nmove out a bipartisan bill, it should enjoy the respect of good debate \nas we move forward to again attempt to modernize our energy policies.\n  At the beginning, I acknowledge the good and strong and very \ncooperative work I have received from my ranking member Senator \nCantwell from the State of Washington and thank her for helping me \ncraft this bill because it was truly a joint effort. It was a very \ncollaborative effort. I also thank the other members of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee for all the ideas they brought \nto bear and the support we have received from them bringing the bill to \nthis point.\n  To give folks a little bit of a background on how we came to have \nthis Energy bill--the first real substantive legislation we have had \nhere in 2016--it is worthwhile to talk about the process of how we got \nit because that in and of itself is a little bit unusual nowadays.\n  To segue just a moment, because it was last year at this time that \nSenator Cantwell and I were managing the floor when we had the Keystone \nXL debate. It was the first time in a long time we had seen regular \norder with a full-on amendment process. A lot of people did not even \nknow how to process these amendments. We worked through some 40-odd \namendments, and got everybody's attention that we can actually move a \nbill. It had some level of controversy. We did not obviously agree with \nmany aspects of it, but we moved through a process.\n  Well, it is January again, and the women are back at work. I am \nhopeful the collaborative effort that got this bipartisan bill to the \nfloor today will be reflected in the debate that goes forward. Senator \nCantwell and I sat down last January, when I became the chairman of the \ncommittee, and we talked about goals and priorities--what we were \nlooking for. We both said it was well past time to update our energy \npolicies, to do a scrub, to do an overhaul. We had a conversation about \nhow we might go about it because there were a couple of ways we could \nproceed. I could have drafted my own bill with my own priorities and \ntried to get the votes that I needed to move it out of committee, but \nif you do not have the support beyond your side of the aisle, it is \ngoing to be tough to be able to advance it to the floor and get it \nenacted into law. Senator Cantwell could have done the same. She could \nhave moved her own bill. We could have done messaging bills, but we \nboth agreed we are well past the time for messaging. We need to be \nlegislating and governing in the energy space, and in order to do it, \nit is going to take some cooperation, collaboration, and conversation. \nThat is where we started.\n  I went around to colleagues on the committee and began conversations \nwith them about their energy-related priorities. These conversations \ncontinued between our staffs. Our staffs also held dozens of bipartisan \nlistening sessions with stakeholders. We held them in Washington, DC. \nWe held them in other parts of the country. We held one hearing in \nKwigillingok, AK. The Presiding Officer knows where that is. Most \nothers know it as only some faraway village in Alaska, but I mention \nthis as it speaks to the level of outreach for which we strived.\n  After our listening sessions, we came back and really rolled up our \nsleeves. We held four oversight hearings and began with a 30,000-foot-\nlook about where we are in different energy spaces. We had our \noversight hearings.\n  Then we moved down to six legislative hearings on a total of 114 \ndifferent bills. These were 114 different bills that were not \nnecessarily introduced by just Members of the energy committee. These \nwere bills that were introduced by Republicans and Democrats throughout \nthe Senate and some House Members' bills that we had seen as well. We \ntook the testimony that we received from experts, advocates, private \ncitizens, administration officials, and from our home States and just \nabout every other State. We gathered all the perspectives that we could \nabout what Congress should do and what Congress needs to do to ensure \nthat our Federal policies keep up with the years of change in energy \nmarkets and energy technologies.\n  One simple case in point that reminds us of this 8-year passage of \ntime is this. Eight years ago when we talked about LNG, what we were \ntalking about was seeing if we could structure our LNG terminals so \nthey could be import terminals. Think about where we are now. We are \ntalking about how we export our LNG, how we can move it to share our \nenergy wealth with others. That is a prime example of making sure that \nwhat is happening within our energy markets, what is happening within \nour energy technologies is consistent with what our policies, our laws, \nand our regulations allow.\n  After we did all this gathering of information, we entered weeks of \nbipartisan negotiations to determine which bills should be incorporated \ninto our draft text. From the 114 measures, we took 50 different bills. \nAs one flips through the 400-some-odd pages of this Energy Policy \nModernization Act, you will see bits and pieces of 50 different \nmeasures offered by colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--offered \nthroughout the Senate.\n  Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen have been leaders on energy \nefficiency and we were able to incorporate a number of ideas in the \nenergy efficiency title of our bill. You will also see incorporated in \nit the critical minerals bill that I have been working on for years \nnow. Again, we are not just taking the ideas from this Senator\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nfrom Alaska or the Senator from Washington and introducing a bill for \nconsideration, we have solicited others for ideas and input as well.\n  The last step on the committee was when we went to markup. We held 3 \ndays of markup, which is a pretty good time to spend in committee. We \ndispensed with nearly 59 amendments and because of that very \ncollaborative process we solicited ideas from all sides. When it came \nto reporting the bill out of committee we ended up passing it out by a \nsignificant 18-to-4 vote. We agreed to report the Energy bill to the \nfull Senate for further consideration, and that is how we got to where \nwe are today.\n  I wish I could say we would see more of this type of collaborative \neffort in the Senate. We do not see this all the time. We did see it \nlast year, and where we have seen legislative success is worth noting.\n  The Education bill that was shepherded by Senator Alexander and \nSenator Murray was also a very collaborative process. I serve on the \nHELP Committee. I sat through the many hours of debate and oversight \nand markups. We were able to advance that bipartisan bill to the \nfloor--a bill that moved out of the committee unanimously--and we were \nable to advance it to the floor where it enjoyed strong bipartisan \nsupport, went to conference with the House, and has now been signed \ninto law.\n  Another area where the leaders worked cooperatively and \ncollaboratively--I commend Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe for what \nthey did on the highway bill. They worked through the issues that were \nnot easy but were absolutely necessary to get a longer term highway \ntransportation bill. That does not happen if you just elbow your way \nthrough. It comes when you work together. I think we have demonstrated \non the energy committee that we have done just that--working \ncollaboratively.\n  I have said many times that the Energy Policy Modernization Act is \nnot the bill I would have drafted if it were just up to me, and it is \nnot the bill Senator Cantwell would have drafted if it were just up to \nher. The bill is not exactly the way any one of us would have drafted \nit if it was up to just one of us. It is a bill we wrote together. We \nwrote it as a committee. We wrote it as a team and as a group of 22 \nSenators who care very deeply about our Nation's energy policies.\n\n  As Members are coming back, as they are looking at this bill, I urge \nthem to look at what is in the bill and where we have been able to find \nthe common ground. Look and analyze that because I can guarantee you \nare going to find things that are not in there that you wish were there \nand you are going to say: Lisa, how come my X, Y, or Z is not part of \nthis bill?\n  That is true. There is some X, Y, and Z that is not in this bill that \nI would really like. I know there are items the Presiding Officer would \nreally like--the two of us being Senators from Alaska--but we do not \nhave then opportunity to build a consensus on some of those issues \nright here, right now. So can we agree that what we have built with \nthis bill advances our energy policies, brings us more up to speed, and \nloosens the choke hold we have in certain areas?\n  We spent months modernizing our energy policies and addressing both \nopportunities and challenges, and we found common ground in many areas. \nI think we found common ground in more areas than we actually expected \nwhen we started this process--certainly enough to write a good, solid \nbill. We ultimately organized our efforts into five main titles. We \nhave efficiency, infrastructure, supply, accountability, and \nconservation.\n  We agreed to include the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act. This is the efficiency measure which I mentioned \njust a moment ago which Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen have been \nleading for years. I think it is very important that we were able to \nincorporate the good work of the Senators from Ohio and New Hampshire, \nalong with the support of 13 other Members, for inclusion in this bill.\n  We also agreed to include the LNG Permitting Certainty and \nTransparency Act. This act was led by Senator Barrasso, and 17 other \nMembers joined with him on that very important measure.\n  We agreed to include my American Mineral Security Act, which is the \ncritical minerals bill sponsored by Senator Risch of Idaho, Senator \nCrapo of Idaho, and Senator Heller of Nevada. Again, it is a piece that \nI think many would agree is vitally important. Having greater control \nof these important minerals is critical to our country's energy \nsecurity and we must not subject ourselves to complete reliance on \nothers as sources for their supply. We do not want to go down the same \nroad we have been down, for instance, with oil historically when we are \ntalking about our critical minerals. This is a huge issue for us.\n  We agreed to promote the use of clean, renewable hydropower, which is \na priority for Members from Western States, including Senator Gardner, \nwho helped lead, Senator Daines, Senator Cantwell, and me.\n  We agreed to expedite the permitting of natural gas pipelines without \nsacrificing any environmental review or public participation. This was \nan effort that was led by Senator Capito of West Virginia.\n  We agreed to a new pilot program for oil and gas permitting. This was \none of many good ideas Senator Hoeven of North Dakota advanced.\n  We took up a proposal from Senator Collins of Maine to boost \nefficiency within our schools. I think we all recognize this is an area \nwhere we can and should try to do a little bit more. It saves us in the \nlong run.\n  Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota had a measure to increase the \nefficiency of buildings that are owned by nonprofits.\n  We agreed to improve our Nation's cyber security--an issue we are all \nvery keyed in on. This was from legislation that was originally \npresented by Senator Risch of Idaho and Senator Heinrich of New Mexico. \nWe saw an amendment from Senator Flake on this topic as well.\n  We made innovation a key priority in our bill, with a recognition \nthat there is a limited but very useful role for the Federal Government \nto play early on in the development of new technologies.\n  I just came from a meeting this morning, a summit on advanced nuclear \ntechnologies. We spent a good part of the summit recognizing that when \nyou talk about nuclear and the future, innovation is key to what we are \nbuilding.\n  We agreed to reauthorize many of the energy-related portions of the \nAmerica COMPETES Act. You will recall that this was the measure Senator \nAlexander has advanced in the past. We took those energy-related pieces \nand incorporated them in the bill.\n  In some of the areas of renewable, geothermal is one that I believe \nhas enormous potential. We certainly have that potential in the State \nof Alaska, but we also have it in other Western States. This was a big \npriority for Senator Wyden and Senator Heller. Senator Wyden's \nlegislation and the ideas he has advanced have been key.\n  We agreed to promote vehicle innovation. This was a priority for \nSenator Peters of Michigan, Senator Stabenow of Michigan, and Senator \nAlexander of Tennessee so we were able to enhance that discussion on \nvehicle innovation.\n  We agreed to renew the coal R program at the Department of Energy. \nThis was based on a proposal that was advanced by the Senators from \nWest Virginia, Senator Manchin and Senator Capito, but Senator Portman \nwas also key to helping advance this.\n  We agreed to help protect reliability within the electric sector--an \nincredibly important part of what we do within this legislation.\n  We reform the Loan Guarantee Program at the Department of Energy. \nMany of us believe strongly that reforms were necessary, and we have \ndone just that to ensure that we do not have taxpayers at risk with \ncertain aspects of that program.\n  We agreed to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. As \nfolks will recall, that authorization expired toward the end of last \nyear. Within the omnibus, we successfully advanced a 3-year extension, \nbut what we did within the committee was we advanced permanent \nauthorization of LWCF with some reforms--reforms that were endorsed by \nthe full committee.\n  We have a provision in there as well that helps to address the \nmaintenance backlog within our national park system. People understand \nthat this year\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\nis the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. It is something \nworthy of celebration. Unfortunately, we have a real black eye when it \ncomes to maintenance and upkeep of our parks, so we have reviewed that \nissue and said we need to make steps to help address that in a way that \nis constructive.\n  There is a section of the bill nobody will talk about. The press does \nnot care to report about it, but I think it is a very good section. \nRecognizing the Presiding Officer's interest in regulatory reform, he \nwill be pleased to know we cleaned up the United States Code. We delete \ndozens of provisions within the Code that are either obsolete or \nduplicative. We get these programs on the books, we put requirements \nfor a study into law, and as long as they are still there--even though \nno one is reading that report anymore, even though those programs are \nnow obsolete because of what has gone on, they are still on the books. \nSo if you are worried about government spending and you are looking at \nthe conservative reason to embrace what we are doing, take a look at \nsome of the provisions we got rid of. They are old, they are outdated, \nand they are obsolete.\n  This is just a sample of the good work we have included within the \nbipartisan bill.\n  Many of the Members I listed are responsible for not just one \nprovision but for multiple provisions throughout the bill. It was truly \na team effort as we worked this through. We were counting up different \nparts of the bill on which we have seen Members contribute, and more \nthan half of the Members of this Senate are sponsors or cosponsors of \nat least one provision in the bill as we stand here today. Again, I \nthink that is representative of the process in which Senator Cantwell \nand I have engaged.\n  You may say: OK, you had a very thorough process. What is in it? What \ngood is it? What does it mean to me? How is this going to help our \ncountry from an energy policy perspective? How is it going to make sure \nthat when we talk about energy security translating into economic \nsecurity and national security--how does this all bind together? What \ndoes this do? How does this help our people?\n  There are many practical benefits to modernizing our energy policy, \nand I will start with the first obvious one. Every time you do \nupgrades, whether within your house or your business, you become more \nefficient. For example, we recently replaced the windows in our house. \nNot only did it make the house look a little bit better, but we are \npaying less on utility bills. My husband just found a good deal on \nLEDs, and he replaced all the lightbulbs in the house. He is all \nexcited about it because it is going to reduce his costs. He is worried \nabout costs. We should all be worried about costs. This bill helps us \nreduce our costs.\n  This bill also allows us a cleaner energy future because when you \nmodernize your infrastructure, when you use less, you reduce much of \nyour emissions. So for those who will be critical and say ``By gosh, \nyou didn't fix the issue of climate change,'' look through this bill \nand tell me it does not make for a cleaner energy future for this \ncountry.\n  This bill helps us to produce more energy and to be less reliant on \nothers. It helps Americans save energy. Again, when we save energy, we \nsave money and there is a more efficient environment. It will help \nensure that our energy can be transported from where it is produced to \nwhere it is needed. That is a big challenge we have nowadays. It will \nbolster our status as the most innovative Nation in the world. Why \nshouldn't we be the most innovative Nation in the world when it comes \nto energy? We have the resources here. Let us develop the technologies \nthat will allow us to access them in a way that is responsible, with \ngood environmental stewardship, that creates jobs, that creates \neconomic opportunities, and that truly allows us to be more energy-\nresilient. Why shouldn't we be the innovators and the leaders? Let us \nnot cede that to anyone.\n  Our bill will allow manufacturers to thrive without the fear of high \ncosts or crippling shortages, and it will cement our status as a global \nenergy superpower as we provide a share of our surplus to our allies \nand trading partners. Is not that a nice thing to know, that not only \ncan our energy be good for us and for America, it can be good from a \ngeopolitical perspective? That we can help our friends and allies?\n  When you think about the energy security, the economic security, and \nthe national security that come with energy, that is where it all knits \ntogether. The Energy Policy Modernization Act will boost our economy, \nour security, and our international competitiveness all at the same \ntime. It will help our families save money. It will help our businesses \nsave hundreds of billions of dollars. It frees up budgets. It frees up \nour ability to place priorities elsewhere. It will help assure that our \nenergy remains abundant and affordable, even as it becomes cleaner and \nmore diverse in supply. And it will do all of this without raising \ntaxes, without imposing new mandates, and without adding to the Federal \ndeficit.\n\n  Again, we are getting great gains for our economy, good jobs, and \nsecurity from a host of different ways. We are able to do this without \nraising taxes, without imposing new mandates, and without adding to the \nFederal deficit.\n  This is a good bill. This is a bill that is designed to go the \ndistance. It is designed to make a difference. I am confident that we \ncan proceed through this floor debate, and we can make it even better. \nFor the half of the Senators who have participated in this one way or \nanother, there is another half who want to weigh in, and I welcome \nthat. I think that is part of this process. This is part of a \ncommitment we are making to an open amendment process, but I hope we \ncan focus on the good that is within this bill and work to make it \nbetter and avoid the gotchas and avoid the poison pills; avoid those \nthings that are designed to do nothing more than to bring a bill down \nby perhaps making a political point. I ask my colleagues to treat this \nbill on the floor with the same seriousness that the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee treated it throughout this month-long process. Let \nus come together as Senators in the United States Senate to truly help \nmake a difference with our energy policies.\n  With that, I encourage Members to come down to the floor. We know \nthere are a bunch of rumored amendments out there, and we welcome them. \nBut we all know we have been delayed a couple of days by the snow, and \nwe have work to do. So I would urge colleagues to come to the floor and \nfile their amendments. I would also remind Members that if an amendment \ncosts money, it is going to need to be paired with a viable offset.\n  I remind the Senate that we are considering Senate bill 2012. This is \nnot a House shell. So we will need to table any tax amendments because \nwe do not want to be in a situation where we have a blue slip that \nprevents us from advancing to conference. I am throwing that out there. \nYou may have issues that you would like to bring up, but if it costs \nmoney, we have to have an offset. We simply cannot do tax amendments, \nand I know that because there are actually some that I am interested in \nas well.\n  I think Senator Cantwell and I are both in the same situation. We \nknow an open amendment process on an energy bill that hasn't seen floor \naction in a long time could have the effect of unkinking the hose. We \nknow there are a lot of folks that have a lot of good ideas, and \nperhaps hundreds of ideas, that this bill could include. Our intent is \nto work as hard as we can and as fast as we can to process as many of \nthese bills as possible.\n  Tomorrow we expect to have a busy day. Hopefully, by the end of \ntoday, we will have reached some consent agreement as to what the votes \nfor tomorrow would look like, but my hope is that we will be voting, \nvoting, voting tomorrow so as to process the many of the amendments we \nare expecting. It is unfortunate that we have lost a few working days \nto the snowstorm, but that is nothing compared to the 8 years we have \nlost as we have let our energy policies languish.\n  We know we are in a place and a space where our policies have failed \nto keep up with the changes in the market and the advances in \ntechnology. We know our policies in many areas are outdated, with \nopportunities being ignored and challenges going unaddressed. So we are \nhere. It is time to have the debate. It is time to work through an \namendment process. It is time to pass an energy bill in the U.S. \nSenate. And after the model of the\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\nhighway bill, of the education reform, and the very good work that so \nmany in this body have put toward this bipartisan effort, my hope is \nthat the Energy Policy Modernization Act will be the next bipartisan \naccomplishment on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my ranking member and good partner in all \nthings energy, Senator Cantwell. A very sincere thank-you to her for a \nvery cooperative and good working relationship throughout all of this. \nThank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I, too, rise this morning to talk about \nthe Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015. Yes, sometimes we can be \ncynical about this place and what we can get done; then, all of a \nsudden, we have a great opportunity to move something forward.\n  The Senator from Alaska said it correctly. This is a milestone for \nthe Senate. The fact that we are considering energy policy legislation \non the Senate floor in a bipartisan bill, or any bill, for the first \ntime since 2007 is a tremendous milestone. I thank her for her \nleadership and for her time and effort to put this legislation together \nin such a bipartisan fashion through the processes that we went through \nshown on that chart--hearings, listening sessions, discussions, \namendments.\n  I think it is appropriate to thank our staffs. Usually that is done \nat the end of a process, but when we have had a bill on the floor for \nthe first time since 2007, we should herald them in advance. Angela \nBecker-Dippmann, Colin Hayes, and I know Karen also played a big role \nin this, so I thank them.\n  But my colleague is a partner, as she said, in all things energy. It \nis interesting that the other Senator from Alaska is presiding at this \nmoment. We have all been working together. The Senator from Alaska, Ms. \nMurkowski, and I participated in an Arctic summit just last week in \nSeattle, focusing on another policy for our Nation--the urgency of \ngetting an icebreaker fleet for the United States of America and the \nother policies we need to do in the Arctic. So I have certainly enjoyed \nthe many efforts that we in the Pacific Northwest region focus on. I \nthink maybe that helped us a little bit in our outlook. It is not that \nwe agree on everything. Certainly, we don't. But I think we know where \nwe disagree, and we try not to let that get us held up. We try to find \nthe commonality in what we are doing in moving forward on the \nmodernization of our energy system and to make sure we are empowering \nthe private sector to continue to move ahead on things by making sure \nthat either the R investments or changes in policy get done on our \nwatch. That is really what the Energy Policy Modernization Act is \nabout.\n  I thank the Chair for her leadership on that effort and for steering \nus to this process that we have before us today. As she said, it is not \na bill so perfect that we are not going to hear from our colleagues on \nit. Since it is the first major piece of energy legislation in a long \ntime that we hope goes all the way to the President's desk, it is a \nprocess I am sure many of our colleagues are going to want to see \namendments on. We will work through them to the best of our abilities \nto hopefully improve the bill, but also not sink the bill with poison \npill amendments that we know either will get it vetoed or will not get \nit across the finish line where we need to take this legislation.\n  I am here this morning, along with the Chair of the committee, to \nthank our colleagues on the committee on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir leadership and input on this bill. Again, it was a process on \nwhich not everybody agreed, but the bill passed out of committee with \nwell over a majority of votes in a bipartisan way. I think that signals \nit should have good support here on the Senate floor because we went \nthrough a very deliberative process in the committee, and that \ndeliberative process means a lot of issues were aired, and we know \nwhere we can go and where we can't go on this legislation.\n  Again, it doesn't mean we are not willing to consider a lot of \ndebate; we are. It doesn't mean people aren't going to offer amendments \nthat are going to be challenging; they are. But in the end, I think if \nwe want to keep moving forward with empowering the kind of energy \nrevolution that we are seeing, we need to keep up on our side of the \nledger here in the Nation's Capital.\n  Much has changed in the last 9 years since the 2007 act. Before that, \nwe had a small bill in 2005, so we have seen some very dramatic changes \nin energy. Clean energy has certainly weathered the storm and is not \njust a pipe dream anymore. It is a key driver of our economy, and it is \nhelping us reduce our carbon emissions. Wind power has more than \nquadrupled since the last bill. Solar photovoltaic installations are up \nnearly 15 times. The number of LED lights--I am glad the Senator from \nAlaska's husband is such a cheerleader--has grown more than 90 times in \nsince that bill. The reason is, just as the Senator from Alaska said, \nthis is all about consumers who want to be able to save money on their \nenergy costs. Senators from Alaska get that, and Senators from \nWashington get that as well. We get it in a different way. They get it \nbecause they are constantly battling the highest energy costs in the \nNation, and we get it because we are constantly reaping the benefits \nfrom some of the lowest energy costs in the Nation.\n  We both have a great deal of concern here. We both want to protect \nthe industries and the economic opportunities of our economy. We know \nthat energy is the lifeblood of any economy.\n  The U.S. solar industry employed more than 200,000 Americans in 2015, \nwhich was a 20 percent growth in the industry in the last year. To put \nit into perspective, it has grown nearly 12 times faster than the \nnational employment rate during that same time period. So we need to \ncontinue this effort to make investments in the right research and \ndevelopment, the right technologies, in order to empower homeowners, \nratepayers, and even businesses to save billions of dollars in energy \ncosts.\n  Why are we doing this bill? As I said, it is an important journey to \nupdate our antiquated energy policies when we want to modernize our \ninfrastructure, and we want to maintain our global competitiveness. \nThese are issues that are part of our energy debate today because we \nalso want to reduce carbon pollution. As my colleague said, while this \nbill may not have everything we want to see from our side of the aisle \nin a carbon reduction plan, it certainly shows that we do want to see \ninvestments in clean energy.\n  It doesn't matter whether you are a Republican or Democrat, the \npeople of this country have said clearly that they want to see clean \nenergy and they want us to help curb climate change. We need to listen \nto our constituents, and that is why we are trying to move past some of \nthe issues of policy and move forward on things that will empower our \ncitizens.\n  The Senator from the State of Iowa, who is here, understands exactly \nwhat I am talking about because he, too--whether it is in wind or solar \nor biofuels--has seen the economic benefits of a changing energy \nlandscape for our economy and wants to make sure that businesses and \nratepayers are still empowered.\n  We are here because we need to update and modernize our energy \npolicies. That is what we did when this bill came out of committee with \nan 18-to-4 vote. And we need to build on the momentum of the \ntechnologies and how their deployment reflect new market realities. A \nvery important aspect of our energy debate is the Secretary of Energy's \ncompletion of what was called the Quadrennial Energy Review.\n  What are our Nation's energy challenges? It wasn't just an Energy \nDepartment discussion. It was the entire Federal Government weighing in \non what are the energy needs of our Nation. It is done every 4 years. \nBasically, what Secretary Moniz said in that report is that we are at a \ncrossroads, that the dynamic and changing nature of our domestic \nresource mix, expanded supplies of natural gas, and growth in \ndistributed generation are creating opportunities and challenges.\n  As the Secretary put it, ``the longevity and high capital costs of \nenergy infrastructure mean that decisions made today will strongly \ninfluence our energy mix for the considerable part of the 21st \ncentury.''\n  What was he talking about? He was talking about the fact that we are \nat a crossroads and where we make investments will mean that we will \neither\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\nreap the benefits of making the right decisions or stymie our economy's \neconomic growth by not making the right energy decisions.\n  When we talk about energy infrastructure, I try to remind my \ncolleagues we are talking about 2.6 million miles of pipeline, 640,000 \nmiles of transmission lines, 414 natural gas storage facilities, 330 \nports with petroleum and crude, more than 140,000 miles of railroad, \nand a diverse mix of energy projects and obviously an electricity grid \nthat runs from coast to coast.\n  The Quadrennial Energy Review talked about how we needed to modernize \nand upgrade that infrastructure and that the electricity grid was a key \npart of that. That is why you will see a lot in this bill about \nmodernizing the electricity grid and why it is so important to our \nNation--not only from an economic perspective of having affordable, \ncheap, renewable, clean energy but also in making sure we modernize the \ngrid to help us with cyber security.\n  Once again, a quote from the report:\n\n       Dramatic changes in the U.S. energy landscape have \n     significant implications for . . . infrastructure needs and \n     choices. Well-informed and forward-looking decisions that \n     lead to a more robust and resilient infrastructure can enable \n     substantial new economic, consumer service, climate \n     protection, and system reliability benefits.\n\n  That is why you will see a significant focus in this bill on \ninfrastructure, investing in technologies, cyber security, and making \nour grid more intelligent, efficient, and resilient--ways that we \nbelieve are going to help both businesses and consumers.\n  The bill includes investments in energy storage, which helps \nintegrate renewable energy. It has provisions for advanced grid \ntechnologies, which help make our electricity grid smarter and more \nintelligent, to move energy around more efficiently. It has cyber \nsecurity research and development. I don't think there will be anybody \nin the Senate who will not support this more robust effort on cyber \nsecurity given the challenges and the threats we face.\n  It has a focus on new renewable technologies, which are great \nbreakthroughs in helping to drive down costs. It has energy efficiency, \nwhich costs basically one-third to one-half less than new generation.\n  This chart shows the question of whether you want to pay 4.6 cents a \nkilowatt for production or 12 cents a kilowatt for production. I know \nthis. I would rather pay 4.6 cents. I would rather drive the costs down \nfor the consumer as a result of energy efficiency or renewable energy, \nas opposed to making investments in what we know is going to be more \nexpensive energy for the future.\n  When it comes to R, we need to make sure we are making the right \ninvestments for the future and that we are sending the signals that \ncapital markets will take as also a signal for continued investment.\n  We need to make investments in our workforce because as the \nQuadrennial Energy Review shows, we will need 1.5 million new workers \nby 2030 in the energy sector. That is a huge number. I will say that we \ndo not have the right tools in place to quickly train as many people as \nnecessary.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer would attest to this just in the \nbiofuels area. I am sure there are institutions in her State that are \nworking hard to help describe, train, and educate those in the biofuels \nareas so we can have a robust infrastructure--the science, the R, the \ndistribution, all of that. I know in our State we are working hard on \nthis with our national laboratories and Washington State University on \ngetting an advanced biofuels for the airplane sector because we want \naviation to move forward on using those fuels and becoming even more \nefficient.\n  There is advanced manufacturing here where it is about making sure \nour trucks have the same efficiency opportunities that we were able to \nhelp usher through in 2007 with higher fuel efficiency standards for \nautomobiles. Now we want to make sure we are investing in the same \nlevel of R for our advanced truck fleets in the United States so they \ncan reap the same benefits as fuel-efficient automobiles.\n  As I mentioned, the Quadrennial Energy Review laid all of this out, \nand that is why we took an effort with the committee on hearings that \nmy colleague already outlined with more than 100 different energy bills \nand a variety of input from our colleagues.\n  Yes, energy efficiency is front and center in this debate. In fact, I \nthink there were 22 different energy efficiency bills from 30 different \nSenators as sponsors and cosponsors in the discussion. I think in 2007 \nwe definitely talked about some smart grid demonstration projects and a \nfew things, but nowhere was energy efficiency or the development of \nthese policies--whether it is storage or distributed generation or \nprotecting ratepayers--none of them were as front and center as they \nhave been in this debate today. That is because energy efficiency not \nonly makes sense in terms of the environmental benefits. People have \nseen that it makes sense for the economy, and it makes sense for our \nconsumers. As I said, it drives down the cost of production and, \nobviously, when it integrates more sustainable resources, efficiency \nbecomes a cheaper, better job creator and carries lower environmental \ncosts than the alternative. Not only does it save consumers money, but \nit helps add to the flexibility of our grid and reduces carbon.\n  I want to thank a few of our colleagues who have worked so hard on \nhelping us put this legislation together. My colleague from Alaska \nmentioned the Shaheen-Portman piece of legislation, which is a key \ncornerstone of this bill when it comes to the energy efficiency area. \nIt encompasses much of their work. They have obviously been stalwarts \nfor years trying to get energy efficiency legislation moved through the \nSenate. Many of the provisions they have sought in the past are now in \nthis bill. I commend them for their efforts.\n  Residential and commercial buildings consume 40 percent of our U.S. \nenergy. That is roughly $430 billion. When you talk about focusing on \nmaking our buildings more efficient and addressing that sector of our \nenergy needs, there are some true savings.\n  In the past, energy buildings and equipment standards have lowered \nthe costs, and they expected to save roughly 3 billion metric tons of \ncarbon emissions, which is the equivalent of carbon emissions of 42 \nmillion vehicles in a 15-year period. Just by focusing on our buildings \nand making them more energy efficient, we can have a tremendous impact. \nThat is why I worked with my colleague Senator Murkowski in authorizing \na section of this bill on smart buildings, and Senator Warren joined \nus. Smart buildings really will help us manage our energy loads better, \nparticularly focusing on lighting, heating, cooling systems, and \ncommunications between buildings. We heard from the Department of \nEnergy that smart buildings really could be a game changer for the \nefficiency discussions. I thank my colleague from Alaska for working \nwith me on that provision.\n  DOE has estimated that smart buildings can result in 30-percent \nadditional efficiency in the way buildings are operated when they \nrealize the full potential of these technologies. You can imagine that \nif you are an industry and you are trying to be competitive, what that \nis going to mean to have that level of efficiency. I know because with \nevery sector of economy, they are constantly focusing on energy costs \nas a way to be competitive, particularly in an international market. I \nwould say that one of the reasons we have so many server farms in the \nState of Washington--that is, storage data facilities--is because we \nhave cheap electricity. When you start saying you are going to drive \ndown the cost of electricity by such a significant margin, people are \nsaying, ``I want to locate there.''\n  We want to make sure we are empowering free capital and investments \nto help us reduce carbon emissions by focusing on giving those powers \nto help focus on smart buildings. This isn't just a U.S. strategy. This \nis something the United States could be world leaders in. The \nInternational Energy Agency says that the energy efficiency market in \nChina alone is expected to total more than $1.5 trillion between now \nand 2035. Think about it. They are building so rapidly, and yet they \ncould be incented--that is, by the level of investment the United \nStates is already making--to further their own efforts in smarter \nbuildings, reducing carbon, building more efficiently. This is \nsomething where U.S. solutions could aid. I hope we will continue to \nfocus on these\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nkinds of innovations in the U.S. agreement with China.\n  My colleague mentioned infrastructure as a key theme of this bill and \nmentioned some of those provisions. As I mentioned, utilities and the \nfact that, on average, the United States spends nearly 29 percent of \nits total expenditures on utilities such as electricity and natural \ngas--we want to continue to make improvements there. Data-driven \nintensive industries also, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, are part \nof the equation. We know as they continue to grow, we are going to want \nto make continued investments.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, the Bullitt Center, which has been an \nacclaimed building--probably one of the greenest commercial buildings \nin the entire world--is a net-zero building and shows how well you can \nbuild a building that both consumes less electricity and can actually \nput electricity back onto the grid.\n  We have many of these efforts in the Pacific Northwest where people \nhave seen that smart building technology is expected to grow from $7 \nbillion now to $17 billion in the next 4 years. It is a tremendous \nmarket opportunity for U.S. technology.\n  I wish to mention a couple of other provisions that our colleagues \nhave worked on in the bill and thank them for that. I wish to thank \nSenator Franken, Senator Heinrich, Senator King, and Senator Hirono for \ntheir efforts on energy storage that we have included in this \nlegislation. It includes a program that is focused on driving down the \ncost curve of ways to help with storing energy, whether you are talking \nabout battery technology or large-scale storage. I also thank Senator \nWyden, Senator King, and Senator Hirono for their focus on advanced \ngrid technologies--that includes demonstrating how multiple new \ntechnologies can be put into the electricity grid on a micro level. \nThis is so important. My colleague from Alaska and my colleague from \nHawaii both see the challenges of very different energy mixes than the \nrest of the United States and the challenges with transportation. \nHelping them on micro grid issues is critically important.\n  As I mentioned, making distributed generation more reliable and more \nintelligent is a very key factor in this bill. Senator Wyden did \nincredible work on making sure we added new renewables in the area of \nmarine hydrokinetic, geothermal, and biopower into this legislation. I \nthank him for that.\n  I know my colleagues Senator King and Senator Sanders--and I know we \nwill be joined by Senator Reid on the floor--are continuing to push the \nenvelope on innovative ways to make sure distributed generation works \nfor our citizens.\n  This is something we didn't get as much in the bill as we wanted. We \ncertainly put some new authority to make sure we are protecting \nconsumers. But I think we will probably see that people will want to go \nfurther to make sure we are empowering everybody--from members of the \nTea Party to the environmentalists who want to be in the solar business \nto those who put solar panels on their roof or anyone else who doesn't \nwant to be gouged for the cost of doing that by the utility. They want \nthe utility to make the investment, and they want to get a return for \nparticipating in reducing energy costs.\n\n  I wish to thank all of those who worked on the cyber security section \nof the bill, which, as I mentioned, is very important. In 2003, more \nthan half of the cyber incidents were directed at critical energy \ninfrastructure. So the bill today basically says that the Department of \nEnergy will be the lead role in coordinating our cyber response for the \nenergy sector and that we will be working on the R in partnership \nwith the private sector to make sure we have the right kind of \ninformation sharing to continue to make the kinds of investments for \nresiliency that we need to have for cyber security.\n  I would like to mention a few more items. The advanced vehicle \ntechnologies program--Senators Stabenow, Peters, and Alexander all \nworked on this section of the legislation to try to, as I mentioned \nearlier, take the same fuel efficiency we have in automobiles and do \nthe same thing for trucks. Companies in my State, such as PACCAR and \nthe Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, are already trying to drive \ndown the cost of truck transportation. Why? Because they see how much \nfreight the United States is moving to overseas markets. We see that we \nhave products we are going to sell to a developing overseas world, but \nwe have to move them cost-effectively, so we put a lot of work into \nmaking our truck transportation efficient.\n  I thank Senator Warren for her work on the Energy Information \nAdministration provisions and Senator Manchin for his work on workforce \nissues--which I am sure we will continue to hear about when we come to \nthe floor as it relates to our mine workers and a variety of other \npeople keep transitioning to new job training to make sure we have the \nworkforce for tomorrow. Lastly, I also want to mention my colleague \nSenator Heinrich, who has been very active on the workforce issues as \nwell and making sure we have grants for work shortages and job \ntraining.\n  I think my colleague from Alaska said it best--that this is not a \nbill which is about what everybody wanted but about what we could do \nand that is important to move forward now. It was built on a good, \nbipartisan process, and people were able to have input. We hope to \nfollow the same process here on the floor. I am sure my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle will want to talk about ways in which we could \ngo further.\n  The American Energy Innovation Act we introduced last September has \nmany of these provisions, such as having an energy efficiency resource \nstandard at a national level and getting Senators Bennet and Isakson's \nSAVE Act, which makes sure consumers realize as homeowners the benefits \nof the investments they make in energy efficiency.\n  I also mention my colleagues, Senator Reid of Nevada and Senator King \nof Maine, who have shared innovative ways to make sure consumers \nbenefit from being in the solar business.\n  I am sure we will hear from many more people on both sides of the \naisle about their ideas and how they would like to improve this bill.\n  As my colleague from Alaska said, it is important that we work \ntogether and not try to torpedo this bill but instead move forward on \nwhat has been a good, bipartisan process and continue to make \ninvestments for the future.\n  One of the last issues I wish to mention, as an investment for the \nfuture, is the success of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I am so \nproud that the Land and Water Conservation Fund was original \nlegislation by my predecessor, Scoop Jackson, a Senator who served our \nState for many years. I think the Land and Water Conservation Fund is \none of the most successful conservation programs in our country's \nhistory. It had been successful for more than 50 years before it was \ndismantled, but we were able to reestablish it in the omnibus for the \nnext 3 years. Obviously our committee came to a bipartisan decision on \nthis issue, and we believe it should be made permanent. It was such a \nsuccessful program, it should at least receive the same attention it \ndid for the first 50 years so we can continue on the same journey we \nhave been making so we can be sure we have open space in the United \nStates of America as we continue to grow.\n  These are important outdoor spaces that have generated an incredible \noutdoor economy for the United States of America. It has generated \neconomic revenue by providing the ability for people to go to the \noutdoors. I hope we will keep that as part of this legislation as it \nmoves all the way through the U.S. Senate and the House and to the \nPresident's desk--permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  At this time, I am going to turn the floor back over to our \ncolleagues so they can discuss this bill or other issues, but before I \nyield, I will reiterate that this legislation is about the \nmodernization of energy--the lifeblood of our economy--and driving down \nthe costs through investments on a new strategy for the future. It is \nnot about holding on to the past as much as moving forward to the \nfuture, and it will enable our businesses, our ratepayers, and all of \nthose whom we care about in that economy to continue to reap the \nbenefits of next-generation energy technology--renewable technology--\nthat is cleaner, more efficient, and will keep our economy in the \ndriver's seat\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\nfor our own U.S. economy and be a game changer for us on an \ninternational basis so we can provide solutions that are cleaner, more \nefficient for sure, and will help us deal with the carbon issues around \nthe globe.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know we will be breaking at the \nregular time for our policy luncheons. When I am finished speaking, I \nwill yield the floor so that the Senator from Arizona can make any \ncomments he wishes before we go into recess.\n  I want to say a few words about this legislation. I know that amidst \nthe polarization and the circus-like atmosphere of our politics these \ndays, people are really surprised to find out we were able to get some \nimportant work done here in the U.S. Senate in the year 2015.\n  While this Presidential selection process goes forward in Iowa, New \nHampshire, and South Carolina for both Democrats and Republicans, I \nthink it is important that we continue to do the people's work here in \nthe Senate. I can't think of any better subject for us to legislate on \nthan this bipartisan Energy bill which was ably led by the chair of the \nenergy committee, the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, and our \ncolleague, the Senator from Washington.\n  In my State and no doubt in other States, we have seen how important \nthe energy sector can be to jobs. Texas is suffering a little bit, as \nare places such as North Dakota, Alaska, and other big energy States, \nbecause the price of oil is so low. Actually, it is good for consumers \nbecause gasoline prices are cheaper than they have been in a long time. \nWe have been able to see how smart energy policies can have a positive \ninfluence on jobs and stronger economic growth not just in Texas but \nacross the country. So taking advantage of our natural resources and \ndiversifying our energy supply when we can is a win-win situation.\n  This legislation, the Energy Policy Modernization Act, will update \nour energy policies for the 21st century. I can't tell you how many \ntimes I have heard people say: Well, we don't have a national energy \npolicy. Unfortunately, that is true, but this Energy Policy \nModernization Act will go a long way toward developing sound energy \npolicy that will help us produce more energy, help us use the energy we \nproduce more efficiently, and it will allow consumers and businesses to \nsave money.\n  This bill modernizes the U.S. electric grid--the infrastructure that \nprovides us with electricity--which, of course, we don't think about \ntoo often until we have a brownout or a blackout as a result of some \nincident. It is very important that our electric grid be reliable and \nmore economical in the long run.\n  This bill also seeks to diversify our energy supply, including \npromoting research on renewable energy options while updating our \npolicies on mineral extraction as well. I think this legislation \npromises to allow us to continue to be productive now in this new year, \n2016.\n  I wish to add one other word about the Senator from Alaska, Ms. \nMurkowski, the chair of this important committee. Thanks to her \nleadership, Congress was able to pass legislation to finally lift the \nexport ban on crude oil--a ban that had been in place for 40 years. \nReally, that change was the most contentious part of this energy \npolicy. I think she has wisely separated those two issues and left the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act as one that does enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  We also need to continue to expedite our exporting of liquefied \nnatural gas, which this bill does. It will help us to get more of our \nenergy to international markets and will provide domestic suppliers a \nmore reliable timeline for building the infrastructure--which is not \ncheap--to allow us to export more of our domestic resources.\n  This has really been the story of our energy resources here in \nAmerica, where we have constantly underestimated the impact of \ntechnology and innovation when it comes to energy. Just a few years \nago, we used to talk about something called peak oil, as if all the oil \nhad been discovered and there wasn't any more there. Thanks to the \ninnovative use of horizontal drilling, together with fracking, which \nhad been around for 70 years or more, people realized that America \nholds the promise of being the next energy exporter in the not too \ndistant future.\n  I have heard the senior Senator from Arizona, the chair of the Armed \nServices Committee, make this point, which I enthusiastically agree \nwith: Our energy resources here in America are a natural security \nasset. What we see around the world, particularly in Europe, is that \npeople like Vladimir Putin use energy as a weapon. Our willingness and \nability to export energy will not only create jobs in America, but it \nwill help grow our economy by making sure our small businesses have \naccess to reasonably priced energy, and it will also help strengthen \nour friends and allies around the world.\n  I look forward to discussing the bill. I hope we can move on some of \nthe amendments that have been brought up on both sides of the aisle and \nin so doing continue to strengthen America's hand as an energy \npowerhouse in the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business for whatever time I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Overruling the Authorizing Committee\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, last month I came to the floor and \ncalled attention to a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act \nfor fiscal year 2016. I will remind my colleagues about the 2,000-page \nomnibus bill that all of us had approximately 48 hours to view before \nvoting yes or no on it. I specifically objected to a provision that, in \nan egregious exercise of pork barrel parochialism, reversed reasonable \nrestrictions on the Air Force's use of the Russian-made RD-180 rocket \nengine for national security space launches. I explained how that \nprovision was secretly airdropped into the 2,000-page omnibus bill and \noverruled the authorizing committee--in other words, an outrageous \noverruling of the authorizing committee. They dropped this provision \ninto the middle of this 2,000-page bill while we had hearings, \ndiscussions, markups, and debates on the floor of the U.S. Senate which \nconsidered 100-and-some amendments. So what we saw buried in this \n2,000-page bill was a direct contradiction to the authorizing process.\n  This process must stop. We have to stop allowing the appropriators to \nmake policy. That should come from the authorizing committee. I tell my \ncolleagues now: I will not stand for it any longer.\n  Sometimes we wonder why the Americans are angry and why they are \nsupporting Trump, Sanders, or some outsider. All they have to do is \nlook at the process we went through with this 2,000-page bill. It \nwasn't just the rocket engines; it also included hundreds of millions \nof dollars in unnamed projects, including $225 million for a ship that \nthe Navy neither wants nor needs. By the way, that was the second one. \nWe were supposed to build 10. So the appropriators--the Senator from \nAlabama--again added a $225 million ship that the Navy neither wanted \nnor needed, which was made and manufactured in Mobile, AL. We can't do \nthat. It has to stop.\n\n  Of course, they acted in a way that it now provides tens, if not \nhundreds, of millions of dollars to Vladimir Putin and his corrupt \ncronies. How do we justify such action?\n  The American taxpayers should be outraged to learn that some U.S. \nSenators want American taxpayers to continue subsidizing Russian \naggression and comrade capitalism. But those very Senators thought that \nif they snuck their blank check to the Putin regime into an unamendable \nomnibus bill, no one would stop them. I rise in the hope that Congress \nwill prove them wrong. That is why I will be joining with House \nmajority leader Kevin McCarthy to introduce legislation that would \nrepeal this section of the omnibus bill and reassert the will of the \nCongress and the American people.\n  It is morally outrageous and strategically foolish to ask the \nAmerican taxpayers to subsidize Russia's military industrial base when \nVladimir Putin, whom the Treasury Department\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\nhas reportedly accused of being personally corrupt, occupies Crimea, \ndestabilizes Ukraine, menaces our NATO allies in Europe, violates the \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treaty, sends weapons to Iran, and \nbombs U.S.-backed forces in Syria to prop up the murderous regime of \nBashar Assad, and all for the benefit of a rocket plant in Alabama.\n  I won't go into too many details here, except to point out that after \nthe United States imposed sanctions against Russia in March of 2014, \nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the space \nindustry in Russia, indicated several times that Russia expects that \nthe United States will not use RD-180 engines for military launches and \nthreatened to stop supplying them.\n  Rogozin declared: ``We are not going to deliver the RD-180 engines if \nthe United States will use them for non-civil purposes. We also may \ndiscontinue servicing the engines that were already delivered to the \nUnited States.'' He also threatened to deactivate all GPS sites in \nRussian territory and ban U.S. astronauts from the International Space \nStation by 2020. Rogozin suggested that in the future, the United \nStates should deliver ``its astronauts to the ISS with a trampoline.''\n  Later that year, Rogozin appeared to reconsider. After all, in order \nto design and build more rocket engines in Russia, Rogozin said, ``we \nneed free money. This is why we are prepared to sell them . . . taking \nthe sanctions very pragmatically.''\n  So what are Russia's two desired outcomes? On the one hand, America \ncontinues its dependency on Russian rocket engines. On the other hand, \nAmerica helps Putin go around sanctions by getting ``free money'' for \nrocket engines. And this is who ULA and its congressional sponsors want \nus to do business with?\n  At the same time, Russia has threatened to cut off supply, Energomash \nhas pursued other business opportunities with other countries that \nwould give Russia a freer hand in making good on its threats--most \nnotably, China.\n  In July 2015, President Putin signed a new law that consolidated the \nRussian space industry under a single state corporation, an entity \ncalled Corporation Roscosmos. This was done to enhance the power of the \nRussian Government to better implement state-based policy and control \nthe space industry. He signed an order that will effectuate this law.\n  In addition, Putin appointed Igor Komarov chief executive of the \nnewly created Corporation Roscosmos. Komarov was the former chairman of \none of Russia's largest carmakers and an adviser to Sergei Chemezov. \nChemezov, who was also appointed to the board, is said to have served \nas a KGB officer with Vladimir Putin in Germany back in the 1980s, and \nhe has been targeted by our sanctions.\n  Under the same order, Putin also appointed Russian Deputy Prime \nMinister Dmitry Rogozin, and the list goes on and on.\n  So why do we want U.S. taxpayers sending millions of dollars to the \nRussian Government when Vladimir Putin occupies Crimea, destabilizes \nUkraine, et cetera. To add insult to injury, this last year, on the \ndefense bill, we had to legislate to stop--to stop--the U.S. Defense \nDepartment from giving $800 million per year to ULA. That is the outfit \nthat now launches using Russian rockets--ULA--with Russian rocket \nengines. We had to prohibit the continued payment of $800 million a \nyear they were paying them to stay in business. It is amazing. I \nfigured out that roughly, since 2006, we have paid this ULA, which is a \ncombination of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, some $7 billion to stay in \nbusiness. It used to be called the military industrial complex that \nEisenhower warned us about when he was leaving office. It is now the \nmilitary industrial congressional complex that puts in a 2,000-page \nbill a requirement to build a $225 million ship that nobody wants and \nthat the Navy doesn't need, for the second year in a row. That is $450 \nmillion of your tax dollars that went to build two ships that the Navy \nneither needs nor wants.\n  My friends, do you wonder about the cynicism of the American people? \nDo you wonder why they think the way we are doing business in \nWashington is corrupt, when we spent $240 million in 2 years on two \nships that the Navy doesn't want or need and when we subsidize an \noutfit--the only one that until recently does space launches--and paid \nthem $800 million a year to stay in business, spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars on unspecified scientific programs, take hundreds \nof millions of dollars from medical research that has nothing to do \nwith defense and take it out of defense? Would we wonder that the \nAmerican people are angry and frustrated? Look at what we are doing \nwith their tax dollars.\n  I don't know if it was 48 or 72 hours that we had to vote up or down \non a 2,000-page, $1.1 trillion document, and no amendments were \nallowed.\n  So I say to my colleagues: Do not wonder; do not be curious why they \nare out there flocking to the banner of Senator Sanders, the only \nannounced socialist in the U.S. Senate and on the other side people \nlike Donald Trump, who has never had anything to do with Washington, \nDC. They should not be surprised.\n  Well, all I can say to my colleagues is that I am not going to stop, \nbecause I owe the people of Arizona a lot better than what we are \ngiving them. We owe them an accountability of why we would spend $800 \nmillion a year to keep a company in business. We owe them an \nexplanation of why we would over the last 2 years spend $450 million \nfor two ships that the Navy neither wants nor needs because they are \nmade in Mobile, AL. We owe them a lot better than our performance on \nthis omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I will be glad to talk more about how each individual was blocked by \nthe other side and would not agree to move forward and the rules of the \nSenate and all that, but that really doesn't make much difference at \nthe Rotary Club. What makes a difference is that we have wasted \nbillions of dollars of the taxpayers that were neither wanted nor \nneeded nor ever had a hearing in the authorizing committee.\n  I am proud of the work we do on the Armed Services Committee. We have \nliterally a hearing every day. We spend hours and hours and hours in \nmarkups and debate and discussion on these various programs. We have \nhearings with administration officials. We have hearings in the \nsubcommittees. I am so proud of the bipartisan approach that we take on \nour Defense authorization bill, working closely with Senator Reid and \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I am proud of the \nproduct, after literally thousands of hours of testimony, of study, of \nvoting, and all of that. Then we get a 2,000-page omnibus \nappropriations bill stuffed with billions of dollars of projects that \nwe never, ever would consider in the authorizing committee.\n  So the system is broken. The system is broken, and it better be \nfixed. I am telling my colleagues, especially those on the \nAppropriations Committee: This will not stand.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S224-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Federal Employees\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in 2014, I began coming to the Senate \nfloor almost every month. I came here to highlight some of the great \nwork done each and every day by the men and women who serve us in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I continued that effort throughout \nmuch of last year and plan on coming to the Senate floor every month in \n2016 with a new story to share. There is simply so much good being done \nacross the Department by the employees, our public servants who work \nthere. I don't think I am going to run out of material anytime soon.\n  As you know, the Department of Homeland Security is made up of some \n22 component agencies and employs over 200,000 Americans. These men and \nwomen work around the clock to protect all of us, our families, and our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\n  One part of the Department is called the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency. We call it FEMA. It has the unique task of keeping Americans \nsafe when everything around them has been thrown into chaos. In times \nof crisis, the men and women at FEMA coordinate rescue operations, \nprovide emergency medical care, and give shelter to those who lost \ntheir homes. Simply put, they bring hope back to Americans whose towns \nand cities have been swept away by floods, destroyed by a fire or torn \napart by a tornado.\n  Ten years ago, in the days after Hurricane Katrina, Congress passed \nthe Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act. That law completely \noverhauled FEMA from top to bottom. It increased its authority and \nstature within the Department of Homeland Security and provided it with \nneeded new resources. This legislation also required FEMA to bolster \nits regional offices and to build stronger relationships with State, \nlocal, and tribal governments. Taken together, these reforms have \nimproved our capability at all levels of government to respond to \ndisasters, while also improving FEMA's capacity to support State, \nlocal, and tribal governments as they rebuild.\n  Over the past 10 years, the men and women of FEMA have worked \ncountless hours to improve our preparedness for, response to, and \nrecovery from disaster. Bad things still happen. In the aftermath of a \ntornado, wildfire or even a snowstorm like the nor'easter we saw on the \nEast Coast this week, we still see the images of destruction and lives \nturned upside down on our television screens. Most of the work that the \nmen and women at FEMA do 365 days a year to prepare for these events \nand make them less damaging rarely ever get discussed.\n  Every day the men and women at FEMA create evacuation plans, stock \nemergency shelters with food and medical supplies, and they partner \nwith law enforcement and first responders in every state to improve \npreparedness through exercises and drills. In addition to training \nfirst responders, one of FEMA's top priorities is to educate and train \nall of us on what to do in case of disaster. The more you and I and our \nfamilies know, the more likely it is that we will be safe and will stay \ntogether during a disaster.\n\n\n                               Milo Booth\n\n  One FEMA employee charged with helping some of our most vulnerable \ncommunities prepare for disaster is a fellow named Milo Booth who \nserves as FEMA's tribal affairs officer. Milo is an Alaskan Native from \nMetlakatla, AK. It is an Indian community on the southernmost tip of \nAlaska.\n  After graduating from Oregon State University with a bachelor of \nscience degree in forestry and minor in economics, Milo returned home \nto serve as the Metlakatla Indian community's director of forestry and \nland resources, working to protect his hometown for the next 16 years.\n  After 2 years with the U.S. Forest Service, Milo moved to FEMA to \nserve as the National Tribal Affairs Advisor, and that is what he does \ntoday. In this role, Milo works to communicate disaster preparedness to \nreservations, Alaskan Native villages, and tribes across the country. \nThese communities, some of the most remote and isolated in the country, \nare also most at risk in times of disasters. Ensuring that these \ncommunities are educated in preparedness helps some of the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  As a FEMA liaison and an advisor to Indian Country, Milo doesn't just \nhelp the communities prepare for disaster. He also educates senior FEMA \nofficials in the Department of Homeland Security tribal affairs staff \non how FEMA could better prepare for and respond to hazards. In times \nof planning, Milo leads workshops and trains FEMA staff. He advises the \nsenior leadership on tribal policy, and he works every day to build \nstrong relationships between FEMA and tribal leaders and their \ncommunities. In times of crisis, when disaster strikes, Milo \ncoordinates with tribal emergency managers and FEMA regional managers \non the best ways to help and support these communities. In only 2 years \nat FEMA, Milo has visited more than 2 dozen reservations and Alaskan \nNative villages and has met with more than 100 tribes at trainings and \nregional tribal meetings.\n  Perhaps more important than any of this technical work that Milo does \nin planning is the work he has done in building relationships and \nearning the trust of tribal leaders.\n  When asked their thoughts on Milo, tribal leaders described him as \naccessible, responsive, and understanding, but most importantly, they \ndescribed him as trustworthy. They trust that in Milo, their \ncommunities have a voice at FEMA.\n  When Milo isn't working in Washington, DC, he returns home to Alaska \nwith his wife and two children, where he enjoys spending time with them \noutdoors. One of his favorite activities these days is going trout \nfishing with his young son, who says he wants to grow up to be just \nlike his dad.\n  Milo is just one shining example of the thousands of dedicated men \nand women at FEMA who work to protect hundreds of communities across \nour Nation, treating every one of them as if it were their own \nhometown.\n  The Presiding Officer will remember that Pope Francis addressed a \njoint session of Congress last September at the other end of this \nCapitol Building. He invoked the words of Matthew 25, which call for us \nto help the least among us, saying:\n\n       I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was \n     thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger \n     and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I \n     was sick and you looked after me.\n\n  These have become known as the works of mercy or the acts of mercy. \nMilo Booth and all of his colleagues at FEMA perform these acts of \nmercy each and every day. They protect our children and our homes, \nsaving lives and doing truly remarkable deeds. And for the thousands of \ncivil servants at FEMA and the tens of thousands of others across the \n22 components of the Department of Homeland Security, these acts of \nmercy are their life's work.\n  For all these things you do, for all these things all of you do, to \neach and every one of you, I wish to say thank you from all of us. God \nbless you.\n  The Senators from Alaska and Wyoming are on the floor. Good to see \nthem both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, at this time, we will resume the \nconsideration of S. 2012, which is the Energy Policy Modernization Act. \nSenator Cantwell and I have had an opportunity to speak, as well as the \nSenator from Texas, and now the Senator from Wyoming has joined us. He \nhas been a leader on these issues. He sits next to me on the energy \ncommittee and has worked on so many of the issues we have contained \nwithin this good bill, but the piece on which he has probably been most \naggressive and shown his leadership is what we have done to help \nfacilitate the export of our resources with regard to liquefied natural \ngas.\n  I am pleased to turn to my colleague from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe energy committee. She does a remarkable job, and she has brought \nmany people together on this bipartisan piece of legislation. It passed \nthe committee 18 to 4. People are energetic about this Energy bill \nbecause it is so critical and important to our communities and our \neconomy.\n  As the Senate is discussing this important energy legislation, I come \nto the floor today because energy is one of those issues on which we \nshould actually all be able to agree in terms of the basic idea. The \nbasic idea and my goal for this Energy bill is that we make energy in \nAmerica as clean as we can, as fast as we can, and do it in ways that \ndon't raise costs on American families. I think most of us would \nconsider that to be a worthy, commonsense goal. That is why the Energy \nbill before the Senate today is so important and why it has such broad \nbipartisan support. As I said, the bill passed the committee 18 to 4. \nAnd this is a bill that actually takes concrete steps to help our \ncountry produce the energy we need.\n  I think one of the good ideas in the bill is a provision to speed up \npermitting for the exportation of liquefied natural gas. Six Democrats \nhave cosponsored this language on the LNG exports as a separate piece \nof legislation, which is now incorporated into this Energy bill. That \nis because Senators on both sides of the aisle recognize the importance \nof natural gas to our economy and to our national security.\n  America has the world's largest supply of natural gas in terms of \nwhat we are able to produce today. We also have the resources to be a \nmajor exporter of this clean and versatile fuel. It is estimated that \nliquefied natural gas exports can contribute up to $74 billion to \nAmerica's gross domestic product by the year 2035. All we need is for \nWashington to give producers some regulatory certainty--certainty that \nis not there today.\n  To liquefy and to export natural gas requires special production and \nspecial export terminals, places to get it done. Under President Obama, \nthe Department of Energy has been very slow and very unpredictable \nabout approving these projects. The Energy bill would expedite the \npermit process for LNG exports to countries around the world and \ncountries that right now do not have free-trade agreements with the \nUnited States. It opens it up to new markets, new customers, people who \nare friends and allies who want to buy a product we have right here for \nsale.\n  This legislation would require the Energy Secretary to make a final \ndecision on an export application within 45 days after the \nenvironmental review process is completed. It would also provide for \nexpedited judicial review of legal challenges to the LNG export \nprojects because things can get tangled up in legal challenges that can \ngo on for months and years.\n  Finally, the bill requires that exporters publicly disclose the \ncountries to which the LNG is delivered so the American people know \nwhom we are selling to.\n  This legislation doesn't force the administration to approve the \nprojects, it doesn't shut down the environmental reviews, and it \ndoesn't take away anybody's right to voice their opposition; it just \nsays that the Obama administration should do its job in an accountable, \ntimely, and predictable way.\n  This legislation would help create jobs. It would help to reduce our \ntrade deficit, which is something President Obama has said is a \npriority of his. It would also help the security of America and our \nallies. That is something which should be a priority for all of us in \nthis body. Speeding up American exports of liquefied natural gas will \ngive our allies an alternative for where they can get the energy they \nneed. It would help our allies reduce their dependence on gas from \nhostile places, many of whom are now getting it from Russia. Remember, \nRussia invaded Ukraine largely to get control of the gas pipelines \nthere.\n  Now Iran wants to step up its natural gas business as well--Iran. The \nIranians have been working on a liquefied natural gas export plant that \nis almost complete. Construction had stalled a few years ago because of \nthe economic sanctions against Iran. Now that the Obama administration \nhas lifted the sanctions against Iran, Iran can start construction \nagain. The managing director of the National Iranian Gas Export Company \nsays that it could start shipping liquefied natural gas to Europe in 2 \nyears. That was in an article in the Wall Street Journal today. The \nheadline is ``Iran Seeks Ways To Ship Out Gas As Sanctions Ease.'' This \nis today. What we are discussing on the floor of the Senate is \nincredibly timely. When you read through the article, it says that \nEuropean companies are promising billions in new deals in Iran as \nIranian President Ruhani visits Europe this week to revive trade and \npolitical ties. So Iran is on the move.\n  The Obama administration, as of right now, is shackling American \nnatural gas, shackling the production, shackling the export. At the \nsame time, the President, through his agreement with Iran, is enabling \nIran to move forward and seek ways to ship out gas as sanctions ease.\n  If our allies are dependent on gas from Russia or from Iran or from \nboth, how does that make the world a safer place?\n  This administration has been dragging its feet on approving liquefied \nnatural gas exports. It has blocked North American energy projects in \nthe past, such as the Keystone XL Pipeline. That would have created \nthousands of jobs. Then, earlier this month, the Secretary of the \nInterior halted all new leases on mining coal on Federal land. This \naction by the administration is alarming, it is drastic, and it is \ndestructive. Forty percent of all the coal produced in the United \nStates comes from Federal land. The Interior Secretary wants the coal \nto stay in the ground, wants it to become a stranded asset. With this \nnew rule, she took one more step toward wiping out the jobs of \nthousands of Americans, and then she staged a press conference to brag \nabout it. If that weren't bad enough, last week the administration \nannounced new restrictions on oil and gas operations on Federal land \nand on Indian land.\n  The unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats of the Obama administration \nhave been relentlessly attacking American energy producers with new \nrules, new regulations--costly--hurting our economy, hurting jobs. They \nare costing American workers and families billions of dollars, and they \nwill do great damage to American energy reliability. Reliability is \nkey. We need a different approach.\n  It is essential that we create as much energy as possible here at \nhome, and it is essential that we be able to export American energy to \nour allies as well, people who want to get it from us. That is why \nenergy is called the master resource, and that is why this Energy bill \nis so important.\n  This legislation is a good start toward making sure America has the \nenergy we need to keep our economy growing. There are things we could \ndo to improve this legislation. We could use this bill to protect \nAmericans from President Obama's reckless attempt to end coal leases on \nFederal lands. We can also make sure the Obama administration stops its \nunwise new rule on natural gas and oil operations. We can actually \ncapture more energy while we reduce waste and emissions from this kind \nof oil and gas production.\n  I have introduced bipartisan legislation that is going to expedite \nthe permitting process of natural gas gathering lines on Federal and \nIndian land.\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nThese are pipelines that collect unprocessed natural gas from oil and \ngas wells and ship it to a processing plant and then on to interstate \npipelines. Today a lot of that gas is flared off right at the well. You \ncan see that at the well, the flames. One of the reasons that is \nhappening is because the Obama administration has been so slow in \ngranting the permits for the natural gas gathering lines on Federal \nland. People want to build them; they want to use this natural gas. The \nPresident opposes the flaring. More gathering lines would mean less \nflaring. It is good for energy producers, it is good for the \nenvironment, and it is good for taxpayers.\n  We need the energy. Keeping it in the ground is not the answer. The \nanswer is making energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without \nraising costs on American families. I believe that is a better \napproach. A bipartisan group of Members of this body knows it is a \nbetter answer. It is time for the Obama administration to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Energy Policy \nModernization Act. Along with a broad, bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues, I supported this bill as a member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. I thank Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member \nCantwell, and their staff for their commitment and hard work in \nproducing a bill that could earn a strong bipartisan vote in the \ncommittee.\n  There were other proposals that I would have liked to have seen \nincluded in the bill, such as the national Renewable Electricity \nStandard introduced by Senator Udall, which I cosponsored, and there \nwere other proposals included in the bill that I would not have \nsupported on their own. However, I was willing to support a compromise \nthat provides positive direction for our country in the midst of an \nenergy transformation.\n  Now that the full Senate is considering the bill, I would like to \nremind my colleagues of the effort that went into reaching this \ncompromise. We should not squander the opportunity before us with \namendments that will simply erode bipartisan support for the bill or \ndraw a Presidential veto.\n  So much has changed in how energy is produced and consumed since the \nSenate passed its last energy bill in 2007. Our country is in the \nmiddle of a transformation toward cleaner sources of energy and greater \nenergy efficiency in our vehicles, homes, and businesses. Hawaii is \nleading the way on many fronts in this transformation. Hawaii has \nalready set the most ambitious electricity standard of any State, and \nthat is 100 percent renewable electricity by 2045. Our State has \nalready more than doubled its use of renewable electricity in 6 years \nto 21 percent.\n  Making sure that we have clean and affordable power for families and \nbusinesses will require a more modern and reliable electricity system. \nThe Energy Policy Modernization Act tackles research, job creation, and \ninnovation on a number of fronts. Let me highlight some of the bill's \nimportant provisions.\n  This bill includes provisions from my Next Generation Electric \nSystems Act that would establish a Department of Energy grant program \nfor projects to improve the performance and efficiency of electrical \ngrid systems. These grants could assist efforts in Hawaii and around \nthe country to make greater use of renewable energy, energy storage \nsystems, electric vehicles, and other innovative energy technologies.\n  The bill also provides $500 million over 10 years to support the \nenergy storage research, demonstration, and deployment program from \nSenator Cantwell's Grid Modernization Act, which I cosponsored. Energy \nstorage will help smooth the delivery of power from renewable sources \nso that it is available even when the sun is not shining or the wind is \nnot blowing. Greater use of energy storage systems could help cut \nenergy bills by reducing the need to build expensive powerplants that \noperate only at times of highest demand and avoiding blackouts.\n  Thanks to Chair Murkowski, the bill also promotes the development of \nmicrogrid systems for communities that are not connected to the grid, \nso that isolated communities in places like Hawaii and Alaska can also \nuse alternative energy and energy storage to secure more reliable and \naffordable sources of power.\n  The bill includes my amendment to ensure that the U.S. Territories \nand the District of Columbia can join Hawaii and other States in being \neligible to participate in a Department of Energy loan guarantee \nprogram to help States support new investments in clean energy \nprojects. For instance, Hawaii could expand its Green Energy Market \nSecuritization--or GEMS--Program to make rooftop solar systems and \nother clean energy improvements more affordable for renters and other \nunderserved consumers.\n  The bill authorizes research and development in promising renewable \nenergy technologies like marine and hydrokinetic energy, which harness \nthe power of the ocean's waves, heat, and currents. In partnership with \nthe U.S. Navy, the Hawaii National Marine Renewable Energy Center at \nthe University of Hawaii-Manoa is one of three federally funded centers \nfor marine energy research and development in the Nation, including a \nwave energy test site at Kaneohe Bay on Oahu.\n  The bill will help people find well-paying jobs in the energy and \nenergy efficiency fields by establishing a $10 million grant program \nfor nonprofit partnerships that train workers to earn energy efficient \nbuilding certifications. It also creates a $20 million energy workforce \ntraining grant program for colleges and workforce development boards. \nThis program will focus on helping workers earn industry-recognized \ncredentials. I will be offering amendments to ensure that our veterans \ncan take full advantage of these programs to speed their transition \ninto the civilian workforce.\n  The bill will also help boost energy efficiency. Hawaii set a goal \nrequiring a 30-percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. \nAccording to the Hawaii State Energy Office, that standard has resulted \nin the equivalent of $435 million in energy savings for Hawaii's homes, \nfarms, and businesses.\n  Finally, the bill strengthens our protection of public lands by \npermanently reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund--LWCF--a \nfund that, throughout its 50-year history, has financed over 40,000 \nprojects across all 50 States and protected public lands that support \nour Nation's $646 billion outdoor recreational industry. In Hawaii \nalone, the LWCF has directly provided $195 million to our local \nconservation efforts, and, as most people know, we in Hawaii go to \ngreat lengths to protect and conserve our native ecosystems. LWCF funds \nwill support Hawaii's ``Island Forests at Risk'' proposal. These funds \nwill expand Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Hakalau National \nWildlife Refuge by a total of 12,000 acres. These two locations host a \ntotal of nearly 2 million visitors each year and protect some of \nHawaii's most beautiful and sensitive habitats. The bill also \npermanently reauthorizes the Historic Preservation Fund and creates a \nnew National Park Maintenance and Revitalization Fund. The new national \npark fund will help reduce the backlog of $11.5 billion in repairs and \nmaintenance needed in our national parks, including the $127 million \nbacklog of maintenance at Hawaii's national parks. This much needed new \nfund will ensure that people can enjoy the beauty of our parks for \ngenerations to come.\n  In addition to improving energy usage in our homes and businesses, we \nmust ensure that government takes full advantage of new energy and \nenergy efficient technologies. For the fourth consecutive year, the \nState of Hawaii led the Nation in per capita use of energy performance \ncontracting for State and county buildings, resulting in the creation \nof over 3,000 jobs and an energy savings of over $989 million.\n  I would like to expand the use of energy contracting at the Federal \nlevel to save taxpayer dollars and support the use of cleaner sources \nof energy. I will be offering an amendment to allow all Federal \nagencies to use long-term contracts to reduce their energy bills, as \nthe Department of Defense is allowed to do under current law.\n  I also plan to offer an amendment to establish a pilot project to \nexpand the use of Federal energy savings performance contracts to \nmobile sources such as federally-owned aircraft and vehicles. The \nguaranteed energy savings will mean taxpayer savings.\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\n  With oil accounting for 80 percent of the energy needs of our State, \nthe people of Hawaii are acutely aware that there must be new \nalternatives to the volatile prices and vulnerable supply of the global \noil trade. Hawaii, which for too long has been paying the highest \nelectricity rates in the country, recognizes that we have renewable \nresources in our own State that should be developed so that we keep at \nhome more of the $5 billion per year we currently spend to import oil. \nThat is more money circulating in Hawaii's economy, creating jobs, \nraising wages, and helping families make ends meet.\n  For all the reasons I have mentioned, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill and those amendments that will be offered that move our \ncountry forward, not backward, to a future with affordable, clean, and \nreliable energy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Solitary Confinement\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe it was in April of 2009 that I \npicked up a New Yorker magazine and read an article that had a real \nimpact on me. It was an article written by Dr. Atul Gawande, a \npracticing surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, an \namazing man. In addition to his medical responsibilities, he is a \nperson with a very inquisitive mind and a real knack when it comes to \ninvestigating challenging issues.\n  The article that I read in the New Yorker by Dr. Gawande examined the \nhuman impact of long-term solitary confinement and asked, ``If \nprolonged isolation is--as research and experience have confirmed for \ndecades--so objectively horrifying, so intrinsically cruel, how did we \nend up with a prison system that may subject more of our own citizens \nto it than any other country in history has?''\n  Dr. Gawande's article inspired me--motivated me--to begin to look \ninto the issue of solitary confinement in prisons. I was amazed to \nlearn that the United States holds more prisoners in solitary \nconfinement--about 100,000--than any other democratic nation in the \nworld. So in 2012, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, I held the first-ever \ncongressional hearing on solitary confinement.\n  At the hearing, we took a look at the serious fiscal impact of \nsolitary. We learned that it costs almost three times more to keep a \nFederal prisoner in segregation than in the general population. We also \ndiscussed the significant public safety consequences of widespread \nsolitary confinement, given that the vast majority of inmates held in \nsegregation will ultimately be released to the community someday. And \nwe heard testimony about the human impact of holding tens of thousands \nof women, men, and children in small, windowless cells 23 hours a day--\nfor days, months, even years--with very little, if any, human contact \nwith the outside world. Clearly, such extreme isolation can have a \nserious, damaging psychological impact. I will never ever forget the \ncompelling testimony of Anthony Graves. In the year 2010, after 18 \nyears in prison--and 16 of those years in solitary confinement--Anthony \nGraves became the 12th death row inmate to be exonerated in the State \nof Texas.\n\n  At the hearing, Mr. Graves testified about his experience. The room \nwas silent. He stated:\n\n       Solitary confinement does one thing, it breaks a man's will \n     to live. . . . I have been free for almost two years and I \n     still cry at night, because no one out here can relate to \n     what I have gone through. I battle with feelings of \n     loneliness. I've tried therapy but it didn't work.\n\n  In 2014, I held a follow-up hearing on the issue. I called for an end \nto solitary confinement for juveniles, pregnant women, and inmates with \nserious mental illness. At the hearing, we heard from Damon Thibodeaux. \nHe had spent 15 years in solitary confinement at the Louisiana State \nPenitentiary before being found not guilty and released. Mr. Thibodeaux \ntestified:\n\n       I do not condone what those who have killed and committed \n     other serious offenses have done. But I also don't condone \n     what we do to them, when we put them in solitary for years on \n     end and treat them as sub-human. We are better than that. As \n     a civilized society, we should be better than that.\n\n  In recent years a number of experts and State and Federal officials \nacross the country have questioned our Nation's overuse of solitary \nconfinement. In 2014, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy testified \nto Congress: ``Solitary confinement literally drives men mad.''\n  Last year, Justice Kennedy again brought up the issue in a powerful \nconcurring opinion. He wrote: ``Research still confirms what this Court \nsuggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation \nexacts a terrible price.''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The judiciary may be required . . . to determine whether \n     workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, \n     and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required \n     to adopt them.\n\n  Pope Francis, who spoke to a joint session of Congress a few months \nago, has also criticized solitary confinement. In a 2014 speech at the \nVatican, he referred to the practice of extreme isolation as \n``torture'' and ``a genuine surplus of pain added to the actual \nsuffering of imprisonment.''\n  The Pope went on to say:\n\n       The lack of sensory stimuli, the total impossibility of \n     communication and the lack of contact with other human beings \n     induce mental and physical suffering such as paranoia, \n     anxiety, depression, weight loss, and significantly increase \n     the suicidal tendency.\n\n  In light of the mounting evidence of the dangerous and harmful \nimpacts of solitary confinement, several States have led the way in \nreassessing the practice. Colorado has implemented a number of reforms, \nincluding no longer releasing offenders directly from solitary to the \ncommunity, and ensuring that inmates with serious mental illness are \nnot placed in solitary confinement. As a result of the reforms, inmate-\non-staff assaults are at the lowest levels in Colorado in 10 years, \nincidents of self-harm have decreased among the inmates, and most \ninmates released from solitary do not return.\n  In the State of Washington, a focus on rehabilitation and programming \nfor inmates in solitary confinement has led to a reduction of more than \n50 percent in the segregated population.\n  The Association of State Correctional Administrators--a group \nrepresenting the heads of all 50 State prison systems--recently called \nfor limits on the use of long-term solitary confinement. In a \nstatement, they said:\n\n       Prolonged isolation of individuals in jails and prisons is \n     a grave problem in the United States. . . . Correctional \n     leaders across the country are committed to reducing the \n     number of people in restrictive housing. . . .\n\n  Progress has been made at the Federal level since our first hearing. \nA substantial percentage of those in solitary confinement are no longer \nserving in that situation. After my first hearing on the issue, I asked \nthe Bureau of Prisons to submit to the first-ever independent \nassessment of its solitary confinement policies and practices.\n  The assessment, released last year, noted that some improvements have \nbeen made since the 2012 hearing, the initial hearing we had on the \nsubject. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has reduced its segregated \npopulation by more than 25 percent and continues to look for more \nreductions.\n  Despite this, there is a lot of work to be done. That is why I was \npleased to see President Obama's announcement this week that he has \naccepted a number of recommendations from the Department of Justice to \nreform and reduce the practice of solitary confinement in the federal \nprison system.\n  In an op-ed published yesterday in the Washington Post, the President \nexplained how the Department of Justice's review of solitary \nconfinement policy led to the conclusion that the practice should be \nused rarely, applied fairly, and subjected to reasonable constraints.\n  The President's recommendations included: banning solitary \nconfinement for juveniles, diverting inmates with serious mental \nillness to alternative forms of housing, diverting inmates in need of \nprotection from solitary confinement to less restrictive conditions,\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nreducing the use of disciplinary segregation, and improving the \nconditions of solitary confinement by increasing inmates' out-of-cell \ntime and access to services.\n  I welcome these changes. I commend the President for his actions. I \nlook forward to working with the Bureau of Prisons and the Department \nof Justice on this issue.\n  In the course of studying this issue, I decided I had to see it \nfirsthand. I went to Tamms prison in Southern Illinois. It was the \nmaximum security State prison in the State. I went in, met with the \nwarden, and I took my tour. Then I said to her: I want to see the most \nrestrictive solitary confinement. She took me into an area where five \nmen were in solitary confinement. I had a chance to speak to each of \nthem. One of the men I will never forget. I asked him: How many years \nare you in for?\n  He said: Originally 20, but they added 50 to that.\n  I said: Fifty additional years?\n  He said: Yes. He said in a very calm voice: I told them that if they \nput another prisoner in my cell I would kill him, and I did.\n  I thought to myself, be aware, Senator, there are ruthless and \nvicious people and violent people who really need to be carefully \nscrutinized and carefully imprisoned in a situation where they can't \nharm other inmates or the personnel, but still, even in that \ncircumstance, we have to look to the most humane way to treat them in \nthe course of their imprisonment.\n  The President's decision to address the use of solitary represents a \nmajor step forward in protecting human rights, increasing public \nsafety, and improving fiscal responsibility in our federal prisons. \nStill, we have the highest per capita rate of incarceration in the \nworld--the United States, the highest rate of incarceration in the \nworld.\n  President Obama noted yesterday that changing our approach to \nsolitary confinement is just one part of a larger set of reforms we \nmust pursue. Last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Chuck \nGrassley of Iowa, and I worked with a bipartisan coalition of Senators \nto introduce the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act. The bill passed \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in a 15-to-5 bipartisan vote several \nmonths ago.\n  In order to comprehensively address the problems facing our Federal \nprisons, we should bring this bipartisan criminal justice reform \nlegislation to the Senate floor and work with our colleagues in the \nHouse to send a bill to the President this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today marks the 125th time I have come \nto the Senate floor to ask this body to wake up to the threats of \nclimate change. This week is a little different because we are \ncurrently debating the bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act. The \nbill was crafted by my colleagues, Senators Murkowski and Cantwell, and \nit may become our first comprehensive energy efficiency legislation \nsince 2007. While the base bill is a good start, we have much work to \ndo before we come anywhere near meeting the challenges we face as a \nresult of our decades of carbon pollution.\n  As we begin debate on this legislation, calls for bold action on \nclimate continue to mount. The World Economic Forum released its \n``Global Risks Report 2016,'' which for the first time ranked an \nenvironmental risk--climate change--as the most severe economic risk \nfacing the world. The report found that a failure to deal with and \nprepare for climate change is potentially the most costly risk over the \nnext decade.\n  Cecilia Reyes, chief risk officer of Zurich Insurance Group, said: \n``Climate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms \nof water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker \nsocietal cohesion and increased security risks.''\n  Some of my Republican colleagues have begun to wake up to these \nrisks. It was just last year that Chairman Murkowski said: ``What I am \nhoping that we can do now is get beyond the discussion as to whether \nclimate change is real and talk about what to do.'' The chairman \ndeserves credit for reporting a bill that has solutions a broad \nmajority of the Senate can support; however, she has been handicapped \nby the fact that many in her party still refuse to take seriously that \nhuman-caused climate change is real and that it presents a significant \nand growing risk to our economy, our national security, and our way of \nlife.\n  Many of the provisions in this bill are not new. We saw much of it in \nthe Shaheen-Portman Energy bill that Republicans twice before have \nfilibustered. With so many Republicans seemingly incapable of \nsupporting responsible energy legislation, those of us who want to \npromote energy efficiency and a clean energy economy sometimes feel a \nlittle bit like Charlie Brown, hoping that this time Lucy won't yank \nthe ball away yet again. These issues are too important, and I am \nhoping this time will, in fact, be different.\n  The bill contains commonsense reforms, such as reforming building \ncodes to improve energy efficiency and directing the Secretary of \nEnergy to establish a Federal smart building program to demonstrate the \ncosts and benefits of implementing smart building technology. It \nreauthorizes the weatherization and State energy programs that States \nsuch as Rhode Island rely on and the Advanced Research Projects \nAgency--Energy. That has shown the importance of government investment \nin new energy technologies. It will modernize and secure our electric \ngrid and enhance cyber security safeguards.\n  My State, Rhode Island, is a national leader in promoting energy \nefficiency, so we know how programs like these are good for consumers, \nbusinesses, and the environment. In fact, I came here to the floor \nafter a meeting with our grid operator. She said Rhode Island was the \nleading State when it comes to efficiency. Rhode Island has had energy \npolicies guiding electricity and natural gas efficiency standards since \n2006. We have consistently ranked in the top five States when it comes \nto energy efficiency. We do this as one of the founding members of the \nRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative--or RGGI for short--the Northeast's \ncarbon pollution cap-and-trade program. States that belong to RGGI are \nproving that we can grow our economies at the same time we cut our \nemissions. Between its founding in 2005 and the report of 2012, \nemissions in the RGGI States decreased by 40 percent, while the \nregional economy grew by 7 percent, so we won on both sides. Putting a \nprice on carbon and plowing that money back into clean energy projects \nis, in fact, saving us billions of dollars while helping to reduce \ncarbon pollution.\n  I hope this bill will be a small step forward toward solutions that \nwill begin to help reverse the devastation carbon pollution is wreaking \non our climate and particularly on our oceans.\n  I have to ask my Republican friends, what is your best bet on whether \nthis climate and oceans problem gets better or worse in the next 20 or \n40 years? I ask this seriously because a great party's reputation is on \nthe line here. How are you going to bet--with the 97 to 98 percent of \nthe scientists and 100 percent of the peer research? Do you want to bet \nthe reputation of the Republican Party that suddenly all of this is \ngoing to magically get better?\n  Right now the American public sees what is going on. The American \npublic knows that the Republican Party in Washington has become the \npolitical wing of the fossil fuel industry. There has always been a bit \nof this within the Republican Party, but since the Republican \nappointees on the Supreme Court gave the fossil fuel industry that \ngreat, fat, juicy gift of its Citizens United decision, the fossil fuel \nindustry menace looming over the Republican Party in Congress has \nbecome near absolute.\n  Trapped by the fossil fuel industry, the Republican vision for energy \npolicy has been stuck in the past. Most of the time, it is just \ncomplaints and obstruction: Oh, the President's Clean Power Plan is no \ngood. Oh, the States should engage in massive civil disobedience\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nagainst the President's Clean Power Plan. Oh, we should defund the EPA.\n  It will be no surprise if they try to block the Department of \nInterior's plan to reform a coal leasing program that has not been \nupdated in over 30 years. It doesn't matter to them that the way we \nprice the extraction of fossil fuel on Federal lands is a massive \ntaxpayer giveaway to fossil fuel companies and it is based on a market \nfailure that ignores the costs those fuels impose on taxpayers and our \nclimate. Conservative and progressive economists alike agree on that \nmarket failure point. Indeed, Republicans defend all the subsidies we \ngive to the fossil fuel industry. There is no subsidy to the fossil \nfuel industry that does not earn constant Republican support.\n  Rather than gambling on more oil and gas production, I suggest we \nmake the safe bet on a strategy that cuts emissions, encourages \nAmerican investment in American clean energy, saves taxpayers billions \nof dollars, and creates and supports millions of jobs.\n  There is an old hymn that the Presiding Officer probably knows. It \nsays: ``Turn back, O man, forswear thy foolish ways.'' Well, it is time \nto turn back and forswear our foolish fossil fuel ways. If we don't, \nthere will be a day of reckoning and a harsh price to pay.\n  Remember what Pope Francis told us:\n\n       God always forgives. We men forgive sometimes, but nature \n     never forgives. If you give her a slap, she will give you \n     one.\n\n  We have given our Earth one heck of a slap.\n  I will leave the Chamber with this: Last week, NASA and the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2015 was the \nwarmest year on record globally. That is not a fluke. Fifteen of the \nwarmest 16 years recorded occurred during this century, which, by the \nway, has had 15 years. They are all in the warmest 16 years ever \nrecorded. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the most \nrecent 5-year period--from 2011 to 2015--was the warmest 5-year period \never recorded. You can see that the long-term trend is going in one \ndirection and one direction only--hotter. There is no pause. The pause \nwas a trick. These changes are primarily driven by the excessive carbon \npollution we continue to dump into our atmosphere and oceans.\n  By the way, for all of this measured heat, 90-plus percent of the \nheat actually goes into the oceans. There is little change in the \noceans but big changes here. As the oceans stop absorbing as much \nwarmth, I don't know where that will lead.\n  As we bring our ideas to the floor during our discussion about \nmodernizing our electric grid, we have an opportunity to also have a \nreal conversation on climate change. We still have a real \nresponsibility to act.\n\n  It is time for this body to wake up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Donald Trump\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are some things I shouldn't joke \nabout. I tried to be funny an hour ago at my weekly stakeout and I \nguess it wasn't very funny--at least I don't think so.\n  The danger Donald Trump's candidacy poses to our country is not a \njoke. Since he launched his bid for the Republican nomination, Donald \nTrump has proven over and over again that he is a hateful demagogue who \nwould do immeasurable damage to our country if elected. I have come to \nthe Senate floor many times to decry his hateful comments.\n  Donald Trump threatens to diminish the integrity of our democracy \naround the whole world. If he wins the nomination of the Republican \nParty to run for President of the United States, the Republican Party \nwill never recover from the damage he will inflict on conservatism.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Robert Califf\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to Dr. \nRobert Califf, the President's nominee to be the Commissioner of the \nFDA.\n  I do this with all respect for Dr. Califf, his expertise, and all the \nwork he has done. He is a quality human being. I am sure the \nadministration is going to be able to find a position for him that \nsuits his background better than being the head of the FDA, and I say \nthat with all due respect. We had a thoughtful conversation when he \ncame to visit with me.\n  I do not believe he can be the leader we need to change the culture \nof the FDA. I say that coming from a State that has been ravaged by \nthis opiate addiction. It is going to take someone who is totally \ncommitted through and through to make the changes that need to be made.\n  The No. 1 priority of the FDA and its Commissioner should be public \nhealth. It is inappropriate for the FDA Commissioner to have such close \nfinancial ties with the pharmaceutical industry. I will give a little \nbit of background on this because what he has done I think is what most \nof them do.\n  Between 2010 and 2014, Dr. Califf received money through his \nuniversity salary as well as his consulting fees from 26 different \npharmaceutical companies, including opioid manufacturers. Dr. Califf \nhas described FDA regulations as a ``barrier''--not a safeguard--to \npublic health. That is troubling in itself.\n  In 2008, the FDA's approval of new marketing claims for existing \ndrugs was 56 percent. In the first 8 months of 2015, it was 88 percent. \nThis includes just last year approving OxyContin for children as young \nas 11 years old. At a time when opioid deaths are killing tens of \nthousands of Americans every day, our FDA would like to give these \ndangerous drugs to kids. Someone at the FDA needs to change this way of \nthinking. They are giving all of the excuses in the world, and it makes \nno sense whatsoever to me.\n  Dr. Califf's past involvement with the pharmaceutical industry shows \nthat he will not be able to be this person--the person of change who is \nneeded. He will not have the impact or leadership capabilities that \nthis Nation needs to stem the tide of the opioid crisis.\n  These are the facts of what this horrific pain reduction, if you \nwill--pain suppressor, opiates--does to Americans. With 51 Americans \ndying every day due to an opioid overdose--51 Americans die every day--\nthe FDA, now more than ever, needs a champion who is committed to \ndramatically changing the way this agency handles opioids. Every other \nFederal agency is fighting to address opioid addiction.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about addiction. There is not one of us in \nthe Senate, there is not one person who works here who doesn't have \nsomeone in their immediate family or extended family or a close friend \nwho has been affected by prescription drug abuse or illicit drugs, but \nthe FDA continues to approve stronger and more dangerous opioid drugs, \nendangering the public.\n  In 2014, 18,893 people died due to a prescription opioid overdose. \nAgain, as I have said, that is 51 people every day. That is a 16-\npercent increase from 2013 and it increased every year before that. We \nhave lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse since \n1999.\n  The FDA Commissioner is an important figure in the fight against \nprescription drug abuse, and he or she must be a public health official \nwhose top priority is stopping the opioid abuse epidemic.\n  We need to change the culture of the FDA to make them address the \ncrisis seriously. That will not happen if the person at the helm is not \na strong advocate--and I say a very strong advocate--who is committed \nto pushing back against the pressure to continually approve new opioid \nmedications given the significant risks to public health, just for \nmeeting a business model or a business plan.\n  I believe the FDA needs new leadership, a new focus, and a new \nculture. This is not disparaging anybody who is there or who wishes to \nbe there. When I talked to Dr. Califf, I found him to be most qualified \nand will do a good job in some other position, I am sure.\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\n  I believe the FDA must break its close relationship with the \npharmaceutical industry and instead start a relationship with the \nmillions of Americans impacted by prescription drug abuse. It is just \nhuman nature for a person that basically has had all his research \nfunded for many years from this industry, and it is going to be hard to \nchange.\n  It is because of this that I will filibuster any effort to confirm \nDr. Califf instead of voting to confirm a nominee who will not address \nthe concerns of the people of West Virginia and all of America. I will \ncome to the floor and read letters from those who have had their lives \ndevastated by opiate addiction. I will read letters from children who \nhave seen their parents die from an overdose. I will read letters from \ngrandparents who have been forced to raise their grandchildren when \ntheir kids went to jail, rehab, or the grave. I will read letters from \nteachers and religious leaders who have seen their communities \ndevastated by prescription drug abuse. I will read letters from West \nVirginians who need help from the FDA--not by putting more of these \nopiate killers on the market.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to examine the financial support Dr. \nCaliff has received throughout his research career and ask themselves \nif he is the right person to change the culture of the FDA. This \nSenator is confident that when looking at all the facts, you will agree \nthat we need a new nominee, one who will join us in the fight against \nthis horrible epidemic affecting every nook and cranny of this country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I know we are waiting for other \ncolleagues to come to the floor to speak to the Energy bill itself or \nperhaps to offer amendments. I certainly would encourage that, as we \nare trying to get the process going with the Energy Policy \nModernization Act.\n  Before my colleague from West Virginia leaves the floor, I want to \nthank him for his leadership on this issue. We have had conversations. \nI traveled to West Virginia at his invitation to view how West Virginia \ndeals with its energy issues. They have a little bit of everything \nthere in West Virginia, and I was able to see that.\n  One of the sad stories I learned, though, is what we were seeing in \nhis State as it relates to opioid abuse--OxyContin and meth at that \ntime. Our States share some similarities in that there are very rural \ncharacteristics in both West Virginia and Alaska. Even though we are \nfar removed from most of the other States in this country, we are not \nimmune or insulated from what we are seeing with this epidemic of \nopioid abuse brought on initially by access to prescription drugs and \nnow being replaced in a horrible way with heroin that is impacting our \nkids, young people, and folks who are ages that would surprise many. It \nis deeply troubling.\n  When you use words like ``epidemic'' or ``pandemic,'' those are very \nstrong words, but I think that is what we are seeing in this country, \nand it is reaching from one end of the country to the other.\n  I want to acknowledge my colleague for the issues he has raised.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. If I may, Mr. President, let me first of all thank the \nSenator from Alaska for her leadership on the Energy bill. It has been \na long time since we have had one on the floor, working in a most \nrational, commonsense approach trying to bring all parties together. \nShe has done a great job working with Maria Cantwell, the Democrat on \nour side from the State of Washington.\n  I think we are finding there is a little bit of something for \neverybody, understanding that the energy policy should be an all-in \npolicy. I come from a fossil fuel State and she comes from a fossil \nfuel State, and people think they can live without it. I think they can \nlive better with it if we use technology, and that is what we have \ntried to push in this piece of legislation.\n  On the opiate issue, I have a passion. I have watched it, and it is \ndevastating. When you have young kids coming to you and telling you \nthat they have watched their parents die of overdose, they have watched \ntheir families split up, with the kids taken in different directions, \nit makes your heart bleed and makes you think about future generations \nand what we are going to face.\n  Then to have the Food and Drug Administration--I will give one \nexample. It took them working 3 years to get all opiates to be \nreclassified from a schedule III to a schedule II. It took 3 years to \nget that done. To show the success we have had, millions of \nprescriptions have been reduced because now it is a 30-day mandatory, \nbut let me tell you, it is still a problem that we have. Not everybody \nneeds 30 days. Unless we start doing a whole reeducation of the doctors \nwho basically write the prescriptions to understand sometimes you need \nit only for 1 or 2 days of assistance, we are over-prescribing and the \npharmaceuticals are over-enticing, if you will, with stronger and \nstronger medications.\n  This Senator believes we need an FDA cultural change. That is it. I \nthink if we can't do it here, if we don't drive it on the inside, then \nthere is no one expected to do it on the outside.\n  In States that do the heavy lifting--Alaska, West Virginia--people \nare going to get injured from time to time. They have pain, and they \nneed help. There are other methods. We are trying to go in a different \ndirection.\n  I thank the Senator for recognizing that, but I also thank the \nSenator for coming to our State. We enjoyed having her, and I enjoyed \nbeing in her State.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my colleague from West Virginia is \nalways welcome to come back and learn more.\n  On the issue of Dr. Califf, let it be known that I, too, have \nconcerns about his nomination, and it has nothing to do with opioids. \nIt has everything to do with fish, and basically what we have referred \nto as a fake fish, a genetically engineered fish. All this Senator is \nlooking for is an assurance from the FDA that if they are going to put \nthis genetically engineered product out there for human consumption \nthen there should be an appropriate labeling. I do not think that is \ntoo much to ask. I have asked for that, and the difficulty is getting \nfolks within the FDA to have a full and important conversation about \nthe import of that. So it is a different issue from what the Senator \nfrom West Virginia has discussed, but I think it goes to the issue of \nneeding to have some communication within the FDA.\n  The FDA is an agency that has considerable authorities, and we in the \nCongress need to know that we can have a good level of dialogue and \ndiscussion going back and forth. I think we have seen a real lack or \nshortfall, and until I get certain assurances from the FDA as well, I \nam not planning on removing the hold that I currently have on this \nnominee, and we will be working with other colleagues on this.\n  My friend, the Senator from Colorado, has arrived to the floor, and I \nknow he wishes to speak on the Energy Policy Modernization Act. The \nSenator from Colorado has been a great Member of the U.S. Senate since \nhe came. He was a leader on energy issues when he was over at the \nHouse, and he has continued that in a very constructive and robust way. \nWe can talk about energy matters that come from producing States like \nours, but a recognition that Senator Gardner's approach is not just \nthat he comes from a fossil-fuel producing State; he is also looking to \nmake sure that we move to a clean energy future. He is also very \nconscious and considerate about what we do with conservation. His \nleadership has been greatly appreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her \nleadership on the bipartisan Energy bill. It is a bill that came out of \ncommittee with an 18-to-4 vote, strong support on both sides of the \naisle.\n  This is a bill that has components in it from grid reliability, to \ntransparency, accountability, and clean energy. On the floor there are \nopportunities for amendments that will be discussed and brought out, \nincluding an amendment that is important to Senator Shaheen and I that \nwill be discussing the impact the recreation economy has--the amount of \ndollars raised and generated through the recreation economy, spending \nmoney in the great outdoors, how it impacts our States, and the jobs it \ncreates.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n  We know people come to States such as Colorado, New Hampshire, and \nAlaska to hike, fish, climb, ski, and partake in all of the great \nincredible recreational benefits we have year-round in Alaska, \nColorado, and the rest of our many States with so many recreational \nofferings. I look forward to these discussions, and over the next few \ndays I look forward to coming back to the floor to discuss other ideas \nin the bill right now, such as renewable energy, energy efficiencies, \nincluding my legislation to expand the use of energy savings \nperformance contracts which could save this country $20 billion without \nspending a dime of taxpayer money. These are incredible opportunities.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Remembering U.S. Capitol Police Officer Vernon Alston, Jr.\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Vernon Alston. \nVernon Alston, Jr., was a member of the U.S. Capitol Police. On Sunday, \nJanuary 24, Officer Alston passed away after suffering from a heart \nattack. As was so common for Officer Alston, his concern had been for \nothers that day. He spent the morning by serving those around him, \nhelping those in his community shovel the incredible amounts of snow \nthe area received.\n  Day after day, the men and women of the Capitol Police work to \nprotect us all, not just the Members and staff, but anyone who comes to \nthe Nation's Capitol to share in the history, heritage, and traditions \nof this place.\n  For two decades, Officer Alston dedicated himself to his work, and I \nam grateful for his many years of dedicated service on the Capitol \ngrounds. This building stands as a representation of the values our \nNation was founded on, and it is in this building that we continue to \nuphold the values of democracy.\n  The Capitol Police are often called America's police. They protect us \nas we carry out this work and safeguard those who travel from around \nthe world to experience this living piece of American history which \nserves as the stage for our future. Their support for us is invaluable \nand unwavering, and this week it is our turn to support them as they \nmourn the loss of a dear colleague and friend.\n  Whether it is September 11 or the ricin attacks or anthrax or \nsomebody who is here visiting who has a health issue, we know the \nsupport and the pride that every member of the Capitol Police Force \nbrings to the job each and every day. They are never the first to flee, \nthey are the last to leave, and for that we are eternally grateful.\n  My deepest condolences go to Officer Alston's wife Nicole, their \nchildren, and his family members. We will always honor his work and \nlegacy. He is a member of our Capitol community, and he will truly be \nmissed.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Tribute to Canadian Ambassador Gary Doer\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to honor the outgoing Canadian \nAmbassador to the United States, Gary Doer. Soon Ambassador Doer will \nreturn home to Manitoba, but, lucky for us, he will be a frequent \nvisitor to Washington, DC, as the new cochair of the Wilson Center's \nCanada Institute Advisory Board. We are glad the Ambassador will \ncontinue to be an influential voice in shaping U.S.-Canada relations.\n  Over the last 6 years, I have had the privilege of getting to know \nthe Ambassador. I knew we would get along well when I learned he was a \nlongtime fan of Bud Grant, an incredible athlete who became the head \ncoach of the Minnesota Vikings. From a Canadian perspective, he first \ncoached the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League.\n  Bud Grant is adored in Minnesota and is still adored many years after \nhe left coaching. In fact, it was during a recent playoff game that we \nremember well--in Minnesota versus the Seahawks--where Bud Grant came \nout in 17-below-zero weather and flipped the coin with no jacket on.\n  What I will also never forget is attending an event at the \nAmbassador's home. I walked in the door, and he had a framed photo of \nCoach Grant right next to a framed photo of the Prime Minister of \nCanada. We like that in Minnesota.\n  The Ambassador served for 6 years--or double-overtime, as he likes to \ncall it. This is longer than his two predecessors combined. Ambassador \nDoer's long tenure and the fact that he served Prime Ministers from \ndifferent political parties are testaments to his professionalism and \ncharacter. Ambassador Doer is also well known in Washington for his \nhumor and good nature, and I am sure that helps.\n  Minnesota shares a long border with Canada--in fact, about 547 miles. \nAs I like to say, I can see Canada from my porch. That must be why \nearly on in my Senate career Leader Reid asked me to head up the \nCanada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group, along with Senator Mike \nCrapo of Idaho. Together we have come to understand what an important \ngeopolitical partner Canada is to the United States. I am a Minnesotan \nwho is proud to share a border with Canada. I appreciate the country's \nfriendship, culture, and beauty.\n  Not only is Canada America's biggest trading partner, but it is the \nonly country with an embassy that at one point draped a sign that said \n``friends, neighbours, partners, allies.'' I will never forget how \ngracious Ambassador Doer was for hosting my swearing-in celebration at \nthe Canadian Embassy in 2013. I am the only Senator in recent history \nto choose the Canadian Embassy as a site for my Senate reelection \nswearing-in party, and a lot of that had to do with the Ambassador.\n\n  President Kennedy said this to the Canadian Parliament in 1961:\n\n       Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us \n     friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has \n     made us allies.\n\n  During his tenure in Washington, Ambassador Doer has been a strong \nchampion for Canada and Canadians and an effective diplomat who gets \nthings done. Through his successful 10 years as Premier of Manitoba and \nhis efforts as Ambassador to engage leaders and citizens across the \nUnited States, the Ambassador has strengthened the already robust \nfriendship and partnership between our two great nations.\n  His list of accomplishments is impressive. He has worked tirelessly \non tourism and trade while ensuring the safety and security of the \nborder between our two countries.\n  The Ambassador championed the agreement on the new bridge that will \nlink Detroit and Windsor. This bridge is destined to become the most \nimportant border crossing between our two countries. For too long there \nhas been complete gridlock on the bridge linking our countries. I know \nhow hard the Ambassador has worked on the Windsor bridge, and for a \nwhile it looked as though it wouldn't get done. But the Ambassador \nnever stopped fighting for it and refused to be satisfied until the \ndeal was done, often using an old Gordie Howe saying that ``you don't \nput your hands in the air until the puck is in the net.'' That is a \nhockey analogy between Minnesota and Canada. The Ambassador made sure \nthe puck was in the net.\n  The Ambassador was also instrumental in the U.S.-Canada preclearance \nagreement, a new agreement that will facilitate travel, create jobs, \nand encourage economic growth in both countries, while ensuring a \nsecure border. This initiative reaffirms the commitment of the United \nStates and Canada to enhancing security, while facilitating economic \nactivity, and will help move more than $2 billion in goods and services \nand an estimated 300,000 people across the longest border in the world.\n  I know that the Ambassador considers it an accomplishment that he \nhelped to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic redtape, making it easier \nfor businesses and agencies to operate by working to align regulatory \nsystems and practices in health, safety, and the environment.\n  The Ambassador also strengthened Canada's role as a world leader in \nrenewable energy when he worked to harmonize vehicle emission standards \nbetween our two countries, which will ultimately improve air quality on \nboth sides of the border. In addition, the Ambassador fought for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency Clean Power Plan, which provides \nCanadian hydroelectricity as a renewable energy that U.S. States can \nimport and use to\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\ncomply with new Federal emission rules.\n  Ambassador Doer ensured that the surviving members of the World War \nII joint American-Canadian First Special Service Force, nicknamed the \n``Devil's Brigade,'' received the Congressional Medal of Honor for its \npart in ending World War II.\n  Like all friends, sometimes our nations have differences, but with \nhis experience, tact, and plain-spoken pragmatism, Ambassador Gary Doer \nhas ensured that these differences are bridged so that our two \ngovernments can move forward together.\n  In a 1943 address, President Roosevelt said this to the Canadian \nParliament:\n\n       Your course and mine have run so closely and affectionately \n     during these many long years that this meeting adds another \n     link to that chain. I have always felt at home in Canada, and \n     you, I think, have always felt at home in the United States.\n\n  Ambassador Doer, your service has added another strong and important \nlink in the chain that connects our two countries. And as you have said \nmany times in the past in Gordie Howe hockey terms, it is only safe to \nput your hands in the air after the puck is in the net.\n  Ambassador, you have put a lot of pucks in the net, and now you \ndeserve a moment to put your hands in the air to celebrate your work. \nIn hockey parlance, you have scored for your great country of Canada.\n  I am proud to have worked with the Ambassador during his time in the \nUnited States, and I hope he will always feel at home in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with a number of Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today I come again to the floor to speak \nabout the ongoing challenges that we face in our relationship with \nIran, about some of the benefits that we have seen through the JCPOA--\nthe joint comprehensive agreement on the nuclear program that Iran has \nnow significantly set back--and some of the challenges that we face \ngoing forward.\n  We will hear from a number of my colleagues in the next 45 minutes, \nand I am grateful that they, too, are coming to the floor today to talk \nabout the balance, what there is that we can recognize about the \nprogress we have made under the JCPOA and what there is that remains to \nbe done and that remains as a challenge.\n  There are some who believe that having reached so-called \nimplementation day means that we have settled our scores with Iran, \nthat there are no more concerns we have, and that we can now expect a \ncomplete and positive change in its behavior. But in my view this \ncouldn't be further from the truth. Now more than ever, we cannot \nafford to take our attention away from Iran.\n  My colleagues and I are on the floor today to explain why we must do \nmore to strictly enforce this deal and to aggressively push back on \nIran's bad behavior outside of the parameters of the nuclear deal. My \npersonal concern is that if we don't, if we don't do this effectively, \nthis important landmark nuclear agreement may not survive even into \nnext year.\n  Let me at the outset say that there have been some encouraging \ndevelopments in recent days. It is hugely encouraging to see an \nAmerican, a U.S. citizen such as Jason Rezaian from the Washington \nPost, return to United States soil and be reunited with his family. He \nis someone who had been unjustly detained and sentenced without \nfoundation. He is now once again free. A journalist--the best and \nbrightest of American journalism--is now free and back in the United \nStates.\n  I also want to recognize former marine Amir Hekmati, who was arrested \nwhile visiting his grandmother in Iran. He was also unjustly arrested \nand detained and is now also free in the United States.\n  I wish to move to another topic by way of introduction. In the past \nweek alone, the Iranians have signaled that Iran is open for business \nagain as Iran's leaders have hosted Chinese's President Xi Jinping, and \nIranian President Ruhani has traveled to Europe to meet with the Pope \nand with leading officials from the French Government and the Italian \nGovernment.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Iran was still an international pariah. \nBusiness deals with the Iranian Government were illegal. Today, some \nforeign governments--some who are supposed to be our vital partners in \nenforcing the JCPOA--at times seem all too eager to resume business \nties with the regime. At the outset I might caution those allies of \nours to be mindful that American sanctions remain in place against \nIranian bad behavior--whether it is their support for terrorism, their \nhuman rights violations, such as arresting and detaining Americans \nwithout foundation, or their illicit ballistic missile program.\n  So to further expound on the challenges that we face and the \nimportance of having the resources in the U.S. Government and in the \ninternational monitoring agency called the IAEA that we need to be \nsuccessful in enforcing this deal, I wish to invite my colleague from \nthe State of New Hampshire to rise for a few minutes and to share with \nus her thoughts, having served on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nhaving closely studied this deal, and having looked forward to what the \nopportunities and challenges are for us in the weeks and months ahead.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to be here to \njoin my colleague from Delaware to talk about what is happening with \nenforcement of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  If we want this to succeed, one of the things we need to do is to \nmake sure we support the IAEA, the international agency that is charged \nwith monitoring and verifying Iran's compliance with the agreement. I \nwant to address that first, and then I wish to talk about some national \nsecurity nominees who are also critical as we think about how we \nenforce this deal.\n  First, we all know that the IAEA is absolutely critical to the \ninternational nonproliferation system and to the enforcement of the \nJCPOA. Their employees are working day in and day out to verify \ncritical aspects of the implementation of the agreement that prevents \nIran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n  For example, on December 28, Iran shipped more than 12 tons of low-\nenriched uranium to Russia, where the fuel is stored in a facility that \nis guarded by the IAEA. The IAEA has increased the number of its \ninspectors on the ground in Iran. They have deployed modern \ntechnologies to monitor Iran's nuclear facilities, and they have set up \na comprehensive oversight program of Iran's nuclear facilities.\n  The IAEA is constantly enhancing and improving its efforts. For \nexample, earlier this month they installed the online enrichment \nmonitor, or OLEM, to verify that Iran keeps its level of uranium \nenrichment at up to 3.67 percent, as they committed to under the JCPOA \nto keep it at that 3.67-percent level. This prevents Iran from \nenriching uranium to a point where it could conceivably be used in a \nnuclear weapon.\n  This is new technology. It was developed by the IAEA with significant \nsupport from American scientists at our Department of Energy national \nlabs.\n  As a result of the JCPOA, this new system can be used in Iran.\n  The IAEA resources devoted to verification and monitoring are also \nincreasing considerably with personnel devoted to monitoring Iran's \nnuclear program increasing by 120 percent and the number of days \nmonitors spend in the field by 100 percent. If we want the IAEA to be \nsuccessful in making sure this agreement is successful, we need to \nprovide robust financial support so that they can deploy the best \nscientists in the world for inspections and so that they can deploy the \nbest equipment to monitor Iran's compliance.\n  IAEA Director General Amano has called on member states to provide \nlong-term funding for the IAEA's additional activities in Iran that are \nestimated at approximately $10 million a year. If we think about this \ncost, that is a very good investment for America as we prevent Iran \nfrom getting a nuclear weapon.\n  I have other colleagues on the floor who wish to speak. So I can wait \nand talk about nominees after they have had a chance to speak, if that \nmakes sense.\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COONS. That would be fine. I think there is a strong point being \nmade by my colleague from New Hampshire that I will just briefly \nexpound upon and then invite my colleague from New Jersey to join in \nthis conversation.\n  Earlier this month, I traveled with a number of my Senate colleagues \nto the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency and heard \nfrom them directly the same sorts of concerns my colleague from New \nHampshire just laid down. They are struggling with how to ensure that \nthey have the resources, the staffing, and the equipment to take on \nthis remarkably broadened scope of inspections.\n  One of the underappreciated, positive benefits of the JCPOA is that \nthe IAEA now has unprecedented 24/7 access not just to Iran's nuclear \nenrichment sites but to its centrifuge production workshops, its \nuranium mines mills, the entire so-called fuel cycle for the production \nof nuclear material within Iran. So I believe, as does my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, that the IAEA needs and deserves greater funding, \nmore reliable funding, more robust and long-term funding.\n  The oversight and monitoring mechanisms of the JCPOA, if strictly \nenforced, can serve as a viable deterrent to Iran's cheating and, in a \nworst-case scenario, provide the international community with early \nwarning and enough time to respond if Iran decides to break out and \ndash to a nuclear weapons capability. But access to all of these sites \nis only valuable if the IAEA has the resources it needs and has asked \nfor to conduct thorough inspections.\n  So my colleagues and I will be working together with the \nadministration and others of our colleagues in the months ahead to \nauthorize not just an adequate level of funding of 1 year or 2 years in \nadvance but to put in place a long-term, reliable source of funding. As \nmy colleague from New Hampshire said, there could be no better \ninvestment than in ensuring deterrence through vigorous and \ncomprehensive inspections to prevent Iran from ever renewing its dream \nof access to a nuclear weapon. We will press the administration to work \nwith all of us on this and to make this a higher priority going \nforward.\n  The idea that we have world-class nuclear scientists in the United \nStates and that the IAEA has world-class nuclear inspectors and \ntogether they have developed new technologies and can deploy highly \nskilled teams to do this monitoring in Iran is a great opportunity, but \nit is only meaningful if we contribute the resources to ensure that \nthose inspectors do their jobs.\n  So let me turn to our colleague from the State of New Jersey who \nwants to speak about some of the pros and cons of this critical \nturning-point implementation.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I thank my colleague, and Senator Shaheen as well, for \nemphasizing what I think needs to be emphasized, which is that we have \nin the IAEA an ability to do the most intrusive inspections ever before \nseen on the planet Earth. That agency--an important point Senator \nShaheen was making--needs to be funded and funded well. We need to make \nsure the international community is standing there, and America needs \nto lead in that way.\n  I anticipate hearing Senator Shaheen also make the point, though, \nthat it is the height of malfeasance for us here in this country not to \nhave people in the right places to do the other things necessary to \nhold Iran accountable. We can't sound like a hawk around the debate \nover the JCPOA and then sound like a chicken when it comes to putting \nthe funding forward necessary to prevent them from engaging in \ndestabilizing activities in the region. I am grateful Senator Shaheen \nwill make that point further, but I just want to review again what has \nbeen accomplished come implementation date because it is still an \nextraordinary victory for diplomacy, taking the spectre of a nuclear-\narmed Iran and evaporating, eviscerating, pushing it back at least for \n15 years.\n  In that region, we now have the spectre of a nuclear-armed Iran \npulled back, and we have the ability of moving forward with greater \ndiplomacy. In order to get there, some pretty extraordinary things have \nhappened. We have now effectively blocked Iran's uranium pathway to a \nbomb, with 12 tons of enriched stockpile--virtually all of its \nstockpile--shipped out of its country, and two-third of Iran's \ncentrifuges have been taken offline. So there has been a significant \nremoval of Iran's pathway.\n  In addition, we have blocked the plutonium pathway. The heavy water \nreactor in Iran has been filled with concrete. It is no longer \noperational. It has been permanently disabled. This makes sure that \npathway to producing weapons-grade plutonium has been eliminated for \nthe foreseeable years in the future.\n  Again, it has established unprecedented monitoring. The IAEA has \ngained unprecedented 24/7 access to all of Iran's nuclear facilities, \nincluding the pathway toward a weapon. Now we have intrusive monitoring \nand intelligence-gathering capabilities we never had before.\n  Most recently, Secretary Kerry was able to call upon his Iranian \ncounterpart to secure the release of sailors. The reason why I say that \nis the quick turnaround of the sailors being released shows that these \nhistoric steps of the JCPOA have put us in an environment where \ndiplomacy works in other critical areas.\n  Now, let's be clear, and these are important points I want to make. \nWe must remain vigilant as a Congress and we must be vigilant in this \nbody to make sure that other areas of Iran's activities are being \nwatched in every single way and that there are repercussions for any \nIranian violations of its nuclear agreements. This first step is \nimpressive and historic and has really done a lot of good in removing \nthat nuclear threat for at least 10 to 15 years, but it must come with \nreal repercussions for any violations. The only way to ensure that the \npath of diplomacy is validated is to hold Iran accountable. It must \nmeet all of the commitments--not just those for implementation day but \nduring the whole process of the JCPOA for the many years ahead.\n  Again, the oversight and engagement of Congress on monitoring \nprovisions of this agreement are absolutely vital. That is in many ways \na chorus of conviction amongst my colleagues speaking here tonight to \nmake unmistakably clear that we have eyes and ears on this agreement. \nAll of my colleagues are saying on the floor today that we expect Iran \nto test the bounds of the JCPOA, but if there are signs that Iran is \nnot abiding by the terms of the agreement, we are firm in our \nconviction that Congress must not hesitate to levy new economic \nsanctions, isolate Iran diplomatically and financially, and use \nsecurity and military measures if that is what it takes to keep them \nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Iran's obligations under the JCPOA are ongoing and must be \ncontinually verified. It is one thing for Iran to cooperate \nsufficiently to achieve the transfer of frozen assets and the \ndismantling of the international sanctions regime; it is quite another \nfor it to cooperate in an ongoing basis after these aims have been \nachieved. That is the responsibility of the administration and this \nCongress.\n  The JCPOA must serve as one part of a larger strategy with Iran. This \nis about the nuclear agreement and pushing back the spectre of a \nnuclear-armed Iran. But this is just one part--it must be just one part \nof a larger strategy with Iran. The diplomatic success with the JCPOA \nis commendable, but tensions between our closest partners in the region \nand Iran remain high. I was just there, and we saw the concerns of the \nIsraelis, of Saudi Arabia, of Turkey. Iran is continuing its \ndestabilizing activities, testing ballistic missiles, and further \nflaming tensions in the region. These events demand that we be even \nmore attentive and engaged so that our allies and others know that the \nUnited States will not hesitate in the face of Iran's continued \ndefiance of international rules. The implementation of the JCPOA is \nagain an important step, but as a stand-alone strategy, it is just not \nenough.\n  In addition, Iran has been a bad actor in nonnuclear areas, and the \nUnited States needs to hold it responsible. Therefore, in addition to \nthe accountability measures we are taking with the nuclear regime, \nthere must be an understanding that we cannot allow the Iranians to \ngrow the shadow of this agreement to cover all their other nonnuclear \ndestabilizing activities. Congress and the administration must be\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\nprepared and must be willing to levy appropriate economic sanctions \nneeded to respond robustly to these destabilizing activities.\n  I believe it is unacceptable for us to move forward in any way that \nallows Iran to flaunt international law to violate any of the balance \nof the agreements we have made. We need to make sure we meet them. Iran \ncould try to use the additional funds they receive through this deal to \ndo things that undermine regional security. That cannot be allowed. We \nmust continue to work closely with our allies and respond to every \nsingle bit of Iranian aggression that undermines international order \nand violates international regions.\n  With that, I turn back to Senator Coons to continue this dialogue.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  I wish to emphasize a point he made. We need to remain vigilant. We \nneed to remain ready to impose additional sanctions on those actions by \nIran that are outside the JCPOA. We saw two launches of ballistic \nmissiles by Iran late last year, designations recently having been made \nof those involved in supporting Iran's ballistic missile program.\n  There is other bad behavior by Iran--violations of human rights that \nled to the long and unjust detention of Amir Hekmati and also \npotentially their increased support for terrorism in the region.\n  I invite my colleague from New Hampshire to help us understand what \nbarriers there might be to the administration vigorously enforcing the \nsanctions that remain on the books here in the United States if we as a \nbody don't act to do our part in making sure the administration has the \nresources they need.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank Senator Coons.\n  As we know, one of the challenges is having people in place in the \nvarious agencies who can enforce this agreement and hold Iran \naccountable. That is where I think we have a real challenge because we \nhave a number of nominees who need to be approved, but there are three \nwho stand out as particularly important. First is Tom Shannon, who was \nnominated to be the State Department's Under Secretary for Political \nAffairs. Second is Laura Holgate, who is nominated to be the U.S. \nAmbassador to U.N. offices in Vienna. Included in those offices is the \nIAEA. The third and maybe even the most important as we think about \nfuture sanctions on Iran is Adam Szubin, who has been nominated as the \nTreasury Department's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial \nCrimes.\n  Shannon was nominated on September 18. This nomination is currently \non the floor. Holgate was nominated on August 5. Her nomination is \npending in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Szubin was nominated \non April 16, and his nomination has been held up in the Banking \nCommittee despite the support he has from the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  I know a number of my other colleagues are going to speak to these \nnominees, but I would like to point out that last week we had a hearing \nin the Foreign Relations Committee on the implementation of the JCPOA, \nand one of the witnesses who had not been a supporter of the \nagreement--Michael Singh--was a witness at that committee hearing. I \nasked him about Adam Szubin. He described him as a ``good guy who had \ndone great work for the country'' and as someone whose nomination \nshould go forward because it would allow us to continue to look at the \nsanctions regime and what we need to do.\n  The reality is--and I am sorry to say this because I think it \ncontributes to what the American public is concerned about when they \nlook at us in Washington and what we are doing. I think these \nnominations are being held up for purely political reasons. It has \nnothing to do with the background of these candidates, with their \nexpertise, or with what they would do on the job; this is about \nindividuals within this body who are trying to hold up these people for \ntheir own political gain. I think this delay is harming the national \nsecurity interests of the United States. It is something every one of \nus ought to be concerned about, and we ought to be yelling about this \nbecause it is long past time that we confirm these individuals, let \nthem do their jobs, and continue to do everything we can to protect \nthis Nation's national security.\n  I thank Senator Coons for organizing all of us to come to the floor \ntoday to talk about what we need to do as we are implementing the joint \nplan of action.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I want to emphasize again that these three nominees--Tom Shannon, \nLaura Holgate, and Adam Szubin--have been waiting for months. In \nparticular, Adam Szubin is a nonpartisan career professional, having \nserved in both the Bush and Obama administrations. Being the lead \nenforcer, the lead investigator in sanctions, he has now been nominated \nto take on the top role at the Department of Treasury in making sure \nour sanctions have bite and stick.\n  Why wouldn't we proceed on a bipartisan basis to give this \nadministration the senior officials and the resources it needs to \nenforce sanctions, to keep us safe, to make sure this nuclear deal is \nenforced? Whether we voted for or against it, supported it or opposed \nit, I can't comprehend why any Senator would consent to the ongoing \nmonths-long delay in these vital nominees being confirmed so that the \nadministration can do the job that I believe all of us want them to do, \nwhich is to enforce sanctions against Iran for its bad behavior.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. COONS. Of course.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. It is my understanding that Adam Szubin has been held \nup and we have never heard a reason why he is being held up in that \ncommittee. Is that the Senator's understanding as well?\n  Mr. COONS. That is my understanding as well. There is no publicly \narticulated basis--certainly no basis that has anything do with his \nqualifications, skills, experience or relevance to the job--as is the \ncase with all three of these nominees.\n  There are many other nominees we could be talking about, whether for \njudgeships, ambassadorships or senior positions. These three we have \nchosen to focus on today because they are so directly relevant to \nAmerica's national security and to the successful enforcement of this \ncomplex nuclear deal with Iran.\n  As I said, and Senator Shaheen and Senator Booker said earlier, the \nIAEA has incredibly broad scope to investigate what is going on in \nIran, but if we don't have the senior people in our government, in the \nadministration, that can take action when things are discovered in Iran \nthat we want to be active in taking on or when there is bad behavior \noutside of this nuclear agreement, we have no one to blame but \nourselves as a body for failing to provide our administration with the \nsenior leadership and the skills and the resources needed to really \ndefend America.\n  I wish to encourage and invite my colleague from the State of \nConnecticut to add, as he wishes today, both the positives about \nimplementation day and the concerns he might have going forward, such \nas these vital national security nominees whom Senator Shaheen and I \nhave been discussing.\n  Senator Murphy.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Senator Coons, thank you for convening us.\n  I think it is important to restate the progress we have made. I know \nit has been said before, but frankly not enough attention has been paid \nto the fact that since implementation day Iran has shipped 12 tons of \nenriched uranium out of Iran and kept enrichment at that 3.67 level, \nwhich is significantly below what is necessary to create a bomb. They \nfilled the core of the Iraq plutonium reactor with concrete, preventing \nthem from producing weapons-grade plutonium. They started to allow the \nIAEA access to the entire nuclear fuel cycle or uranium enrichment, \nincluding their centrifuge production shops and uranium mines and \nmills.\n  Of course, as has been stated before, the IAEA has been given an \nunprecedented level of access to the entirety of the supply chain \nleading up to any future potential development of a nuclear weapon. \nThat is an unprecedented level of access that will require an \nunprecedented level of support. We are talking about an additional \n$10.6 million per year that the IAEA is going to\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nneed to carry out these oversight responsibilities. The United States \nputs up a percentage of IAEA's funding, but it is still the minority of \nfunding.\n  One development that we need to guard against are attempts in \nCongress to undermine this agreement in very quiet, subtle ways. There \nis a bill that has been introduced in the House of Representatives that \nwould disallow the United States from funding the IAEA unless it grants \nthe United States access to the contents of proprietary bilateral \narrangements. That would have the results of stripping the funding \nnecessary to carry out this agreement. If the IAEA doesn't get U.S. \nfunding, it simply can't have the purview it has been granted, by \nvirtue of this agreement, of the entire field cycle throughout the \ncountry.\n  As important as it is to get the personnel in place who can enforce \nthis agreement, who can root out the ways in which Iran may take money \nthey get by virtue of this deal and support terrorism in the region, it \nis also important to make sure the IAEA is properly funded as well.\n  Senator Coons, the only comment I would add to this discussion is \nthis. I think for those of us who supported this agreement--I will \nspeak for myself. I supported it because this was the most effective \nway to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon--period, stop. With \nthis agreement, we were much more likely to prevent Iran from obtaining \na nuclear weapon than we were without this agreement, but we certainly \naccepted the premise that it is in our long-term security and strategic \ninterest as a country to facilitate the transition of power within Iran \nfrom the hardliners who have chosen a path of Iranian foreign policy to \nbe simply a provocateur and an irritant in the region to the more \nmoderate elements who would like to see Iran reengage on big questions \nof both regional and global security.\n  I don't think you can count on that happening. I don't think anybody \nshould have voted for this agreement or supported this agreement \nbecause they were counting on that being the end result, but you have \nstarted to see a different level of engagement, whether it is with the \nrelease of the prisoners as you spoke about, whether it was about the \nresolution of the detainment of U.S. personnel, and we will shortly see \nwhether this battle that plays out almost every day inside Iran is \nultimately accruing to the benefit of the moderates. We will have \nelections next month in Iran.\n  I think we should support this agreement because it strips from Iran \nthe ability to rush to a nuclear weapon, and you see the evidence \nalready in the steps they have taken since the implementation \nagreement, but I think we should read with some level of positive \ninterpretation some of the resolution of crises that we have seen just \nin the time passed over the course of 2016. That doesn't mean there \naren't still enormous issues still at stake, but it is in our security \ninterests, and it was part of the discussion of this agreement to \nultimately bring Iran to a place in which the will of the vast majority \nof that country be expressed in the leaders who speak to the world \ncommunity.\n  I thank Senator Coons for continuing to bring us down to the floor. I \nthink as important as it is to talk about the positive steps that have \nbeen taken since implementation day, it is also important to note that \nwe have a lot of work undone--whether it be funding the IAEA, \nconfirming these important positions--and we have a lot of work to do \nin terms of remaining vigilant about the quiet, subtle ways that may be \nundertaken in this body and across the hall in the House of \nRepresentatives to try to undermine this deal that is working.\n\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. COONS. I wish to thank my colleague from Connecticut for his \nactive leadership role on the Foreign Relations Committee and his deep \ninterest in this topic.\n  By way of transition to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I briefly \nwant to point out this picture of the Arak heavy water reactor in Iran. \nTo me, it is a symbol of both what implementation day and the JCPOA \nletter promises positively and the unresolved risks it presents.\n  Implementation day has only been reached because the IAEA--the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency--certified to the world that Iran \nhad taken the very core of this reactor, capable of producing weapons-\ngrade plutonium, and filled it with concrete, rendering it useless for \nthe production of significant quantities of plutonium. That is a \nsignificant step forward, but when a reporter asked me the other day: \nDoes Iran still pose a nuclear threat to the United States and our \nvital ally Israel, I said: Of course. When asked why, I said because \nthey still possess the knowledge, the resources, the engineering, the \nuranium in the ground, in the mines, in the mills of their country, and \nthe engineers and the facilities to at some point enrich once again to \nweapons grade. If we don't stay on this, if we don't fund the IAEA \neffectively to conduct this oversight and these inspections, if we \ndon't stay attentive to this issue, we will simply wake up again at a \npoint 5, 10, 15 years from now and discover that what we have in Iran \nis a nation that has translated its natural resources, its rich uranium \ndeposits, and its engineering know-how into once again being in a place \nto threaten the world.\n  I wish to invite my colleague from Pennsylvania to talk about how our \nregional vital allies perceive the path forward and what concerns he \nhas and how he sees implementation day.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I first of all thank Senator Coons and my \nother colleagues who are working on this. It is very important to walk \nthrough where we are in the process. If I had to step back at this \nmoment and say: Well, now that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \nis moving forward and we are beyond implementation day, what do we have \nto look for over time? If I had to boil that down to three words--\nreally three goals we must work toward every day. On some days it has \nto be the United States on its own and other days working with allies, \nthose who participated in this agreement and signed it and partners in \nthe region--but the three words I guess would be as implementation is \ngoing forward, we have to focus on three goals: enforce, counter, and \ndeter. Enforce, making sure the agreement is enforced at every step. I \nwill get to the issue of the consequences for violations of the \nagreement. Counter, meaning countering the Iranian aggression in the \nregion. That is why it was so important that the President and the \nadministration he leads was very clear about the designation and the \nsanctioning of the Iranian regime as it relates to ballistic missile \nlaunches and their activity. The third is deter. We have to have a \ndeterrence policy that stays in place and, if anything, is strengthened \nover time.\n  If we do a good job on those three things over the next several \ndecades--literally--enforcing the agreement, countering the aggression, \nand deterring them--we will have the result we want years from now.\n  First of all, on the question of consequences, similar to a lot of \nMembers of the Senate when I made a decision about the agreement, I \nwrote down page after page walking through my reasons. At the time I \nwrote the following: ``We have to prepare for the possibility that the \nIranian regime may violate the agreement and may even engage in \nactivity constituting significant non-compliance with the JCPOA.''\n  That is what I wrote several months ago. That still holds true today. \nWe must not trust in Iran's compliance. In fact, some may say that \nusing President Reagan's old formula, which was ``trust but verify''--\nand I will be blunt about this, these are my words--in this case, until \nproven otherwise, we must mistrust and verify, mistrust the regime and \nverify. That is the nature of where things are right now.\n  We have to vigorously verify any asserted reason or action the \nIranians would take. Also, in the process of doing that, we have to \nwork with our partners to ensure that any violations will be met with \nswift multilateral consequences. That means we need other nations to \nhelp us. We can't do this on our own.\n  We cannot know whether and how the Iranian regime might violate the \nagreement. For example, we might see them drag their feet on allowing \nthe IAEA access to certain nuclear sites, especially ones where covert \nactivity may be suspected.\n  I firmly believe hardliners in Iran will be watching how we respond \nto\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nany violation. The best way to condition behavior, the best way to \nimpact what they might do, the best way to cause them a second thought \ndown the road is to aggressively enforce violations of the agreement.\n  It is important we work in lock step with our European partners to \nprepare for these violations. I hope it doesn't come to pass, but I \nthink we have to assume, and I will assume, that they will violate the \nagreement. Many of us met with our European friends before making \ndecisions about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. We need to \ncontinue these conversations to ensure that as businesses and business \nties increase between the Iranian regime and Europe and other parts of \nthe world, we have to remain unified in our stance on the potential \nIranian violations of the deal. That is about violations.\n  The second and final point, briefly but so important to our \ndeliberations and our actions, our friend and ally Israel, the \nrelationship between the United States and Israel is unbreakable. We \nhave to make sure that as we move forward with the implementation of \nthe agreement, we insist that our policy reflects that unbreakable \nrelationship and also continues what has been very strong support for \nIsrael for many years, if not generations, now. We have to recognize at \nthe same time that Israel faces significant threats from Iran and its \nproxies, especially Hezbollah and Hamas. We also have to assume that \nIran will continue its aggression in the region. That is why I talked \nabout countering that aggression before. And we have to assume that \nIran will try to expand its support for terrorism.\n\n  We have already taken some initial steps to expand cooperation with \nIsrael on defense and homeland security, including beginning \nconsultations toward a new 10-year memorandum of understanding, or MOU. \nThat memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation is vital in \ninitiating new efforts to address, among other threats, the terror \ntunnels Hamas has constructed, which threaten Israel all the time.\n  I urge the administration to focus on the capabilities Israel \nrequires to face both conventional and asymmetric threats and to ensure \nthat the new memorandum of understanding constitutes a transformational \ninvestment--not just one budget year to the next budget year or \nappropriation to appropriation year--in our bilateral relationship with \nIsrael going forward. We should all meet with Israeli leaders to hear \ntheir firsthand assessments of the threats and to reassert our mutual \ninterests in countering Iranian aggression.\n  I yield the microphone to my colleague Senator Coons again, but first \nI wish to thank the Senator from Delaware for his leadership and for \nwhat I believe is a bipartisan determination that we have to do \neverything possible to enforce this agreement aggressively, with \nconsequences when there is a violation, counter Iranian aggression in \nthe region and beyond, and deter, deter, deter over what will be more \nthan one generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for \nhis clear-eyed assessment of the challenges that lie ahead as we try to \nmove past implementation day and into a positive world where together \nwe might be able to provide the administration with the resources they \nneed to enforce the agreement, counter Iran's bad behavior, and deter \nIran from any further illicit or bad behavior.\n  I wish to invite my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Kaine of Virginia, to offer any thoughts he might care to share \nat this point before we bring this colloquy to a close.\n  I know Senator Kaine has followed the importance of the inspections \nregime under the JCPOA closely. As Senator Shaheen and I both \nreferenced earlier, full and robust funding of the IAEA is the only way \nto ensure they really have the ability to enforce this agreement and \nmake sure this heavy water reactor does not somehow get redesigned, \nreengineered, and restarted in the future.\n  I invite my friend and colleague from Virginia to offer his thoughts \non how to make sure we are effectively enforcing this deal.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for taking the floor \non this important matter. While I serve on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I actually want to talk about this issue from my standpoint \non the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  I happen to believe that one of the most valuable military assets we \nhave as a nation is information intelligence. In that capacity, what we \nhave under the JCPOA is the dramatic ability to learn, sadly, from \ntragic mistakes.\n  After more than a decade of war in Iraq and thousands of lives lost, \nwe know that operating in an environment where we base national \nsecurity decisions on what we don't know rather than what we do know \ncan be tragically costly.\n  Over the weekend, there was press about a recently declassified \nreport from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on weapons of mass destruction. \nIt was submitted to former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in \nSeptember of 2002, around the time Congress and the administration were \ntrying to decide whether to invade Iraq. The report that was given to \nthe Secretary of Defense--and it was not widely shared with the \nadministration or Congress at the time--confirmed that our officials at \nthe very top levels of the intel and military community knew very \nlittle about the actual status of Iraq's WMD program. The report \nconcluded that what we suspect is ``based largely--perhaps 90 percent--\non analysis of imprecise intelligence.''\n  While the national security apparatus was acknowledging that it was \noperating in the dark, it was nevertheless planning for war.\n  On March 7, 2003, 2 weeks before the beginning of the Iraq invasion, \nthe IAEA presented to the U.N. an updated report on Iraq's nuclear \nactivities. The report stated that they had conducted 218 nuclear \ninspections at 141 sites and concluded at the time that there was no \nindication of resumed nuclear activities since 1998, no indication that \nIraq had attempted to import uranium since 1990, no indication that \nIraq had imported aluminium tubes, and no indication that they had \nsought to import magnets for use in centrifuge enrichment. The IAEA \nsaid they had no information suggesting that Iraq had a WMD program \nspecifically with nuclear weapons.\n  We ignored what the IAEA told the U.N. the world, and us, and instead \nwe went to war based upon a national intelligence estimate that said we \ndidn't know what they were doing. That decision locked us into a decade \nof combat operations which resulted in a tragic cost. We know the rest \nof the story: 4,484 Americans lost their lives in connection with the \nwar in Iraq from 2003 to 2011 and another 32,246 Americans were \nwounded. We also know that it turned out the IAEA was right. Once the \nwar was waged and we got in and had our own ability to gather \nintelligence and information, we found out that Iraq didn't have a \nprogram of weapons of mass destruction, so we went to war based upon a \nfaulty assessment and we didn't have the information we needed.\n  Let's contrast what happened in 2002 and 2003 with the opportunity we \nnow have before us as a result of the JCPOA. The agreement of Iran to \nfollow for the next 25 years an enhanced inspection regime and be \ninspected by the IAEA to a standard that no other country in the world \nmust follow is very unique. It will provide us and all of our \ninternational partners with significant intelligence about Iran's \nprogram. After year 25, Iran has also agreed to submit and follow the \nadditional protocol of the IAEA, which also guarantees significant \nintelligence and inspections.\n  What does that give us? It arms us with information. It arms us with \nfacts. It arms us with intelligence. Those are some of the best \nmilitary assets we can have. With intelligence, we obviously hope that \nIran never makes a move to develop nuclear weapons, but if they do, \nwith intelligence we can blow the whistle and inform the world that \nthey are violating paragraph 1, page 1 of the agreement where they \npledged never to seek, acquire, or develop nuclear weapons. With \nintelligence, we can make a wise decision rather than a blind decision \nas to whether we should send American men and women into war to try to \nstop a nuclear weapons program. With intelligence, we can even target \nmilitary action to be more effective. That is what the JCPOA gives us \nthat we\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\ndidn't have before. That is what it gives us that we didn't have in \nIraq, and we regret that we didn't have it.\n  I say to the Senator from Delaware that I noticed during our recent \nvisit to Israel that the tone seems to be changing a little bit as far \nas our dialogue with our Israeli allies about this deal because the \ndramatic nature of the intelligence is now being seen by our strong \nallies in Israel as something that is potentially transformative.\n  Two days ago, the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces gave a \nspeech in Tel Aviv. Gadi Eizenkot spoke on Monday at a national \nsecurity conference in Tel Aviv and basically said that the nuclear \ndeal with Iran constitutes a strategic turning point. He didn't \nwhitewash it; he said ``many risks but also opportunities.'' What are \nthe opportunities? He said the deal reduces the immediate Iranian \nthreat to Israel because it rolls back Iran's nuclear capabilities and \ndeepens the monitoring capabilities of the international community.\n  After all the drama about how it was a historic mistake, how \nrefreshing it was to go to Israel a few weeks ago and hear security and \nintel officials talk about what this enhanced intelligence meant with \nrespect to Israel's security.\n  We know there is no guarantee that a diplomatic deal will work out, \nand my colleagues have laid out the need for strict implementation, but \nwe also know--and we have the scar tissue, so this is painful \nknowledge--that we are much safer if we have better information, we are \nmuch safer if we have better intel, and we will make much better \ndecisions.\n  I certainly pray that we will never again send American men and women \ninto war based on a false intelligence assessment. The only way we can \nguard against that eventuality is to have stronger intelligence. The \nIAEA inspections will give us better intelligence and should help us \nmake better military decisions in the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor back to my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. We had a \nterrific experience traveling together to Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, \nand Vienna. In Vienna, we met with the leadership of the IAEA. We asked \ntough questions and learned more about their needs and plans for \nthoroughly inspecting every aspect of Iran's nuclear program. We heard \nabout the concerns of our close regional allies in Turkey and Saudi \nArabia.\n  We need to strengthen our partnership with regional allies who are \nuncertain about the future with ISIS but who were, frankly, grateful \nfor the increased intelligence partnerships between the United States, \nTurkey, and Saudi Arabia, but most importantly with our vital ally \nIsrael, as the good Senator from Virginia has recounted. We heard from \nthe Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, opposition leadership, and \nintelligence and defense community leaders that the partnership with \nthe United States is stronger than it has ever been and that they view \nthis path forward with Iran as having challenges and opportunities--\nopportunities in terms of intelligence to be gained, opportunities in \nterms of pushing back on what was a rapidly advancing Iranian nuclear \ninfrastructure and program, and now a challenge--a challenge to work \ntogether and provide exactly the sort of oversight and engagement that \nonly a duly-empowered and active Congress can take.\n  Let me close out the colloquy of six Senators by making a few simple \nobservations, if I might. Congress has an essential role to play in \nensuring that this nuclear deal with Iran moves forward and moves \nforward in our best national interest. Congress should not only provide \noversight but also take action. The simplest is a point about which \nSenator Shaheen spoke at length--the importance of securing key \nnational security nominees essential to the enforcement of sanctions.\n  We can also take proactive action here in this Chamber by passing the \nIran Policy Oversight Act. Its drafting was led by Senator Cardin of \nMaryland, but a dozen other colleagues--some who opposed and some who \nsupported the deal--joined in as initial cosponsors. It is a bill that \nwould clarify some ambiguous provisions of the JCPOA, establish in \nstatute America's commitment to enforcing the deal, engage us in more \ncomprehensive efforts to counter Iranian activity in the Middle East, \nand provide increased support to our allies in the region, especially \nour valued ally Israel. This is a step this body can and should take, \nand to do so would be much in the bipartisan spirit we saw in the \nForeign Relations Committee between Chairman Corker and Ranking Member \nCardin that produced the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  I think passing the Iran Policy Oversight Act would be a strong and \nimportant contribution by this Chamber.\n  Speaking for only myself, I will also say that I think we should \nreauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act, which is set to expire this year. \nHaving that law reauthorized would provide a viable framework through \nwhich the United States could snap back sanctions if Iran violated the \nJCPOA.\n  Each of the ideas we have outlined--confirming vital national \nsecurity nominees; passing enforcement legislation; and fully funding, \nreliably and for the long term, the IAEA, the inspections watchdog that \nis supposed to keep a close and persistent eye on Iran's nuclear \nfacilities represents critical--these represent critical, concrete \nsteps Congress can take.\n  If the United States alone cannot enforce this complex deal, we have \nto keep building international support for the imposition of new \nsanctions to punish Iran for its ongoing human rights abuses, its \nillegal ballistic missile activity, and its support for terrorism in \nthe Middle East.\n  If we are going to be serious about our constitutional role to \nprovide for the common defense and general welfare, I would argue that \nwe here in the Senate have a sacred obligation to provide not only \noversight of this deal but to also take action and enforce its terms \nand push back on Iran's bad behavior and to demonstrate to the world \nthat the United States is serious about securing a peaceful, nuclear-\nfree future, as difficult as that may be, for the Middle East.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues who joined me here on the floor and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the bill we have on \nthe floor and how important I think it is not only to my State but to \nour United States in terms of our energy security and energy policy \nmodernization.\n  I rise to support the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016. I \nthink this legislation recognizes the critical need to improve our \nNation's energy infrastructure and how we can use our natural \nresources.\n  I commend Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell for their \nhard work to get this bill on the floor. I am honored to be a member of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The open process they led \nin the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, resulted in a strong bipartisan vote of 18 to 4 in support of \nthis bill.\n  I think it goes without saying, but this country needs an updated, \ncomprehensive policy that brings an ``all of the above'' approach to \nthe way we utilize energy. This is the first major energy legislation \nto be considered by the Senate since 2007. This bill will help make our \nhomes, our cars, our public buildings--think about how old and \ninefficient a lot of our public buildings are, including our schools--\nmore energy efficient. It will help improve our parks and lands through \nthe reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  This bill will enhance our ability to fully utilize our vast natural \nresources so that we remain and become even more energy secure in the \nyears to come.\n  There are few people who know energy potential better than the people \nof West Virginia. West Virginia's Marcellus region has the largest \nshale gas reserves in the United States. It is really a magnificent \nthing to watch as it is developing. It is a job creator, an excitement \ncreator, and a revenue generator. It is a reason to have a revitalized \npart of our State come alive as we participate in the energy economy. \nCoupled with the nearby Utica region, these two shale formations have \naccounted for major increases in natural gas production since 2012.\n  West Virginia's natural gas production has nearly quadrupled between \nthe\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nyears 2008 and 2014. As I said earlier, it has happened fast and quick, \nand it has really exploded throughout the region in terms of job \ncreation.\n  Unfortunately, despite this unprecedented increase in natural gas \nrecovery, our producers have been underserved by a lack of pipeline \ncapacity. Nobody knew this existed until just in the last 10, 12 years. \nOur current permitting process for pipelines can take years. It is slow \nand uncertain, which means delayed construction, if we get to \nconstruction, and, in turn, delayed manufacturing projects and access \nto affordable energy. Many manufacturers across this country rely on \ncheap, affordable natural gas, not just as an energy producer but in \nour chemical industries as feedstock to create.\n  Last spring, the Charleston Daily Mail editorialized that ``the big \ngas boom that has increased employment and tax revenue in West Virginia \nhas slowed considerably less due to slowing markets than a lack of \npipeline infrastructure to carry the burgeoning supplies.''\n  Earlier this month, the Clarksburg Exponent Telegram, another fine \nnewspaper in West Virginia, editorialized that ``the promise of more \nthan 18,000 jobs tied to the construction of six interstate gas \npipelines is the last hope for prosperity for a generation of Mountain \nState residents.'' The paper continued that regulatory delays are \nslowing these important projects.\n  West Virginia has been hard hit by job loss in the energy sector. \nJust this week, more than 850 West Virginia coal miners received \nnotices that their jobs may be at risk. They join more than 500 other \nWest Virginia miners who were informed after the start of this year \nthat they would be losing their jobs, not to mention that the whole \ntotal job loss in the coal economy in my State has been 10,000 direct \njobs, as miners as well as some other indirect jobs that contribute to \nthe mining industry, most recently CSX and Norfolk Southern, are \nannouncing cutbacks.\n  Moving forward with improvements to our energy infrastructure will \ncreate construction jobs and economic opportunity in my State, where \nboth are desperately needed. That is why I am pleased that this bill \nincludes language that I introduced, along with Senators Heitkamp and \nCassidy, that would address the fragmented and prolonged permitting \nprocess for pipelines. This provision will streamline the application \nprocess so pipelines can be constructed in a more timely and efficient \nmanner and will meet our energy transportation needs, along with \nmeeting the environmental requirements that we feel are proper in order \nto site the pipelines.\n  The provision establishes FERC as the lead agency for the permitting \nprocess. This helps to address any interagency squabbles or disputes \nthat can lead to project delay.\n  We must make use of our natural resources to grow our domestic \nmanufacturing. We should also use our abundant gas reserves to export \nliquefied natural gas to our allies. A strong export policy will bring \njobs and revenue to producing States such as my State of West Virginia \nand to many others across the country. It will also help with energy \nsecurity for our allies in Europe and Japan at a time of growing \ninstability around the globe.\n  This bill includes Senator Barrasso's bill to expedite LNG export \npermitting so that natural gas produced here in America can be sold to \nour allies around the world. Going forward, innovation will be a key \ncomponent in powering West Virginia's energy economy.\n  In addition to our rich natural gas reserves, West Virginia has been \none of the major producers of coal for energy generation in this \ncountry for decades--centuries. My State and our Nation have faced an \nuphill battle in the administration's war on coal, despite the fact \nthat coal still remains America's baseload energy source. We need a \ncommonsense approach to coal-fired energy generation, one that doesn't \nsimply try to eliminate it but instead incorporates it into a modern, \ninnovative energy policy.\n  That is why I cosponsored language included in this bill, with \nSenators Manchin and Portman, that will revitalize the fossil energy \nprogram at the Department of Energy. This program is critical to the \nresearch and development of new technologies that make fossil energy \nmore efficient and more reliable, while at the same time reducing \nemissions.\n  One of the most promising advances in fossil energy technology is \ncarbon capture utilization and storage. Not only will this technology \nensure that our significant coal reserves are part of an overall \nstrategy, but it could also be used for enhanced oil recovery that will \nfurther strengthen our energy security.\n  A modern energy policy must recognize that coal and natural gas will \nremain a key part of our Nation's energy portfolio for decades to come. \nI think everybody agrees that the baseload needs to be there. By acting \nnow to support infrastructure and innovation, we can support jobs and \ngrow our economy for future generations.\n  I started out my speech talking about the way this bill moved through \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee and how bipartisan it was \nand how we worked out the wrinkles. I, again, wish to thank Chairwoman \nMurkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell for the way they wove through a \nvery complicated procedure.\n  This bipartisan legislation is critical to all Americans and their \nfamilies. It means more efficient, affordable, and reliable energy for \nmillions of people. It makes us energy secure and more competitive with \nother countries in innovative energy and efficiency technologies.\n  These are the reasons why I support this important piece of \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak about an \namendment I have filed and that will soon reach the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, we don't yet know the exact number of the \namendment because we are refiling a minor correction to it. However, I \nwish to talk about a very critical amendment that I and a number of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle are bringing to the legislation \ntoday dealing with nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is one of the key \nelements of our national energy policy, and it must be one that is \nstrengthened and improved as we move forward into the new global energy \nclimate that we are dealing with in this country.\n  I wish to start out, however, by going back in time. Sixty-four years \nago, in a desert plain near Arco, ID, the Idaho National Reactor \nTesting Station used the Experimental Breeder Reactor, known as EBR-1, \nto light four lightbulbs. This was the first time in the history of the \nworld that a nuclear reactor was used to generate electrical power. \nThis singular event proved that atomic energy could be used to create \ncommercial electricity.\n  After this momentous event, EBR-1 went on to serve its real purpose, \nproving it was possible to build a reactor that could create more fuel \nthan it consumed. Breeder reactors were possible. Another reactor at \nthe National Reactor Testing Station named BORAX-III went on to power \nthe entire town of Arco, ID. Now, Arco is not a huge metropolis like \nNew York City, but there, once again, a nuclear reactor was used to \nprovide the electrical needs of an entire city--another energy first \nfor nuclear energy in our history. So began the legacy of what would \nbecome the Idaho National Laboratory, which is now the home of over 50 \none-of-a-kind nuclear reactors.\n  Everything the lab did was new. Everything was innovative. The lab in \nIdaho went on to achieve tremendous breakthroughs--breakthrough after \nbreakthrough. The imagination, ingenuity and hard work of the \nscientists in Idaho's lab now, along with the same ingenuity of \nscientists at Argonne and Oak Ridge, ensured that the United States was \nthe leader in the development and commercialization of nuclear energy.\n  Today, many in the industry are focusing on what it takes to keep a \ncurrent fleet of reactors alive and operational. Industry leaders are \nworried about waste issues, the economics of operation, and navigating \nthe requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Understandably, \nmany are not focused on the future of nuclear energy\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\nand what lies beyond the current generation of reactors.\n  Congress must find a way to help deal with the very real challenges \nthat the current generation of nuclear reactors face. Congress must \nalso address the waste issue, and we must evaluate the safety and cost \nbenefits of regulations the government has placed on this industry. \nMany of the burdens on the nuclear industry are government created, and \nso they must be government solved. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to do our part \nin providing sound solutions.\n  Congress needs to find a way to multitask. Again, we can't ignore the \nchallenges of the current fleet of reactors, but we must not allow \nthese challenges to keep us from looking forward. The nuclear industry \nin America is, for better or worse, completely controlled by the \ngovernment. Congress must lead in preparing government agencies to move \nforward into the future and to prepare for the next generation of our \nnuclear reactors. If our government is not able to create an \nenvironment in which the industry can grow and advance, companies will \ntake their technologies overseas. We have seen this begin to happen \nalready. Companies are now going to places such as China, Russia, South \nKorea, and India. These countries want to develop exportable nuclear \ntechnology. If we continue down our current path, these countries will \ntake the lead in establishing nonproliferation norms and safety norms \nin the advanced nuclear industry. I would prefer that America continue \nto lead in this area.\n  Today, Senators Whitehouse, Risch, Booker, Hatch, Kirk, Durbin, and I \nintroduced the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, or NEICA, as \nan amendment to the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2016. This \nmeasure is the Senate companion to the House measure of the same name, \nintroduced by Representatives Randy Weber, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and \nLamar Smith. I wish to thank my colleagues for their hard work on this \nmeasure. As my colleagues can tell from the list I gave, it is highly \nbipartisan. There is broad support for this legislation on both sides \nof the aisle and on both sides of the Rotunda.\n  We are all very excited by this legislation, and we all agree that \ninnovation within the nuclear industry must continue. America's \npreeminence in all things nuclear must endure.\n  The Senate version of NEICA would do four very important things to \nencourage innovation in advanced nuclear.\n  No. 1, the bill directs the Department of Energy to carry out a \nmodeling and simulation program that aids in the development of new \nreactor technologies. This is an important first step that allows the \nprivate sector to have access to the capabilities of our national labs \nto test reactor designs and concepts.\n  No. 2, the measure also requires the DOE to report its plan to \nestablish a user facility for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron \nsource. This is a critical step that will allow private companies the \nability to test the principles of nuclear science and prove the science \nbehind their work.\n  No. 3, NEICA directs the Department of Energy to carry out a program \nto enable the testing and demonstration of reactor concepts proposed \nand funded by the private sector. This site is to be called the \nNational Nuclear Innovation Center and will function as a database to \nstore and share knowledge on nuclear science between Federal agencies \nand the private sector. The Senate version of NEICA encourages the \nDepartment of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to work \ntogether in this effort. We would like to see the DOE lead the effort \nto establish and operate the National Nuclear Innovation Center while \nconsulting with the NRC regarding safety issues. We would also like to \nsee the NRC have access to the work being done by the center in order \nto provide its staff with the knowledge it will need eventually to \nlicense any new reactors coming out of the center. If these reactors \nare ever to get to the market, the NRC must be able to understand the \nins and outs of the science and work behind their development. The NRC \nneeds the data in order to make data-driven licensing requirements.\n  No. 4, the Senate version of the NEICA requires the NRC to report on \nits ability to license advanced reactors within 4 years of receiving an \napplication. The NRC must explain any institutional or organizational \nbarriers it faces in moving forward with the prompt licensing of \nadvanced reactors.\n  As I said earlier, this bill is an important step forward in \nmaintaining the United States' leadership in nuclear energy. It is my \nhope this bill will enable the private sector and our national labs to \nwork together to create new mind-blowing achievements in nuclear \nscience. This bill encourages the smartest, most innovative and \ncreative minds in nuclear science to partner together to move the \nindustry forward.\n  The NEICA is an exciting piece of legislation. I look forward to \nworking with my congressional colleagues to help the American nuclear \nenergy industry thrive today and prepare for the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S240-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S240-S243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John \nMichael Vazquez, of New Jersey, to be United States District Judge for \nthe District of New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                    Energy Policy Modernization Bill\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of \n2015 is a crucial step forward in modernizing our country's energy \npolicy and public lands management for the first time in nearly a \ndecade, and we are doing it in a strong, bipartisan fashion. Moreover, \nwe are taking the necessary steps to secure our Nation's energy future, \nin turn increasing economic opportunity and protecting our Nation's \nsecurity needs.\n  Here are a few important components of this bill that I would like to \nhighlight.\n  No. 1, it permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. This is an important tool for increasing public access to public \nlands and one of the country's best conservation programs.\n  No. 2, this bill also streamlines the permitting for the export of \nliquefied natural gas, allowing more American energy to power the \nworld.\n  Montana is the fifth largest producer of hydropower in the Nation, \nand we have 23 hydroelectric dams. This bill strengthens our Nation's \nhydropower development by streamlining the permitting process of new \nprojects and finally defining hydropower as a renewable resource. Only \nWashington, DC, would not define hydropower as a renewable resource. \nThis cleans that up by statute, allowing FERC to provide more time to \nconstruct new hydroelectric facilities on existing dams. It also \nextends construction licenses for Gibson Dam and Clark Canyon Dam, two \nprojects critical to tax revenue and jobs for communities in Montana.\n  This energy bill establishes a pilot project to streamline drilling \npermits if less than 25 percent of the minerals within the spacing unit \nare federal minerals. The provision, sponsored by my good friend the \nsenior Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Hoeven, is of particular \nimportance to Montana, given the patchwork of land and mineral \nownership in the Bakken.\n  It also improves the Federal permitting of critical and strategic \nmineral production, which supports thousands of good-paying Montana \njobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues for our State \nto support our infrastructure, our schools, and our teachers. Metal and \nnonmetal mining has created more than 8,500 good-paying Montana jobs. \nIn fact, mining helps support more than 19,000 jobs in total across \nMontana. Metal mining in Montana has contributed $403 million in taxes, \nand nonmetal mining produces $128 million every year. This includes \n$288 million of State and local taxes.\n  Finally, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015 modernizes and\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\nstrengthens the reliability and security of bulk power in America's \nelectrical grid. In Montana, we know the important balance of \nresponsibly developing our natural resources and serving as good \nstewards of our environment. Our energy sector supports thousands of \ngood-paying jobs for union workers and tribal workers. Access to our \nState's one-of-a-kind public lands is critical to our State's tourism \neconomy and our very way of life in Montana. This bill facilitates all \nthese goals.\n  Given the overwhelming support this bill received in committee, I am \nhopeful that this bill will also receive strong bipartisan support as \nwe work through the amendment process and take a final vote on this \nbill next week.\n  I also look forward to having the opportunity to make this bill even \nbetter for our Nation. This legislation makes important gains for \nMontana energy, but there is still work to do. We can't fully discuss \nour Nation's energy future without also addressing the President's \nmoratorium on new Federal coal leases and royalty increase attempts for \nFederal coal, oil, and natural gas. I hope we can work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to address these important issues, which have a \nsignificant impact on jobs, tax revenue, and energy prices in Montana.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Cantwell, \nand their staffs for their work in getting us to this point. I look \nforward to seeing and voting on additional amendments from my \ncolleagues in the coming days, and I look forward to getting this bill \nacross the finish line, providing the American people with a \ncomprehensive energy policy that works to support both our economic \nsecurity as well as our national security.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of \nJohn Michael Vazquez to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nFederal district court in the district of New Jersey. His confirmation \nis long overdue. He was nominated over 10 months ago and reported out \nof the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote over 4 months ago.\n  Mr. Vazquez is an outstanding nominee who has experience both in \nprivate practice and in the public sector. Since 2008, he has practiced \nas a named partner at the law firm of Critchley, Kinum & Vazquez in \nRoseland, NJ. He has also devoted a significant part of his career to \npublic service, having worked for both the office of the attorney \ngeneral for the State of New Jersey and as a Federal prosecutor in the \ndistrict of New Jersey. During his tenure as a Federal prosecutor, Mr. \nVazquez handled a wide array of Federal investigations and prosecutions \nwhile serving in the general crimes unit, the major narcotics unit, the \nterrorism unit, and the securities and health care fraud unit.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nMr. Vazquez ``Well Qualified'' to serve as a Federal district judge, \nits highest rating. He has the support of his home State Senators, \nSenators Menendez and Booker.\n  Mr. Vazquez's nomination reflects the enormous progress that the \nSenate and this administration have made in making the Federal \njudiciary more diverse and more representative of the citizenry it \nserves. The fact that there are more women and minorities than ever \nbefore serving on our Federal bench is important. The result of this \nprogress is that it increases public confidence in our justice system.\n  Unfortunately, Senate Republicans have stalled this progress by \nobstructing several highly qualified Hispanic nominees. For example, \nSenate Republicans delayed the confirmation of Judge Luis Felipe \nRestrepo, the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania nominated to the \nthird circuit, for more than a year. This was the case despite his \nexcellent legal and judicial career and the strong bipartisan support \nhe had from his home State Senators.\n  In addition, the junior Senator from Arkansas continues to impose a \nwholesale blockade on the nominees to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, \nincluding Armando Bonilla, a Cuban American who has devoted his entire \ncareer to public service at the U.S. Department of Justice. If \nconfirmed, Mr. Bonilla would be the first Hispanic judge to hold a seat \non that court, where he is urgently needed. The chief judge of the \nCourt of Federal Claims has written to Chairman Grassley and me to \nexpress the need to confirm the pending nominees; yet Senator Cotton is \nbeing allowed to hold up these well-qualified nominees.\n  And just last week, the junior Senator from Georgia announced that he \nwas withdrawing his support for the nomination of a Hispanic nominee to \na Federal district court in Georgia. Judge Dax Lopez has served as a \ndistinguished State court judge in DeKalb County, GA, since 2010. With \nhis experience, I was not surprised that the Georgia Senators submitted \nJudge Lopez's name to the White House for consideration to the Federal \ndistrict court. After recommending him to the White House, it is \nunfortunate that the junior Senator from Georgia is now blocking his \nnomination because of Judge Lopez's membership on the board of \ndirectors for the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials. This \nnonpartisan organization's mission ``is to increase civic engagement \nand leadership of the Latino/Hispanic community across Georgia.'' But \nsome conservatives have focused only on the fact that the organization \nsupported common sense immigration reform--something that a bipartisan \nmajority of this body supported when we passed comprehensive \nimmigration reform in 2013.\n  I have long noted that I do not vote to confirm individuals to the \nbench because I expect to agree with all of their views. My standard is \nwhether the nominee would be the kind of independent judge who would be \nfair and impartial. There is nothing in Judge Lopez's record to suggest \nthat he could not or would not be an impartial judge. Judge Lopez has \nbeen a State court judge for nearly 6 years. Those who oppose Judge \nLopez have decided that, because he was on the board of directors of an \norganization that advocates certain policies with which they disagree, \nthey refuse to even consider his record or his own merits. This new \nlitmus test for his membership in a nonpartisan organization sets a \ndangerous precedent that Senators should reject.\n  We also saw this unreasonable treatment from Senate Republicans with \nthe nomination of Judge Edward Chen to the northern district of \nCalifornia. Despite having served as a Federal magistrate judge for a \ndecade, Senate Republicans held up Judge Chen's nomination for years \nbecause Judge Chen had previously worked for the American Civil \nLiberties Union. According to one Republican Senator on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Judge Chen had the ``ACLU gene,'' and so somehow he could \nnot possibly be a fair judge--even though Judge Chen had shown that he \ncould be an independent and neutral arbiter over the 10-year period \nthat he served as a Federal magistrate judge. This new litmus test is \ncompletely unfair. I am sorry that Senate Republicans have now \nsubjected Judge Lopez to this.\n  This afternoon, I hope we do not see a repeat of what happened to \nJudge Wilhelmina Wright, who was confirmed last week to the district \ncourt in Minnesota with a large number of ``no'' votes from \nRepublicans. Judge Wright was the first African-American woman to serve \non the Minnesota Supreme Court and the first person to serve on all \nthree levels of the Minnesota State judiciary; yet many Republicans \nchose to side with the moneyed Washington interest groups who unfairly \nattacked her nomination based on a writing assignment from her third \nyear of law school. That a Washington political action committee is \nopposing a nominee should not prevent Senators from exercising their \nown fair judgment. The resource needs of our independent judiciary \nshould not be tainted by calls for a shutdown of our constitutional \nrole as Senators.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote to confirm Judge Vazquez.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to support the nomination of \nJohn Michael Vazquez, whom the President nominated for a lifetime \nappointment as a United States district judge for the district of New \nJersey.\n  I thank Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid for giving \nMr. Vazquez a vote on the Senate floor. I appreciate Chairman Grassley \nand Ranking Member Leahy and their respective staffs for all their hard \nwork on moving this well-qualified judicial nominee through the \nJudiciary Committee. I also want to thank Senator\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nMenendez, New Jersey's senior Senator, for his hard work on this \njudicial appointment.\n  The district of New Jersey currently has four judicial vacancies, all \nof which are judicial emergencies. This means that a very heavy \ncaseload exists in that judicial district which, if left unremedied, \nundermines the quality and pace of access to justice for the people of \nNew Jersey. According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, each \njudgeship in the district of New Jersey has over 650 weighted filings. \nThat is unacceptable. Senator Menendez and I are committed to breaking \nthe logjam and ensuring New Jerseyans gain more access to justice.\n  Mr. Vazquez is a well-qualified nominee. He has worked in both public \nservice and private practice and has experience in both criminal and \ncivil cases. His time in public service includes stints as a Federal \nprosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office for the district of New Jersey \nand attorney in the New Jersey State attorney general's office where he \nrose up the ranks to become the first assistant attorney general. He is \nnow a partner in private practice at a Roseland, NJ, law firm.\n  Mr. Vazquez has litigated both criminal and civil cases, which I am \nconfident will make him a fine and well-balanced jurist. As a Federal \nprosecutor, he handled a wide variety of Federal criminal cases, \nincluding major narcotics prosecutions, as well as securities and \nhealth care fraud cases. In the state attorney general's office, he \nfocused on criminal matters, including public corruption and financial \nfraud. In private practice, he specialized in criminal and civil law.\n  He has excellent credentials. He graduated summa cum laude from Seton \nHall University School of Law and earned his undergraduate degree from \nRutgers University--two prominent New Jersey educational institutions. \nHe also clerked for a well-respected judge on the New Jersey Superior \nCourt bench, appellate division.\n  Mr. Vazquez has also given back to his community. He won numerous \nawards for his dedication to his community and to law enforcement, \nincluding the Latino Legal Community Award from Seton Hall University \nSchool of Law's Latin American Law Students Association; the Excellence \nin Hispanic Leadership Award from the New Jersey Department of \nCommunity Affairs' Center for Hispanic Policy; and recognition from the \nNew Jersey County Prosecutor's Association and the New Jersey State \nPolice.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has unanimously rated Mr. Vazquez well-qualified to be a \ndistrict court judge, the highest possible rating. Last September, he \nwas favorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous \nvoice vote. I am confident this well-qualified nominee will serve \nhonorably on the Federal bench.\n  I urge my fellow Senators today to confirm Mr. Vasquez as a United \nStates district judge to the district of New Jersey. I look forward to \ncontinue working with Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy and \nSenate leadership to confirm more judicial nominees to fill vacancies \nin the district of New Jersey so that we can eliminate existing \njudicial emergencies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to express my \nenthusiastic recommendation for John Michael Vazquez's nomination and \nconfirmation to the United States District Court for the District of \nNew Jersey, which the Senate will be voting upon shortly.\n  Mr. Vazquez's credentials are impressive. He is a New Jerseyan who is \neminently qualified and highly experienced, and I am confident that he \nwill be an outstanding jurist whose judicial temperament, observance of \nprecedent, and personal integrity will be beyond reproach.\n  There is an inscription over the 10th Street entrance to the Justice \nDepartment that I often am reminded of, and it can't be quoted too \noften when we are looking to perform one of our most vital duties, \nselecting those best qualified judicial nominees. It reads: ``Justice \nin the life and conduct of the State is possible only as it first \nresides in the hearts and souls of its citizens.'' I believe that \njustice does, in fact, reside in the heart and soul of John Vazquez and \nthat he will bring that judicial heart and soul to the task, as well as \nthe benefit of a long and distinguished legal career in private and \npublic service.\n  Mr. Vazquez began his legal career at the law offices of Michael \nCritchley & Associates after completing a clerkship with the Honorable \nHerman D. Michels of the New Jersey Appellate Division. He graduated \nsumma cum laude from Seton Hall University School of Law and from \nRutgers College. His intellect is of the highest order. He would bring \na long and distinguished career to the District of New Jersey bench if \nand when he is confirmed. He is currently a partner at Critchley, Kinum \n& Vazquez, practicing commercial, securities, and civil litigation, as \nwell as white collar criminal defense.\n  Before his time in private practice, he served the people of New \nJersey in the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General as the first \nassistant attorney general. As the second highest ranking law \nenforcement official in the State, Mr. Vazquez conducted the day-to-day \noperations of the 9,500-person department and various divisions within \nthe department, including criminal justice, consumer affairs, civil \nrights, elections, and gaming enforcement divisions, to mention a few. \nHe previously served in that particular office as a special assistant \nto the attorney general. Before that he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney, \nwhere he focused on health care fraud, securities fraud, and terrorism \ninvestigations. These experiences have given him a clear appreciation \nof the separation of powers, the importance of checks and balances, and \nI believe he will bring that view to the bench.\n  The American Bar Association rated him unanimously ``well qualified'' \nfor the nomination, and I agree. He was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously. When I think about the breadth and scope of what \ncomes before a Federal district court judge, I can only think about the \nbreadth and scope of his experience. He understands both sides of the \nlegal equation--the prosecution and defense of the accused. He is a \nmember of the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey, the Essex County \nBar Association, the New Jersey State Bar Association, the Association \nof the Federal Bar of New Jersey, and the Association of Criminal \nDefense Lawyers of New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, I can say without equivocation that justice does \nindeed reside in the heart and soul of John Vazquez. He is an eminently \nqualified nominee with impressive credentials and experience who will \nfill a judicial emergency vacancy in the District of New Jersey. In \naddition to intellect, judgment, temperament, observance of the rule of \nlaw, and separation of powers, he diversifies our judiciary as a \nHispanic American, which is something I think is also very important--\nto be able to have any American walk into any court in the land and \nbelieve the possibility that someone like them may very well be sitting \nin judgment of them. When you have all the elements of what we want in \nthe Federal judiciary and we are able to achieve that element of \ndiversity as well, I think it is the highest moment.\n  I urge the Senate to unanimously support him, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the Vazquez nomination?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, in this Energy bill we are considering, \nwe are going to offer an amendment regarding the renewable fuel \nstandard--also called the RFS. The RFS requires that fuel sold in the \nUnited States contain a minimal amount of renewable fuels. You know it \nbecause when you go to the gas pump, it says: contains 10 percent \nethanol.\n  The RFS is outdated. It was created in 2005--a time when American \nenergy consumption relied heavily upon foreign imports. It was thought \nthat the renewable fuel standard will be good for the environment by \ndecreasing the carbon footprint, but in the last 10 years our energy \nlandscape has changed dramatically. We now have more domestic oil than \nalmost ever before, and the drawbacks of the RFS greatly outweigh its \nbenefits.\n  For example, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Americans \nwill be forced to pay $0.13 to $0.26 more per gallon if the RFS is not \nrepealed. For a mom and dad with two teenage sons, this would be $400 a \nyear, but it doesn't stop at the pump.\n  Over the last 10 years, the price of corn has drastically fluctuated. \nCorn costs have approximately doubled since before the RFS began. The \ncorn price increasing has increased the cost of food as much as 7 \npercent to 26 percent it is estimated per year. It also raises costs \nall the way down. For example, your chain restaurants are estimated to \nspend $3.2 billion more for the food they purchase and serve to their \ncustomers because of the RFS.\n  Perhaps paying more at the pump, paying more at the grocery store and \nmore at the restaurant will be worth it if there are environmental \nbenefits. Unfortunately, there is not only no environmental benefit, \nthere is tremendous environmental harm.\n  To begin with, an increase in corn production means that there is an \nincrease in fertilizer use across the Midwest. That fertilizer runs \ninto the rivers, goes down into the Mississippi River, hits the Gulf of \nMexico, and causes algae blooms because of the high nitrogen and \nphosphorous, and that decreases the oxygen in the water, thereby \ndevastating the fish population. If you look at maps of the dead zone \nin the Mississippi River, they have continuously increased in size \nsince the RFS was put into law.\n  But it is not just about our water quality. Let's talk about carbon \nfootprint. One of the original rationales as to why we should have \nrenewable fuels: The Union of Concerned Scientists state that certain \ntypes of ethanol have a worse carbon footprint than gasoline. So now we \nhave something that not only increases the cost of food and hurts the \nwater quality in the Gulf of Mexico and the rivers that feed it but \nalso has a higher carbon footprint than the gasoline it dilutes.\n  By the way, it is not just the Union of Concerned Scientists; the \nNational Academy of Sciences says that the renewable fuel standard has \nlittle or no environmental benefit and actually increases the \nparticulate matter and sulfur that is in the atmosphere and harms water \nquality.\n  Let's just say that with the abundance of our domestic oil and \nincreased vehicular efficiency standards, there is no need for the RFS. \nIt is time to repeal the renewable fuel standard so that our farmers, \nanglers, ranchers, and consumers can reap the benefit.\n  In addition to this, I wish to mention another amendment I am \noffering with Senator Markey. This amendment would save taxpayer \ndollars and preserve oil reservoirs in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve is located in my home State, in \nHarahan, LA. This amendment gives the Secretary of Energy the ability \nto sell Strategic Petroleum Reserve quantities of crude oil when the \nprice goes up. Right now, he has been instructed to sell the oil to \nraise $5 billion but without regard to price. We clearly don't want to \nsell it when the price of oil is at $30. We want to wait until the \nprice of oil goes back up and sell it then so we can reap multiple \nbenefits. It will allow for more supply so consumers will have lower \nprices at the pump, and it will also get more money for the oil we do \nsell, which will be good for taxpayers who bought the oil in the first \nplace.\n  America is blessed with an abundance of oil. Taxpayers invested in \nthis emergency oil stockpile. Yet some must be sold, and it should be \nsold at the highest price possible to get the best deal for the \ntaxpayers.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support both of these amendments. They \nare important to American families, critical to America's energy \nsecurity, and in the case of the RFS, it is critical to our \nenvironmental hopes.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Homeland Security and the Threat of Violent Extremism\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss for a couple of \nmoments the issue of homeland security and the threat of violent \nextremism in the United States.\n  In the last 2 months in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we have \nexperienced two very concerning incidents of violent extremism--first, \nin December, the arrest of a 19-year-old man in Harrisburg, PA, who \nallegedly used social media to propagandize and facilitate on behalf of \nthe terrorist group ISIS. At the time of his arrest, law enforcement \nofficers found ammunition and other signs that he might be preparing \nfor an attack. Thank goodness\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nlaw enforcement at the local and State level worked with the FBI and \nwould have been able to thwart that attack if it were carried out.\n  The second incident, and the one I will focus more of my attention on \ntoday, was the shooting of Philadelphia police officer Jesse Hartnett \nwhile he was on patrol on January 7 of this year. The gunman ran up to \nOfficer Hartnett's patrol car and fired 11 rounds at very close range. \nOfficer Hartnett was hit three times in his left arm before the \nattacker fled. In a truly remarkable act of bravery, Officer Hartnett \nwas able to radio for backup and pursue the attacker. The gunman was \napprehended as a result of Officer Hartnett's heroic action and the \nquick response of his fellow officers.\n  Law enforcement professionals like Officer Hartnett and his \ncolleagues are on the frontlines of protecting us and protecting our \nhomeland every day. We have to remain vigilant against potential \nattacks from terrorist groups in foreign countries, of course, who seek \nto harm Americans, but we must also confront the threat of violent \nextremism here at home from individuals who are inspired by the \nhateful, evil ideology of terrorist groups such as ISIS. These are \nindividuals who can often be categorized as lone wolves, planning and \nplotting without the direction of a terrorist group necessarily but \nmotivated by violent rhetoric they find online or by other means.\n  On January 18, I visited Officer Hartnett in the hospital to thank \nhim for his bravery and his service. He was in much better shape that \nday than he was on the night of the attack. We are so happy that he \ncontinues to recover well from those injuries. Just last week he was \nable to leave the hospital in Philadelphia and go home.\n  At the same time, I also received a briefing on the investigation \nfrom the FBI and met with Mayor Jim Kenny, the newly elected mayor of \nPhiladelphia, and Philadelphia Police Commissioner Ross to discuss this \nemerging threat in Philadelphia and certainly in other places as well.\n  What do lawmakers do, Members of this body and the other body as \nwell, the House and the Senate? We have an abiding obligation to give \nour full support to local and State authorities confronting the threat \nof violent extremism whether it is in Pennsylvania or anywhere across \nthe country.\n  According to a recent assessment from the Foreign Policy Initiative, \n71 individuals have been charged with ISIS-related activities since \nMarch of 2014. The profiles and motivations of these individuals differ \ndramatically, making it even more difficult for law enforcement \nofficials to investigate and prevent attacks. But I believe that as \nMembers of Congress--and, I also would add, the administration as \nwell--we all need to listen to the professional advice of law \nenforcement officials, homeland security experts, and others rather \nthan simply engaging in categorical condemnation or, unfortunately, \noversight by sound bite.\n  I have invited Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to \nPhiladelphia to join me in a roundtable with community leaders and law \nenforcement officials in Pennsylvania so I can be briefed on and \nupdated about homeland security issues in Philadelphia and throughout \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania.\n  A recent Politico survey of leading mayors around the country \nevaluated the city executives' perspective on the challenges they \nconfront in addressing terrorism and violent extremism in their \ncommunities. The mayors have told us that they identified lack of \noverall funding as the biggest challenge facing their cities in the \ncontext of counterterrorism. And I have to say that for at least a \ndecade, local law enforcement and the FBI have been badly underfunded. \nLet's ensure that these communities have what they need.\n  I will continue to urge the Departments of Homeland Security and \nJustice to communicate better with local and State authorities. I will \nalso urge the disbursement of Federal grant funding to support \nactivities to counter violent extremism and to continue to train law \nenforcement in ways to help prevent and respond to complex terrorist \nattacks.\n  I am supporting and I hope others will support Senator Carper's \nCommunity Partnerships Act of 2015, which is a piece of commonsense \nlegislation that would bolster the Federal Government's support to \nlocal and State authorities. We owe it to our first responders, such as \nOfficer Jesse Hartnett from Philadelphia, and we owe it to the \ncommunities they protect to give them the support and resources they \nneed to help us confront and defeat violent extremism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about the \nEnergy bill that is before the Chamber right now. I thank Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Cantwell for bringing us to this point.\n  This is called the Energy Policy and Modernization Act. It is my \nunderstanding that this is the first comprehensive Energy bill to come \nto the floor of the Senate in 7 or 8 years. It is something we ought to \nbe focused on because it helps to create a better economy, and it helps \nto ensure that we do have a protected grid and that we can indeed \nimprove our infrastructure around the country in terms of energy and \nimprove the performance of Federal agencies.\n  The bill allows more exports of LNG--liquefied natural gas--which is \nimportant to our economy. By focusing on energy and taking commonsense \nsteps to help in terms of making our economy more efficient, we will \nhelp to create more independence in this country and make America less \ndependent on foreign sources of energy as well. I commend them for \nthat, and I am happy to support the broader legislation.\n  Tonight I would like to talk about title I of the bill. As those of \nyou who have looked at the bill know, title I is about energy \nefficiency. I again thank Senators Murkowski and Cantwell for including \nthe Portman-Shaheen Energy and Savings and Industrial Competitiveness \nAct in as title I of the legislation. This is energy efficiency \nlegislation that has been to the floor a couple of times. We were not \nable to get it passed because of a disagreement over amendments, but it \nhas come out of the committee with strong votes. In fact, the most \nrecent vote was a few months ago when we reported the energy efficiency \nlegislation out of our energy committee in the Senate by a vote of 20 \nto 2. That doesn't happen very often around this place. It is \nbipartisan because it makes sense.\n  Senator Shaheen and I have worked with Members on both sides of the \naisle and groups all around the country over the past 4 or 5 years to \nput this legislation together. It is part of what I think is the right \nphilosophy which I see embodied in this overall legislation, which is \nthat we ought to be producing more energy in this country, but we also \nought to be using it more efficiently. Producing more and using less is \na good combination. It creates jobs, creates the opportunity for us to \nbe more competitive in global markets, it helps us to be less dependent \non foreign oil, and it helps us to improve the environment.\n  This legislation we are looking at in title I is going to get across \nthe finish line this year, I believe, because we do have strong support \nfrom not just Republicans and Democrats here in this Chamber but from \npeople around the country who have helped us to put this together.\n  Those on this side of the aisle often talk about the need for an \n``all of the above'' energy strategy. I like to talk about that. I \nthink it is the right approach. I think we should be focusing on all of \nour energy resources. When you talk about ``all of the above,'' though, \none of the best sources of energy is the energy you don't use. It is \nthe energy that is really economically viable, and that is energy \nefficiency. Sometimes we are pretty good at the produced part of the \nequation on my side of the aisle, but we need to focus more on the \nefficiency part.\n  This legislation also helps the environment, as I said. It is \nactually the equivalent of taking about 20 million cars off the road \nwithin 15 years. Think about that. Through energy efficiency, it is the \nequivalent of taking about 20 million cars off the road within 15 \nyears.\n  By the way, it doesn't do it by overregulating, it doesn't do it by \nkilling jobs, and it doesn't do it by the heavy hand of government. It \ndoes it without any mandates. It does it by\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\nincentivizing less energy use, which will help to reduce emissions in a \nway that doesn't kill jobs. In fact, our legislation will create more \njobs. We have a study of our legislation now showing that it will \ncreate 136,000 new jobs while saving consumers about $13.7 billion a \nyear in reduced energy costs within 15 years.\n  The bill is supported by 260 associations, businesses, advocacy \ngroups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the Sierra \nClub, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It \nis supported by groups who don't normally get together to support \nlegislation, but they are all together on this because they understand \nthe importance of it. That is one of the reasons this passed the \ncommittee with big bipartisan numbers, and it is also why it actually \nworks--because we got input from everybody. It makes good economic \nsense, good energy sense, and good environmental sense.\n  In visiting with jobseekers around Ohio and going to businesses \ntalking about this legislation, they are excited about it because it \ngives them the opportunity to have access to new energy efficiency \ntechnology that makes them more competitive. So it allows Ohio workers \nto be able to compete better with workers in places like Japan or \nEurope where there is more of a focus on energy efficiency, and it \nreduces the costs of production. This is why the manufacturing \ncommunity in my home State of Ohio is really excited about it. They \nknow this is going to help them to be competitive.\n  It also helps with regard to our Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment ought to practice what it preaches. The Federal Government \nis the largest user of energy in the country--probably the largest user \nof energy in the world--and, by the way, one of the more inefficient \nusers of energy. So our legislation specifically focuses on the Federal \nGovernment and talks about how we need to use less energy at our call \ncenters and how we need to make sure Federal buildings are more energy \nefficient. Just by doing that alone, we are going to save taxpayers \nbillions of dollars. That makes sense for taxpayers, and it also makes \nsense for reducing emissions, and it makes sense to have our Federal \nGovernment be more efficient.\n  The proposals contained in this bill are really commonsense reforms. \nThere are no mandates on the private sector. They come as a result of \ndirect conversations we have had with people at the local level and \nbusinesses to understand how we can actually help, without mandating, \nto create incentives.\n  Our legislation does focus on manufacturing, and it does focus on the \ngovernment and the General Services Administration and buildings. It \nalso focuses on buildings to ensure that buildings are more efficient, \nboth residential and commercial buildings, which is where we are going \nto see a lot of our savings. Again, this is not only going to create \nmore jobs but save consumers a lot of money.\n  It has been nearly 10 years since Congress passed legislation that \nfocused on energy efficiency. A lot has changed and a lot needs to be \nupdated. This legislation allows us to do that--to move forward in a \nsmart way and in a bipartisan way to ensure that, yes, we are producing \nmore energy, becoming less dependent on foreign sources and more \nindependent here in this country, helping our economy but also doing so \nin a way that helps create a better environment for all of us.\n  This is a true, ``all of the above'' energy strategy.\n  Again, I applaud my colleagues for bringing forward the Energy Policy \nModernization Act, and I thank them for including the Shaheen-Portman \nlegislation. I wish to thank my partner, Jeanne Shaheen from New \nHampshire, for her hard work over the years on this legislation. It is \ntime for us to get it done. It is time to provide this incentive and \ngive this economy a shot in the arm to help ensure that we can take \nadvantage of the energy resources in this country, use them more \nefficiently, and, by doing so, create more economic opportunity for \neveryone.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are at the end of the day after \nhaving turned to the Energy Policy Modernization Act. We have had some \nMembers come to the floor to speak to the significance and the \nimportance of finally, after almost 8 years now, updating and \nmodernizing our energy infrastructure, our energy supply, our energy \nefficiency and accountability within the energy space.\n  I know that we are going to be continuing to work to address not only \nmuch of what is contained within the bill but also amendments from \ncolleagues. We have solicited and have received a fair number of \namendments today. The ranking member and I are processing these and \nlooking, again, not only to set up a unanimous consent agreement here \nthis evening, but I will take this opportunity to remind colleagues \nthat if you have amendments that you wish to be brought up, please file \nthem, and please come to the floor to speak to them. We will hopefully \nhave a full opportunity tomorrow to do just that, but we do intend to \nwork aggressively to get through this very important, very bipartisan \nmeasure.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 2968, 2963, 3017, 2982, 3021, and 2965 En Bloc to \n                           Amendment No. 2953\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a beloved \nfather, a loving husband, and a fallen hero: Officer Douglas Barney of \nthe Unified Police Department. Officer Barney was killed in the line of \nduty last week when attempting to question a man at the scene of an \naccident. In the wake of Doug's passing, the Barney family has \nexperienced an outpouring of love and support from law enforcement \nofficials not only in Utah, but across the Nation. As a testament to \nDoug's generosity and the many lives he touched, more than 10,000 \npeople attended his funeral services on Monday. Today I join the many \nwho mourn by honoring Officer Douglas Barney--a man of character, \ncommitment, kindness, and courage.\n  Doug's dedication to law enforcement was matched by his zeal for \nlife. As a teenager, he explored the outdoors, rode dirt bikes on the \nhills behind his home, and raced cars on Utah's old Bonneville Raceway. \nAs a police officer, he loved the thrill of a high-speed chase and had \na knack for defusing tense situations with a well-timed joke. An \nindomitable sense of humor endeared him not only to those he loved, but \neven to those he arrested.\n  On one particular occasion, he was tasked to handle a DUI situation \ninvolving a female arrestee whose behavior was growing increasingly \nerratic. Instead of reacting with force, Doug responded with humor by \ncontinuously joking with the arrestee. His off-the-cuff comedy replaced \nthe woman's threats with smiles and her cries with laughter. \nEventually, she calmed down enough to cooperate. As one of Doug's \ncolleagues recalls, the two left ``the best of friends.'' Only Doug \ncould have managed such a feat.\n  Doug's humor helped him cope with the rigors of a stressful career in \nlaw enforcement. It also helped him overcome serious illness. No \nstranger to adversity, Doug battled back from bladder cancer just a \nyear before his death. Cancer could weaken his body, but it could do \nnothing to dampen his spirits. Throughout the ordeal, Doug maintained a \ncheerful disposition and refined his trademark sense of humor.\n  In addition to laughter, Doug drew strength from family. He \nbefriended his wife, Erika, when they were growing up together in \nCalifornia. While Erika was studying at Brigham Young University, their \nrelationship took a romantic turn, and Doug asked her to marry him. \nErika was caught off guard by the proposal and was initially reluctant, \nbut Doug persisted. Time and again, he asked Erika to be his wife. \nAfter several months, she finally accepted, and the two were married in \n1996. Together, they had three beautiful children: Matilda, Meredith, \nand Jacob.\n  Shortly after their marriage, Doug told Erika that he dreamed of \nbecoming a police officer. With her support, he began an 18-year career \nin law enforcement. Doug's fellow police officers will always remember \nhim for his work ethic, gregariousness, and larger-than-life \npersonality. Over many years of consistent, hard work, Doug won not \nonly the love and friendship of his colleagues, but also their respect \nand admiration.\n  Like thousands across our Nation, I am deeply saddened by the passing \nof Officer Barney. I am immensely grateful for Doug's example and for \nthe service of countless police officers like him. Each day, these \nselfless men and women risk their own well-being to ensure the safety \nof others. They are the most courageous of public servants, and I \nbelieve Doug was among the best of them. He was a man who lived and \nloved deeply. He made people laugh, he made them smile, and he helped \nthem hope.\n  I pray that Doug's memory might continue to inspire and bless those \nhe loved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S247-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S247-S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WILDFIRE FUNDING AND FOREST MANAGEMENT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Enzi of \nWyoming, and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Roberts \nof Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Last session, I came to the floor to speak about the \nsignificant wildfire provisions we included in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, why Congress could not accept a flawed proposal \nsupported by this administration and a handful of Senators, and to \noutline a path forward on this important issue in 2016.\n  As we begin consideration of the energy bill, I have come to the \nfloor to add further definition to that path forward. As many of you \nknow, wildfire budgeting and forest management overlap jurisdictionally \nwith several other Committees so I want to thank my colleagues, \nSenators Enzi and Roberts, for joining me here.\n  In my view, the time has come to find real solutions to the \nchallenges we face in each of these areas. This crisis has gone on for \nlong enough. It has grown worse and worse. Our lands are burning. \nCommunities are being devastated. And it is time for Congress to act.\n  I want to start first with wildfire budgeting. For some time now, \nMembers of this Chamber have been talking past each other. Before we \ncan come up with a solution, we have to at least agree on the problem \nwe are trying to solve.\n  We have all been saying that we want to solve the problem of ``fire \nborrowing''--the unsustainable practice of borrowing from non-fire \ngovernment programs so that fire response activities can continue when \nwildfire suppression accounts are depleted.\n  One way to fix the problem of ``fire borrowing'' is to continue to \nfully fund the predicable costs of wildfire suppression, the 10-year \nrolling average, while allowing access to additional funds through a \nlimited cap adjustment when the agencies run out of suppression funds, \nfor the emergency and unpredictable costs of wildfire suppression.\n  Another issue relating to wildfire budgeting is the percentage of the \nForest Service's discretionary budget\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nspent on wildfire. The Forest Service has said that it now spends \nnearly half of its discretionary budget on wildfire. Some of our \ncolleagues and this administration have conflated the fire borrowing \nproblem with this budgeting issue. They have sought to shift \nanticipated wildfire suppression costs off-budget to limit how much of \nthe Forest Service's discretionary budget is spent on fire with the \ngoal of ``freeing up'' dollars for other programs under the \ndiscretionary cap.\n  Cap adjustments and budgeting generally are within your committee's \njurisdiction. I say to Senator Enzi. Have I properly characterized the \nwildfire budgeting issues we are wrestling with?\n  Mr. ENZI. I agree with Senator Murkowski that fire borrowing has been \nmischaracterized and conflated with the Forest Service's overall \nconcern about its discretionary budget. Although I recognize the fact \nthat the Forest Service has serious management challenges, consensus \ndoesn't exist in the Senate to adjust the caps so the Forest Service \ncan spend more money on other programs within its discretionary budget.\n  That said, Congress must find a fiscally responsible solution to \nwildfire funding and fire borrowing. I welcome the opportunity to \nreview the fire borrowing issue in my committee and how the \nunpredictable costs of wildfire suppression have forced Congress to \nappropriate emergency dollars in past years. We can find a solution to \nbudgeting for wildfires. We cannot, however, only work on the budget \nissues without also making changes to the way we manage our forests. It \nis crucial to ensure taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and \neffectively.\n  Just as there are many State, local, and Federal partners in the \nfield when it comes to suppressing wildfires during the fire season, it \nis important that all the necessary committees in the Senate work \ntogether on this issue. I look forward to addressing these issues with \nSenator Murkowski and Senator Roberts, with my committee members, and \nwith other Western Senators interested in the outcome.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you to my colleagues, Senator Enzi and Senator \nMurkowski, for their work on these important issues related to wildfire \nand forest management. I would like to echo their concerns and share \nwith the rest of my colleagues that I agree with them entirely that \nthis is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Coming off the end \nof a catastrophic wildfire season with a record amount of acres burned, \nit is essential that the Senate turn its attention to finding a \nwildfire solution in 2016--and through regular order.\n  As chairman of the Agriculture Committee, it is my first and foremost \npriority that the committee serve as the platform for America's \nfarmers, ranchers, small businesses, rural communities--and forest land \nowners and forestry stakeholders, a constituency sometimes forgotten. \nAs chairman of the Agriculture Committee, we intend to serve and \nrepresent all of agriculture, of which forestry plays an important \nrole.\n  Last November, the Agriculture Committee held a hearing on the \neffects of wildfire and heard testimony from stakeholders on the \nbudgetary impacts and threats to natural resources on Federal, State, \nand private forest lands. The message from that hearing was unanimous \nand clear: it is time for Congress to act and advocate for solutions \nthat not only address funding fixes, but more importantly advocate for \nsolutions that improve the management of our national forests.\n  H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, which passed \nthe House last summer, has been referred to the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. This legislation, while not perfect, includes provisions \nthat attempt to address both the funding mechanism and incorporate \nmeaningful forest management tools which are the paramount issues in \nthe overall wildfire debate. I recognize the challenges that remain \nahead with crafting such a legislative proposal that satisfies all \ninterested parties involved in this larger debate. With that being \nsaid, I stand ready to work with my colleagues to find areas where \ncommon ground and consensus can be achieved to address the overall \nwildfire issues facing us today.\n  I look forward to working together with Senator Murkowski, Senator \nEnzi, and others to provide the necessary tools to expedite the much \nneeded work on not just Western forests, but also nationwide, \nencompassing Federal, State, and private forest lands.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank Senator Roberts. I look forward to working \nwith him as well. And he is right. The wildfire problem is not just a \nbudgeting problem--it is also a management problem. Reforming the way \nwe manage our forests is absolutely crucial. Healthy, resilient forests \nare fire-resistant forests; yet despite knowing the value of fuel \nreduction treatments in mitigating wildfire risks, increasing \nfirefighter safety, and protecting and restoring the health of our \nforests, active management is still often met with a series of \ndiscouraging and near insurmountable obstacles.\n  High upfront costs, long planning horizons, and regulatory \nrequirements--including what seem like unending environmental reviews--\nare impeding our ability to implement treatments at the pace and scale \nthese wildfires are occurring. We must also work with our State \nagencies, local communities, and the public to increase community \npreparedness and install fuel breaks to break up fuel connectivity to \nkeep fires small.\n  As you can see here, the chairmen of the committees with jurisdiction \nover the wildfire budgeting and forest management issues are ready to \nroll up our sleeves in 2016. We are going to work through regular \norder, in a transparent and collaborative manner, to come up with a \nlegislative solution.\n  We look forward to the input of our colleagues, who also care deeply \nabout these issues. My plan is to dedicate whatever time we have in \nFebruary after this bill clears the floor--and the entire month of \nMarch--to producing this legislative product. I appreciate Members' \nwillingness to work with us and believe we are on a good track to find \nreal solutions to our wildfire challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S248-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S248-S249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IMPROVING THE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO CHALLENGES IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN \n                                AMERICA\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Improving the Federal Response to Challenges in Mental Health Care in \n                                America\n\n       Before we begin today's hearing, I want to briefly mention \n     for the information of committee members one of the next \n     items on the committee's agenda, and that's biomedical \n     innovation. I was glad to announce yesterday our committee's \n     plans to hold its first markup on Feb. 9 to consider the \n     first set of bipartisan bills aimed at spurring biomedical \n     innovation for American patients. Senators and staff on our \n     committee have been working throughout 2015 to produce a \n     number of bipartisan pieces of legislation that are ready for \n     the full committee to consider.\n       The House has completed its work with its 21st Century \n     Cures Act. The president announced his support for a \n     precision medicine initiative and a cancer ``moonshot.'' It \n     is urgent that the Senate finish its work and turn into law \n     these ideas that will help virtually every American.\n       The committee has also been working for months on \n     legislation to help achieve interoperability of electronic \n     health records for doctors, hospitals and their patients--and \n     the committee will be releasing a bipartisan staff draft of \n     that legislation later today for public comment.\n       This February markup will be the first of three committee \n     meetings that we have planned to debate and amend bills as \n     the committee moves forward on the bipartisan goal of \n     modernizing the Food and Drug Administration and the National \n     Institutes of Health to get safe, cutting-edge drugs and \n     devices to patients more quickly.\n       Last week, in his State of the Union address, the president \n     reiterated his support for a Precision Medicine Initiative \n     and announced the administration's cancer ``moonshot'' \n     initiative--and I look forward to working with the president \n     and Vice President Biden.\n       In addition, this year the committee intends to be busy on \n     oversight of the Every Student Succeeds Act. A law that's not \n     implemented appropriately is not worth the paper it's printed \n     on, and we will plan a series of hearings this year to make \n     sure that it's implemented the way Congress wrote it and the \n     president signed it.\n       And, of course, we've done a great deal of work on \n     reauthorizing the Higher Education\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\n     Act, which expired at the end of last year. We have a number \n     of bipartisan proposals that will make it easier and simpler \n     for students to attend college and for administrators to \n     operate our 6,000 colleges and universities.\n       But, another priority of the committee is legislation \n     dealing with the mental health crisis in America, which we \n     are discussing today.\n       The committee has done a great deal of work on this \n     subject. On September 30, 2015, this committee passed S. \n     1893, Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act of 2015, \n     introduced by Senator Murray and myself. This bill, \n     cosponsored by many members of the committee, reauthorizes \n     and improves programs administered by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services related to awareness, prevention, \n     and early identification of mental health conditions. The \n     Senate passed this important piece of legislation on December \n     18, 2015. Senators Cassidy and Murphy have introduced \n     legislation, and Sen. Murray and I have been working with \n     them. We hope to move promptly to bring recommendations \n     before the full committee.\n       Not everything the Senate may want to do is within the \n     jurisdiction of this committee. We're working with Sen. \n     Blunt, who is the chairman of the Senate's health \n     appropriations subcommittee, on ideas that he's proposed--as \n     well as with Sen. Cornyn on issues that the Judiciary \n     Committee is considering and the Senate Finance Committee, \n     which will also be involved.\n       Here is why there is such interest in the United States \n     Senate in the mental health crisis in America today: A 2014 \n     national survey from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration found that about one in five adults \n     had a mental health condition in the past year, and 9.8 \n     million adults had serious mental illness, such as \n     schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression that \n     interferes with a major life activity.\n       However, nearly 60 percent of adults with mental illness \n     did not receive mental health services in 2014. Only about \n     half of adolescents with a mental health condition received \n     treatment for their mental health condition.\n       Mental health conditions that remain untreated can lead to \n     dropping out of school, substance abuse, incarceration, \n     unemployment, homelessness, and suicide. Suicide is the 10th \n     leading cause of death in the United States, and 90 percent \n     of those who die by suicide have an underlying mental \n     illness.\n       I hear from many Tennesseans about the challenges faced by \n     individuals and families living with mental illness. From \n     2010 to 2012, nearly 21 percent of adults in Tennessee \n     reported having a mental illness--that's more than a million \n     people--according to the Tennessee Department of Mental \n     Health and Substance Abuse Services. About 4 percent had a \n     serious mental illness--that's nearly a quarter of a million \n     Tennesseans.\n       According to a 2015 report from the Tennessee Suicide \n     Prevention Network, the most recent data available shows \n     Tennessee's rate of suicide reached its highest level in 5 \n     years in 2013. Also in 2013, the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention reported that suicide was the second leading \n     cause of death for Tennesseans between the ages of 15 and 34. \n     Scott Ridgway, head of the Tennessee Suicide Prevention \n     Network, last year stated that suicide ``remains a major \n     public health threat in the state of Tennessee.''\n       At our October hearing on mental health, this committee \n     heard from administration witnesses about what the federal \n     government is already doing to address mental illness. Today, \n     I look forward to hearing from the doctors, nurses, advocates \n     and administrators who work every day with Americans who \n     struggle with a mental health condition about how the federal \n     government can help patients, health care providers, \n     communities, and states to better address mental health \n     issues.\n       One way is to ensure that the latest and most innovative \n     research findings get translated into practice and can change \n     the lives of individuals and families across the United \n     States. For example, at our earlier hearing, the National \n     Institute of Mental Health's then-director, Dr. Tom Insel, \n     discussed the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia \n     Episode, or RAISE study. The study found that identifying and \n     treating psychosis early with a comprehensive, personalized \n     treatment plan can significantly improve an individual's \n     quality of life. Many states have begun implementing \n     treatment programs based on this model--and it was called a \n     ``game changer'' by the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n       I am interested to hear from our witnesses how the federal \n     government can support state efforts to implement innovative \n     and evidence-based treatment programs--as well as their \n     thoughts to help ensure that Washington is not getting in the \n     way.\n       Strengthening our mental health care system will require \n     modernizing the leading agency for mental health. It will \n     also require involvement from patients, families, \n     communities, health care providers, health departments, law \n     enforcement, state partners, and others.\n       I look forward to hearing from our witnesses here today \n     about the challenges we face and the solutions they believe \n     are needed to address them head on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S249-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    200TH ANNIVERSARY OF WELD, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of the Town of Weld, ME. Known today as a gateway to the \nrugged and beautiful Western Maine Mountains, Weld was built with a \nspirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community \ntoday.\n  Weld's incorporation on February 8, 1816, was but one milestone on a \nlong journey of progress. For thousands of years, Maine's Western \nMountains were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. The reverence \nthe Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is \nupheld by the people of Weld today.\n  The early settlers at what was called Webb's Pond Plantation were \ndrawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they \nturned into productive farms and busy mills. The wealth produced by the \nland and by hard work and determination was invested in schools and \nchurches to create a true community.\n  Weld is a town of patriots. Its namesake, Benjamin Weld, was a hero \nof the American Revolution. Ninety-three townsmen answered freedom's \ncall during the Civil War; more than 20 gave their lives preserving our \ngreat Nation. The veterans memorials at the town library stand in \nsilent tribute to those who have defended America throughout our \nhistory.\n  Weld also is a town of involved citizens. The active historical \nsociety, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence of a \nstrong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone \ninto this yearlong bicentennial celebration are evidence that Weld's \nspirit grows only stronger.\n  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years; it is about human accomplishment and an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who for more than two centuries have worked \ntogether and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before, \nWeld has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it \nhas a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S249-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

SPIEGELMAN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Richard D. \nSpiegelman. In a world of shifting alliances and temporary commitments, \nyou occasionally come to know someone who epitomizes constancy, loyalty \nand devotion to the public good. And if you are very lucky, you get to \nwork with him or her. I have had the good fortune of working with such \na person, my former legislative director and counsel, Dick Spiegelman. \nFor 8 years, Dick brought to my Senate office a piercing intellect, an \nintense work ethic, an unfailing good nature, and a vast collection of \ncolorful bowties.\n  I first came to know Dick when he worked for my father, Governor \nCasey, as Pennsylvania's general counsel, the highest ranking attorney \nin a Governor's administration. He had sterling academic credentials: \nan undergraduate degree from Williams College, as well as a master's \ndegree and a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. More \nimportantly, he brought a wealth of experience in both the private and \npublic sectors to the job. Following 8 years of service in Governor \nCasey's administration, Dick returned to private practice as a partner \nin the Dilworth Paxson law firm, representing a blue-chip clientele of \nmajor telecommunications companies. After I was elected Pennsylvania \nauditor general in 1996, my transition leaders broached the idea of \nluring Dick back\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\ninto State government. The advice I got from everyone I asked was, \n``Get Spiegelman; he knows everything.'' Dick did join my team and \nserved as my chief of staff and chief counsel for 8 years. Then, when I \nwas elected State Treasurer, he served as my chief of staff.\n  Dick came to the U.S. Senate with me in 2007 as my legislative \ndirector and counsel. His intellect and encyclopedic knowledge soon led \nthe younger members of my staff to begin referring to him as \n``Spiegeltron.'' During his 8 years as LD, Dick played a significant \nrole in the big issues of our day, including the Affordable Care Act, \nTARP, Wall Street reform, and the American Recovery Act, as well as my \nlegislative initiatives like the ABLE Act and pregnant women's support \nprograms.\n  People from other Senate offices, the executive branch, and the \nlobbying world always remarked that Dick was unfailingly courteous, but \nalways knew the substance of the matter at hand. No one could put one \nover on him. He supervised and mentored dozens of legislative staff \nmembers who worked under him and later moved on to key positions in \ngovernment or the private sector. He was also known in the Senate for \nhis sartorial splendor; few others could pull off a seersucker suit and \na fedora.\n  A year ago, Dick decided to take a well-deserved retirement. Although \nno one believed that he would stay retired, he has confounded all of us \nby doing so--at least up to now. Dick's garden has expanded; he and his \nwife, Kathy, have dialed up their ballroom dancing skills to ``Dancing \nwith the Stars'' levels; he sees his children, Alex and Margaret, more \noften; and he continues to offer wise counsel to those who seek it.\n  Dick Spiegelman represents the best in our American tradition of \npublic service. The work that he did over the course of a 40-year \ncareer will live on, often permanently, in the form of well-crafted \nlegislation; more honest and more efficient government; and the many, \nmany young men and women who worked with him and who will follow his \nexample throughout their own careers.\n  I thank Dick Spiegelman for all he has done for me, for the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, and for the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S250-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT COLONEL KENNETH R. JOHNSON\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \nlife and honor the service of Vietnam veteran Lt. Col. Kenneth R. \nJohnson. Lieutenant Colonel Johnson passed away on August 29, 2015, and \nwas laid to rest January 14, 2016, at Arlington National Cemetery. Born \nand raised in Minneapolis, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson enjoyed playing \nmusic with his garage band, the Commodores, and studying airplanes. \nUpon graduating from Roosevelt High School in 1955, Johnson enlisted in \nthe Minnesota Air National Guard, where he served for 2 years before \nentering the U.S. Air Force Academy to become an officer.\n  After he received his commission as a second lieutenant, Johnson went \non to earn his wings and begin his career flying the F-100 Super Sabre, \none of the planes that he would fly during the Vietnam war. It was in \nthis plane that Johnson earned the Silver Star, defending the Tong Le \nChan Special Forces camp, heroically making nine passes at low altitude \nagainst intense hostile fire in support of our troops. Later in the \nwar, after being forced to eject over North Vietnam, Johnson would \nspend nearly 15 months as a POW in Hanoi. Despite this trying time, \nJohnson's resolve and the love he had for his country remained intact, \nand he continued to serve for many years after his release in 1973.\n  Our country will always need brave men like Lt.

CARTER G. WOODSON\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. Carter \nG. Woodson, a distinguished African-American civil rights activist, \nauthor, editor, publisher, and historian who left a remarkable legacy \nacross the Nation and in my home State of West Virginia.\n  Dr. Woodson was born in New Canton, Buckingham County, VA, in 1875 to \nformer slaves Anne Eliza and James Henry Woodson. Taking care of the \nfamily farm often took priority over his education; nevertheless, his \nthirst for knowledge drove him forward during the course of his life. \nHe was a very bright student when he was able to attend school. Despite \nbeing taught theories of African-American inferiority of that time \nperiod, his well-grounded beliefs, credited to his father, kept his \nspirits high and only added fuel to the influence he would one day \nshare with the world.\n  James and Anne Eliza first moved into the region on the Ohio River \nthat became Huntington, WV, in 1870. There, James Woodson worked with \nmany other former slaves to complete the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad. \nDr. Woodson and his older brother Robert Henry Woodson then delayed \ntheir move and took jobs working in the West Virginia coalfields of \nFayette County. Here, Dr. Woodson, who had not yet attended high \nschool, often read to his fellow coal miners who were illiterate, as he \nhad been doing for his illiterate father. The collection of books and \nnewspapers he accumulated for this task broadened his horizons about \nthe world.\n  Ambitious for more education, the largely self-taught Dr. Woodson \nenrolled in 1895 at Douglas High School and received a diploma in less \nthan 2 years. He began his teaching career in 1897 in Fayette County \nand would later return to Huntington to become the principal of Douglas \nHigh School. In the years to come, he continued to travel across the \nUnited States and throughout Europe and Asia. He received degrees in \nhistory from the University of Chicago and Harvard University. He \nbecame the second African American to earn a Ph.D. at Harvard.\n  Countless individuals inspired this great man. Whether citing a \nspeech from Booker T. Washington or a friendship with a fellow coal \nminer, it is clear that Dr. Woodson saw education as the great \nequalizer. He could see beyond what he considered ``miseducation'' as a \nway to continually improve both the education of others and of \nhimself--and ultimately generations of students of all races. He had \nfierce opinions and was unafraid to challenge what was then considered \nas ``known'' information.\n  Dr. Woodson continued to travel in later years, lecturing to various \nAfrican-American organizations and institutions. In 1921, he created \nthe Associated Publishers, which was dedicated to issuing books by \nAfrican-American authors. In 1926, he orchestrated Negro History Week, \nheld in connection with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick \nDouglass and later extended to African-American History Month. \nLibraries and schools have been named in honor of this brilliant man--a \ntestament to his commitment of embracing our knowledge of the history \nthat shaped this great Nation. Particularly now, as we celebrate \nAfrican-American History Month, it is fitting that we should honor such \na man as Dr. Woodson. He has inspired countless leaders to fearlessly \nchallenge what they believe is unjust and to inspire others to do the \nsame. His legacy is one of constantly striving to better oneself and \ntruly sets the standard for all leaders who have followed and will \ncontinue to follow in his footsteps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S250-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S250-S251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO ANN MARION FURUKAWA DONDERO\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, just about every successful person \ncan point to a teacher or other adult who inspired and encouraged them \nas a child, a person who spurred curiosity and love of learning. Today \nI wish to recognize the hard work and dedication of one of my \nconstituents who played that role for countless Oregonians Ann Marion \nFurukawa Dondero from Forest Grove.\n  Ann was raised in Sunnyside, WA, and graduated from Whitman College \nin 1966 with a psychology degree and a\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nteacher's certificate. She taught first grade for 3 years in St. Paul, \nMN, while her husband, Russ, completed graduate school and later taught \nsecond and fourth grade in Boiling Springs, PA, when Russ started his \npolitical science teaching career.\n  When Ann and Russ moved their young family to Forest Grove, Ann \ncontinued her education and enrolled in night classes at Pacific \nUniversity where Russ had started teaching. In addition to raising \ntheir two sons, Tony and Jason, Ann also began volunteering in Forest \nGrove's library across the street from her classes.\n  Eventually, Ann's enthusiasm to share her love of reading turned into \na career spanning five decades. The library became Ann's classroom \nwhere she worked with parents and caregivers to help children become \nactive readers.\n  In 1975, Ann and her former colleague Barbara Dunnette organized BEAR \nmonth--Be Enthusiastic About Reading--at the Forest Grove Library, and \nthe tradition has continued ever since. January 2016 will be the 37th \nannual BEAR month at Forest Grove.\n  Ann's dedication and love of learning is an inspiration to our State \nand our Nation, and I have no doubt there are kids today who are better \noff because of Ann's selfless devotion. I thank Ann for her many years \nof hard work and for the great things she has done to promote reading \nand literacy in the Forest Grove community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S251-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ANNE WOIWODE\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Anne \nWoiwode of Okemos, MI, as she ends 35 years of service with the Sierra \nClub's Michigan chapter. Through her leadership, the organization's \nwork has been critical in preserving numerous wilderness areas, \ntracking and curtailing pollution, and leading the fight for clean \nenergy in the beautiful State of Michigan. I am honored to acknowledge \nMs. Woiwode's career-long commitment to safeguarding the flourishing \nhabitats and environmental wonders Michigan has to offer.\n  Ms. Woiwode began her involvement with the Sierra Club as a young \nmother after moving to Michigan with her husband, Tom, in 1980. Her \nimpact was felt immediately, and the environmental community grew \nquickly. In 1983, Anne became the chapter chair, and in 1985 she became \nits first executive director. Knowing the power of collaboration in \nchanging policy, she helped form the Michigan Environmental Council, \nMEC, in 1980, serving in many leadership roles over the years. Thanks \nto her direction, the MEC is a fully independent organization with over \n70 member groups, and it continues to provide policy expertise to the \nenvironmental community.\n  Breathtaking wildernesses like the Nordhouse Dunes and Sturgeon River \nGorge exist due in part to Ms. Woiwode's dedication. She was \ninstrumental in the establishment of 90,000 acres of protected \nwilderness under the Michigan Wilderness Heritage Act of 1987. Today \ncountless species of plants and animals flourish in these protected \necosystems.\n  In addition to working to preserve Michigan's diverse ecosystems, Ms. \nWoiwode also dedicated over a decade of work to reducing pollution from \nconcentrated animal feeding operations, CAFOs, or animal factories. Ms. \nWoiwode came to listen when rural residents and small family farms \nreached out for help, even though they were too intimidated by their \nCAFO neighbors to provide names. Countless stories and evidence of \nanimal waste carried into Michigan's waterways, toxic fumes from \nmillions of gallons of raw sewage spread on massive farm fields, and \nsickness were responded to in attempts to reduce CAFO pollution. While \nit's still a problem in Michigan, thanks to Ms. Woiwode, the Sierra \nClub's Michigan chapter is recognized as the national expert in \ntracking CAFO pollution.\n  While her commitment to protecting Michigan's ecosystems and tracking \npollution are worth acknowledging alone, Ms. Woiwode's leadership in \nturning Michigan toward a clean energy future is perhaps the most \nimportant step in preserving Michigan's environment. Through the Clean \nEnergy NOW Coalition, she organized environmental and citizens groups \nto protest the construction of eight proposed coal power plants in \nMichigan without additional review by the Governor. The coalition's \nemphasis on citizen pressure and legal avenues led to a Governor's \nexecutive directive requiring further review of the proposed plants and \neventually a complete stop in construction.\n  I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Ms. \nAnne Woiwode's service to the Sierra Club's Michigan Chapter. While her \npassion and leadership will be dearly missed, I know she has inspired \nfuture generations to continue fighting for the natural wonders and \nbeautiful, vibrant ecosystems of Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S251-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S251-S252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High \nSchool students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the \nUnion'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were \nselected from nearly 800 entries.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n       FARYAL AFSAR, MOUNT MANSFIELD UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       ''Whoever kills an innocent person it is as if he has \n     killed all humanity''--Quran 5:32.\n       Being a Muslim girl in the world, I hear many bad things \n     about my religion or my country. Sometimes when people come \n     to know that I'm a Muslim girl they may think that I'm a \n     terrorist, yet I wonder how only 0.03% extremists can \n     represent 1.6 billion people of the world. As a child, I grew \n     up in a loving Muslim family. My parents didn't even permit \n     us to kill a spider or an ant. I was never told to spread \n     violence in the world. I was never taught in my school or \n     house to be an extremist. In my reading of our holy book, I \n     only found words of wisdom and peace so then why are the \n     extremists labeled as Muslims? How can we say they belong to \n     a certain religious group if they kill innocent people?\n       As an exchange student from Pakistan coming to Vermont, I \n     was first afraid of coming to a country that may see me as a \n     terrorist since I am a Muslim. I thought I may be bullied or \n     someone would call me a terrorist in school but the love I \n     have received from people here is what I had never imagined. \n     But still when I hear negative news about Muslims or my \n     country on TV or the internet, it hurts me. I want to help \n     people understand Islam and my country. A month ago after the \n     ISIS attacks in Paris, this topic was raised again and \n     political leaders started saying that Muslims shouldn't be \n     allowed to enter the U.S. I ask, is this really the solution \n     to the terrorist problem? How is it that I have been welcomed \n     so warmly through this exchange program and yet there are \n     those who generalize and state that Muslims are not welcome \n     here?\n       Each year hundreds of exchange students from the Muslim \n     world come to the U.S and the students and their host \n     families form a special bond. These relationships form strong \n     connections and the memories live forever. Our country's \n     leaders should look at what we are doing; young people can \n     play just as an important role as our current leaders. We are \n     not spreading any violence; we are trying to know each other. \n     We are humans and we care about each other. It's not because \n     we're from the same background or religion. What matters the \n     most is how strongly we are bonded to each other.\n       The problem of terrorism is not a problem for one country \n     but for the whole world, and the solution to it is not \n     blaming each other and closing boundaries but rather knowing \n     and helping each other. I believe that if people open \n     themselves to new experiences and start knowing each other, \n     the world would be a good place.\n\n\n          MEGAN BROMLEY, MILTON SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       My fellow Americans, sometimes overlooked are the basic \n     human rights and needs of the people. While this may entail \n     many topics, I would like to focus on a major issue that has \n     slid under the radar for far too long. The epidemic of rape \n     and sexual assault runs rampant through our country and not \n     much has been done to change this continuing tragedy. Steps \n     may be taken. The first step must address the unprocessed \n     rape kits. Throughout our country there are over 20,000 \n     unprocessed rape kits. Add to this the estimate that 68% of \n     rapes or sexual assaults that occur go unreported. Imagine \n     how large the number of unanalyzed kits there would then be \n     if even 50% more were to be reported. This is a challenging \n     issue and it cannot be solved overnight, however there are \n     steps to take in the right direction aside from moral and \n     ethical obligations.\n       One solution that could be enforced is a quota, by this I \n     imply that every city must meet a certain number of kits \n     processed in order to get the number of prosecutors facing \n     jail time or other capital punishment inclining. Too many \n     cases go without investigation even after the kit has been \n     used and the victim has been tested, this crime is not fading \n     away and must be faced head on not shied away from due to \n     technical complications that can be entirely avoided. The \n     federal government should follow through with\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\n     a funded mandate to state and city law enforcement to help \n     them process the kits and create additional lab facilities.\n       Now, as I have just said the number of people who have \n     committed a sexual assault crime in prison would increase due \n     to the processing of more rape kits, this leads into my next \n     point of discussion--incarceration rates and funding for \n     prisons. 12.7% of inmates are made up of those who are \n     serving time for drug violations and marijuana expenses. We \n     are pouring millions of dollars into our state and federal \n     prison systems and too much of that is going towards people \n     for up to twenty years for marijuana possession. However I \n     propose to use the funding instead to evaluate something such \n     as unprocessed rape kits and begin to treat minor drug use in \n     a proactive manner. Marijuana possession should be removed as \n     a state and federal crime and result in no jail time. \n     Instead, as a nation we should implement counseling after a \n     three strike policy or enter the convicted into a \n     rehabilitation program if the drug use worsens. Many other \n     countries decriminalized the use and/ or possession of \n     marijuana and they have some of the lowest rates regarding \n     drug use and misdemeanor crimes. Just by reducing \n     incarceration of people convicted of misdemeanor drug crimes, \n     there would be an inclination of money to put forth on other \n     issues at hand, not just processing rape kits. Taking one \n     step at a time towards the issues that are more manageable \n     such as the two I have just discussed is how America can move \n     forward, it doesn't need to be a leap of faith and a tackle \n     at a major issue, one objective at a time culminates for a \n     strong, prosperous country.\n\n\n       MIKAYLA CLARKE, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       There are many different issues that the U.S. is facing \n     right now, but one of the most beneficial actions the U.S. \n     could do right now is to legalize marijuana. By legalizing \n     marijuana for recreational and medical uses the country would \n     benefit in many different ways. The crime rate would \n     dramatically decrease, the use of prescription drugs would \n     decrease and the economy would greatly improve.\n       The economy is not in a great place in the U.S., as we are \n     $18.7 trillion in debt, and counting. In 2014 the Washington \n     Post wrote that Colorado made $700 million off of medical and \n     recreational marijuana in the first year it was legal. By \n     legalizing marijuana, many more job opportunities would open \n     and a whole new industry is created. The amount that the \n     whole country would make would be in the billions.\n       The use of prescription drugs such as painkillers and \n     sleeping pills is greatly increasing. Those pills become \n     addictive and many people use them to get high because \n     they're legal and easy to obtain. Children are given those \n     pills, and they may become addicted at a young age. While \n     there is the ability to overdose on those pills, marijuana is \n     almost impossible to overdose on and brings better relief \n     than prescription drugs. Overdose deaths from prescription \n     pills were significantly reduced in the 23 states that allow \n     medical marijuana. By legalizing marijuana the dispensaries \n     get different strains of marijuana to help people sleep or \n     deal with pain. If it's being used in the medical form the \n     THC can be extracted and the CBD's can be used for the pain. \n     There are many different ways to consume marijuana, such as \n     oils, creams, foods, and smokable. In the U.S. there are over \n     one million people using medical marijuana, yet, it's still \n     not legal in all states.\n       People all over the country are getting in legal trouble \n     for using and possessing marijuana. Young people are getting \n     criminal records for a non-violent civil offense, and as a \n     result will potentially be not allowed to gain federal \n     student loans or jobs. With our limited police and jail \n     resources, there are more important and harmful substances to \n     focus on. In April of 2014 MSNBC wrote an article, Study: \n     Marijuana Legalization Doesn't Increase Crime, ``Even after \n     Colorado legalized the sale of small amounts of marijuana for \n     recreational use on Jan. 1 of this year, violent and property \n     crime rates in the city are actually falling.'' Since the \n     government is regulating the marijuana, it will be safer. \n     There won't be strands that are laced with other harmful \n     drugs, such as heroin or cocaine. By legalizing marijuana, \n     less people will get arrested for the use and possession.\n       As a country we should legalize marijuana. First we should \n     start with medical, because medical patients are more \n     important. Then as a country it should be decriminalized. \n     Then, we should legalize recreational. By legalizing \n     marijuana not only will marijuana users benefit, even non-\n     users will benefit.\n\n\n     MADDIE COLLINS, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       The 2008 financial crisis should have paved the way for a \n     new era of banking, for real reform and regulation, for much \n     needed change. The 2008 financial crisis should have forged \n     the path for breaking up the nation's largest banks, but \n     instead the crisis has taken a back seat to other, more \n     heavily broadcasted issues. This back seat position has \n     allowed the same Wall Street bankers who are to blame for the \n     greatest recession since the Great Depression, to yet again \n     be gambling with taxpayer money. In my opinion, it is of \n     utmost importance to regulate our financial institutions in \n     order to hinder their increasing ability to damage the global \n     economy. We must understand that our country and the world as \n     a whole would be devastated if another large bank were to go \n     bankrupt.\n       In our country there are four banks that hold assets of \n     more than $1 trillion dollars. The largest, JP Morgan Chase \n     and Company, holds $1.8 trillion dollars in total assets, the \n     equivalent of 14% of all total assets held by U.S. commercial \n     banks. Comparatively, in 2001, the top asset holder was Bank \n     of America with $552 billion dollars. This increase is \n     substantial, and will only continue to rise.\n       The problem with these large banks is that if they were to \n     go unexpectedly bankrupt it would cause rippling effects on \n     the economy, similar to what the world witnessed in 2008 with \n     the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers. To give this some \n     perspective, the Lehman Brothers' total assets were $600 \n     billion dollars, only one third of JP Morgan Chase and \n     Company's current assets. These banks pose a real threat to \n     the security of our financial system. As described by William \n     C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New \n     York, there are two big problems with these ``too big to \n     fail'' banks. First, to combat the threat that they pose, the \n     government intervenes and gives large banks a funding \n     advantage over smaller banks, thus creating an unfair playing \n     field. Secondly, this funding advantage creates incentives \n     for financial firms to become larger and more complex. As the \n     banking system becomes more and more complex, the risks \n     dramatically increase, only furthering the problem.\n       In a time where our government officials are advocating for \n     the creation of more jobs and placing greater value on small \n     businesses, we need to be more aware of what is best for this \n     type of business. We need smaller, community banks to serve \n     small businesses for they do a better job of fulfilling their \n     credit needs. Unlike with large institutions, community banks \n     allow businesses to receive loans based on their reputation \n     and reliability within the community that they serve, rather \n     than basing it solely on their credit scores.\n       With a clear perspective and a shift in focus, it is \n     certainly achievable to break up our nation's largest banks \n     and ensure that greed and selfishness are no longer the \n     ruling forces that drive our financial institutions.\n\n\n             OLIVIER ENWA, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       The country that you and I live in is fantastic and I am \n     really proud of the things we are doing. I would like to \n     address two problems, which are racism and prejudice. \n     Specifically, there are people who are being judged by their \n     skin color or their religion in the United States.\n       More people of color are being sent to jail than white \n     people. More people of color are also being killed by the \n     police and executed by the judicial system. Bryan Stevenson, \n     a social justice activist, said ``I think that every human \n     being falters sometime; no one is perfect. Our mistakes \n     require the mercy and understanding of others, which we can't \n     legitimately expect unless we offer the same to others''. \n     Innocent people are being killed for nothing. ``Why do we \n     want to kill all the broken people?''\n       The U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights protect \n     people's rights, and we have the right to worship any \n     religion. The First Amendment says that everyone in the \n     United States has the right to worship any god or no religion \n     at all. Over the years many Americans have forgotten the \n     First Amendment when they think about Muslims. Innocent \n     Muslims are blamed for things they didn't do, such as the \n     attack in New York on September 11, 2001.\n       One cause of hatred against Muslims is the growth of ISIS, \n     which uses Islam as an excuse to kill people and destroy \n     land. Many Americans think that all Muslims are the same as \n     ISIS, which is not true. I have friends who are Muslims and I \n     definitely don't think they are terrorists. Innocent Muslims \n     are being accused of terrorism and they are sent back to \n     their countries. According to CNN, presidential candidate \n     Donald Trump said that, ``the United States should come to a \n     complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.'' I \n     think that innocent Muslims should be left alone.\n       Prejudice still exists in this amazing country because I've \n     experienced it. One day I went to the store near my house \n     with my friends. When we got there the cashier told us to put \n     our backpacks down. As we were getting the stuff we wanted to \n     buy, the manager came up to us and told us to ``get out of my \n     store'' even though we hadn't done anything wrong. I was hurt \n     that he had judged me by my appearance.\n       Better education in poor parts of the country and the \n     education of police officers will help improve racism in the \n     U.S. The United States should improve education for poor \n     people. Most of the people being killed and put in jail are \n     undereducated people of color. Speaking as a black man from \n     Mozambique, I believe that if education is improved in poorer \n     parts of the country our country will be a better place. \n     Education is the key to everything.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S252-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S252-S253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE CLEMSON TIGERS FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. SCOTT.

Coach Dabo Swinney has led this special group \nof young men to the top of the mountain, and all signs point to them \nstaying at the top for years to come.\n  Therefore, I recognize and congratulate the entire Clemson Tigers \nfootball team for all the hard work they put into a successful season. \nI look forward to another great season from the team this year. Go \nTigers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S253-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING RALPH EUGENE NIX\n\n Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today I wish to remember Ralph \nEugene Nix, a beloved father and grandfather, a kind-hearted veteran, \nand a great Alaskan.\n  Mr. Nix served as a corporal in the Marine Corps during the Korean \nwar, where he served as a gunner. The Korean war is often forgotten in \nour Nation's history. Because it was sandwiched between World War II \nand the Vietnam war, many in our country don't know much about the \nsacrifices made by so many--including Mr. Nix--during the war.\n  When I joined the Marine Corps, from officer candidate school on, I \nstudied the war with great interest. Some call it the Forgotten War. I \ncall it the Noble War. Tens of thousands of lives were lost, and the \nsacrifices were many in their effort to save the cause of freedom.\n  As the Korean War Memorial says, ``Our nation honors her sons and \ndaughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and \na people they never met.'' Mr. Nix was one of those sons.\n  He answered that call as a young man and continued his patriotism by \nserving his country after the war. In 1976, he moved to Anchorage. He \nmarried and had children. He became active in his church and devoted \nmuch of his life to helping other veterans. As a member of the board of \ndirectors for the Alaska veteran support group, he worked to help \nveterans and their families with warm meals, clothing, household goods, \nand food.\n  His devotion to his country was recognized by his participation in an \nhonor flight to Washington, DC, in April of 2015--an experience that I \nknow meant very much to him.\n  For me, greeting his honor flight in DC was one of the highlights of \nmy career, as was the trip that we made to the Veterans Administration \ntogether in Anchorage.\n  Last year, after Mr. Nix received a medal from Korean officials for \nhis efforts during the war, Mr. Nix wrote, ``To serve with you men and \nwomen is one of life's greater blessings. In some way--in some capacity \nwe all are giving our lives for our fellow man.''\n  Mr. Nix lived up to that statement. He also embodied another \nstatement etched into the marble of the Korean War Memorial: ``Freedom \nis not free.'' The defense of freedom comes with sacrifice. Ralph Nix \nknew this. Ralph Nix acted on this. Ralph Nix protected the freedom of \nAmerica and our allies. His service to our country will not be \nforgotten.\n  I express condolences to his wife, Carol Nix; his son, Johnny Nix, \nand wife, Dawn; his grandson, Jacob Moser; his daughter, Jamie Nix, and \nhusband, Aron Aguilar.\n  We lost a great American, an Alaskan treasure, and a marine. Semper \nfidelis, Ralph.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S253-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S253-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/27/senate-section/article/S253-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S253-S254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-4207.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Heat Efficiency through \n     Applied Technology Act'' or the ``HEAT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) combined heat and power technology, also known as \n     cogeneration, is a technology that efficiently produces \n     electricity and thermal energy at the point of use of the \n     technology;\n       (2) by combining the provision of both electricity and \n     thermal energy in a single step, combined heat and power \n     technology makes significantly more-efficient use of fuel, as \n     compared to separate generation of heat and power, which has \n     significant economic and environmental advantages;\n       (3) waste heat to power is a technology that captures heat \n     discarded by an existing industrial process and uses that \n     heat to generate power with no additional fuel and no \n     incremental emissions, reducing the need for electricity from \n     other sources and the grid, and any associated emissions;\n       (4) waste heat or waste heat to power is considered \n     renewable energy in 17 States;\n       (5)(A) a 2012 joint report by the Department of Energy and \n     the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that by \n     achieving the national goal outlined in Executive Order 13624 \n     (77 Fed. Reg. 54779) (September 5, 2012) of deploying 40 \n     gigawatts of new combined heat and power technology by 2020, \n     the United States would increase the total combined heat and \n     power capacity of the United States by 50 percent in less \n     than a decade; and\n       (B) additional efficiency would--\n       (i) save 1,000,000,000,000,000 BTUs of energy; and\n       (ii) reduce emissions by 150,000,000 metric tons of carbon \n     dioxide annually, a quantity equivalent to the emissions from \n     more than 25,000,000 cars;\n       (6) a 2012 report by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     estimated the amount of waste heat available at a temperature \n     high enough for power generation from industrial and \n     nonindustrial applications represents an additional 10 \n     gigawatts of electric generating capacity on a national \n     basis;\n       (7) distributed energy generation, including through \n     combined heat and power technology and waste heat to power \n     technology, has ancillary benefits, such as--\n       (A) removing load from the electricity distribution grid; \n     and\n       (B) improving the overall reliability of the electricity \n     distribution system; and\n       (8)(A) a number of regulatory barriers impede broad \n     deployment of combined heat and power technology and waste \n     heat to power technology; and\n       (B) a 2008 study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory \n     identified interconnection issues, regulated fees and \n     tariffs, and environmental permitting as areas that could be \n     streamlined with respect to the provision of combined heat \n     and power technology and waste heat to power technology.\n\n     SEC. 2503.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Forest Incentives Program \n     Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 6002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) public and private forest land in the United States \n     plays a crucial role in sequestering carbon and otherwise \n     contributes to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (2) the Environmental Protection Agency has reported in the \n     annual greenhouse gas inventory that United States forests \n     and forest products sequester as much as 12 to 14 percent of \n     annual United States carbon emissions, which makes forests \n     one of the largest carbon sinks in the United States;\n       (3) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     carbon sequestration from forests and other land uses has \n     grown by approximately 14 percent since 1990, largely as a \n     result of afforestation and improved forest management;\n       (4) the use of forests products, such as wood products, in \n     buildings and biobased products can also reduce carbon \n     emissions when used in place of other, more carbon-intensive \n     products;\n       (5)(A) in addition to the significant carbon mitigation \n     benefits of using forests and forest products for carbon \n     sequestration, the economic and societal cobenefits of forest \n     carbon solutions are extraordinarily valuable; and\n       (B) incentivizing forest carbon activities, including \n     through working forests, has the potential to provide timber \n     and other forest commodities, improve air quality, enhance \n     watershed function and water supply, create and sustain fish \n     and wildlife habitat, contribute to scenic and aesthetic \n     qualities, support historical and cultural resources, provide \n     hunting, fishing, and recreational opportunities, and \n     increase forest resiliency, while also supporting rural jobs \n     and local economies;\n       (6) despite positive recent trends in forest carbon, as \n     documented by the annual greenhouse gas inventory of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, projections of the Forest \n     Service indicate those forest carbon and other benefits are \n     at risk in future decades due to development pressures and \n     other factors;\n       (7) while the majority of the productive forest land of the \n     United States is under private ownership, private landowners \n     are facing increased pressure to convert their forest land to \n     other uses;\n       (8) while some landowners are able to participate in \n     various carbon markets, the transaction costs and \n     restrictions of those programs are often prohibitive for \n     private landowners, particularly smallholders; and\n       (9) creating incentives for private forest landowners to \n     adopt best practices to maintain and increase carbon benefits \n     from forest land through a streamlined program that avoids \n     excessive transaction costs will help ``keep forests as \n     forests'' and enhance forest carbon benefits by providing \n     incentive payments for a suite of eligible practices \n     throughout the lifecycle of forest management, including \n     forest products that provide long-term carbon storage \n     benefits.\n\n     SEC. 6003. FOREST INCENTIVES PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Carbon incentives contract; contract.--The term \n     ``carbon incentives contract'' or ``contract'' means a 15- to \n     30-year contract that specifies--\n       (A) the eligible practices that will be undertaken;\n       (B) the acreage of eligible land on which the practices \n     will be undertaken;\n       (C) the agreed rate of compensation per acre;\n       (D) a schedule to verify that the terms of the contract \n     have been fulfilled; and\n       (E) such other terms as are determined necessary by the \n     Secretary.\n       (2) Conservation easement agreement; agreement.--The term \n     ``conservation easement agreement'' or ``agreement'' means a \n     permanent conservation easement that--\n       (A) covers eligible land that will not be converted for \n     development;\n       (B) is enrolled under a carbon incentives contract; and\n       (C) is consistent with the guidelines for--\n       (i) the Forest Legacy Program established under section 7 \n     of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. \n     2103c), subject to the condition that an eligible practice \n     shall be considered to be a conservation value for purposes \n     of such consistency; or\n       (ii) any other program approved by the Secretary for use \n     under this section to provide consistency with Federal legal \n     requirements for permanent conservation easements.\n       (3) Eligible land.--The term ``eligible land'' means forest \n     land in the United States that is privately owned at the time \n     of initiation of a carbon incentives contract or conservation \n     easement agreement.\n       (4) Eligible practice.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``eligible practice'' means a \n     forestry practice, including improved forest management that \n     produces marketable forest products, that is determined by \n     the Secretary to provide measurable increases in carbon \n     sequestration and storage beyond customary practices on \n     comparable land.\n       (B) Inclusions.--The term ``eligible practice'' includes--\n       (i) afforestation on nonforested land, such as marginal \n     crop or pasture land, windbreaks, shelterbelts, stream \n     buffers, including working land and urban forests and parks, \n     or other areas identified by the Secretary;\n       (ii) reforestation on forest land impacted by wildfire, \n     pests, wind, or other stresses, including working land and \n     urban forests and parks;\n       (iii) improved forest management through practices such as \n     improving regeneration after harvest, planting in \n     understocked forests, reducing competition from slow-growing \n     species, thinning to encourage growth, changing rotations to \n     increase carbon storage, improving harvest efficiency or wood \n     use; and\n       (iv) such other practices as the Secretary determines to be \n     appropriate.\n       (5) Forest incentives program; program.--The term ``forest \n     incentives program'' or ``program'' means the forest \n     incentives program established under subsection (b)(1).\n       (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Agriculture.\n       (b) Supplemental Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions in \n     United States.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a forest \n     incentives program to achieve supplemental greenhouse gas \n     emission reductions and carbon sequestration on private \n     forest land of the United States through--\n       (A) carbon incentives contracts;

CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Carbon \n     Capture Improvement Act of 2016''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Capture and long-term storage of carbon dioxide from \n     coal, natural gas, and biomass-fired power plants, as well as \n     from industrial sectors such as oil refining and production \n     of fertilizer, cement, and ethanol, can help protect the \n     environment while improving the economy and national security \n     of the United States.\n       (2) The United States is a world leader in the field of \n     carbon dioxide capture and long-term storage, as well as the \n     beneficial use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery \n     operations, with many manufacturers and licensors of carbon \n     dioxide capture technology based in the United States.\n       (3) While the prospects for large-scale carbon capture in \n     the United States are promising, costs remain relatively \n     high. Lowering the financing costs for carbon dioxide capture \n     projects would accelerate the deployment of this technology, \n     and if the captured carbon dioxide is subsequently sold for \n     industrial use, such as for use in enhanced oil recovery \n     operations, the economic prospects are further improved.\n       (4) Since 1968, tax-exempt private activity bonds have been \n     used to provide access to lower-cost financing for private \n     businesses that are purchasing new capital equipment for \n     certain specified environmental facilities, including \n     facilities that reduce, recycle, or dispose of waste, \n     pollutants, and hazardous substances.\n       (5) Allowing tax-exempt financing for the purchase of \n     capital equipment that is used to capture carbon dioxide will \n     reduce the costs of developing carbon dioxide capture \n     projects, accelerate their deployment, and, in conjunction \n     with carbon dioxide utilization and long-term storage, help \n     the United States meet critical environmental, economic, and \n     national security goals.\n       (c) Carbon Dioxide Capture Facilities.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) in paragraph (14), by striking ``or'' at the end,\n       (ii) in paragraph (15), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``, or'', and\n       (iii) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(16) qualified carbon dioxide capture facilities.'', and\n       (B) by
