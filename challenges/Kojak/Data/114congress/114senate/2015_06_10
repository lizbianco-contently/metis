Mr. President, the President put forth a mighty \nObamaCare spin effort yesterday. We have to give him credit for trying \nto salvage a law that only one--one--out of every nine Americans thinks \nis actually working. But I don't think condescending to ObamaCare's \nvictims was the best approach for him to take.\n  Consider this cringe-inducing assertion: Americans who already had \nhealth insurance ``may not know that they've got a better deal now \n[under ObamaCare] . . . than they did, but they do.''\n  In other words, he knows what is best for you, so quit complaining.\n  It is the very mindset that led this partisan law being forced \nthrough over the objections of the American people in the first place. \nIt is the very mindset that said it was OK to cut a few corners and \ntell a few white lies to sell the country a law it didn't want.\n  So what, the Obama crowd seems to think, if Americans couldn't keep \nthe plan they had and liked--so what. So what, ObamaCare's defenders \nmust reason, if Americans see costs rise after being told they would \nfall.\n  To our friends on the left, it is just the cost of doing business. \nThese days they have all but given up the ghost of empathy. They just \ntalk past the middle class instead.\n  Consider some of the statements we have heard from top Democrats. \n``ObamaCare has been wonderful for America.'' ``None of the predictions \nabout how [ObamaCare] wouldn't work have come to pass.'' The \nimplementation of this is ``fabulous.''\n  We have heard all of that from Democratic leaders.\n  These are the kinds of statements that raise our blood pressure all \nacross America. But quotes such as these betray more than just a \ncertain incongruence from reality. This is also a signal of a party \nthat has lost confidence in the force of its own arguments--one that \nseems more intent on reassuring itself than convincing others.\n  Why else would they be saying things they know aren't true?\n  Now, I have spoken broadly over the past week about how ObamaCare has \nfailed Americans in terms of higher costs especially, but allow me just \nto touch on the assertion that ObamaCare's implementation has been \n``fabulous'' too.\n  Fabulous? That is certainly one way to describe how ObamaCare has \nbeen plagued by failure since day one. Consider the disastrous rollout. \nMany Americans won't forget the crashing Web sites, the hours on hold, \nthe instructions to ``fax in'' their applications while at the same \ntime seeing reports of ObamaCare contractors sitting idle, waiting for \nwork to come through the door.\n  The White House tried to spin it all away as nothing more than a \nglitch--just a glitch--on the Web site. But the American people knew it \npointed to broader systemic challenges in an unworkable law.\n  Consider the many pro-ObamaCare States that launched exchanges with \ngreat enthusiasm. These true-blue administrations did everything they \ncould to make ObamaCare work, but they often ended up exposing \nObamaCare's tragic realities instead.\n  Take deep blue Vermont. Many on the left looked to Vermont's extra-\nambitious ObamaCare experiment as the crown jewel in their ideological \ncrown, but it turned out to be little more than ``an unending money \npit,'' as one Vermonter put it.\n  In Oregon, officials spent over $300 million taxpayer dollars to \nlaunch an ObamaCare exchange and marketing campaign. That is a big \ninvestment. But ObamaCare has been an even bigger flop. Millions of \ndollars down the tubes and Oregon has little to show for it beyond a \ncouple of bizarre marketing videos and a criminal investigation.\n  Hawaii just announced it will be the latest State to shutter--close, \nshutter up--its faltering exchange.\n  In Kentucky, a Democratic administration poured one-quarter of a \nbillion dollars into an exchange that placed nearly 80 percent of the \nenrollees into an already broken Medicaid system. Many of the remaining \n20 percent or so now find themselves stuck with unaffordable ObamaCare \ncoverage, such as a constituent from Ashland,\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\nwho wrote to let me know that his monthly premium increased by more \nthan 30 percent.\n  So it is hard to disagree with the top Vermont health official who \nsaid: ``Good God, this just wasn't set up for success.'' That is from \nthe top health official in Vermont. Given the spectacular flop in his \nState, he would certainly know, and he certainly seems to have a point. \nOf the 17 original ObamaCare exchanges, some have failed outright, and \nhalf of those that remain are struggling financially.\n  So the truth is this: ObamaCare never had a Web site problem; it had \nan ObamaCare problem.\n  No amount of wishful thinking or fast talk is going to change that \nreality. It is not going to change the failures I just mentioned, and \nit is not going to change the failures I haven't, such as the failed \nCLASS Act, the troubled co-ops, the debacle of giving people the wrong \namount of subsidy or what we just learned yesterday--that the IRS may \nnot even be able to verify that many of the people who received the tax \ncredit for health insurance actually bought the health insurance.\n  I am asking ObamaCare's defenders in the White House and in Congress \nto redirect their efforts away from the spin and toward the reality \ninstead. We all know that ObamaCare is a law filled with broken \npromises, higher costs, and failure. So let's work together to start \nover with real health care reform instead.\n  That is the kind of health care outcome that actually would be \n``fabulous'' for our constituents. It is something that really would be \n``wonderful for America.'' And it is what we can work together to \nachieve once Washington politicians move past the failure of ObamaCare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3978-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the massive cyber attack Americans just \nread about reminds us all of the need for action on this issue. \nBuilding America's public and private cyber defenses won't be easy. But \nthe bipartisan cyber security measure that passed out of the \nIntelligence Committee with the support of every single Republican and \nevery single Democrat but one, 14 to 1, will increase the ability of \nthe public and private sector to share information and to make us \nsafer. That is why we are going to take it up as part of the Defense \nauthorization bill now before us.\n  I hope Senators of both parties will come together to support that \nbipartisan amendment when it comes to a vote, just as we saw the Senate \ncome together to keep the Defense authorization bill intact and \nconsistent with the budget resolution by standing against the Reed \namendment yesterday. It keeps us on track to pass bipartisan \nlegislation that will support the men and women who keep us safe every \nday.\n  There is something else worth noting about the vote, too. It means we \nhave now taken twice as many amendment rollcall votes on this year's \nDefense authorization bill as we were allowed on the last two bills \ncombined. Again, it means we have now taken twice as many amendment \nrollcall votes on this year's Defense authorization bill as were \nallowed in the last two bills combined. It is just the latest reminder \nof a new majority that is getting the Senate back on track and back to \nwork.\n  Unfortunately, some leaders of the previous majority seem bound and \ndetermined to get us back into their gridlock comfort season. At a time \nof grave threats to our Nation, these Democratic leaders think it is a \ngood idea to hold brave servicemen and brave servicewomen hostage to \npartisan demands for more waste at the IRS and bigger congressional \noffice budgets for themselves. Let me repeat. At a moment of dangerous \nand gathering threats, here is the position of these Democratic \nleaders: They want to hold hostage the funding needed to make our \ntroops combat ready so they can spend more on bureaucracies such as the \nIRS.\n  These Democratic leaders just can't seem to kick the gridlock habit, \neven on legislation with the exact same level of funding President \nObama asked for in his own budget. They just can't shake their passion \nfor partisanship, even on a bill that sailed out of committee on a \nhugely bipartisan vote of 22 to 4. That is how the Defense \nauthorization bill came out of the committee: 22 to 4.\n  That doesn't mean the rest of their party has to go along with it. I \nam appealing to every commonsense Democrat--every Democrat \nuncomfortable with the thought of holding our troops and our families \nto ransom for unrelated partisan demands--to keep working across the \naisle in good faith, instead, because many of our colleagues understand \nthe true sacrifice and unparalleled value of the nearly 1.5 million \nActive-Duty men and women who proudly wear our country's uniform, the \n1.1 million members of the Reserve and National Guard, and the more \nthan 700,000 civilian officials who stand in support, not to mention \nthe many veterans and families who enrich our country and our \ncommunities.\n  We certainly understand their value in Kentucky. We are proud to host \nseveral important military bases across the Commonwealth. I wish to \ntell my colleagues about just one of them today.\n  Fort Campbell is home to approximately 30,000 Army personnel, \nincluding vital Special Operations units and the famed 101st Airborne \nDivision. Units from Fort Campbell have bravely served as the tip of \nthe spear in executing the U.S. global war on terror, with the 101st \nAirborne deploying as the first conventional unit in its support.\n  It was soldiers from Fort Campbell who proudly answered the call to \nassist with the delicate Ebola mission in West Africa, and it is Fort \nCampbell's unrivaled aviation infrastructure that provides the Army \nwith the critical ability to rapidly deploy servicemembers to volatile \nregions.\n  It is obvious that Fort Campbell means a lot to our country, and I \ncan't tell my colleagues how much it means to Kentucky. It means a lot \nto its local community, too, especially considering the fact that it \nhas an annual economic impact of $5 billion to the surrounding area.\n  This, of course, is hardly a unique story in America. From coast to \ncoast, there is no end of examples of how our troops and our military \nenrich the fabric of our communities while at the same time keeping us \nsafe. They are our neighbors. They are our friends. They are our \ndaughters. They are our sons. They are not chess pieces for Democratic \nleaders to wield in some partisan game.\n  If Democratic leaders are really that worried about fattening up the \nIRS or adding a new coat of paint to their congressional offices, we \ncan have that discussion, but let's leave our troops out of it and \nleave their families out of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3978-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is very difficult to respond to fiction, \nand that is what we just heard. We heard a speech based on fiction, a \nspeech based on no facts, a speech based on made-up facts.\n  It is so hard to comprehend the different areas the majority leader \nspoke of with no basis in reality. On the subject of health care, it is \nas if he doesn't realize that 16.5 million people have health \ninsurance.\n  He denigrates people who aren't insured. Because of Obamacare, they \nnow have the ability to go to a doctor or a hospital when they are sick \nbecause of Medicaid. Is there anything wrong with that? In America \neveryone is not rich. In America not everyone is middle class. Some \npeople are falling through the cracks, and the fact that in the State \nof Kentucky a lot of people there now have the ability to go to doctors \nwhen they are sick or hurt shouldn't be anything that people make fun \nof.\n  Health care has changed dramatically. I walked into a drugstore near \nmy home here in Washington--CVS. As a result of ObamaCare and other \nreasons, you can go into that drugstore now and have a test for strep. \nIf you need medicine, they can give it to you. That is progress in \nmedicine in America.\n  My friend the Republican leader talks as if he would like to return \nto the time prior to ObamaCare, when insurance companies defined the \npeople\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nwho have preexisting disabilities. Let's go back to that system. Let's \ngo back to the system where if you have a child who has diabetes, you \ncan't get that kid insured. If you have been in an automobile accident \nand you broke your neck--even if you are doing fine now, but from the \ndoctor's reports it shows that you broke your neck--you can't get \ninsurance. People with debilitating diseases now can get help.\n  The overwhelming majority of Americans, statistically, who enrolled \nin health care plans under the new law are satisfied with the coverage. \nThe majority leader continues to misstate the facts on the Affordable \nCare Act. The latest poll shows that the majority of Americans support \nthe law, as they should. So I don't know why my friend has to come here \nand make up things.\n  ObamaCare has been an important program for American families in \nNevada and all over America. So I am very disappointed with the state \nof nonreality of my friend from Kentucky, who has come here each day \nthis week to talk about ObamaCare and what is wrong with it. Before \nthis law came into being, patients and the American people were subject \nto premium increases without any notice, cancellations without notice, \ndenials for preexisting conditions, which I have already mentioned, and \narbitrary limits on how much care insurance companies would cover.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3979-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3979-S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader also came here and talked about how \nDemocrats don't care about people in the armed services in America--\nthat we don't care. In Nevada, I would compare our military \ninstallations and their contributions to a stellar military. Nobody \nsurpasses what we do in Nevada. We have the finest Air Force training \ncenter in the world for people who fly fighter aircraft. They are all \nthere. We have 10,000 civilian employees, and about 10,000 troops are \nstationed there. It has been in existence since it was called the \nGunnery School in World War II. We are very proud of that. It is an \nimportant part of our community, and we protect it.\n  If you go north 350 miles, there is the Fallon Naval Air Training \nCenter, which is a great installation, where if you want to fly on an \naircraft carrier in America, that is where you train, at Fallon. TOPGUN \nis there. It is a wonderful facility, and we are proud of that \nfacility. It doesn't have as many civilian personnel as Nellis. It is \nnot as big and does not have as many active military, but it is an \noutstanding operation. People come from all over the world to train at \nNellis--from all over the world. We have such a vastness in Nevada, and \npeople train there. They can't do it anyplace else in the world.\n  So I would put my support of the military--I would certainly compare \nit to my friend the Republican leader. I am sure he cares. I care also, \nand all 45 Members of the Democratic caucus care about the military. We \ncare about it in a way that is not denigrating to the Internal Revenue \nService that he keeps bashing.\n  One reason that the Internal Revenue Service has a tough time doing \nits job is because the Republicans keep cutting their budget. The head \nof the IRS came to see me a couple months ago, and said: We made it \nthrough the tax season. There were very few problems, but he said that \nif anyone wanted to call the IRS 2 months prior to the tax season \nending, they couldn't answer the phones. They didn't have enough staff \nto do it.\n  The bill came out of the Armed Services Committee, and at that time, \nour leading member of that committee, Jack Reed, a graduate of the U.S. \nMilitary Academy said that the bill was flawed. It was flawed because \nhe hoped we could fix the funding mechanism that the Republicans put in \nthis--another unbelievably fictitious way of taking care of our \ngovernment.\n  The chairman of that committee is somebody with whom I came from the \nHouse of Representatives 33 years ago. We came to the Senate together. \nHe has been someone who has stood on this floor and berated phony \nspending. Where is he now? How could this man be in favor of deficit \nspending? How can he be in favor of OCO? He has spoken out openly \nagainst it in the past, but suddenly he is in favor of it.\n  The President said the minute that bill was taken up in the \ncommittee: If you don't change that, I am going to veto the bill--as he \nshould. What we have said is we are going to support that. We believe \nwhat is in this bill is as fictitious as his account of what ObamaCare \nis all about. But my friend the Republican leader keeps talking about \nthe leftwing: The leftwing is trying to kill this bill. We are not \ntrying to kill the bill. We are trying to make sure we have programs in \nAmerica that support the middle class, that support medical research, \nthat support funding the FBI, and our court system. My friend the \nRepublican leader seems only to care about the military. We care about \nthe military, but we care about other things that lead to the security \nof this Nation.\n  We are not a secure Nation when we don't fund the National Institutes \nof Health. We are not a secure Nation when we don't fund the FBI, the \nDrug Enforcement Administration, and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We are not a secure Nation when we don't fund the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service. But my friend the Republican leader is \nsaying: Don't worry about them. Just take care of the military. All \nthis other stuff will work out.\n  The military is not secure, our government is not secure, and our \nhomeland is not secure, when we have all these other agencies that are \nbeing, in effect, cut back in funding.\n  Now, on cyber security, we know the Presiding Officer of this body \nled the Senate through some very important debates in recent days, and \none of the things that was underlying everything done by the Presiding \nOfficer was cyber security--maybe sometimes not directly, but that is \nin the background, always.\n  What does the Republican leader now come and say?\n  Look how much I am on cyber security. Look at me. I lifted weights \nthis morning.\n  But what he has done is that now he is going to put cyber security on \nthe bill the President said he is going to veto. We are stuck. We have \n400 amendments filed, and we are not going through these amendments. He \nwants to be able to check off the box, saying: Well, we did cyber \nsecurity.\n  He hasn't done cyber security. I have a quote here from him on cyber \nsecurity, just a short time ago: ``Any issue of this importance \ndeserves serious consideration and open debate.'' This is what the \nRepublican leader said. He says: Oh, we have done double the amendments \nthat were done in the last couple of bills.\n  It takes two sides of the Senate to have amendments heard. The \nRepublicans would not let us have open debate on the armed services \nbill the last two Congresses. We never even had a debate here. What \nhappened is the two chairs of the committee met in secret and came up \nwith a bill that came up to the Senate floor, and we were able to get \nthat done. But for people to come here and say this is the 53rd year we \nhave done the bill is a little fictitious itself.\n  I hope that my friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, will get in \ntouch with reality on ObamaCare, on the Defense authorization bill \nbefore this body, and on cyber security and stop making things up, \nbecause that is it. It is fiction, and it is not appropriate.\n  I was so disappointed yesterday to see my Republican colleagues vote \nagainst the amendment proposed by the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, the senior Senator from Rhode Island. His amendment \nwould have done what no Republicans have even tried to do, which is to \nadequately address sequestration.\n  Sequestration was supposed to be so absurd and so foolish that it \nwould force Congress to reduce the deficit in a sensible, balanced \nmanner. On the floor now--I have said this before and I will say it \nagain--I asked the senior Senator from Illinois who came to this House \nwith me and with John McCain 33 years ago: Would you do me a favor? We \nhave this committee that the President has set up, and I need somebody \nthat represents maybe a little bit left of center on this committee. \nWould you do it? He had many other obligations, but he agreed to be on \nthe Bowles-Simpson Commission, and he did a stunningly important good \njob. He supported the financing of that. Quite frankly, that surprised \nme because of all the people yelling for all these\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\nbudget cuts, and many of those voted against it in the committee. Now, \nno one in this body understands sequestration any better than my friend \nfrom Illinois.\n  Sequestration was supposed to be so absurd--I repeat--so foolish, \nthat it would force Congress to balance in a sensible manner. Yet what \nthe Republicans considered lunacy a few years ago is now the preferred \nform of legislating, the preferred form of budgeting. That tells you \neverything you need to know about today's Republican Party. They are \nbeating their chests about how great sequestration is. Isn't it great \nthat all of these Federal agencies are being cut.\n  The Reed amendment would have allowed the Democrats and Republicans \nto negotiate a balanced budget and would have rescinded sequestration, \nwhile ensuring adequate funding to the Department of Defense and \nnondefense programs. Instead, by rejecting Senator Reed's legislation, \nthe Republicans have effectively said spend first, budget later. Here \nis what they have come up with. They are saying: Ready, fire, aim. Or \nthey are saying: Fire, ready, aim. We know they are not saying: Ready, \naim, fire. They have it all backwards, like everything they have done \nhere legislatively--like ostriches with their heads buried deep in the \nsand.\n  The majority leader and Republicans continue to deny the need for a \nbipartisan budget. They deny the need to fix sequestration, just as \nthey deny the urgent need to authorize the Export-Import Bank, which \nemploys 165,000 people in America, as we speak. It expires at the end \nof this month.\n  They deny the urgent need to fix our roads, rails, and bridges. That \nprogram is going to expire in 6 weeks, which creates millions of jobs--\nmillions of jobs.\n  Regardless of what Republicans tell themselves, they cannot wish \nthese important issues to just disappear. It is our job to address \nthese matters that affect working Americans.\n  Here we are in June, months before funding for the government runs \nout. We have plenty of time to sit down and work out an agreement that \nboth sides can work out. It appears to me what the Republicans are \ndoing is that we are heading for another shutdown. They did it once; \nthey are going to do it again. They want to do nothing now. They want \nto wait until the fiscal year ends and then lock it up--close up \ngovernment. There is no reason for this to become yet another \nmanufactured crisis, and that is what we have here.\n\n  We can, I repeat, months before the funding for government runs out, \ndo something about it. Do they desire another closed government? I hope \nnot. But it appears that is where we are headed. The Republicans are \nunwilling to do things that are real. So I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to change course, instead of barreling ahead with bills they \nknow are going to fail.\n  The Defense authorization bill, the President is going to veto. The \nveto will be upheld. We will do it over here. But the House already has \nenough votes to sustain the President's veto. It is just moving forward \nfor reasons that I do not fully understand. I urge them to change \ncourse, work with us to forge an agreement that can get signed into \nlaw.\n  The majority leader's party can continue to ignore and procrastinate \nall they want, but eventually we will need to negotiate a budget free \nof sequestration, a budget that protects our military and also \nnondefense, our middle class. Eventually, we will need to reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank, I repeat, which sustains hundreds of thousands \nof jobs and is responsible for billions of dollars in U.S. exports.\n  Now, eventually we need to find a lasting way to fund on a long-term \nbasis our American highways. Fifty percent of our highways are \ndeficient, 64,000 bridges--50 percent of those are structurally \ndeficient. Not far from here, over the great Memorial Bridge, they are \nclosing two lanes. Why? Because it has rotted away. Hundreds of \nthousands of people go over that every day--or they used to. So why \nwait? Instead of waiting for the President to veto their sham funding \nmechanism and then scramble to craft some last-minute, hastily wrought \ncontinuing resolution, the Republicans should work with us on a \nbipartisan solution now. We are ready to cooperate with Republicans to \npass legislation that keeps America safe and protects the middle class. \nBut to do that, my Republican colleagues will first have to pull their \nheads out of the sand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3980-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, we are considering this bill, and you can \nsee by the size of it, it is a major undertaking. It comes up every \nyear. It is the Department of Defense Authorization Act. It is an \nextraordinarily important bill. It literally authorizes programs for \nthe defense of America.\n  We have two able leaders who brought the bill to the floor. One is \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, John McCain, a man with \nwhom I entered the House many years ago and a man whose reputation and \nservice to America is well known. He is someone who has served in the \nU.S. Navy, was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam war, and has been a \nleader in speaking out on behalf of the military throughout his life. \nIt is built into his family. It is built into his soul.\n  On our side, we have Senator Jack Reed from Rhode Island. Senator \nReed is a graduate of the West Point Military Academy. He served as \nwell in the Active Army. He brings that service, that part of his life \nto his work on the Democratic side of the aisle. When it came to \nputting this bill together, I do not think we could have picked two \nmore able leaders from the Senate, a Republican and a Democrat, to \nbring this bill to the floor.\n  They have their differences. But for the most part they agree on this \nbill. It was troubling this morning to hear the Republican majority \nleader suggest that the differences we have over this bill suggest a \nlack of commitment by Democrats to the military of the United States. \nThat is not true. It is not fair. We are as committed on our side of \nthe aisle as those on the other side of the aisle when it comes to the \nmen and women in uniform--committed to making certain that they have \nwhat they need to be trained, to fight effectively, and to come home \nsafely.\n  We are also committed to bringing them home to a welcoming America, \npreparing veterans programs for the rest of their lives, so they can \nhave productive lives, happy lives after having risked their lives for \nAmerica.\n  So to suggest that the Republicans are for the military and Democrats \nare against it, I regret that the majority leader made that suggestion. \nBoth sides are committed--both the chairman and the ranking member are \ncommitted. But what is the issue that divides us when it comes to this \nbill? It is basically an issue of funding. Here is what it comes down \nto: We have a Budget Control Act, and if we do not hit the numbers in \nspending, in comes sequestration. What is sequestration? It is an \nacross-the-board cut.\n  We do not want to see that happen. We have seen it. We know what it \ndoes. It was devastating to the Department of Defense when we went into \nsequestration. I know because I chaired the Appropriations Committee \nand I listened to the Secretary of Defense and the leaders from our \nbranches and services tell us: It is impossible for us to budget an \neffective national security if we have to wonder whether we are going \nto face an across-the-board cut. I can understand that, not only in \nreadiness, which is essential to the survival of our troops, but also \nin the procurement of substantial, expensive, important, and necessary \ntechnology.\n  So Senator McCain on the Republican side brings to the floor this \nauthorization bill and says: We will solve\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\nthe problem of sequestration by inserting about $38 to $40 billion in \nwartime emergency funding into the Department of Defense. Well, we \ndon't believe that is the right way to go, neither does the Secretary \nof Defense, neither does the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nbecause it is a 1-year fix.\n  We need a fix that has some continuity and predictability to it. \nTherein lies the difference in approach between Democrats and \nRepublicans. Is one side patriotic and the other side not patriotic \nbecause we disagree on a budget reform? Of course not. We happen to \nbelieve there is a better way to do this and so does the President.\n  But there is another element I want to make a reference to. The \nRepublican majority leader came here and said: Well, the Democrats are \nfighting to put more money into the rest of government--nondefense. It \nis true, we are. He used his two examples: Well, they want to hire more \npeople at the Internal Revenue Service and maybe they want to put \nanother coat of paint on their offices. That is what the majority \nleader said.\n  Well, it could not be further from the truth. I will argue for \nadequate funding for the Internal Revenue Service. The overwhelming \nmajority of Americans who pay their fair share of taxes and are honest \npeople and try to follow the law should be respected. Those who don't, \nthose who try to cheat our tax system should be held accountable. I do \nnot think that is a radical idea. It takes employees at the Internal \nRevenue Service to make sure that is true. Right now we have cut back \non their spending.\n  But let me go to another issue which I think really tells the story \nabout why we think we not only need to make sure the Department of \nDefense is adequately funded, but we want to make sure other areas of \ngovernment are adequately funded. Once every 67 seconds in America \nsomeone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's--once every 67 seconds. It is a \ndisease which is now growing at a rapid pace because of the aging of \nour population. It is extraordinarily expensive. Under Medicare and \nMedicaid, $200 billion were spent last year in the care of those with \nAlzheimer's.\n  That number is projected to grow dramatically in the years to come. \nWell, it is a heartbreaking disease, as you see someone whom you dearly \nlove, someone in your family, and their mind is not as responsive as it \nonce was. It is extraordinarily devastating to these families, and it \nis extraordinarily expensive to taxpayers.\n  So what will we do about it? I hope we will be committed, on a \nbipartisan basis, to medical research. Medical research, through the \nNational Institutes of Health, is part of the nondefense budget that we \nare trying to help by resolving this whole question of sequestration. \nIt is not about putting a coat of paint on my office. That is not why I \nam fighting to make sure the nondefense part of the budget is not \nvictimized by sequestration. I am fighting for the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  How important is it that they not face sequestration? They have done \nit. They faced it. Let me tell you just one example of what it meant. \nDr. Frank LaFerla is at the University of California in Irvine. He is a \nmedical researcher. He and his team have created mice that develop \nAlzheimer's disease in the same way humans do. Now, his research team \ncan study that disease in these mice, but the mice need to age 18 \nmonths before research on potential Alzheimer's disease treatments can \nbe done.\n  In 2013, when we faced sequestration, across-the-board cuts in the \nbudget, Dr. LaFerla was faced with the prospect of having to sacrifice \nthese laboratory animals and close his lab. If that had happened, \nmonths of research would have been wasted. That is what happens when \nyou do something as mindless as sequestration in the Department of \nDefense and in the National Institutes of Health.\n  We even have an amendment, which I hope will not be offered but is \npending--has now been filed, I should say, in the Senate, which would \ncut medical research in the Department of Defense. I wonder what my \ncolleagues are thinking; that we in America should cut back on medical \nresearch as a way of balancing our budget. I am praying for the day \nthat Dr. LaFerla or someone like him will find a way to delay the onset \nof Alzheimer's and, God willing, find a cure. If they do, the \ninvestment in the National Institutes of Health will be paid off over \nand over and over again, and human suffering will be avoided.\n  So when I hear the Republican majority leader dismiss the idea of \nfunding outside the Department of Defense, when I hear him suggest that \nthe Democrats are trying to work toward a budget solution that is fair \nto the Department of Defense and all other agencies so that we ``have \nenough money to paint our offices''--that is what he said--I am \ntroubled by that. There is much more at stake.\n  When it comes to medical research, I would hope the Senator from \nKentucky feels, as all of us do, this is not partisan at all. The \nvictims of Alzheimer's are of both political parties and people who \nnever vote. They are just across the board. We ought to be committed to \nmaking certain that medical research makes a difference and that we \nbelieve in it. I hope this amendment that is being offered to cut \nDepartment of Defense medical research is not offered, because if it \nis, I plan to come to the floor and tell the story about what that \nmedical research has meant over the last 20 years.\n  For example, the second largest investment in breast cancer research \nis in the U.S. Department of Defense. There are dramatic stories to be \ntold about what they have discovered and what they have been able to do \nin the Department of Defense. The suggestion that we should eliminate \nthis research to me is a very bad one. It does not reflect the reality \nof the fright and concern that come with a diagnosis of breast cancer.\n  I am prepared for that battle, not just on breast cancer but on all \nof the other areas of medical research in the Department of Defense, as \nwell as medical research in the National Institutes of Health. If there \nis one issue that should unite us, Democrats and Republicans, it is \nmedical research. I will tell you, the people I represent in Illinois, \nregardless of party affiliation, believe that we in both political \nparties should be making this commitment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today, the 13th time, for the \n``Waste of the Week.'' So far, we have identified waste in many areas, \nranging from the familiar, such as the duplication of government \nprograms and outrageous spending and lack of control, to the bizarre, \nsuch as the government-funded massages for New Zealand rabbits. I have \nreceived more responses on that than I have for some of the major items \nI have listed. Every once in a while, I throw in a ``Can you believe \nthey do that?''\n  To date, we have estimated nearly $67 billion of fraud, abuse, and \nwaste. This is taxpayer money. These are taxpayer dollars that are \ncoming in for programs that the Congressional Budget Office, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, and other special investigators have \nlooked at and said: Why are we spending this money in the first place? \nIt is a total waste, it is fraud, and it has been abused.\n  So we are at the level of nearly two-thirds of our goal of $100 \nbillion and moving forward.\n  And so today, I wish to talk about yet another fiscal situation we \nhave come across that is costing the taxpayers the hard-earned dollars. \nThey're sending them to Washington and they want accountability. Since \nwe are doing debate on the Defense bill this week, I thought I would \nlook at the defense issue. I will use contracting accountability as an \nexample of the need for another effort to save the taxpayers' dollars \nbecause they are being wasted.\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n  Now, it is not uncommon for every agency of the Federal Government to \nuse contractors. The Department of Defense uses contractors. They do \nnecessary work. They provide services for our troops overseas. We owe \nour troops, we owe them, given the sacrifices they are making to \nprovide those needed services in an effective and efficient way, but we \nalso owe the taxpayer clear oversight in terms of how their money is \nspent to make sure that these services that are provided, these tasks \nthat are undertaken by defense contractors as well as all Federal \ncontractors are done so in an accountable way.\n  The issue today arises out of a report by the Special Investigator \nGeneral for Afghanistan Reconstruction. That report identified a total \nof $135 million of questionable costs spent by one specific contractor \nbetween October 2011 and March 2014. He said that in most cases the \nfunds that were spent were not supported with adequate documentation or \ndid not have prior approval. In another instance, this same contractor \nalso overcharged the government by over $1 million. The government lost \nabout $37,000 in interest payments. That is a little bit of change in a \ntotal of billions of dollars being spent, but nevertheless it is not \nall that small of an amount to a number of Americans who work awfully \nhard to pay their taxes, and they want those taxes to be used wisely.\n  Again, this same contractor in three other cases violated Federal \nprocurement law in securing contracts totaling almost $5 million.\n  So here we have one contractor that has been singled out among many \nbut put in place $135 million of questionable costs, and the American \ntaxpayers have every right to know how and where their tax dollars are \nspent and particularly those tax dollars which are spent on providing \nour Armed Forces, men and women in uniform, with the necessary services \nthey need.\n  This was compounded when in 2012 headlines showed that two former \nemployees of this particular contractor, in a video, were drunk or \nunder the influence of narcotics during parties that were allegedly \nthrown ``every other day'' at the contractor's operations center in \nKabul. So to compound the problem, not only were the costs questioned, \nbut also the character and behavior of the employees were something we \ncertainly are not proud of.\n  All of this happened, as the video shows, while weapons were present. \nBonfires were also lit, and employees would often throw live ammunition \nrounds and fire extinguishers into the flames.\n  Some might say: Well, OK, that is a one-off. That is an aberration. \nThat surely doesn't happen all the time. There is a bad apple here, and \nthere are a bunch of good apples in the barrel.\n  Yes, there are contractors that are providing services to our men and \nwomen who are doing it in a responsible and legal way, but the special \ninspector for Afghanistan has also found multiple examples of similar \ntypes of waste. In fact, since its creation, the special inspector for \nAfghanistan has undertaken 324 investigations--he is a busy man--and \nhas accounted for over $571 million of misspent taxpayer dollars, and \nthis is just in Afghanistan. As you know, we have operations around the \nworld, and when we total everything, who knows what that final number \nwill be.\n  I am pleased to report that while these numbers are disturbing, there \nis also progress being made. The special investigator for Afghanistan \nwhom I have referred to has made over 200 recommendations for reforms \nand over 160 of those recommendations have been adopted by the \nDepartment of Defense in trying to help safeguard Federal dollars. So I \ndon't want to leave the impression that something isn't being done \nabout this. Nevertheless, it is important that we bring these things to \nlight so that we can put procedures in place that will prevent them \nfrom happening again.\n  Also, I am pleased that title VIII of this bill we are now debating \non this floor, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2016, directly addresses defense acquisition policy and management and \nwould make several reforms to the contracting process. So action is \nbeing taken. For instance, the bill that calls for the Department of \nDefense to establish a preference for fixed-price contracts when \ndeveloping new programs is a needed reform that is part of this \nlegislation we are debating now. Entering into fixed-price contracts \nhelps eliminate the kinds of questionable costs and cost overruns seen \nin many previous contracts.\n  We need to make sure, Congress needs to make sure, all of us need to \nmake sure that our service men and women have the support they need to \ndefend our Nation. That is why it is so frustrating when we hear about \nthese instances of contractors that are supposed to be supporting our \ntroops but instead are wasting money, whether intentionally or through \nerror or through simply misbehavior.\n  So what we have done today is add another $571 million to our \ntaxpayer savings gauge. As you can see, we are pushing toward the goal \nof $100 billion. We hope to go past that. There is no end of issues \nthat need to be addressed so that we can tell the American people that \nwe are running an efficient and effective shop in Congress and that we \nare being careful with their taxpayer dollars.\n  I look forward to returning to the floor next week for my next \ninstallment of the ``Waste of the Week.''\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, given the fact that no one has come to the \nfloor, I wish to speak on another matter. I will do so, and when other \nMembers come to the floor to speak, I will try to wrap up and save that \ntime for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3982-S3984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, last week I chaired a hearing of the Joint \nEconomic Committee entitled ``Examining the Employment Effects of the \nAffordable Care Act.'' The purpose of the hearing was to discuss how \nthe Affordable Care Act has affected the ability of Americans to earn \nand do business, particularly for small businessmen.\n  The impact of the Affordable Care Act--better known as ObamaCare--is \nparticularly important to discuss at this point this year now that the \ndelayed employer provisions are in effect and employers are feeling the \npinch. Frankly, ``pinch'' is the wrong word; they are feeling the \nhammer blow of the burdens imposed on them, both from regulatory and a \ntax standpoint that are directly affecting their ability to grow, to \nprovide jobs, and to expand their business.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law, ObamaCare, \nwill reduce the total number of hours worked by as much as 2 percent \nfrom the years 2017 to 2024.\n  People said: Two percent--is that a big deal?\n  Yes, it is a big deal. It is equal to 2.5 million full-time-\nequivalent jobs--for workers who are looking for those jobs.\n  The CBO reasoned that this would result from new taxes embedded \nthroughout the ObamaCare program--not talked about when this was \npassed. In fact, nothing was talked about that was passed in terms of \nthe way people could understand it, as acknowledged by the former head \nof the House of Representatives.\n\n  With new taxes and measures that employers will face and the \nfinancial benefits that some will be imposed, the CBO estimates a 1-\npercent reduction in total pay over the same timeframe as a result of \nObamaCare.\n  This was something that was sold to the American people without \ncredibility. All the promises that were made, some so defiantly made by \nthe President. He said: Take my word for it, period, not one penny of \nincrease in your premium cost. Keep your doctor. If you like your \ndoctor, keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, keep your \nhealth care plan. What a misrepresentation of the bill this has been.\n  I have received many stories in my office, by email, by regular mail, \nby phone calls with descriptions of the impact this law has had and the \nbroken promises that have imposed higher premiums, higher copays, \nhigher deductibles, and higher costs for the American people. So we \nanxiously\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\nawait the decision of the Supreme Court, which will be coming in \nseveral weeks or less, to see where we go.\n  I want to take this opportunity to share just one story of one \ncompany and the head of that company and what that one small company--\nproviding needed and good jobs for Hoosiers in my State--has had to \nendure under this particular law. I think this was expressed so well by \nthe head of that company. His name is Dr. Joseph Sergio, president of \nthe Sergio corporation.\n  He came before our committee, and we heard some of the most clear and \ndefined discussion of the impact, the personal impact on families and \nworkers of the ObamaCare act and what it has done to his small \nbusiness, which I think is representative of millions of small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  Dr. Sergio is a first-generation American citizen whose family \nbusiness was founded 36 years ago. His father was an Italian immigrant \nwho came to America to realize the American dream, and he did. Dr. \nSergio expanded his father's business, which includes First Response--a \nnational award-winning disaster restoration company, involved in every \nmajor hurricane and storm disaster in recent history, with awards for \ntheir performance and how effectively and efficiently they brought \nresponse to people who needed it following these disasters--and Polar \nClean--another company he has which is an environmentally friendly dry \nice blast cleaning industrial service. We talk about going green. We \ntalk about caring about our environment. This is a revolutionary way of \ncleaning any number of factories, businesses, energy companies, and so \nforth with a new environmentally friendly process.\n  Here is what Dr. Sergio said to me: ``As a small business, we have \nfelt the profound imposition of the Affordable Care Act, or as it is \nknown among many small business entrepreneurs, the Unaffordable Care \nAct.''\n  As a small business owner, Dr. Sergio said to be successful he needed \nto be able to accurately identify, forecast, and control expenses in \norder to create profits which would then be reinvested in his growing \nbusiness. That means new jobs and new opportunity. That, he said, is \nwhere the frustration with ObamaCare begins.\n  Now, look, what Dr. Sergio outlined is economics 101. It is the first \nthing you learn in an economics class or the first thing your parents \ntell you: To be successful--and I wish this applied to the Federal \nGovernment--you have to control your costs, you have to identify and \nforecast what your expenses are going to be in the future and make sure \nyou can cover those. And only when you make a profit--not just seeking \nneutrality here in the Federal Government--but only when you make a \nprofit in the business can you grow that business and put more people \nback to work.\n  ObamaCare, Dr. Sergio said, has imposed a whole set of complications \nand regulations on small business owners that obscures their ability to \ndo just that--to identify, forecast, and control expenses. This makes \nit difficult to determine profits that are needed to increase employee \nwages, expand research and development, and invest in new equipment. \nFor a company working in disaster response, all of this is important. \nOf course, all of this is important for any company.\n  Dr. Sergio said his business has been forced to make major changes to \nmeet the requirements imposed by ObamaCare. They had to drop their \nhealth care plan because it didn't meet the requirements of ObamaCare, \neven though it had been worked out between the employer and the \nemployees and they were happy with their plan.\n  As a result, his employees and the company are paying more for an \ninferior policy. He said:\n\n       Employees are now paying larger co-pays and larger \n     deductibles. Some are opting to pay the penalty rather than \n     absorb the high cost of ObamaCare.\n\n  This not only illustrates how ObamaCare affects businesses but how it \ndirectly affects families all across our Nation.\n  Small business owners are angry because ObamaCare promised to lower \ncosts for the average family by $2,500. That was another broken promise \nfrom the White House. They said it would lower costs by an average of \n$2,500. Rather, ObamaCare now has increased the price of insurance and \ndecreased the quality of affordable insurance.\n  In addition to the quality of insurance, the mandate has affected his \ncompany's growth, said Dr. Sergio. Small business owners have a limited \namount of capital to spend on their labor pool--employees. The mandates \nof ObamaCare have pushed spending over to the benefits side. This \nlimits the amount of day-to-day compensation increases a company can \nprovide.\n  This is not only demoralizing to the employee but frustrating to the \nemployer that is seeing capital going into an ObamaCare-compliant \nbenefits plan that is not benefiting their employees as well as it used \nto. So all the touting of the magnificence of this ObamaCare helping \npeople to have better insurance coverage without increasing their cost \nis a fraud. It has simply not turned out to be what it was promised to \nbe, and it doesn't benefit his employees--small business employees--as \nwell as the plans they had before, he said.\n  So this is Dr. Sergio's current dilemma. He has a history of \nproviding a strong benefits package, paying up to 50 percent of \ninsurance for employees and their dependents and now is unsure how he \ncan keep it under the new law. He testified that surpassing 50 \nemployees would now bring on more administrative costs and reporting \nrequirements, causing him to purposely stay under the 50-employee \nthreshold and utilize more part-time employees that work less than 30 \nhours per week.\n  We have heard story after story after story on this floor. I have an \nabundance of messages coming into my office simply saying I have no \nchoice other than to put my full-time employees on a part-time basis. \nAnd I have no choice of adding new employees who take me over the 50-\nemployee threshold because it puts me into all these regulations and \nimpositions by ObamaCare. So it is having a dramatic negative effect on \nemployment--on business growth--and that is where the jobs are. It is \nnot the big companies as much as it is small companies in America, and \nthey are being strangled over these regulations and taxes imposed and \nthe regulations telling them what they have put together that their \nemployees are happy with, that allow the employer to be profitable so \nthey can continue to maintain these benefits and increase wages is \nsimply out the window under ObamaCare.\n  Can we repair the damage of ObamaCare? Dr. Sergio closed his remarks \nwith this request:\n\n       Please work to undo the vast harms that ObamaCare has and \n     is causing to the middle class and start addressing the \n     essential issue of unleashing small businesses to create \n     millions of new jobs which could raise most people from being \n     at risk and into truly affordable plans.\n       As a small business entrepreneur and job creator, I urge \n     you to repeal ObamaCare, and allow for market innovation \n     within the health industry, and allow for pooling across \n     State lines, and allow small businesses freedom from \n     oppressive requirements, new taxes and fees, and increased \n     uncertainty.\n\n  I was moved by his testimony, and that is why I am standing here \ntoday, so I can put it in the Record. I was moved by his experience of \nhow ObamaCare has impacted his business decisions in a negative way, \nhow it has hurt his employees, the families of his employees, how it \nhas restricted him from expanding his business, how it has caused him \nfrom going to a profitable business, where he could do more research, \ndo more innovation, pay more, provide more benefits to his employees to \na situation where he now has to reduce those benefits, where he has to \nsit down with his employees and say, I am sorry, under the requirements \nof this new act, this is where we are as a company. We can't continue \nto give you the benefits you once had. We can't raise your wages \nbecause we are not making the profits, and it is either go out of \nbusiness or it is to try to struggle along under this new law, which is \nwhy he believes we need to change it.\n  I certainly agree with that, and I think this is backed by tens of \nmillions of businesses all across America. We can all agree with the \ngoal of ensuring access to quality care when it is needed. I don't \nthink anyone on this floor has disputed that fact. Unfortunately, a \none-size-fits-all government-run health care system is not the answer. \nWe are looking for the best workable, real-world solution for Americans \nand their health care, and we have not hit that mark. This Congress has \nfailed and this administration has failed to hit that mark.\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n  We should pursue initiatives that truly make health care an option \nfor all. Such initiatives should drive down costs by increasing \ncompetition and transparency, reforming medical malpractice, making \nhealth insurance portable, promoting pooling options for small \nbusinesses, and giving States greater flexibility in how they deliver \ntheir services.\n  Dr. Sergio should have better certainty for his business, and all \nsmall business people should have better certainty for their future. \nHis employees should have a better health care system, as should all \nAmericans. These are the goals we need to reach.\n  We should strive for a system that puts individuals squarely in \ncharge of their health care and doesn't discourage Americans from \nworking and improving their earnings. That is the American dream Dr. \nSergio's father sought to achieve when he started his business 36 years \nago. That is the dream we should pursue. Yet we are hampered in doing \nthat by the onerous regulations, taxes, and stipulations imposed by the \nhealth care law passed by one party without any input from the opposing \nparty, and famously labeled as something we would need to learn about \nafter it was passed. That was probably the most telling statement by a \nMember of Congress--in this case the former majority leader and then-\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives--about something that was \nshoved down America's throat without any bipartisan support whatsoever.\n  Now, yes, if it had been read before it was passed, we could have \navoided all of this. It could have been debated and people could have \nlooked for a bipartisan way of moving forward to provide health care \nfor the uninsured and to ensure the health care plan they imposed would \nnot have these negative effects. That is what should have happened. It \ndidn't. We now have a chance to rectify that. We have a chance to \nremedy that. We are waiting for a Supreme Court decision before we go \nforward with an alternative to what has cost us in terms of jobs and \nall the costs to small businesses in terms of their ability to grow.\n  That is a part of the American dream. We have denied that under this \nhealth care program, and I am hoping my colleagues will join us as we \nlook to address this very important issue--important not only for the \nhealth of the American public but important for the growth of our \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator will be happy to do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3984-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROMOTING UNITED STATES INTERESTS IN THE INDO-ASIA-PACIFIC REGION\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk \nabout an amendment I have filed to the National Defense Authorization \nAct, amendment No. 1708.\n  This amendment would require the President to submit a comprehensive \nstrategy within 120 days to promote U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific \nregion. This language or similar language was already placed in the \nHouse version of the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  The amendment would assure that the U.S. Government is effectively \nmarshaling resources and employing a whole-of-government approach to \nimplement an effective, multifaceted engagement policy in the Indo-\nAsia-Pacific region.\n  This region will be vital to U.S. national interests for generations \nto come, and the administration's Asia pivot or rebalance policy was \nintended to reflect that. This is something the administration has \ntalked about for years, this Asia rebalance or Asia pivot. But \ncurrently, the administration does not seem to have such a \ncomprehensive strategy or approach that seamlessly incorporates U.S. \nmilitary, diplomatic, and commercial activities to make the rebalance \nan effective policy.\n  In April of 2014, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a \nreport stating that U.S. Government agencies ``have not substantially \nprioritized their resources to increase engagement in the Asia-Pacific \nregion.'' In fact, if we look at U.S. foreign military assistance, I \nbelieve it ranks somewhere around 4 percent of spending. If we look at \nthe Bureaus, this region we are addressing, hopefully through the Asia \npivot and rebalance, receives about 1 percent or so of funding, \ndepending on how we measure it. In fact, it is last among the Bureau \nfunding.\n  Last month, at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Secretary of \nDefense Ashton Carter announced a new initiative that envisions a boost \nin U.S. military assistance over the next 5 years to enhance maritime \nsecurity efforts with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, \nand Thailand. This effort is a welcomed step forward but alone is not \nenough.\n  These initiatives cannot take place in a vacuum. Department of \nDefense efforts need to be more effectively wedded with other efforts \nof U.S. Government agencies into a coherent and comprehensive strategy \nof assistance and engagement in the region. In light of the shared \nthreats in the region, this lack of a comprehensive policy sends the \nwrong message to our allies throughout the region.\n  The amendment will ensure that Congress is a genuine partner to the \nadministration's effort to implement this important effort. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  One of the challenges we have seen going forward, of course, in the \nAsia-Pacific region is--as we talk about Asia balance, as we talk about \na pivot--our day-to-day attention seems to be more and more drawn to \nthe Middle East, rightly so. But our long-term interests lie in Asia \nand these regions that we are trying to negotiate a Trans-Pacific \nPartnership Agreement with. Hopefully, the House will pass trade \npromotion authority later this week, and we can begin to work in \nearnest on ideas that represent our commitment through the Asia pivot \nor Asia rebalance.\n  I am concerned that we have talked a lot of good talk and we have put \ntogether some fancy rhetoric and put a pretty good label on our foreign \npolicy efforts as it relates to the Asia Pacific, but what we haven't \ndone is actually followed through. While I commend Secretary Carter for \nhis efforts and commitment, we can't just stop there. We must make sure \nwe are doing everything we can to grow our opportunities in this region \nthrough an Asia pivot or Asia rebalance that truly does need \nreenergizing.\n  One of the best ways to help a rising China truly become a great \nnation is to make sure it is abiding by the norms and standards of \nacceptable international behavior. We have talked before about the \nchallenges we have--from violations of intellectual property rights and \ncyber theft. In fact, five PLA officers have been indicted. President \nObama has put forward an Executive order listing possible sanctions on \ncyber threats. We know that if we can start avoiding these kinds of bad \nbehaviors when we start engaging Asia and our neighbors and friends \nthroughout the region, the region we will be dealing with through the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership--it is my hope we can truly bring this \namendment through the National Defense Authorization Act to bring \ncoherence and clarity to the rebalance strategy we have talked about \nbut so far have not been the best in our execution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3984-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3984-S3985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COLORADO'S WESTERN SLOPE\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about what is \nhappening on Colorado's Western Slope this morning.\n  Several weeks ago, a judge in Denver, CO, ruled that a permit was \nimproperly given to a mine known as the Colowyo mine on the Western \nSlope in Northwestern Colorado. This lawsuit was brought, I think, some \n8 years after this permit was granted. Mine employees number around 220 \npeople on Colorado's Western Slope. It is critical to the region's \neconomy, and it is critical to the economy of Craig, CO. Without these \nemployees and without this mine, it will truly be an economically \ndevastating moment in Western Slope history.\n  So I hope the Department of the Interior will pay attention to the \nmultiple\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nletters they have received from our colleague Senator Bennet, from \nGovernor Hickenlooper of Colorado, who have urged this to be taken \nseriously, to be reconsidered and appealed. It would be economically \ndevastating for these communities to lose 220 jobs. I certainly hope \nthe administration is paying the serious attention to this matter that \nit deserves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words here about \nthe fact that apparently President Obama is now going to send hundreds \nmore troops to Iraq. ``The President plans to deploy hundreds,'' \naccording to the media reports, ``more American troops to western Anbar \nProvince, POLITICO has learned, to step up training for Iraqi troops \nwho'll be charged with retaking the city of Ramadi and other ground \nlost to ISIL.''\n\n       However, American troops still will not go into combat with \n     Iraqi units, to help fight ISIL directly or to call for \n     airstrikes. And defense officials continue to worry about \n     Iraqis' end of the bargain--whether Baghdad can send enough \n     recruits to take advantage of a widened American training \n     pipeline. One U.S. training center, at Al Assad Air Base in \n     western Anbar, hasn't had any Iraqi recruits to train for \n     months.\n\n  We are going to send 400 more people, maybe, to staff up their \nheadquarters. I don't know, but when we have a situation where 75 \npercent of the air combat missions over Iraq and Syria return--75 \npercent of them--without dropping a weapon, it is so reminiscent of \nanother war at another time many years ago where, under then-Secretary \nof Defense McNamara, this same kind of strategy prevailed.\n  I would remind my colleagues of the various statements that have been \nmade by President Obama and others.\n  January 27, 2014: ``Obama Likens ISIS to `J.V. Team.' ''\n  On August 7, 2014, Mr. Obama said that ``the United States had no \nintention of `being the Iraqi air force.' ''\n  September 10, 2014:\n\n       President Obama authorized a major expansion of the \n     campaign against the Islamic State, saying the United States \n     was recruiting a global coalition to ``degrade and ultimately \n     destroy'' the militants.\n\n  Unfortunately, there is still--the President said I believe the day \nbefore yesterday that ``we do not yet have a complete strategy'' for \nfighting the Islamic State and that thousands of new fighters were \nreplenishing the ranks of the militant group faster than the coalition \ncould remove them from the fight.\n  In other words, we are losing.\n  I would remind my colleagues of the news items today. The Wall Street \nJournal: ``U.S. Strategy in Lebanon Stirs Fears.''\n\n       Critics say Washington's funding cut for a program in \n     Lebanon to develop alternative Shiite political voices to \n     Hezbollah is an effort to appease Iran.\n\n  ``China military says conducted drills near Taiwan, Philippines.''\n\n       Chinese warships and aircraft on Wednesday passed through \n     Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines to hold \n     routine planned exercises in the Western Pacific.\n\n  The Hill: ``U.S. training base in Iraq hasn't seen a new recruit in \nweeks.''\n\n       The U.S. mission in Iraq has stalled at one of the five \n     coalition training sites because the central government has \n     not been sending new recruits, according to defense \n     officials.\n\n  There is an interesting one in the Wall Street Journal: ``Iraqi City \nof Mosul Transformed a Year After Islamic State Capture.''\n  I remind my colleagues of the many statements made by American \nofficials as well as Iraqis that they were going to retake the city of \nMosul very quickly.\n\n       In Islamic State's stronghold of Mosul, the extremist group \n     is working day and night to repair roads, manicure gardens \n     and refurbish hotels. Iraq's second-largest city has never \n     looked so good thanks to strict laws enforced by the Sunni \n     militants. But beneath that veneer, the group metes out \n     deadly punishments to those who don't comply with a long list \n     of prohibitions imposed over the year since it took control \n     of Mosul on June 10, 2014, according to interviews with more \n     than a dozen current and former city. . . . officials.\n       Mosul is still almost fully inhabited--a contrast to cities \n     where Iraqi and coalition forces have pushed the Islamic \n     State out.\n       Doctors, judges, and professors who defied or questioned \n     Islamic State laws have been executed, sometimes by public \n     stoning or crucifixion. Prisons are filled with people \n     awaiting their sentences from the Islamic court.\n       ``Nearly no one gets out alive,'' one of the residents \n     said.\n       Then came the attacks on minorities.\n       ``There are many things we do not consider Islamic at all, \n     like the way Christians were treated,'' said a female doctor \n     from Mosul who is pious and veiled.\n       ``All of Mosul does not accept what has happened to the \n     Christians,'' said the woman, who lives in the northern city \n     of Kirkuk. The group's attack on minorities ``was a major \n     mistake that cost them our support.''\n\n  ``Suicide bomber attacks tourist site in Luxor, four Egyptians \nwounded.''\n  ``China military conducts drills near Taiwan, Philippines.''\n  ``Al-Qaida militants in Libya attack IS after leader killed.''\n  ``China exports repression beyond its borders.''\n  ``Foreign Policy: Airstrikes Killing Thousands of Islamic State \nFighters, but It Just Recruits More.''\n\n       ``The strength of ISIS continues to grow, so they're \n     getting more in from recruits than they are losing through \n     casualties,'' said Rick Brennan, a former U.S. Army infantry \n     officer who was a civilian adviser to the U.S. military in \n     Iraq. . . . Brennan, now a senior political scientist at the \n     Rand Corp., said he was basing his opinion on intelligence \n     estimates that have been made public.\n\n  So the bragging about killing 10,000 ISIS--they forgot to mention \nthat there are more coming in than they are killing--also reminiscent \nof the days of the Vietnam war where body counts seemed to be the \ncriteria.\n  ``Islamic State keeps firm grip one year after Mosul's fall.''\n\n       Weak Iraqi forces no closer to reclaiming strategic city.\n\n  The New York Times: ``ISIS Stages Attacks in Iraq and Libya, Despite \nU.S. Airstrikes.''\n\n       Islamic State militants staged attacks near Baghdad and the \n     Libyan city of Surt on Tuesday, underscoring the group's \n     persistent strength on both fronts despite a monthlong \n     American-led air campaign against it in Syria and Iraq.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``U.S. Prepares Plan to Send Hundreds More \nTrainers to Iraq,'' as I talked about.\n  The Associated Press: ``State Dep't spokesman: Saving Iraq could take \n3-5 years.''\n  Naturally, there is no mention of Syria.\n  By the way, they said that they were developing if not a complete \nstrategy--I would like to know the incomplete part of it. I would like \nto know what strategy there is of any kind.\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``Iraqi City of Mosul Transformed a Year \nAfter Islamic State Capture.''\n  I mentioned before that ISIS stage attacks in Iraq and Libya despite \nU.S. airstrikes.\n  It goes on and on. Meanwhile, the President of the United States \nwill, according to the media reports, announce today that we will send \n400 or so more to Iraq, none of which is accompanied by a strategy, \nnone of which is accompanied by forward air controllers, so we will \ncontinue to see 75 percent of the combat missions flown return to base \nwithout having discharged their weapons since we have no one on the \nground to identify targets. This is incrementalism at its best or \nworst, depending on how you would describe it.\n  Today, I hope we will be able to take some additional amendments. We \nhave a managers' package getting prepared,\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\nand I believe Senator Reed and I are moving forward with some \namendments we can have debated and also voted on today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S3986-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I was first going to offer an amendment, \nbut both the chairman and ranking member of the committee suggested \nthat I wait until after they have had a chance to review some of the \ntechnical details. So I will speak on an amendment that I will in all \nprobability offer at a later time.\n  My amendment really goes to how we make sure we help our troops with \nthe many stresses that are in their lives. My goal is to add money to \nfunding our commissaries. This amendment, which I will offer at a later \ntime, restores $322 million in cuts to commissaries proposed by the \nDepartment of Defense. It would authorize $1.4 billion in funding--the \nsame level that is in the House National Defense Authorization Act and \nin the House Defense appropriations bill. It offsets the $322 million \nfor commissaries by reducing the Pentagon's budget in failed policies \nto buy spare parts. They have a lot of waste there, and we think we can \nfind the $322 million we need there, and that is the technical issue we \nneed to work, also known as the offset. But what is not technical is \nthe fact that we have to make sure our commissaries function at their \ncurrent level.\n  Commissaries represent one of the most significant and lasting \nbenefits for military members and their families. Commissaries have \nbeen around since 1826, giving military families the ability to shop at \na network of stores. The commissary system is simple. If you are Active \nDuty, Reserve, National Guard, or a retired member of the family, you \nhave access to 246 commissaries worldwide. They are particularly \nimportant to many of our troops overseas, and they give military \nfamilies affordable access to healthy foods.\n  The benefits of commissaries are significant. They feed those people \nwho are actually members of our military. They help military families \nstretch their budgets, and they also help provide jobs to family \nmembers in the military who work in those commissaries.\n  Our distinguished colleagues on the authorizing committee, Senator \nMcCain and Senator Jack Reed, are themselves military men. Senator \nMcCain is a graduate of the Naval Academy and Senator Jack Reed \ngraduated from West Point. They know that one of the big expenditures \nright now for our military is rising health costs. The military itself \nis looking at how to make sure they keep our troops healthy not only \nwhile they are doing their job but also how to keep them healthy so \nthat when they move on, they will be in excellent shape. The \ncommissaries do those kinds of things. They provide what grocery stores \nprovide--fresh fruits and vegetables. They provide healthy foods.\n  Also, for example, my own commissary at Fort Meade, which is part of \nthe Healthy Base Initiative, has shown people how to stretch their \ndollar more so they can get more for their family budget and also has \nactual recommendations on how to add nutrition--save money and add \nnutrition. If we want to bend the health care cost curve, while we are \nlooking at important medical research, research shows that good food \nleads to good health.\n  The other thing is this: Military members get a significant savings \nfrom commissaries. The average savings is about 30 percent on a grocery \nbill. For a family of four, that comes to over $4,000 a year. Everyone \nknows how much military families are stretched, and for our men and \nwomen who are enlisted, this is a really big deal. We need to make this \navailable for them.\n  What many people don't realize is that the commissaries not only \ncreate jobs, but 60 percent of commissary workers are spouses of men \nwho serve in the military. About 100,000 jobs are supported through \ncommissaries. The other thing the DOD wants to do is cut their hours. \nWell, if they cut their hours, that does cut jobs, but it also cuts \nopportunity.\n  When you are in the military, you work around the clock. You are not \non the clock; you work around the clock. So if you are a military \npolice officer, you could be getting off of duty late at night. If you \nare someone who repairs our helicopters or airplanes, you could be \ngetting off at night.\n  The commissary at Fort Meade serves agencies such as the National \nSecurity Agency. They essentially work a 36-hour day. They work around \nthe clock, 24 hours a day. Our commissary isn't open 24 hours a day, \nbut I can tell you it can't be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and still \nmeet the needs of our military workforce.\n  The Department of Defense wants to make the commissaries more self-\nsustaining, and we don't argue with that. We can always find \nefficiencies and look at new ways to do things. But don't cut $322 \nmillion and further cut it close to $1 billion over the next 4 years.\n  What we want to do is make sure our military families have what they \nneed. First of all, we want them to have good food. We want them to be \nable to go to these commissaries at hours that work for military \nfamilies. We also want to look at the long-range effects of bending the \nhealth care curve.\n  I am going to come back to the commissary at Fort Meade. I am very \nproud of the fact that Fort Meade is what we call a compassionate post. \nThat means if you are in the U.S. Army and you have a special needs \nchild, one of the highly desirable places to be based is at Fort Meade. \nWhy? Because Anne Arundel County has one of\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nthe best programs for special education in the State and in the \ncountry. You also have access to Kennedy Krieger, which is one of the \ninternationally iconic agencies that address the needs of children with \nnot only special needs but multiple special needs.\n  We are very happy that Fort Meade is in Maryland and that it is known \nas a compassionate post. But think of those families who have a child \nwith cerebral palsy or multiple complications that might even require \nthe child to constantly need a respirator. All of these things go on \nalong with the stress of being a military family. We can certainly keep \nthe commissaries open so that they can get the food they need for their \nfamilies and have the commissaries open during the hours that work for \nthem. This is what real life in the military is.\n  After Desert Storm, I remember when the Appropriations Committee met \nunder the leadership of Senator Byrd and Senator Ted Steven. They asked \nGeneral Schwarzkopf what he needed in an after-action report. He said: \nWe need better intelligence. And we worked really hard to upgrade to \nwhere we are. He also said: We need better food. We need better food \nfor our troops, and people need to believe their families are being \ntaken care of while they are in harm's way.\n  We ask a lot from our military, and our military families are now \nasking us: Don't cut the commissaries. Keep them open. Keep them \naffordable. Keep them available. Once we clarify the technicalities of \nthe offset, which is required, I will come back and offer my amendment, \nwhich I hope will pass the Senate with a 100-to-0 vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1569, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I modify my amendment No. 1569 by \naccepting the second-degree amendment No. 1921, offered by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title V, add the following:\n\n             TITLE XVII--CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING\n\n     SECTION 1701.

Amendment No. 1921 is rendered moot.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, turning to the underlying legislation that \nwe are debating, the Defense authorization bill, I can't think of \nanything more basic or fundamental to the Federal Government's \nresponsibility than national security and defense and to make sure we \nprovide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need in \norder to do the job they volunteered to do on our behalf. Of course, \nmany of us have commented time and again on this floor and elsewhere \nabout the increasing complexity of the threats facing our national \nsecurity and the security and peace of the world.\n  This legislation enables our troops to get the funding and the \nresources and the authorities they need in order to have success on the \nbattlefield. As we consider the current state of the world, it is clear \nwhy this bill is vital. We live in a world marked by constant dynamic \nthreats to our way of life. For example, parts of the Middle East and \nNorth Africa have been overrun by the Islamic State, and the region \ncontinues to be a hotbed of failed states and ungoverned places. If we \nhave learned anything from 9/11, it is that ungoverned spaces are a \nthreat to our national security, because that is where our adversaries \nwill organize and train and then export those threats to our homeland.\n  Despite ongoing negotiations, Iran remains an enemy of the United \nStates and continues its campaign to achieve regional domination and \nbecome a threshold nuclear State, threatening our most trusted allies \nand partners in the region. In Europe and in Asia, Russia and China \ncontinue to threaten our allies in their respective neighborhoods, \nusing a growing array of soft-power and hard-power tactics to twist \narms and to coerce our friends and allies. These new dynamic threats \ninclude cyber attacks, which have been much in the news today, \nincluding espionage and just outright theft of our intellectual \nproperty in seed corn created from the brains and ingenuity of American \nentrepreneurs and creators. Today, our courageous men and women in \nuniform are tasked with the challenge of facing these many threats and \nmany others in regions all around the world.\n  So it is astounding to me that the Democratic leader, in the face of \nthese threats and in the face of our grave responsibilities to meet \nthese challenges, would come to the floor and suggest that debating \nthis bill would be what he called a ``waste of time'' and go further to \nsay that the Democratic minority would consider filibustering this \nlegislation. It is just unbelievable.\n  This blatant disregard for our responsibilities and for our troops is \nvery troubling, particularly because this bill has historically been \none that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support. In fact, as our \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, pointed out in an op-ed he \nwrote yesterday, Congress has passed a Defense authorization bill for \n53 consecutive years--53 consecutive years--because it is a national \npriority. It should be, and it is. Up to now, this bill has been marked \nby strong bipartisan backing in the committee. The bill sailed through \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee with a bipartisan vote of 22 to 4. \nWe don't get much more bipartisan in today's Senate than that.\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nYet, with all of the support from both sides of the aisle and even with \nsuch a clearly demonstrated need as the funding and well-being of our \ntroops and their families, the President himself--the Commander in \nChief--has threatened to veto this bill--a bill that actually provides \nthe full funding levels he himself requested.\n  It is important to note--because some of our colleagues on the other \nside have said that the problem with this bill is that it doesn't spend \nenough money or that we ought to reallocate our nondefense \ndiscretionary spending to increase that, as well--that this bill \nincludes the exact same level of funding that President Obama himself \nrequested in his budget. So why in the world would the President \nthreaten to veto a bill that meets the funding levels that he himself \nidentified in his budget?\n  For some reason, instead of focusing on our most fundamental \nresponsibilities of funding the brave men and women in our Armed Forces \nand making sure they have the resources they need to keep our country \nsafe, our Commander in Chief and the minority leader are threatening to \nhold this bill hostage to extract more government spending for \nnondefense discretionary spending for organizations and agencies such \nas the Internal Revenue Service. So why in the world would we hold \nnational security spending hostage so we can spend more money on the \nIRS? It is just a complete upside-down view of our priorities.\n  So the President's lack of strategic depth or his understanding of \nour Nation's most fundamental duties is really astounding. I am \ntroubled to say this, but I think it is actually true: I think the \nPresident understands our Nation's fundamental duties very clearly. The \nproblem is that this threat to hold this bill hostage is just cynical. \nIt just uses a political tool to try to gain advantage when it comes to \nraising the caps on nondefense discretionary spending. For a President \nwho admits that he doesn't have a complete strategy to defeat the \nIslamic State, I find his comments to be irresponsible. He is \nthreatening to veto this bill to satisfy the far leftwing of his party, \nwhich doesn't believe government could ever spend too much money and \nthat government is ever big enough. The government is never big enough \nor spends enough for some of our colleagues across the aisle and some \nof the political base in the President's party.\n  Just this morning, the Washington Post reported that Senate Democrats \nhave now come up with a brand-new political strategy, and this time \nthey are going further--to threaten to block all funding bills for the \nrest of the summer, including the Defense appropriations bill, which I \nknow the majority leader is scheduling to be debated and voted on right \nafter we complete our work on this legislation. As a matter of fact, \nthe Democratic leader said this morning: ``We're headed for another \nshutdown.'' Senator Reid said: ``They did it once, they're going to do \nit again. . . . They want to wait until the fiscal year ends and then \nclose up government.''\n  It is bad enough that Democrats are threatening to filibuster the \ndefense spending bill, but now they are claiming that it is really the \nRepublicans' fault. In other words, they are saying: We are not for \nstopping the Defense authorization bill.\n  We are for funding our national responsibilities when it comes to \nnational security. But because our Democratic friends wish to hold the \nDefense authorization bill and the Defense appropriations bill hostage, \nthey somehow now are claiming that we are the ones responsible. Because \nwe won't accede to their insatiable demand for bigger government and \nmore government spending, and we won't allow them to hold our troops \nand their families and our national security hostage, we are the ones \nat fault.\n  But, today, as we know, thanks to the Washington Post, the \nfilibustering of this and other bills is just part of a political \nstrategy.\n  One point I have to acknowledge is the candor of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. If we want to know what they are planning \nto do, all we have to do is read the newspaper, because they are more \nthan happy to tell us exactly what they are going to do and what their \nplans are.\n  This is all part of a cynical political strategy to keep the Senate \nfrom working and to deny funding to our Armed Forces while bulking up \nFederal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nIRS. This is shameless, and it is hypothetical, and the American people \nwill not be fooled by it.\n  I wish to remind our colleagues across the aisle that stifling debate \nand blocking votes is a pretty lousy political strategy, as well. It is \nwhat lost them control of this Chamber last November. It is a losing \nstrategy, it is bad policy, it is cynical politics, and the American \npeople understand that. It is simply shameful that they are trying to \nuse our troops, who protect this great Nation, as some sort of leverage \nin some sort of political game.\n  I don't have to remind the Presiding Officer, who continues to serve \nhonorably in our military services, that we live in a very dangerous \nworld. Somehow, we don't pay enough attention to that until something \nreaches out and bites us or injures someone we love. Our Armed Forces \nface new and growing threats on a daily basis. Our troops deserve our \nfull attention and every resource they need as they serve and defend \nour country around the world.\n  So that is why I have come to the floor, to say: Why in the world, \nafter 53 consecutive Defense authorization bills, would the Democratic \nleader--and indeed with the complicity of the President of the United \nStates himself--say they are going to hold this Defense bill hostage \nuntil they get what they want when it comes to spending more money?\n  This bipartisan bill, which focuses squarely on the needs of our \nwarfighters and authorizes funding at the same level the President \nhimself suggested, should not be held hostage to political \ngamesmanship. So I would encourage the more sensible Members across the \naisle to focus on the troops and their families, not on the partisan \nagenda of their leadership, and pass this legislation to provide the \nfunding our troops need to continue to do their courageous work of \nkeeping our country safe.\n  One way my colleagues could play a constructive role and move this \nlegislation forward, instead of threatening to filibuster, is to work \nwith us on commonsense amendments, such as the one I have filed that is \npending on the underlying bill.\n  Under current law, the President has discretion to allow energy \nexports to vulnerable allies, our partners in Europe, and around the \nworld when it is deemed to be in our national interest. The amendment I \nhave offered in the underlying bill simply reaffirms the existing \nauthority of the President of the United States but encourages the \nPresident not to allow our adversaries, such as Vladimir Putin, to use \nenergy supplies for vulnerable countries in Europe as a weapon. It \nwould also commission a report that would allow us to get an accurate \nassessment of just how dependent our allies in the region are on those \nwho would wield their energy supply as a weapon.\n  This amendment is a commonsense measure that serves as a first step \nto addressing the requests--the pleas in some cases--of our allies and \npartners in an increasingly unpredictable world, and it doesn't change \nthe existing authority the President already has.\n  I would urge our colleagues to put down the political playbook and \nwork with us in a constructive way on the underlying legislation. This \nhas been the great tradition of the Defense authorization bill and one \nthat is being threatened by the political gamesmanship that we see \nthreatened by the Democratic leader and, indeed, even with the \ncomplicity and the fingerprints of the President of the United States.\n  We owe it and so much more to our troops, who are relying on us to \nact today. Even more than that, we have a duty to the country to make \nsure we maintain the security of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last week we learned of the latest in \nthe string of massive breaches of private information from cyber \npenetrations, this time of government personnel records held by the \nOffice of Personnel Management.\n  In its annual worldwide threat assessment, the intelligence community \nthis year ranked cyber intrusions and attacks as the No. 1 threat to \nour Nation's security. Cyber attacks and threats are also a major drag \non our economy, with the theft of billions and billions of dollars of \nintellectual property and actual money from our Nation's businesses. \nQuite simply, cyber attacks are a major and growing threat to every \naspect of our life.\n  It is with that background that Senator Burr and I began working \nearly this year on a new cyber security information-sharing bill. It is \na first-step bill, in that for sharing company to company or sharing \ncyber threat information directly with the government, a company would \nreceive liability protection and therefore feel free to have this kind \nof constructive interchange.\n  The Senate Select Intelligence Committee produced the bill in the \nlast Congress, but it didn't receive a vote. Chairman Burr and I have \nbeen determined not only to get a vote but to get a bill signed into \nlaw. It should be evident to everybody that the only way we will get \nthis done is if it is bipartisan.\n  With significant compromises on both sides, we put together the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act, a bill approved in March by our \nIntelligence Committee by an overwhelming 14-to-1 vote. That bill has \nbeen ready for Senate consideration for nearly 3 months but has not yet \nbeen brought to the floor.\n  Last week's attack underscores why such legislation is necessary.\n  The Democratic leader told me many weeks ago that this issue is too \nimportant for political wrangling, that he would not seek to block or \nslow down consideration of the bill and would work to move the bill \nquickly. So the bill is ready for floor consideration.\n  Now, a number of my colleagues would like to propose amendments--as \nis their right--and I expect I would support some of them and would \noppose some of them. The Senate should have an opportunity to fully \nconsider the bill and to receive the input of other committees with \njurisdiction in this area. Unless we do this, we won't have a \nbipartisan vote, I believe, because, like it or not, no matter how \nsimple--and I have been through two bills now--this was not an easy \nbill to draft because there are conflicts on both sides.\n  Filing the cyber security bill as an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill prompted a lot of legitimate and understandable \nconcern from both sides of the aisle. People want debate on the \nlegislation, and they want an opportunity to offer relevant amendments. \nTo do this as an amendment--when Senator Burr discussed it with me, I \nindicated I did not want to go on and make that proposal--I think is a \nmistake.\n  I very much hope that the majority leader will reconsider this path, \nand that once we have finished with the Defense authorization bill, the \nSenate can take up, consider, and hopefully approve the cyber security \nlegislation. I think if we do it any other way, we are in for real \ntrouble, and this is the product of experience. So I very much hope \nthat there can be a change in procedure and that this bill--I know our \nleader will agree--could come up directly following the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue to call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I speak today about Cotton amendment No. \n1605, addressing funding for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, the administration that safeguards our nuclear \nstockpile for the country. The Obama administration, in its budget \nearlier this year, requested approximately $50 million per year for the \nnext 5 years for the administration to be able to dismantle old or \nobsolete warheads. My amendment would simply codify President Obama's \nown budget request, limiting the administration to spend $50 million \nper year for the next 5 years on nuclear dismantlement.\n  My amendment also includes a waiver that would allow the President to \nincrease the amount of spending under certain limited conditions. This \namendment has been approved not only by the majority but also the \nminority of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I offer this amendment because of troubling statements from the Obama \nadministration about their intent to accelerate nuclear disarmament, \nhowever. Last month, Secretary of State Kerry announced at the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Review Conference that the United States would \naccelerate its dismantlement of nuclear warheads by 20 percent. Beyond \nobsolete or outdated warheads, I do not believe that is a priority. \nNuclear modernization is a priority.\n  We should not be accelerating our nuclear disarmament by up to 20 \npercent because it would send the exact wrong message to Russia, other \nadversaries, and our allies. Russia is making overt nuclear threats to \nthe United States and our allies, and we are going to accelerate our \nunilateral nuclear disarmament? That defies logic.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to call up Cotton amendment No. 1605.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object. I am \nvery concerned about this. It unnecessarily limits the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration's ability to dismantle the retired nuclear \nweapons that no longer have any role in our national defense.\n  The President's budget proposed $48 million for dismantlement, and \nthis amendment would freeze funding at that level and at specific \nfunding levels for the next 5 years. However, the Appropriations \nCommittee, just last month, provided an additional $4 million for \ndismantlement in the Energy and Water bill.\n  I am ranking member on that committee. It was approved on a \nbipartisan basis, 26 to 4. This funding is appropriate and it is \njustified. The fact is, there are currently approximately 2,400 retired \nwarheads awaiting dismantlement. The rate at which we dismantle these \nwarheads does not have anything to do with the 4,800 warheads that \nremain in the stockpile, consistent with the New START treaty.\n  This is a treaty, not an agreement. The administration has committed \naccelerating dismantlement and we should support its goals of \neliminating redundant nuclear weapons. I see no reason to imply \ncongressional disapproval for this effort and to micromanage NNSA's \nweapons activity. Modernization and dismantlement go hand in hand. NNSA \nroutinely shifts employees from weapons stockpile stewardship and \nmodernization work to dismantlement to keep the workforce fully and \nusefully engaged. It is completely unnecessary to complicate this \nprocess. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I understand that the Senator from \nCalifornia objects to my amendment. But this is the Senate. This is an \nimportant issue. We should be debating the matter. If the Senator from \nCalifornia wishes to defeat my amendment, we should call it up and make \nit pending and have a vote on it, not object to an amendment simply \nbeing brought to the floor to be debated.\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\n  Is there a reason to manage our nuclear policy? Yes, I would say \nthere is a strong reason. On many issues, the administration has shown \nitself less than forthcoming in dealing with Congress, in particular on \nnuclear policy. As we now know, the administration minimized reports of \nRussia's activities under the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty at a \ntime they were trying to pass the New START treaty in 2010.\n  I would further say this amendment simply codifies the President's \nbudget request. The Senator from California said $48 million for this \nyear. For the next 4 years after that, it is $48.3 million, $50 \nmillion, $52.4 million, $51.8 million. I will concede that, in sum, \nthat is $50.1 million per year, on average. So I am giving the \nadministration a haircut of $100,000 per year. If that is \nobjectionable, I would be happy to modify my amendment to put it at \n$50.1 million per year.\n  But this Congress should not give the President a blank check to \nengage in further unilateral nuclear disarmament at a time when \nVladimir Putin is making nuclear threats against the United States, \ninvading sovereign countries, and his missiles are shooting civilian \naircraft out of the sky in the heart of Europe.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I rise to speak on my amendment No. \n1706. This amendment addresses the contributions of the member states \nto the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in relation to their \ncommitment towards their defense budgets within their economy.\n  At the 2006 NATO summit in Riga, Latvia, which I was honored to be \nable to attend, NATO member countries committed to spend a minimum of 2 \npercent of their national income, GDP, on defense. Furthermore, at the \n2014 NATO summit in Wales, NATO member countries agreed again that \n``allies currently meeting the NATO guideline to spend a minimum of 2 \npercent of their gross domestic product on defense will aim to continue \nto do so''.\n  They went on to state that ``allies whose current proportion of GDP \nspent on defense is below this level will: halt any decline in defense \nexpenditure; aim to increase defense expenditure in real terms as GDP \ngrows; aim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade with \na view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO's \ncapability shortfall.''\n  Well, I suggest that is a pretty weak commitment, but it remains a \ncommitment. It certainly can be stretched out, and they are already \nfailing too often to meet those commitments.\n  So, in 2015, only 4 this year--only 4 out of the 28 NATO-member \ncountries, including the United States, meet the 2-percent target. That \nis 4 out of the 28.\n  Regrettably, European NATO allies averaged just 1.33 percent of their \nGDP on defense, even though NATO countries have made numerous, \nunbinding, unfulfilled agreements to spend 2 percent. The United States \ncurrently spends 3.8 percent of its GDP on defense--a large portion of \nit defending Europe.\n  So, in contrast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment data shows that European-NATO allies averaged 24 percent of \ntheir GDP on social welfare programs, contrasting to 19 percent in the \nUnited States. So they spend more in-country on their programs while we \nare spending more to defend them.\n  Unfortunately, reductions in military spending are a common theme \nacross Europe. Just 5 years ago, according to the NATO figures, \nFrance's military budget amounted to 2.4 percent of GDP. This past \nyear, it stood at 1.9 percent, and France's budget law orders no \nincreases before 2019. As for Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, it \nspends only 1.3 percent of its GDP on defense. By the way, the European \neconomy, as a whole, is as large or slightly larger than the U.S. \neconomy as a whole.\n  So in 1990, NATO's European member states spent, on average, about \n2.3 percent GDP on defense--well above today's average of 1.3. \nAmerica's share of NATO military expenditures--get this, colleagues--is \n75 percent. The U.S. share of the NATO military expenditures is 75 \npercent and has grown an additional 5 percent since 2007. This is a \nrather dramatic figure.\n  I had the privilege to be able to travel to Eastern Europe recently, \nand it was raised to us, by individuals in those countries, that they \nwere somewhat embarrassed about this. But the reality is, they are \ntaking no substantial steps to deal with it.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates--who is one of the most wise \npeople in the world, I believe, in terms of U.S. policy and \ninternational policy, served in multiple administrations over the years \nin the White House and as Secretary of Defense under President Obama \nand President Bush--in his last speech as Secretary of Defense had the \nfollowing to say on this matter:\n\n       Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European \n     defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. \n     political leaders--those for whom the Cold War was not the \n     formative experience that it was for me--may not consider the \n     return on America's investment in NATO worth the cost.\n       What I've sketched out is the real possibility for a dim, \n     if not dismal future for the transatlantic alliance. Such a \n     future is possible, but it is not inevitable. The good news \n     is that the members of NATO--individually and collectively--\n     have it well within their means to halt and reverse these \n     trends, and instead produce a very different future.\n\n  This was his last speech. He made a speech on a subject he considered \nto be extraordinarily important. It is a statement he has made \npreviously at other times, but it reflected, I think, something akin to \nWashington's Farewell Address as he raised and discussed one of the \nmost important problems facing the world today; that is, the developed \nworld, other than the United States, is not conducting itself \nfinancially in an effective way to defend themselves.\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, for decades one of the \nworld's wisest world leaders and commentators, has repeatedly \nquestioned Europe's will. It gets down to that level: To what extent is \nEurope willing to pay a modest price to maintain their security?\n  There was a book out a number of years ago, referred to as ``Of \nParadise and Power,'' and Robert Kagan's book notes that the Europeans \nare living in the paradise provided by American power.\n  So when the Russians took this aggressive step to invade the Ukraine, \na nation we have considered for admission into NATO, took Crimea and \notherwise acted in violation of international law, we announced a \nEuropean reassurance initiative, $1 billion. This $1 billion was to be \nutilized in a way that would reassure our allies and reaffirm our \ncommitment to Europe, even in the face of this dangerous and \nprovocative action by Russia.\n  Well, colleagues, after having been to Europe and Eastern Europe on a \nnumber of occasions, I would say I am getting to the point where I want \nto be reassured. I want to have confidence in Europe's commitments.\n  At this volatile time in world history, this lack of commitment on \nthe part of our European allies must end. We need to ensure that NATO \nmembers are spending at least what is needed and certainly the minimum \n2 percent of GDP they repeatedly committed to spend.\n  The dangers in this world are much closer to Europe than they are to \nthe United States, and our European allies are right to be concerned. \nThey are anxious to have our presence. The requests for more and \nnumerous military support, action from the United States, are even \nurgent in some of those countries. They want us there.\n  But, great danger arises from Europe living in an unreal comfort \nzone, living in the paradise of American power. Unless the history of \nthe world has been dramatically altered, and it has not, threats to \nEurope will remain. Who will resist the dangerous pressures on Europe? \nWill our European partners just rest on American power? That is what \nthe reality suggests is, in fact, occurring now.\n  Europeans now insist Greece must take painful financial steps for the \ngood of the European Union to be a good team player, they say.\n  I think it is right and appropriate for the United States to call on \nour NATO\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nallies to do their part for this great alliance that has done so much \nfor stability, prosperity, and peace for Europe and for the entire \nworld.\n  This amendment before the Senate has overwhelming support, I believe. \nI think it will be accepted as part of the managers' package. The call \nit makes on NATO members is the absolute minimum, I think, that can be \nexpected of them.\n  Let's consider the plain facts. The deployment of U.S. military \nforces to any nation in the world, for the purpose of defending that \nnation and a region, is an august thing. Obviously, the military might \nof the United States is unsurpassed. The United States cannot and must \nnot take these commitments lightly. The ramifications of our commitment \nto the defense of a foreign nation are significant--grave indeed.\n  This Nation has every right and a duty to our citizens to ensure that \nthose with whom we partner do their share. The idea that a small nation \ncan simply send an email to the United States calling for more forces \nwhenever they become nervous--while taking only limited steps to fund \nand defend their own country--suggests a disconnect with reality.\n  This Senate, by this amendment, is sending a clear call for NATO to \ndo more. It is not too late to maintain this alliance as the force for \ngood it has always been. But everyone on both sides of the Atlantic who \nunderstands these issues realizes we are in a precarious situation if a \nmiscalculation occurs, and miscalculations can lead to violence and \nwar.\n  So it is time to make clear the strength of our commitment to each \nother and to ensure there is no miscalculation. To do that, more is \nrequired of our NATO allies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1473\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 1473 \nthat is pending. I will be modifying it, not now but later today, in a \ntechnical way. The majority and the minority have been notified of this \nmodification, so I will be making that later, and I am going to talk \nabout the substance of the amendment.\n  This amendment is very significant in terms of our Army force \nstructure. It would limit any additional reductions the Army can make \nto Army BCTs, which have already been drastically reduced from 48 \nbrigade combat teams in 2008 to 45 in 2013, to now 33 in 2015--so in \njust 7 years, from 48 to 33. Obviously, it was a dramatic reduction.\n  This is important because brigade combat teams are a very significant \nelement of Army force structure, and many experts all across the \nspectrum would acknowledge that and would acknowledge that further \nsignificant reductions would be very dangerous.\n  To clarify, my amendment would require the Army to trim its force \nstructure. It doesn't stop that trend, but it also offers protections \nfor that primary core unit of the brigade combat team without mandating \nadditional money, additional requirements, et cetera. There is a \nserious and urgent need for Congress to act quickly so the Defense \nDepartment has the authority and support it needs to defend our Nation.\n  This specific amendment protecting those core, required brigade \ncombat teams is supported by the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States and the Association of the United States Army, the two \nkey national groups that support the direct Army and the National \nGuard.\n  Some Members may argue that we don't want to micromanage the Army and \nhow it deals with force structure. I certainly agree with that \ngenerally, but this is certainly not getting into the fine weeds. This \nis a major issue, and brigade combat teams are a major tool of their \nforce structure. Furthermore, exactly this sort of limitation has been \ndone in this bill, in the underlying bill, both with regard to the Air \nForce and with regard to the Navy.\n  The bill, as it stands on the floor coming out of committee, includes \nnumerous provisions to block the elimination of certain weapons \nsystems, such as the Air Force fighter inventory, the A-10, EC-130 \nCompass Call aircraft. So it is very similar on the Air Force side to \njustify blocking these eliminations. The chairman's report states:\n\n       The committee believes further reductions in fighter force \n     capacity, in light of ongoing and anticipated operations in \n     Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, \n     coupled with a potential delay of force withdrawals from \n     Afghanistan, poses excessive risk to the Air Force's ability \n     to execute the National Defense Strategy, causes remaining \n     fighter squadrons to deploy more frequently, and drives even \n     lower readiness rates across the combat air forces.\n\n  Exactly that same sort of rationale which is in the bill with regard \nto limitations of what the Air Force can do also applies to the Army \nand brigade combat teams.\n  In addition, the same sort of thing is already in this underlying \nbill with regard to the Navy. There is specific language blocking \ncertain further reductions of aircraft carriers--again, a major element \nof force structure; again, Congress saying: No, don't go below this \nnumber. That is not justified. That will weaken our overall capability, \nand that will weaken force structure.\n  So again on the Navy side on this bill the chairman and the committee \nhave done exactly the same thing. My amendment would simply do \nsomething very similar and equally as important and justified on the \nArmy side with regard to brigade combat teams.\n  Because of the significance of brigade combat teams to Army readiness \nand operations, because of the enormous cuts that have already been \nmade in those numbers in the last 7 years--from 48 to 33--I urge all of \nmy colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support this commonsense \namendment.\n  Again, Madam President, to underscore, I will be returning to the \nfloor sometime today to modify my amendment in a technical way. \nEveryone--certainly including the majority and minority leaders on this \nbill--has been given those modifications. They are not controversial. I \nwill simply wait for them to be on the floor to make that modification, \nwhich is within my right and purview and does not require unanimous \nconsent, and then I am very hopeful this amendment will be teed up in \nthe next group of votes, perhaps around 3:30.\n  Madam President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1921\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to say a few words about the Burr \namendment, No. 1921, which has now been made pending. I am thankful for \nthe leadership of Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein.\n  The language of this amendment, of which I am an original cosponsor, \nwas overwhelmingly approved by a 14-to-1 vote in the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence in March.\n  Implementing legislation to address a long list of cyber threats that \nhave become all too common is among my highest priorities. Earlier this \nmonth, it was the Office of Personnel Management and the Army. A few \nweeks before that, it was the Pentagon network, the White House, and \nthe State Department. Before that, it was Anthem and Sony. That is just \nto name a few.\n  I am pleased we are able to consider this amendment on the National \nDefense Authorization Act. This voluntary information sharing is \ncritical to addressing these threats and ensuring that mechanisms are \nin place to identify those responsible for costly and crippling cyber \nattacks and ultimately deterring future attacks.\n  Our current defenses are inadequate, and our overall cyber strategy \nhas failed to deter cyber adversaries from continued attacks of \nintellectual property theft and cyber espionage against the U.S. \nGovernment and American companies. This failure to develop a meaningful \ncyber deterrent strategy has increased the resolve of our adversaries \nand will continue to do so at a growing risk to our national security\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\nuntil we demonstrate that the consequences of exploiting the United \nStates through cyber greatly outweigh any perceived benefit.\n  This amendment is a crucial piece of that overall deterrent strategy, \nand it is long past time that Congress move forward on information-\nsharing legislation. This legislation--again, 14 to 1 from the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence--complements a number of critical cyber \nprovisions which are already in the bill which will ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense has the capabilities it needs to deter \naggression, defend our national security interests, and, when called \nupon, defeat our adversaries in cyber space.\n  The bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense to develop, prepare, \ncoordinate, and, when authorized by the President, conduct a military \ncyber operation in response to malicious cyber activity carried out \nagainst the United States or a U.S. person by a foreign power.\n  The bill includes a provision requiring the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct biennial exercises on responding to cyber attacks against \ncritical infrastructure. It limits $10 million in funds available to \nthe Department of Defense to provide support services to the Executive \nOffice of the President until the President submits the integrated \npolicy to deter adversaries in cyber space, which was required by the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.\n  It authorizes $200 million for a directed evaluation by the Secretary \nof Defense of the cyber vulnerabilities of every major DOD weapons \nsystem by not later than December 31, 2019.\n  It requires an independent panel on DOD war games to assess the \nability of the national mission forces of the U.S. Cyber Command to \nreliably prevent or block large-scale attacks on the United States by \nforeign powers with capabilities comparable to those expected of China, \nIran, North Korea, and Russia in years 2020 and 2025.\n  It establishes a $75 million cyber operations procurement fund for \nthe commander of U.S. Cyber Command to exercise limited acquisition \nauthorities.\n  It directs the Secretary of Defense to designate Department of \nDefense entities to be responsible for the acquisition of critical \ncyber capabilities.\n  The cyber security bill was passed through the Select Committee on \nIntelligence because that is clearly, in many respects, among the \nresponsibilities of the Select Committee on Intelligence. But I think \nit is obvious to anyone that the Department of Defense is a major \nplayer. I just outlined a number of the provisions of the bill which \nare directly overseen and related to the Department of Defense.\n  So my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to be all torqued-\nup about the fact that this cyber bill should be divorced from the \nDepartment of Defense. I know that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are very aware that just in the last few days, 4 million \nAmericans--4 million Americans--had their privacy compromised by a \ncyber attack. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has stated that \nwe are ahead in every aspect of a potential adversary except for one, \nand that is cyber. There are great threats that are now literally to \nAmerica's supremacy in space and to many other aspects of technology \nthat have been developed throughout the world and are now part of our \ndaily lives.\n  So I am not quite sure why my friends on the other side of the aisle \nshould take such exception to legislation that addresses our national \nsecurity and the threats to it, which literally every expert in America \nhas agreed is a major threat to our ability to defend the Nation.\n  So I think there are colleagues who are not on the Intelligence \nCommittee and are not familiar with the provisions of this bill. It \nclearly is not only Department of Defense-related, but it is Department \nof Defense-centric, with funds available to DOD to provide services to \nthe Executive Office of the President, $200 million, cyber \nvulnerabilities of major DOD weapons system, an independent panel on \nDOD war games, and on and on. It is Department of Defense-related, and \nit is the whole purpose of the Defense authorization bill, which is to \ndefend the Nation. To leave cyber security out of that--yes, there are \nsome provisions in the underlying bill, but this hones and refines the \nrequirements that we are badly in need of and gives the President of \nthe United States and Secretary of Defense tools to try to limit the \ndamage that is occurring as we speak.\n  I want to repeat--and to my colleague from Indiana who is a member of \nthat committee, I would ask him--4 million Americans recently were \ncompromised by cyber attack.\n  Mr. COATS. In response to my friend from Arizona----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, this is a serious breach, and there is \nmore to the story to be told. It shows the extreme position that we are \nin here as Americans, as there are those who want to take this country \ndown, those who want to invade privacy of Americans and have the \ncapabilities of breaching this. The legislation before us, and the \nreason why it is brought here now and, hopefully, will be attached to \nthe Defense bill is that this needs to be done now and not later. How \nmany breaches do we have to hear about--whether it is the private \nsector or whether it is the government sector--before this Congress and \nthis Senate will stand up and say we have the capability of preventing \nsome of these things from happening, but we need the legislative \nauthority to do it. To delay and not even allow us to go forward with \nthis puts more and more millions of Americans at risk, whether they \nwork for the government or are in private industry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And isn't it true, I would ask my colleague from Indiana, \nthat the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recently stated that in \nthe potential of our adversaries to threaten our security, we have a \ndefinite superiority in all areas except for one, which is in the issue \nof cyber security; is that correct?\n  Mr. COATS. I think that is obvious, because, clearly, while we have \nthe capability to address some of these issues, we are not allowed to \nuse the capability. This legislation gives us the opportunity to have a \ncooperative effort. Some of those who resist the use of this because \nthey think it is potentially a breach of privacy now understand that \nbreaches are occurring from outside and into the United States, by \nthose who are enemies of the state, those who are criminal groups, \nthose who are terrorist groups. While we may have the capacity to deal \nwith this, without this legislative authority we are not allowed to use \nit.\n  So what an irony--what an irony that some are saying: We can't trust \nthe government on this to help us. This is defense. This is like saying \nwe can't trust the Department of Defense, we can't trust the Army or \nthe Navy to protect us from attack because it is government-run. Now, \nthey are saying there are some operations in government here that are \npart of our defenses that can't be used until we have authority. The \nirony is that people's privacies are being breached by all of these \nattempts, and we are denying the opportunity to put the tools in place \nto stop that from happening.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my colleague again: The 4 million people \nwhose privacy was just breached--4 million Americans--what potential \ndamage is that to those individual Americans?\n  Mr. COATS. Well, we are just learning what damage this is and how it \ncan be misused in any number of ways. Some of this information is \nclassified. But I can say to my colleague from Arizona, the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, that this puts some of our people and \nsome of our systems in great peril. It is something that needs to be \naddressed now and not pushed down the line.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So it seems to me that to those 4 million Americans, we \nowe them and it is our responsibility--in fact, our urgent \nresponsibility--to try to prevent that same kind of breach from being \nperpetrated on 4 million or 8 million or 10 million more Americans. If \nthey are capable of doing it once to 4 million Americans, what is to \nkeep them from doing the same thing to millions of Americans more, if \nwe sit here idly by and do nothing on the grounds that the objection is \nthat it is not part of the Department of Defense\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\nbill, which seems to me almost ludicrous?\n  Mr. COATS. Well, since the Department of Defense is one of those \nagencies being attacked, I would certainly think this is the \nappropriate attachment to a bill for which, hopefully, we will be given \nthe opportunity by our friends across the aisle. Hopefully, we will be \nable to pass it in the Senate, move it on to the House, and get it to \nthe President so that these authorities can be in place.\n  The Senator mentioned 4 million. A company whose headquarters is in \nthe State of Indiana, Anthem insurance company, was breached--and this \nis public information--of 80 million people on their roles. That is \nalmost one-third of all Americans who have had their private \ninformation breached by a cyber attack--not to mention the threat that \ncomes from cyber attack on our critical infrastructure.\n  What if they take down the financial system of one of our major banks \nor several banks? What if they take down the financial transactions \nthat they place on Wall Street every day? What if they shut down an \nelectric power grid in the middle of February when the temperatures in \nthe Northeast are in minus-Fahrenheit temperatures or when it is 110 \ndegrees in Phoenix and you lose your power and can't turn on air \nconditioning? People will die. People will be severely impacted by \nthis. To not go forward and give authorization to use the tools to try \nto better protect American safety is not only unreasonable but is a \nvery serious thing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Indiana for his outstanding \nwork on a very difficult issue that poses a threat to every American \nand citizens throughout the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1473\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Vitter's \namendment No. 1473, which requires the Army to maintain no fewer than \n32 brigade combat teams, which are also referred to as BCTs.\n  I support this amendment because cutting the brigade combat teams is \ncutting the core of the Army's structure and their ability to perform \ntheir mission. This amendment requires the Army to maintain a brigade \ncombat team level of 32. Currently, the Army is planning on cutting \nthese to 30 and to continue cutting to a point where we will have a \nhollow force. This is a short-sighted approach to a bigger problem.\n  First, what the amendment says is that the Secretary shall give \npriority under this paragraph to be carried out as funding or \nappropriations become available.\n  Secondly, nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede the \nArmy's manning of brigade combat teams at designated levels, and it \nrequires congressional defense committees to have a report on the \ncurrent manning of each brigade combat team of the Army. It also \nensures that the Army National Guard brigade combat teams are \nmaintained at 26, and this accounts for the deactivation of two Air \nNational Guard brigade combat teams previously agreed to.\n  You may ask, Why do we need 32 brigade combat teams? At the height of \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan wars, we had 48 brigade combat teams. If we \nhave noticed, in the Middle East, it is getting worse, not better. This \nis not to say that we will commit these troops, but it will be to say \nthat we shall maintain our readiness.\n  Next, the Army's key weapon system is the brigade combat team. This \namendment protects that key weapon from those cuts.\n  Lastly, reducing brigade combat teams does not--I emphasize, does \nnot--make existing brigade combat teams more ready. It wears them out. \nIf you have fewer teams, they are deployed more often in whatever \nactivity they are deployed to, and that stretches that manpower and \nwomanpower potentially to the break.\n  Under this, with the higher level of force, there is less stress upon \nthose who are there maintaining their readiness. In total, this \namendment requires the Army to take a closer look at their strategy and \nrisk, forcing the Army to think long term instead of just cutting the \nmost crucial part of our force, which is the people, the human capital, \nour fellow citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the underlying \nbill we are talking about on the floor, which is the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  At a time of a rapidly deteriorating security environment around the \nworld, we need to modify our policies. From the violence in Iraq and \nSyria to China's aggressive land reclamation in the South China Sea to \nRussia's activities on the eastern border of Ukraine as we speak here \ntoday--all of this is going on. We live in a world that is a lot less \nsafe and less friendly to U.S. interests. Every day we see more of \nthis. Frankly, it is time for us here in the Senate to help by changing \nsome of our policy approaches to address this changing and more \ndangerous situation we see around the world.\n  I would hope we can do this on a bipartisan basis. Our differences \nwith regard to other issues tend to be more pronounced, but with regard \nto national security, normally we come together. I am concerned with \nwhat I am hearing, at least from some of the debate I have heard on the \nfloor, where it sounds as though some of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would like to actually shut down this debate and not \nhave a debate on some of these amendments and not have some votes on \nsome of these amendments and not have a vote on this bill to try to \nadjust our national security posture so that we can address these new \nchallenges around the world. It doesn't mean that everything that this \nside of the aisle wants to do would be accepted. Democrats would have \nthe chance to offer their ideas, and we would have a good debate on it, \nand they would have a say in it. We need Democrat support to get the \nlegislation done. But let's have that debate and that discussion.\n  So I hope that what I am hearing is not accurate. I hope we will be \nable to come together and continue this discussion and be able to have \nvotes on amendments and on the final bill and then be able to help, to \nthe extent we can in the Senate, to adjust our foreign policy and our \nnational security policy to address these very real threats we see \nemerging all over the world.\n  I will give an example of one that I will offer today. This is an \namendment that has to do with Ukraine. As some of my colleagues know, \nthe situation in Ukraine has deteriorated significantly in the last \nyear or so, and it has done so because Russia not only invaded Crimea \nand took that part of Ukraine but they are also now continuing their \naggression on the border of Ukraine. This is a situation that affects \nus as Americans because Ukraine is our ally. Ukraine is a country that \nhas decided to stand with us. It is time for us and the other NATO \ncountries to stand with them.\n  Our policy toward Ukraine, in my view, has been not just insufficient \nbut it has been kind of piecemeal. We haven't had a strategy to deal \nwith this issue. So what this amendment attempts to do is to take the \nlanguage that is in the underlying legislation--already in the bill the \ncommittee put together--and improve it so that, indeed, we do have a \nmore comprehensive strategy toward Ukraine. This is incredibly \nimportant not just for Ukraine but for the international order, for our \nnational security, and for our ability to help stop this aggression in \nEurope--the first, really, since World War II, where we have seen that \na country is going across another country's boundaries and actually \nviolating territorial integrity.\n  I visited Ukraine a couple of months ago in April. I got to see some \nof the conflict consequences firsthand. For those who have been to \nUkraine--a number of my colleagues have, including Senator Durbin, who \njust got back from Ukraine--I think they would all agree with me that \nUkraine is in a state of war and it is under siege. That makes it much \nmore difficult for Ukraine to do what they know they need to do, which \nis to improve their\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\neconomy, to deal with corruption, to have more transparency, to become \nmore like those countries they want to emulate--the European countries \nand the United States of America. They are attempting to do that, but \nit is difficult when they have this conflict on their border where \ntroops are being killed and civilians are being killed and where they \nhave to devote enormous amounts of time and resources.\n  Just this week I had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister \nof Ukraine and the Finance Minister, both of whom are in town. In fact, \nwe met with them yesterday as part of the Ukrainian Caucus, which I \ncofounded with Senator Durbin. I will tell my colleagues that talking \nto them, it is very troubling to hear what is happening in their \ncountry right now.\n  As some of my colleagues know, there is supposed to be a cease-fire \nin place. It came from the second of what is called the Minsk \nagreement. Whatever semblance of credibility this Minsk cease-fire had \nleft--I don't think it had much--it has now totally crumbled. Just last \nweek, combined Russian-separatist forces launched a major assault to \nthe north and southwest of the Province of Donetsk. Donetsk is one of \nthose areas also known as an oblast or a province, where there is a lot \nof Russian and Russian-separatist activity. They were focused on this \nstrategic town of Maryinka. We probably saw some of this on TV. It is \nvery troubling that once again it looks as of these separatist forces, \nbacked by Russia and Russian equipment, which are directly involved in \nthis, are beginning to push back into Ukraine again.\n  The casualty reports are still coming in, but it appears that dozens \nhave been killed or wounded in this assault, according BBC. These \nindependent news organizations are following this, and I hope all of us \nare focused on this. The U.S. intelligence in the area is not what it \nought to be, frankly, in my view, so we do need to rely on some of \nthese media sources.\n  It is very clear that in terms of this assault, they were using tanks \nand heavy multiple-launch rocket systems and over 1,000 men were \ninvolved. So clearly, this is something that is not only a serious \nmilitary exercise, but it is one that is backed by Russia, using \nRussian equipment. We have seen just how committed the Russian \nGovernment is to this--to promoting instability in that region of the \nworld. They are committed.\n  The question is whether we are committed to step up and support the \npeople of Ukraine. This is something that, in my view, the NATO forces \nand the United States should have done a long time ago--not by us \ngetting involved directly, which, frankly, that is not what they are \nasking for. They are asking for assistance and aid to be able to defend \nthemselves. They are asking for us to help them to be able to stop this \nassault by giving them just the basic weaponry they need to stop tanks, \npotentially to stop aircraft if aircraft get involved, and to be able \nto stop the invasion and to protect the territorial integrity of the \ncountry of Ukraine.\n  The President and some of his top advisers continue to stand in the \nway of meaningful U.S. and NATO action. They have told me they fear \nthat it would provoke Russia, as if deadly clashes such as the one we \nsaw last week and, in fact, yesterday--and we will continue to see \ntoday, probably, this steady stream of Russian tanks, artillery pieces, \nand soldiers into Ukraine--aren't evidence enough that NATO and \nAmerican restraint has not deescalated this conflict. In fact, I think, \nin a way, it has emboldened the Russians, and it has inflamed them. \nAgain, we are not talking about U.S. troops. What we are talking about \nis helping this country that is our ally that has turned to us through \nNATO, and we want them to be able to defend themselves.\n  The President continues to enforce this de facto embargo on any kind \nof significant weapon that Ukraine has said it needs to defend itself. \nHe does that despite an overwhelming bipartisan consensus here in this \nbody and in the House that it is time to increase this help. That would \ninclude lethal and nonlethal assistance to Ukraine. Congress has voted \nrepeatedly to do just that, most notably in the Ukrainian Freedom \nSupport Act, which was signed into law by President Obama in December. \nIt also provided the President a national security waiver so he didn't \nhave to do what we think he should do, which is to help them to defend \nthemselves. The administration continues to withhold these arms, and it \nis time for that to end.\n  There is really very little disagreement on the capabilities that \nUkraine needs. My amendment, which is amendment No. 1850, modifies and \nbuilds on the great work that Senator McCain and Senator Reed and \nothers have already done in the bill. If we look at section 1251 of the \nbill, we will see that there is already assistance being provided to \nUkraine, about $300 million. Our amendment directs the Secretary of \nDefense to spend this money in a way that all of us know is the \nappropriate way to ensure that we get the most bang for the buck and \nthat we are giving them the assistance they really need.\n  It requires the Secretary of Defense to spend this money on a number \nof critical capabilities they need to defend themselves, including \nreal-time intelligence, medium-range and long-range counter-artillery \nradars, defensive lethal assistance such as antitank weapons, UAVs, \nsecure communications, and training to develop key combat, planning, \nand support capabilities at both the small unit level and at the \nbrigade level. So it provides, frankly, less wiggle room for the \nadministration by laying out exactly what is needed, what is being \nasked for by the Ukrainian military, and what, in this Chamber and \nhaving done a lot of work in this area through our Ukrainian Caucus and \nthrough other sources, we know is necessary.\n  Half of this $300 million under our amendment would be fenced off \nuntil at least $60 million of it is spent on the important capabilities \nthe Ukrainians really need and have requested. That is the real-time \nintelligence, defensive lethal assistance, and counter-artillery \nbatteries. If the administration fails to use this money for the \npurposes specified, then they have to use it to support other nations \nfacing an increased risk of Russian aggression--countries such as \nGeorgia and Moldova.\n  The amendment also requires DOD to report on the quantity and the \ntype of security assistance being provided to Ukraine and how it \ncomplies with the purposes that are established in the legislation.\n  So the amendment helps to ensure that U.S. military assistance \nprovides the assistance that will truly have a meaningful impact on the \nground, and it gives Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself.\n  It will also finally increase the cost of Russia's aggression. At no \npoint has President Putin's decision to escalate this war been costly \nenough to force President Putin and the Russians to fundamentally \nreconsider their strategy. The annexation of Crimea, the campaign to \ndestabilize and then invade eastern Ukraine last summer and fall, and \nthe recent offensive have all happened despite a flurry of Western \nattempts to force a negotiated settlement. In fact, each temporary \ncease-fire in some senses has merely legitimized what the Russians have \ndone. When there is this flurry of diplomatic activity, it tends to \nhappen after the Russians have made gains on the ground and then it \naccepts those gains on the ground as the basis for negotiations, \ngranting the separatists and their Russian supporters moral and, I \nwould say, some legal equivalency that they simply don't deserve.\n  There is a pattern here. They seize the land, they preserve their \ngains through an internationally mediated cease-fire, and then they \nbreak that cease-fire, as they are doing right now, to seize more land \nand then use a new cease-fire to secure acceptance of their new gains. \nThis has to stop.\n  The Obama administration and some EU members have been so fixated on \nensuring that the successful implementation of the February cease-fire \nis a goal in and of itself that they have lost sight of this broader \npolicy objective that a cease-fire should be working to achieve, which \nshould be the defense of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity and support for the economic and political reforms that \nUkraine needs. Let me underscore that. It is very difficult for them to \nundertake the economic and political reforms they need with this siege \ngoing on, and that is what we need. We need them to make those reforms \nso they cannot\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\njust keep their territorial integrity but also so they become a stable, \ndemocratic, and prosperous country.\n\n  The Russian aggression in Ukraine is not going to go away or resolve \nitself simply because we wish it to. It will take a comprehensive \nstrategy, which is laid out in this amendment, and coordinated \npolitical, military, and economic actions to change the current \ndynamic. Sanctions and economic assistance for Ukraine are important, \nbut they are tools, not a strategy. Russian military action has been \nsuccessful in threatening Ukraine's stability where other attempts to \nuse economic or political means have failed. So what the Russians and \nseparatists have found is that they have tried to disrupt through \neconomic means and political means, and they haven't been successful \nthere. In fact, the Ukrainians have rejected that, including by a \nrecent election. It is no accident that their most successful tactic, \nthe military tactic, is the one the United States and the West has done \nthe least to address.\n  I have argued for months that this piecemeal, reactionary response to \nintimidation from Moscow is a recipe for failure. Instead, we have to \nhave a comprehensive, proactive strategy that strengthens NATO, deters \nRussian aggression, and gives Ukraine the political, economic, and \nmilitary support it needs to maintain its independence. We need a \nstrategy that seeks to shape the outcomes, rather than one that is \nshaped by them. Much of that leadership must come from us and the \nadministration here in the United States. Of course, this body has an \nimportant role to play, and that is what this amendment is all about.\n  Let's include funding for Ukrainian military assistance, not just in \nthis authorization bill where we are setting the policy for it, but \nlet's be sure in the spending bills that follow that we provide the \nUkrainians what they need.\n  We should pass this legislation--the underlying bill--which Chairman \nMcCain has correctly noted is critical to helping us deal with so many \nchallenges in the dangerous world we face. We should pass, again, the \ndefense spending bill that doesn't leave the men and women in uniform \nwithout the means to carry out their incredibly important mission.\n  Importantly, for today's purposes, we have to be clear about what the \nstakes are in Ukraine. Events in Ukraine are a direct and deliberate \nchallenge to the credibility of NATO itself, to the U.S.-led \ninternational order. President Putin's actions upend decades of \nestablished international norms and threaten the very foundation of \nthis system order. Confidence in America and our European allies' unity \nand commitment to upholding this system deters bad actors. It \nincentivizes other countries to play by the rules. That is what we \nwant. We want to help ensure peace, stability, and prosperity. If the \ncredibility of our commitment is in doubt, the risk of economic \ncollapse, more violence, and more instability increases. Into a void, \nchaos ensues. The Ukrainians understand this. They understand the \nimportance of this conflict well beyond their borders. I hope in the \nUnited States of America we understand it. I hope we act in a way to \nhelp the Ukrainians be able to defend themselves and counter these \nactivities on the eastern border of Ukraine.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be in a period \nof debate only until 3 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness until I conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n\n                              Highway Bill\n\n  I come to talk about something different than the pending \nlegislation--I have a number of things to say about that, a number of \namendments I am supporting, many of them bipartisan.\n  At this point, I want to talk about the crisis we are facing in terms \nof our highway bill. We now have 51 days until the highway trust fund \nis empty. For all of us, this is a terrible prospect because a lot of \nour States rely on the Federal Government for up to 85 to 90 percent of \ntheir funding. Some States rely on less. My State relies on about 50 \npercent, but it is still huge. When this trust fund goes under, we are \ngoing to be in a lot of trouble.\n  What we have seen in this particular Senate since our Republican \nfriends took over--and they are my friends--are a number of self-\ninflicted crises. Lord knows we have enough of them coming our way, we \ndon't have to invent them--but we have seen several. In the first \ncrisis we had, we were headed toward a partial shutdown of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security over an unrelated immigration issue. \nThat was ridiculous. There was a lot of angst and finally it was \nresolved.\n  The second self-inflicted crisis ended last week, and it was brought \nabout because the Republican leader didn't like the USA FREEDOM Act the \nHouse had passed overwhelmingly. As a result of his opposition, he, for \nseveral days, turned away from 57, 58, and more Senators who actually \nsupported that bill, and he brought the surveillance of terrorists to a \nscreeching halt. That wasn't what he wanted to do, but as a result of \nthat self-inflicted crisis, we had a couple of moments there where we \nwere dark. That problem luckily ended after a couple of days.\n  And now we are headed for another self-inflicted crisis, although I \nmust say, from conversations I have had, I have some hope we can avert \nthis crisis.\n  We have known about this since last December, when Democrats said: \nLet's stay in until we solve the highway trust fund. And Republicans \nsaid: Oh, no, let's just take care of it in May. Then, in May, the \nRepublicans said: Let's just take care of it in July. That is no way to \nrun a country. It is no way to run a transportation system. It is \nridiculous, and our States, as I will point out later, are starting to \ncut way back on transportation projects--highways, bridges, and transit \nsystems--because they are scared we are not going to reach agreement. \nSo, 51 days, and I am here today to talk about it.\n  I want to show you a photograph of a bridge collapse in Minneapolis, \nMN, that happened in August of 2007. This bridge collapsed because \nthere was a design flaw. It went undetected because there were not \nenough inspections made of the bridge because there wasn't enough being \nspent on ensuring that our bridges are safe.\n  To me, as I look at this, it is a metaphor for the current status of \nthe highway trust fund, which supports thousands of businesses and \nmillions of jobs and is on the verge of bankruptcy. You can see on this \nphotograph the chaos, the danger, the disaster. Even though there are \nno people you can see, you can imagine the shock that occurred from \nthis collapse.\n  Now, you might think this is an isolated incident, but I want to tell \nyou we have 61,300 bridges in the United States which have been cited \nas being structurally deficient by engineers. The fact that we don't \nhave a multiyear plan in place to fix these bridges is a shame upon our \nNation. It is a shame upon our Nation. If you had your loved one in one \nof these cars, you would know this is unacceptable.\n  My message today to both sides of the aisle and to the House and the \nSenate is simple: We cannot afford to pass yet another short-term \nextension because that doesn't give us the certainty or the funds to \nfix bridges such as these--the 61,300 bridges that need repair. The \ncontinued inaction by Congress to enact a long-term bill is a disgrace \nand we need to meet this challenge head-on.\n  Now, I have heard rumors that we are making progress, and I know we \nare in the Environment and Public Works Committee. I serve on that \ncommittee with my friend Senator Inhofe. He and I have agreed we will \ngo forward with a multiyear bill. This is wonderful. It is a little \nlate in the day--we should have done it a long time ago--but I am proud \nhe and I have agreed this is a priority. We have a date set of June 24 \nto mark up the bill. That is only about 35 days before the collapse of \nthe trust\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\nfund, but if all the other committees did their job as our committee \ndid, we would be OK. So, yes, I am encouraged, but there are three \nother committees that haven't set up dates to mark up anything, as far \nas I know. Unless a miracle occurs, I believe my Republican friends are \ngoing to ask us for yet another short-term extension.\n  Now, if you went out on the street and stopped anybody--Republican, \nDemocrat, whatever age--if you asked: Is it controversial for the \nFederal Government to fund transportation projects? They would say no.\n  Maintaining and improving our roads, bridges, and transit systems is \na necessity. It is a necessary investment in our future that was \nrecognized at our country's founding in the Constitution. That is why \nSenator Inhofe, who is one of the leading conservatives in the Senate, \nand myself, a very strong progressive Member, agree. Article I, section \n8 of the Constitution gave Congress the authority ``to establish Post \nOffices and post Roads,'' and that has continued throughout our \nNation's history.\n  Legislation authorizing Federal investment in our highways dates back \n100 years to the passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 and the \nFederal Aid Highway Act of 1921.\n  I quote one of my favorite Presidents, Dwight Eisenhower. In 1956, he \nestablished the highway trust fund to serve as the major source of \nfunding for our Nation's highway systems. This was significant because \nit was a large increase of Federal infrastructure investment. President \nEisenhower knew we needed modern, efficient transportation systems to \nensure our security. I say ``security'' because this is what President-\nelect Eisenhower said, a general and a hero from World War II: ``A \nnetwork of modern roads is as necessary to defense as it is to our \nnational economy and personal safety.''\n  He viewed a network of modern roads as a necessity to our defense. \nAnd I would add the word ``bridges,'' because you can have a convoy \ngoing over our bridges, too. So General Eisenhower and then President \nEisenhower knew how important an efficient system of roads is to our \nmilitary and national defense.\n  While serving in the Army way back in 1919, he joined a convoy of \napproximately 80 trucks and other military vehicles to cross from \nWashington, DC, to San Francisco to test the military's motor vehicles. \nThis trip took 2 months, averaging 6 miles an hour. From this \nexperience, plus his countless other experiences with the military, \nboth home and abroad, he understood how important a reliable \ntransportation system is to a First World nation.\n  Again, he said, ``A network of modern roads is as necessary to \ndefense as it is to our national economy and our personal safety.''\n  Today, our economy still relies on interconnected transportation \nsystems to move goods out of major ports of entry. I want to talk about \nmy own State because at the Port of Los Angeles, we take in about 40 \npercent of the Nation's imports. We know they go straight out onto \nthose roads and they deliver goods all over our great Nation.\n  We know there is a universal understanding that we have to maintain \nthat road system so we can move people and goods efficiently. These \nsurface transportation systems, which used to be the envy of the world, \nremain the foundation of a strong U.S. economy and enable us to compete \nin the global marketplace.\n  I hope you heard that I said our transportation system used to be the \nenvy of the world because it is no longer the envy of the world. It is \nour fault. This has to be a priority. The United States lags behind its \noverseas competitors in infrastructure investment. According to the \nmost recent World Economic Forum ranking within the past decade, the \nUnited States has fallen from 7th to 16th in the quality of our roads. \nWe are behind countries such as China, Portugal, and Oman. This is \nridiculous. The greatest Nation in the world--that is what we are--but \nwe are falling behind on our infrastructure because we do not have the \nguts to face the fact that we have to fund the highway system.\n  Why are we behind? We only spend 2 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct on infrastructure, and that is a 50-percent decline from 1960. \nSo we spend 2 percent of our gross domestic product while Europe spends \n5 percent and China spends 9 percent.\n  The Federal Government does provide, as I said, over 50 percent of \nthe capital expenditures for State highway projects nationwide, which \nmeans that all of our States and all of our local governments rely \nheavily on Federal funding to maintain and to improve their \ntransportation. However, this is just a national average.\n  (Mr. SCOTT assumed the Chair.)\n  I see my colleagues have changed places here. For South Carolina, \nSouth Carolina depends on the Federal Government for 80 percent of \ntheir highway funds and their bridge repair--80 percent. California is \n50 percent. North Dakota is 80 percent. Montana is 87 percent.\n  So what I am saying to my colleagues who I hope are somewhere \nlistening is that if we do not act to fill the highway trust fund and \nto meet this looming made-up crisis--check out your State and how much \nyou rely on Federal funds.\n  I already showed the picture of the Minnesota bridge collapse. I \nwould like to put that up again because I think the Minnesota bridge \ncollapse is a metaphor for where we are. Our whole thing is \ndiscombobulated. Our whole thing is disrupted because we do not have \nthe courage to fund the highway trust fund, which, as President \nEisenhower said all of those areas ago, is critical to our national \nsecurity.\n  I am going keep this picture up here for a minute. I want to talk \nabout our States and the bridges that are in disrepair. I hope people \nwho may be listening across the country--if you live in one of these \nStates, give a call to your Senator and ask him or her: What are you \ndoing to fill the highway trust fund?\n  For example, in Kentucky there are over 1,100 structurally deficient \nbridges--bridges that could look like this. Pennsylvania has more than \n5,000 structurally deficient bridges, which accounts for over 20 \npercent of all the bridges in their State.\n  In addition to the dangerously poor conditions of our bridges, 50 \npercent of our Nation's roads are in less than good condition. These \nroads and bridges that are no longer in good working condition span \nacross the country.\n  So I am going to show a chart that I don't think we have ever talked \nabout here. These are examples of deficient highway bridges in need of \nrepair: Alabama, I-65 bridge over U.S. 11 in Jefferson County; Arizona, \nI-17 bridge over 19th Avenue in Maricopa County; Arkansas, I-30 bridge \nover the UP Railroad in Pulaski County; California, the Golden Gate \nBridge, for goodness' sake; Colorado, the I-70 bridge in Denver; \nConnecticut, the West River Bridge in New Haven; District of Columbia, \nthe Memorial Bridge. There was a press conference right near the \nMemorial Bridge by one of my colleagues a couple of weeks ago.\n  People are getting really scared about this. The point of this is not \nto scare anybody; the point of this is to say to my colleagues that we \nare responsible.\n  You know, maybe it is me. When I was growing up, my mother and father \nsaid: If you know there is a problem, do something about it. You don't \nhave a right to turn your back and walk away.\n  I remember once when I was a county supervisor I found out that the \ncounty building we were in was earthquake-prone. Nobody talked about \nit. As soon as I found out it could collapse in an earthquake, I \nbrought it to my colleagues. I said: Colleagues, we need to do \nsomething.\n  Do you know what they said, one or two of them? Don't bring it up. We \ndon't have the money.\n  Excuse me. You have to have the money if you know the building you \nare in could collapse in an earthquake. You have to have some money if \nyou know all of these bridges are in disrepair.\n  So let's continue. Florida, the Pensacola Bay Bridge; Georgia, a \nbridge in Fulton County; Hawaii, Halona Street Bridge in Honolulu; \nIllinois, Poplar Street Bridge; Indiana, the bridge over the CSX \nRailroad; Iowa, the Centennial Bridge; Kentucky--another one--the Brent \nSpence Bridge; Louisiana, another bridge there; Maine, the Piscataqua \nRiver Bridge; Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge; Massachusetts, the \nI-95 bridge in Middlesex; Michigan, the I-75 Rogue River Bridge.\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\n  Remember, if you are hearing my voice and you are hearing your State \nmentioned, give a call to your Senator and ask him or her, whether they \nare a Democrat or Republican, what they are doing about the highway \ntrust fund because in 51 days it will go bust.\n  In Minnesota--did I mention that--the I-35 East Bridge over \nPennsylvania Avenue; Mississippi, the Vicksburg Bridge; Missouri, the \nEast Bridge over Conway Road; Nevada, the Virginia Street Bridge in \nReno; New Hampshire, the I-293 bridge in Hillsborough; New Jersey, the \nGarden State Parkway in Union County; New Mexico, the Main Street \nBridge; New York, the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  If you did not read the book ``The Great Bridge,'' you should read \nthat book by David McCullough. It is an incredible book. That bridge \nwas built so long ago. We don't want to lose the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  In North Carolina, the Greensboro Bridge; Ohio, the John Roebling \nSuspension Bridge; Oklahoma, the I-40 bridge over Crooked Oak Creek; \nOregon, the Columbia River Crossing; Pennsylvania, the Benjamin \nFranklin Bridge; Rhode Island, the viaduct in Providence; South \nCarolina, the I-85 bridge in Greenville; Texas, the I-45 bridge over \nWhite Oak Bayou; Utah, the I-15 bridge over SR-93 in Davis County; \nWashington, the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; Wisconsin, the U.S. 41 \nbridge over a river.\n  I just have to ask my friends on both sides of the aisle, if the roof \non your house is about to cave in with your children inside and you \nknow about it, would you find a way to pay for that repair or would you \nlet it collapse on your kids? The answer is obvious. Of course you are \ngoing to fix the roof on your house. You have to keep infrastructure in \ngood repair. The roof is caving in on our roads and our bridges. Lord \nhelp us if we do not act and someone else goes down in a crisis.\n  We can look at the details surrounding the I-35 bridge collapse in \nMinneapolis, MN, shown in that picture. On August 1, 2007, this eight-\nlane bridge, which is Minnesota's second busiest bridge, carrying \n140,000 vehicles every day, suddenly collapsed during rush hour, \nkilling 13 people and injuring 145 people.\n  It is critical that our Nation continue investing in our aging \ninfrastructure. Everybody knows it. Everybody knows it--Congress, \nStates, businesses, American workers. Republicans say they are for \ninfrastructure investment, but they have not acted. Happily, we are \nhaving a markup--I am excited about it--in our EPW Committee. Not one \nother committee has marked up a long-term bill.\n  The highway trust fund is an integral part of how the Federal \nGovernment provides predictable, multiyear funding to States so that \nStates can plan and construct long-term highway, bridge, and transit \nprojects; therefore, the highway trust fund should be our No. 1 \npriority. In 51 days, the fund will go bust. It will be gone. We will \nnot be able to pay all of our bills. So we have to move quickly because \notherwise we will face a transportation shutdown.\n  The law that currently authorizes our transportation program is set \nto expire on July 31, and the highway trust fund will go bankrupt \nshortly thereafter. The clock is ticking, and failure is not an option. \nSo let's put up that 51-day ticking time bomb, if you will. The highway \ntrust fund is in serious trouble, and much needed transportation \nprojects are in peril.\n  The short fund creates uncertainty, and uncertainty is terrible for \nbusiness, it is terrible for workers, and it is terrible for the \neconomy. Billions of dollars will be delayed to our States. Many \nStates, including Utah, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Wyoming, have \nalready delayed or cancelled construction projects due to the \nuncertainty in the funding.\n  We are facing a crisis, and everybody knows it. If we do not act and \nact quickly, we will see a domino effect that will be felt throughout \nour economy.\n  I don't think I have to remind people that we came out of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. I was here when we saw that \nhappen at the end of George W. Bush's term. We were losing 700,000 jobs \na month. I remember standing here on the floor of the Senate feeling \nthat the whole world was collapsing around us.\n  The recovery is taking a long time, and thank God it is moving \nforward now. Our economy, though, is still recovering, and we must have \na strong, modern, efficient transportation system to move goods and \npeople. There are some people who absolutely need transportation to get \nto work. This is not a game. Either they need their cars or they need \nto hop on a bus or a subway. And we have 51 days until the highway \ntrust fund will be empty.\n  The amount of money we need just to keep up with the demand right now \nto fix our roads and our bridges--that amount is $123 billion just to \ncatch up on the nightmare we are facing. So we not only need a 6-year \nbill, but we need one that is robust so we can start spending some \nmoney on these repairs. Millions of jobs and thousands of businesses \nare at stake here.\n  You know, it is 51 days. And I have stood in several press \nconferences with business leaders, the chamber of commerce, the AFL-\nCIO, construction workers, the concrete people, the tar people, the \ngranite people--you name it. They are united as one America in favor of \na 6-year solution. I will show you just some of the people whom I have \nstood with over time in recent days: The AFL-CIO; the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--it is hard to get them on the same page, but they are on the \nsame page and they want this fix; the U.S. Conference of Mayors; the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the \nAmerican Council of Engineering Companies; the American Highway Users \nAlliance; the American Public Transportation Association; the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders Association; the American Society of \nCivil Engineers; and the American Trucking Association.\n\n  The truckers have said to me: Senator, we are willing to pay more in \nour gas tax because we cannot continue to ride on these roads that are \nfalling apart.\n  When was the last time someone came up to you and said ``Raise my gas \ntax''? It is rare. But the truckers have asked us to do it as long as \nwe use the money to fix the road. The chamber of commerce has asked us \nto raise the gas tax 6 cents to 8 cents. I mean, this is unusual, and I \nknow there is very little support for that.\n  I have proposed numerous ways to pay for the trust fund, including a \nrefundable gas tax increase. So if you earn $100,000 or less in your \nfamily, you get back the tax increase, which is about $40 a year. So I \nthink it is worth $40 a year to know that the bridge you drive on is \nsafe, but we would make it refundable so that you would get that back \nif you are in the middle class or below.\n  I will tell you, facing a shutdown--and we are already seeing a \nshutdown in five, six, or seven States--is painful for businesses. I \nhave had business people come before me with their heads in their hands \nbecause they do this work. They build the highways. They fix the \nbridges. They build the transit systems. And they know we have not come \ntogether yet. It is a recipe for disaster.\n  What planet are we living on? All of America wants this.\n  I will continue with some more of these names. I just read some of \nthem; I will read some more: the Associated General Contractors; the \nAssociation of Equipment Manufacturers; the Association of Metropolitan \nPlanning Organizations; the International Union of Operating Engineers; \nthe Laborers' International Union of North America; the National \nAsphalt Pavement Association; the National Association of Counties; the \nNational Association of Manufacturers.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers, the Associated General \nContractors, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the \nLaborers' International Union of North America--this is all of America. \nThis isn't red. This isn't blue. This is everybody. Everybody wants us \nto fix the roads. Everybody wants us to fix the bridges.\n  We have the National Association of Truck Stop Operators; the \nNational Governors Association--the Governors are Republicans and \nDemocrats, and they are begging us to get our act in gear and get this \ndone; the National League of Cities, and finally, the National Ready \nMixed Concrete Association; the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel \nAssociation; the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association;\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\nthe Portland Cement Association; and the Retail Industry Leaders \nAssociation.\n  The list I read is a partial list. The list that I read, frankly, is \nmostly Republican-leaning organizations.\n  Why have we not done our job? Why don't we already have a long-term \ntransportation bill before us before the fund goes bust in 51 days? \nWhy?\n  It is Congress's responsibility to act quickly to address our \nNation's infrastructure needs. Every day that the Republicans fail to \nmove forward with a bill, they are putting people at risk. This isn't \nabout philosophy. This is about bread and butter. This is about getting \nto work safely. This is about driving with your family and not being \nfearful that the bridge you are on is going to fail.\n  I am always asked: Well, Senator, that is all well and good, but how \nare you going to pay for this?\n  Well, I have a lot of ideas, and I will lay them out. There are many \nways to pay, and I will give just a sampling of ideas, and I will \nembrace these ideas. I will work with any Democrat or Republican on any \none of these ideas.\n  Replace existing gas and diesel fuel fees with a user fee charged at \nthe refinery based on the fuel price. In other words, do away with the \ngas tax and replace it with a refinery-based fuel fee. They did that in \nVirginia, and I think it is working well.\n  Increase existing gas and diesel fuel fees by indexing those fees to \ninflation, along with a refundable tax credit for low- and middle-\nincome families to offset those costs. So we can have a modest increase \nof 6 cents, 7 cents, 8 cents on the gas tax and make it refundable to \nfamilies earning $100,000 or less.\n  Assess a user fee on the sale of new and used vehicles. That is \nanother idea.\n  Use revenue generated from repatriation of corporate earnings \ncurrently held overseas. That is international tax reform. We have a \nlot of money sitting abroad from corporations that have parked it \nthere. They don't like the rate of their taxes. If you lower their tax, \nthat money can come home, and we can use the taxes we collect to fund \nthe highway trust fund. I have a bill on that with Senator Paul. It is \nbipartisan. Join us. Join us and let's fix the problem.\n  How about this: Borrow money from the general fund, to be paid back \nfrom the stimulative effect of transportation infrastructure \ninvestments on the economy. When we make these investments, they \ngenerate so much employment and so much business that people will pay \nincome taxes because they are working. These are millions of jobs, \nthousands of businesses.\n  Another way to pay for it: Apply a new, honor-based user fee on the \nnumber of miles each individual drives each year. So when you fill out \na form to get your car registered, just tell me how many miles you \ntraveled last year, there will be a modest fee, and we can help the \ntrust fund.\n  By the way, I notice my friends want to use savings from reducing the \noverseas contingency operations account. They want to use that money. \nThey used it for the military; why not use it for saving the trust \nfund? And how about the savings of uncollected revenues owed to the \nFederal Government? If we just collected one-third of those, we would \nmeet the shortfall.\n  So, as I count these ideas, there are eight ideas that I have, and I \nam sure everybody has their own ideas. There is not a shortage of \nideas. There is a bit of shortage of courage to come out and say the \nobvious. If your roof is about to collapse on your home, it will cost \nyou something to fix it. Admit it upfront. No one is going to do it for \nfree. No one is going to fix these 60,000-plus bridges for free. No one \nis going to build new highways for free. No one is going to build new \ntransit systems for free. Grow up and pay for it. This is ridiculous.\n  I am speaking for myself. I will support any of these eight ideas or \nany combination of them. We know our country is in danger. Our people \nare in danger every day because of these structurally deficient \nbridges. If we don't do anything about it, we will be liable--maybe not \nin a court of law, but in my mind it is a moral responsibility. So I \ncan support any of these ideas. Some of them are conservative ideas, \nand some of them are liberal ideas. I don't care. I want to pay for the \nhighway trust fund.\n  The bottom line is that the only solution is a consensus-based, \nbipartisan 6-year transportation bill that will provide States and \nlocal communities with the funding and the certainty they need to build \nthese multiyear projects and modernize our infrastructure.\n  This isn't rocket science. Choose one of the options. Add one of your \nown. Do a combination of these options. Let's have the courage and the \nmoral fortitude to do what is our responsibility. We know our Nation's \ninfrastructure is deteriorating. We are responsible for it. This is one \nNation under God, and we have to act to protect our people. It is our \njob.\n  I think the clearest message was from President Eisenhower on this \nfront, and President Reagan, who stepped up to the plate. President \nReagan signed into law an increase in the gas tax. He was so proud. He \nsaid: I am proud to do this. We have to do this. Let me read his quote. \nHe signed the surface transportation bill, which did increase the gas \ntax, and he said:\n\n       Because of the prompt and bipartisan action of Congress, we \n     can now ensure for our children a special part of their \n     heritage--a network of highways and mass transit that has \n     enabled our commerce to thrive, our country to grow, and our \n     people to roam freely and easily to every corner of our land.\n\n  President Ronald Reagan. I was elected the same year he said this. I \nmean, I am giving away my age, but I was proud that my President \nunderstood this. I didn't agree with Ronald Reagan on a bunch of \nthings. He said once: ``If you have seen one tree, you have seen them \nall.'' I never agreed with that.\n  But setting all of that aside, I agree with what he said. This is \nmagnificent. Listen to this:\n\n       Because of the prompt and bipartisan action of Congress, we \n     can now ensure for our children a special part of their \n     heritage--a network of highways and mass transit that has \n     enabled our commerce to thrive, our country to grow, and our \n     people to roam freely and easily to every corner of our land.\n\n  Another person whom I really admire on this subject is Senator \nInhofe, my friend from Oklahoma, my chairman. I was his chairman for a \nfew years--I think 8--and unfortunately for me I am no longer chairman, \nI am the ranking member. But I will tell you why we will do hand-to-\nhand combat on the environment--and we did that today. When it comes to \ninfrastructure, we are very close. Do you know what he said? ``The \nconservative thing is to pass a bill instead of having the \nextensions.''\n  Anthony Foxx, our Transportation Secretary, and 11 of his \npredecessors offered an open letter to Congress expressing their \nsupport for passage of a long-term bill. Remember, this was signed by \npeople who worked for--follow me--President Johnson, President Ford, \nPresident Reagan, President George Herbert Walker Bush, President \nClinton, President George W. Bush, and President Obama. They offered an \nopen letter and said this about the current situation:\n\n       Never in our nation's history has America's transportation \n     system been on a more unsustainable course. . . . So, what \n     America needs is to break this cycle of governing crisis-to-\n     crisis, only to enact a stopgap measure at the last moment. \n     We need to make a commitment to the American people and the \n     American economy.\n\n  That is four Republican Presidents and three Democratic Presidents--\npeople from those administrations. My goodness, there is bipartisanship \neverywhere but here in this room.\n  I read the list of everybody who wants this bill, and it is very \nimpressive: labor, business--small business, large business. It is \nextraordinary.\n  A survey by the National Association of Manufacturers of its \nmembers--one of our more conservative organizations--found that 65 \npercent don't believe our infrastructure is sufficient. We know from \nthe Texas Institute study that traffic congestion in 2011 was $121 \nbillion. We are wasting so much time in traffic. The cost to truck \ngoods moving on our highway system--$27 billion in wasted time and \ndiesel fuel.\n  So I hear a lot of talk about passing a long-term bill. I am pleased \nI am hearing that talk. I say to my colleagues, I hadn't heard of that, \nand now I am starting to hear my Republican friends say maybe we can do \nit. I think we need to do it. We still have 1.4 million fewer \nconstruction jobs than we had before the recession.\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\n  The clock is ticking. Failure is not an option. Let's get going. \nLet's come together and do the right thing. Pass the highway bill.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in a quorum call.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today following on \nthe speech just delivered by Senator Boxer, who highlighted her concern \nabout a manufactured crisis--the impending expiration of the highway \nbill, which must be reauthorized by July 31. I come to speak to another \nmanufactured crisis. We have to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank by \nJune 30 or face the loss of its support for vital jobs in our economy \nthat will happen with its expiration.\n  I am a big advocate for manufacturing here in the Senate and in my \nhome State of Delaware, but I am not a big fan of manufactured crises. \nBoth of these are unneeded, self-inflicted wounds that will create \nfurther drag on our economic recovery. I think we can and should find \nways to work together across the aisle to reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank.\n  For more than 80 years, the Export-Import Bank, commonly known as Ex-\nIm, has served as a vital tool to help American companies sell their \ngoods around the world. By making loan guarantees and providing risk \ninsurance and other financial products to American firms at market \nprices, the Bank has helped to ensure that American companies and their \nworkers can compete anywhere in the world and at no cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer. I will say that again: at no cost to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  The Bank not only pays for itself, but it actually often runs a \nsurplus. Last year alone, it returned $700 million to the U.S. \nTreasury. Today, the Ex-Im Bank helps American businesses sell nearly \n$30 billion in goods every single year and supports more than 150,000 \nAmerican jobs.\n  The Bank is a government agency, however, and even though it costs \ntaxpayers nothing and has an undeniably positive impact on our economy \nand on job creation, it remains unclear if this Congress will be able \nto come together to reauthorize it by June 30 and keep it running.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues would like to close the Bank, \nand they are using arguments I think are unfounded and misguided to do \nso.\n  First, I have heard the Ex-Im Bank is somehow a government giveaway \nto large politically connected corporations. But the truth is the Bank \nhelps companies of many different sizes, large and small.\n  In my home State of Delaware, for instance, the Ex-Im Bank has helped \na company I know well--Voigt and Schweitzer, a hot-dip zinc galvanizing \ncompany. It has helped them to sell their products abroad. Voigt & \nSchweitzer has a few facilities around the United States, in addition \nto the one in New Castle, DE. At its Delaware location it provides \ngalvanizing services for a range of steel products for export. V \nisn't a huge corporation. It has just a few dozen employees in \nDelaware. It is because of Ex-Im's support that it has been able to \ncompete with other companies around the globe.\n  In fact, Ex-Im's support helped the firm's Delaware location earn the \nbusiness to galvanize literally hundreds of bridges that were \nmanufactured in Pennsylvania and being exported and sold to Africa--\nbusiness that would have likely gone to competitors overseas without \nEx-Im's help.\n  Now, Ex-Im does also help large corporations export their goods to \ncountries around the world, but that support also benefits small and \nmedium- sized businesses. For example, Boeing often receives \nsignificant support from the Ex-Im Bank, which helps it compete with \ninternational airplane manufacturers such as Airbus. I have heard \nSenators criticize this support, but the reality is it isn't just \nBoeing that benefits. This is an important point about how modern \nmanufacturing and the integration of the supply chain work.\n  When Boeing manufactures a finished airplane, it doesn't make all of \nthe plane's parts with its own factories and its own workforce. It, in \nfact, buys the vast majority of the component parts from much smaller \nmanufacturers spread throughout the United States. From the brakes on \nthe landing gear to the in-flight entertainment system, other companies \nmake those parts and sell them to Boeing for the finished product. So \nwhen Ex-Im helps Boeing export a 747, it helps sustain tens of \nthousands of jobs for American workers at other smaller companies.\n  I have seen this myself in Delaware. Although Boeing directly employs \nin Delaware just 16 people, the company supports 1,300 jobs with 52 \ndifferent Delaware companies. Let me give one example. A smallish \ncompany, Polymer Technologies, manufactures and sells thermal and \nacoustic insulation to Boeing for inclusion in their planes, which are \nthen exported through the help of Ex-Im.\n  So when Ex-Im's opponents in this Chamber argue that this is all \nabout a few big companies, that just isn't true. It also is vital to \nsustaining and supporting smaller manufacturers that are vital to our \ncommunities.\n  The next misplaced argument I have heard is that government shouldn't \nbe supporting private companies, period. They should not be, as it \nwere, picking winners and losers. But even to a supporter of the free \nmarket, the point of government is to step in where the private market \nfails to do so, and that is exactly what Ex-Im does.\n  When the Bank makes a loan to a business, it isn't replacing capital \nthat would otherwise have come from a private bank. It supplements \nprivate capital or makes a private bank more inclined to put at risk \nits own capital through provision of political risk insurance. Much of \nthe time Ex-Im serves as a lender of last resort and provides a loan \nwhere a private bank can't or won't.\n  So the Export-Import Bank isn't doing something the private sector \nshould be doing. It is picking up where the market leaves off, and in \ndoing so it helps to level the global playing field on which American \ncompanies compete.\n  The reality is that every single one of our trading partners provides \nthe same type of support for their exports as the Ex-Im Bank does for \nours. So they are picking winners. They are picking American winners on \nthe global playing field.\n  For example, as Ex-Im's chairman, Fred Hochberg, has written, ``Ex-Im \nhas given $590 billion in loans, guarantees, and insurance over its \nentire history but Chinese institutions''--Chinese export-financing \ninstitutions--``have provided an estimated $670 billion in just the \npast 2 years.''\n  In other words, China has done more in just 2 years to support the \nfinancing of their exporters than our Export-Import Bank has done in \nits entire 80-year history and at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  The bottom line is that American jobs are at stake in this debate, \nand if we fail to keep the doors open to the Export-Import Bank, we \nwill fail a lot of American workers. Every year, Ex-Im supports \nhundreds of thousands of jobs, and shuttering it will put them at risk.\n\n  In fact, as the Wall Street Journal reported just this morning, \nAmerican companies worry that global competition is ``so cutthroat,'' \nthat they would ``be forced to move manufacturing overseas'' and to \nship American manufacturing jobs out of the United States ``if the Ex-\nIm Bank isn't open.''\n  At a time when our economy is continuing to gain steam and Americans \nare going back to work--at a clip of 280,000 new jobs announced just \nlast month--we need to continue to help American companies compete in \nmarkets around the world. The Ex-Im Bank is central to our \ncompetitiveness and our continued strength at home and abroad. It is \ncritical that we act together to reauthorize it before the end of June. \nSo I urge my colleagues to join this effort to help support American \njobs, American manufacturing, and the American middle class.\n  Mr. President, for more than 20 years, the State Partnership \nProgram--or SPP--has helped the United States to build closer sustained \nrelationships with militaries and nations around the world. Although I \nwill not call it up and make it pending at this moment, I want to take \na few minutes to speak on the floor today about my amendment No. 1474 \nto the NDAA, an amendment that would significantly strengthen the State \nPartnership Program.\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\n  First established after the fall of the Soviet Union, the State \nPartnership Program was created to help countries transition their \nmilitaries from the Soviet model and enshrine the idea of civilian \ncontrol of the military through professional and personal exchanges \nwith our State National Guard units.\n  The SPP facilitates cooperation across all aspects of civil military \naffairs and, besides military relationships, encourages people-to-\npeople ties at the State level. I have personally seen the benefits of \nthis program through the participation of my home State National Guard \nin their State partnership with Trinidad and Tobago and the civilian \ncontrol that it reinforces.\n  I have also seen it in farflung parts of the globe, from Liberia to \nSenegal to Tunisia on the African continent, where three different \nState Partnership Programs are actively at work providing training and \nsupport and resources for the military of those three nations.\n  The California National Guard, for example, currently has units that \nare helping Ukraine to push back against Russian aggression in eastern \nUkraine, leveraging a deep and trusting relationship first established \nback in 1993.\n  Since its creation, the SPP has grown substantially. Today, it \nconsists of 68 partnerships between U.S. National Guard units and \nforeign countries, with the 69th, between Kentucky's National Guard and \nthe African nation of Djibouti, having just been signed. Djibouti is a \nnation that is actually the site of our only substantial military \npresence on the continent of Africa, and that State Partnership Program \nwill help to strengthen, sustain, and reinforce our ongoing and vital \nsecurity partnership with Djibouti, a nation that is sandwiched between \nSomalia and Yemen, countries currently in chaos and facing significant \nthreats from Islamic terrorism.\n  That is just one example of how the State Partnership Program helps \nleverage the resources of our National Guard.\n  Traditionally, the program has needed to be reauthorized every 2 \nyears, so I am happy this year that both the House and Senate have \nrecognized its value and have decided to work together to permanently \nreauthorize it in their respective National Defense Authorization Act. \nHowever, there are a few changes we can make that would add to making \nthe SPP more transparent, more efficient, and more effective, and that \nis what my amendment would do.\n  First, it would allow the Secretary of Defense to consolidate the \nvarious funding streams for the SPP, which right now come from over a \nhalf dozen different accounts scattered across DOD, which makes it more \ndifficult to provide meaningful congressional sight. This amendment \nwould allow the Defense Secretary to combine these funding sources into \none National Guard fund to pay for personnel, training, operations, and \nequipment.\n  Second, my amendment would allow the National Guard to determine its \ncore competencies and to help combatant commanders determine how best \nto leverage the National Guard to serve the needs of a partner country.\n  Last, my amendment would establish clear and enhanced reporting \nrequirements so we can better track the annual performance of our units \nand make modifications where needed to enhance the program's \neffectiveness.\n  Critically, this amendment would not increase the program's costs at \nall. This amendment, which is based on the State Partnership Program \nEnhancement Act and currently has 9 Republican and 12 Democratic \nSenators, including myself, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, \nSenator Pat Leahy of Vermont, and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support from a wide range of States whose National \nGuards have participated and benefited from the State Partnership \nProgram.\n  The amendment is enthusiastically supported by the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, the National Guard Bureau, and the \nAdjutants General. It would take important steps to strengthening a \nprogram that is essential to many of our international partnerships, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my Virginia colleague Senator Tim \nKaine in expressing concern over the chairman's measure to cut $1.7 \nbillion in funding from specific operations and maintenance accounts in \nan effort to streamline defense headquarters functions.\n  The Department of Defense is in the midst of implementing a 20 \npercent headquarters reduction that defense officials have planned over \ntime to ensure that consequences of the reductions are known and \nmanaged. Like my colleague, I am concerned that the chairman's proposed \nlegislation would require additional headquarters reductions, the \nresults of which have not been properly considered.\n  While I support continued efficiency gains within the Department of \nDefense, including--where merited--reducing headquarters functions, I \nbelieve that before such cuts are taken, the Department must conduct a \nthorough analysis of the best methods to streamline their organizations \nfor the most efficient staffing solutions while remaining viable and \neffective.\n  At a time when department officials are managing through enormous \nbudget pressure in an increasingly complex national security \nenvironment, I fear the Department will be forced to reduce funding to \ncritical programs.\n  Finally, the men and women who will likely bear the brunt of these \ncuts are performing the very work that Congress charged the Department \nof Defense to conduct. Even this authorization includes additional \nreports, studies, and demands for improvement in areas like program \nmanagement, personnel planning, acquisition, and sexual assault. These \nprograms require a professional cadre to conduct the required analysis \nand propose recommendations for improvement.\n  I look forward to passing a defense authorization that adequately \nsupports the Department that has been at war for nearly 15 years.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is debating the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016. Senators \nMcCain and Reed, with help from my colleagues and me on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, have worked tirelessly throughout the spring \non these important military issues. Our committee prides itself on \ntaking a bipartisan and measured approach to reforming and providing \noversight to the Department of Defense. I believe we largely succeeded \nin this endeavor, but I remain gravely concerned about the chairman's \nproposals to streamline Department of Defense Headquarters by cutting \nfunding to specific operations and maintenance, O, accounts.\n  The Department of Defense already implemented a 20 percent reduction \nof headquarters, which began this year and continues through 2019. \nPlanning for the reduction began several years ago, affording the \nDepartment adequate time to ensure compliance with various directives, \nincluding requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act that established \nthe division in roles among the service chiefs and combatant \ncommanders. I am concerned the chairman's proposed legislation this \nyear, requiring additional headquarters reductions, will force the \nDepartment of Defense to find efficiencies that will blur the lines \nbetween service and warfighting functions, undermining the bedrock \nreforms established by Goldwater-Nichols.\n  I support reducing the magnitude of these cuts, while allowing the \nDepartment to conduct a thorough analysis of the best methods to \nstreamline organizations for the most efficient staffing solutions \nwhile remaining viable and effective.\n  The chairman's specific proposed reductions are not supported by any \nreport or study. Instead, they are based on a perception of unnecessary \ngrowth based on anecdotal evidence and nebulous data-sets fueled a $1.7 \nbillion cut to several operations and maintenance accounts.\n  To the chairman's point, there has undoubtedly been a growth in \nheadquarters over the past decade. Areas that saw significant increases \ninclude cyber warfare and special operations. USCYBERCOM did not exist \na decade ago, but now has almost 6,000 employees. Special Operations \nCommand is forecasted to swell to over 70,000 by 2017, but both \nheadquarters are excluded from consideration for reduction, against the \nrequests of the DOD\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\nto leave everything on the table if forced to act on this provision.\n  The timing and magnitude of these cuts are so severe that I fear the \nDepartment will be forced to reduce funding to critical programs \nassociated with the targeted accounts. Some key programs associated \nwith these accounts include military burial honors, suicide prevention, \nradioactive waste disposal, nuclear command and control networks, \nacquisition support, veteran hiring programs, and installation fire \ndepartments. Many of these programs are tied to our Nation's commitment \nto our servicemembers and veterans and should not be subjected to such \ndrastic cuts without due consideration of the downstream effects.\n  Finally, the men and women who will likely bear the brunt of these \ncuts are performing the very work that Congress charged the Department \nof Defense to conduct. Even this authorization includes additional \nreports, studies, and demands for improvement in areas like program \nmanagement, acquisition, and sexual assault. These programs require a \nprofessional cadre to conduct the required analysis and propose \nrecommendations for improvement. Asking our workforce to bear \nadditional oversight and program management functions while cutting \ntheir funding is illogical and wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to speak this afternoon about a \ncontroversial proposal, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, \notherwise known as CISA, which was filed yesterday as an amendment to \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  I want to begin by saying to the Senate that I believe tacking this \nlegislation onto the Defense bill would, in my view, be a significant \nmistake. I expect our colleagues are going to have a wide range of \nviews about this legislation, and I hope the Senate can agree that \nbills as controversial as this one ought to be subject to public debate \nand an open-ended process, not stapled onto unrelated legislation with \nonly a modest amount of discussion.\n  This is particularly true given the issue of cyber security, which is \ngoing to have a significant impact on the security and the well-being \nof the American people and obviously the consumer rights and the \nprivacy of law-abiding Americans. Because it is designed to increase \ngovernment collection of information from private companies, I am of \nthe view that for the Senate to have this expansion of collecting so \nmuch information about the people of the United States, for it to have \nreal legitimacy in the eyes of the public, it is important to have open \ndebate, with votes on amendments from Senators who have a wide variety \nof opinions on the issue of cyber security. Trying to rush this bill \nthrough the Senate, in my view, is not going to increase public \nconfidence.\n  So let me be clear about the process and talk a bit about the \nsubstance of the legislation as well. I believe tacking it onto the \nDefense bill is a flawed process. But I think there are also \nsignificant flaws with the substance of the legislation as well. Dozens \nof independent experts agree this legislation will have serious \nconsequences and do little to make our Nation more secure at a time \nwhen cyber threats are very real. The issue of cyber threats requires \nmore than a placebo, and this legislation is a bandaid on a gaping \nwound. I believe the Senate, having the time for adequate reflection \nand amendment, can do better.\n  In beginning, I would like the Senate to know just how much \ncontroversy and concern this legislation has generated among those who \nare considered independent experts on cyber security. Shortly before \nthe Intelligence Committee, which I have been honored to serve on for \nmore than 14 years--shortly before the committee marked up this \nlegislation, a coalition of nearly 50 organizations and security \nexperts wrote to the members of the Intelligence Committee expressing \nserious concerns about the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Re Cyber Threat Information Sharing Bills\n\n                                                   April 16, 2015.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Congressman Adam Schiff,\n     Rayburn House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Congressman Michael McCaul,\n     Cannon House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Richard Burr,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Congressman Devin Nunes,\n     Longworth House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burr, Senator Feinstein, and Representatives \n     Nunes, Schiff, and McCaul: We are writing you today as \n     technologists, academics, and computer and network security \n     professionals who research, report on, and defend against \n     Internet security threats. Among us are antivirus and threat \n     signature developers, security researchers and analysts, and \n     system administrators charged with securing networks. We have \n     devoted our careers to building security technologies, and to \n     protecting networks, computers, and critical infrastructure \n     against a wide variety of even highly sophisticated attacks.\n       We do not need new legal authorities to share information \n     that helps us protect our systems from future attacks. When a \n     system is attacked, the compromise will leave a trail, and \n     investigators can collect these bread crumbs. Some of that \n     data empowers other system operators to check and see if \n     they, too, have been attacked, and also to guard against \n     being similarly attacked in the future. Generally speaking, \n     security practitioners can and do share this information with \n     each other and with the federal government while still \n     complying with our obligations under federal privacy law.\n       Significantly, threat data that security professionals use \n     to protect networks from future attacks is a far more narrow \n     category of information than those included in the bills \n     being considered by Congress, and will only rarely contain \n     private information. In those rare cases, we generally scrub \n     the data without losing the effectiveness of the threat \n     signature.\n       These are some common categories of data that we share to \n     figure out if systems have been compromised (indicators of \n     compromise, or IoCs) and to mitigate future threats:\n       Malware file names, code, and hashes\n       Objects (code) that communicate with malware\n       Compile times: data about the conversion of source code to \n     binary code\n       File size\n       File path location: where on the computer system malware \n     files are stored\n       Registry keys: configuration settings for low-level \n     operating system and applications\n       Memory process or running service information\n       Attached to this letter is an actual example of a threat \n     signature containing data that helps system administrators \n     secure their networks. You'll see that the information does \n     not contain users' private information.\n       Waiving privacy rights will not make security sharing \n     better. The more narrowly security practitioners can define \n     these IoCs and the less personal information that is in them, \n     the better. Private information about individual users is \n     often a detriment in developing threat signatures because we \n     need to be able to identify an attack no matter where it \n     comes from and no matter who the target is. Any bill that \n     allows for and results in significant sharing of personal \n     information could decrease the signal-to-noise ratio and make \n     IoCs less actionable.\n       Further, sharing users' private information creates new \n     security risks. Here are just three examples: First, any IoC \n     that contains personal information exacerbates the danger of \n     false-positives, that innocent behavior will erroneously be \n     classified as a threat. Second, distribution of private data \n     like passwords could expose our users to unauthorized access, \n     since, unfortunately, many people use the same password \n     across multiple sites. Third, private data contained in \n     personal emails or other messages can be abused by criminals \n     developing targeted phishing attacks in which they masquerade \n     as known and trusted correspondents.\n       For these reasons, we do not support any of the three \n     information sharing bills currently under consideration--the \n     Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), the Protecting \n     Cyber Networks Act (PCNA), or the National Cybersecurity \n     Protection Advancement Act of 2015. These bills permit \n     overbroad sharing far beyond the IoCs described above that \n     are necessary to respond to an attack, including all \n     ``harms'' of an attack. This excess sharing will not aid \n     cybersecurity, but would significantly harm privacy and could \n     actually undermine our ability to effectively respond to \n     threats.\n       As a general rule, when we do need to share addressing \n     information, we are sharing the addresses of servers which \n     are used to host malware, or to which a compromised computer \n     will connect for the exfiltration of data. In these cases, \n     this addressing information helps potential victims block \n     malicious incoming connections. These addresses do not belong \n     to subscribers or customers of the victims of a security \n     breach or of our clients whose systems we are helping to \n     secure. Sharing this kind of addressing is a common current \n     practice. We do not see the need for new authorities to \n     enable this sharing.\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\n       Before any information sharing bill moves further, it \n     should be improved to contain at least the following three \n     features:\n       1. Narrowly define the categories of information to be \n     shared as only those needed for securing systems against \n     future attacks;\n       2. Require firms to effectively scrub all personally \n     identifying information and other private data not necessary \n     to identify or respond to a threat; and\n       3. Not allow the shared information to be used for anything \n     other than securing systems.\n       We appreciate your interest in making our networks more \n     secure, but the legislation proposed does not materially \n     further that goal, and at the same time it puts our users' \n     privacy at risk. These bills weaken privacy law without \n     promoting security.

The signers of the letter expressed very serious concerns \nabout the legislation and were particularly concerned it would \n``significantly undermine privacy and civil liberties.'' Unfortunately, \nas the signers of the legislation will report, these concerns were not \nadequately addressed in the committee markup.\n  Shortly after the committee markup, a group of 65 technologists and \ncyber security professionals wrote to Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman \nFeinstein expressing their opposition to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    March 2, 2015.\n     Chairman Richard Burr,\n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate.\n     Vice Chairman, Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Feinstein, and Members of \n     the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: We the \n     undersigned civil society organizations, security experts, \n     and academics write to explain how the Cybersecurity \n     Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA), would significantly \n     undermine privacy and civil liberties. We now know that the \n     National Security Agency (NSA) has secretly collected the \n     personal information of millions of users, and the revelation \n     of these programs has created a strong need to rein in, \n     rather than expand, government surveillance. CISA disregards \n     the fact that information sharing can--and to be truly \n     effective, must--offer both security and robust privacy \n     protections. The legislation fails to achieve these critical \n     objectives by including:\n       Automatic NSA access to personal information shared with a \n     governmental entity;\n       Inadequate protections prior to sharing;\n       Dangerous authorization for countermeasures; and\n       Overbroad authorization for law enforcement use.\n       For the following reasons, we urge rejection of CISA in its \n     current form:\n       Automatic NSA Access to Personal Information and \n     Communications: Since the summer of 2013, NSA surveillance \n     activities, such as the telephony metadata bulk collection \n     program and the PRISM program, have raised nationwide alarm. \n     CISA ignores these objections, and requires real time \n     dissemination to military and intelligence agencies, \n     including the NSA. Congress should be working to limit the \n     NSA's overbroad authorities to conduct surveillance, rather \n     than passing a bill that would increase the NSA's access to \n     personal information and private communications.\n       Automatic sharing with NSA risks not only privacy, but also \n     effectiveness. During a recent House Intelligence Committee \n     hearing, NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers stated that sharing \n     threat indicators without filtering out personal data would \n     slow operations and negatively impact NSA's cyber defense \n     activities. Further, in the wake of revelations regarding the \n     PRISM program, major tech companies stated that they would \n     not voluntarily share users' information with the NSA. \n     Automated NSA access could thus disincentivize sharing, \n     undercutting the key goal of the legislation.\n       Inadequate Protections Prior to Sharing: CISA does not \n     effectively require private entities to strip out information \n     that identifies a specific person prior to sharing cyber \n     threat indicators with the government, a fundamental and \n     important privacy protection. While the bill requires that \n     companies ``review'' cyber threat indicators for information \n     that identifies a specific person and sometimes remove it, \n     the bill contains no standard to ensure that this review \n     effort is--at a minimum--reasonable.\n       Further, the bill requires companies to remove that \n     information only for individuals that it knows are ``not \n     directly related to a cybersecurity threat.'' This could \n     encourage companies to retain data by default, unnecessarily \n     exposing the information of innocent bystanders and victims \n     to the government, and making it available to law enforcement \n     for a myriad of investigative uses. Legislation should \n     instead require that prior to sharing, companies make at \n     least a reasonable effort to identify all personally \n     identifiable information and, unless it is necessary to \n     counter the cyber threat before sharing any indicators with \n     the government, remove it. The default should be to preserve \n     privacy, rather than to sacrifice it.\n       Dangerous Authorization for Countermeasures: CISA \n     authorizes countermeasures ``notwithstanding any law,'' \n     including the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. As \n     amended by CISA, federal law would permit companies to \n     retaliate against a perceived threat in a manner that may \n     cause significant harm, and undermine cybersecurity. CISA \n     provides that countermeasures must be ``operated on'' one's \n     own information systems, but may have off-networks effects--\n     including harmful effects to external systems--so long as the \n     countermeasures do not ``intentionally'' destroy other \n     entities' systems. Given the risks of misattribution and\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\n     escalation posed by offensive cyber activities--as well as \n     the potential for misappropriation--this is highly \n     inadvisable. CISA permits companies to recklessly deploy \n     countermeasures that damage networks belonging to innocent \n     bystanders, such as a hospital or emergency responders that \n     attackers use as proxies to hide behind, so long as the \n     deploying company does not intend that the countermeasure \n     result in harm. CISA's authorization would not only \n     inadvisably wipe away the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act's \n     current prohibition against these activities, it would be \n     dangerous to internet security.\n       Overbroad Law Enforcement Use: Law enforcement use of \n     information shared for cybersecurity purposes should be \n     limited to prosecuting specific cyber crimes identified in \n     the bill and preventing imminent loss of life or serious \n     bodily harm. CISA goes far beyond this, and permits law \n     enforcement to use information it receives for investigations \n     and prosecutions of a wide range of crimes involving any \n     level of physical force, including those that involve no \n     threat of death or significant bodily harm, as well as for \n     terrorism investigations, which have served as the basis for \n     overbroad collection programs, and any alleged violations of \n     various provisions of the Espionage Act. The lack of use \n     limitations creates yet another loophole for law enforcement \n     to conduct backdoor searches on Americans--including searches \n     of digital communications that would otherwise require law \n     enforcement to obtain a warrant based on probable cause. This \n     undermines Fourth Amendment protections and constitutional \n     principles.\n       Cybersecurity legislation should be designed to increase \n     digital hygiene and identify and remediate advanced threats, \n     not create surveillance authorities that would compromise \n     essential privacy rights, and undermine security. \n     Accordingly, we urge that the Committee not approve this bill \n     without addressing these concerns.\n       Thank you for your consideration,\n       Civil Society Organizations--Access; American-Arab Anti-\n     Discrimination Committee; American Library Association; \n     Advocacy for Principled Action in Government; American Civil \n     Liberties Union; Association of Research Libraries; Bill of \n     Rights Defense Committee; Brennan Center for Justice; Center \n     for Democracy & Technology; Center for National Security \n     Studies; Competitive Enterprise Institute; Constitutional \n     Alliance; The Constitution Project; Council on American \n     Islamic Relations; Cyber Policy Project; Defending Dissent \n     Foundation; Demand Progress; Electronic Frontier Foundation \n     Free Press Action Fund FreedomWorks; Liberty Coalition; \n     National Association of Criminal Defense; Lawyers; New \n     America's Open Technology Institute; Project on Government \n     Oversight; R Street Institute; Sunlight Foundation.\n       Security Experts and Academics--Ben Adida, Cryptographer; \n     Jacob Appelbaum, The Tor Project; Alvaro Bedoya, Center on \n     Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law; Brian Behlendorf; \n     David J Farber, University of Pennsylvania; J.

We have some of \nthe most distinguished independent experts from across the country--\nwhether Amazon or Sysco, Stanford University, Dartmouth, some of the \nleading experts in the private sector and academia--expressing real \nconcerns about this legislation and its House companion.\n  From their letter:\n\n       We appreciate your interest in making our networks more \n     secure, but the legislation proposed does not materially \n     further that goal, and at the same time it puts our users' \n     privacy at risk. These bills weaken privacy law without \n     promoting security. We urge you to reject them.\n\n  The reason I want our colleagues to be aware that these distinguished \nscientists in Silicon Valley, and literally every corner of the \ncountry, are so concerned is that the American people want both \nsecurity and liberty--and they understand the two are not mutually \nexclusive. What this distinguished group of experts has just said is \nthis ``weaken[s] privacy law without promoting security.'' I hope the \nSenate will review what these experts are saying.\n  Along the same lines, I note that the Christian Science Monitor \nrecently polled a group of more than 78 high-profile security and \nprivacy experts from across government, think tanks, and the private \nsector. With these experts, they asked if legislation along the lines \nof this bill--this bill which has been attached to the Defense \nauthorization. These experts were asked if this legislation would \nsignificantly reduce security breaches, and 87 percent said it would \nnot. Many of them noted--a concern I have noted in opposing the \nlegislation--that incentivizing private companies to share information \nabout security threats is a very worthwhile proposition, a worthwhile \nthing to do. But they go on to say that bills like this are going to \nhave limited value in that area and would have significant negative \nconsequences.\n  Now, many of my colleagues may have some disagreement with some of \nthe dozens and dozens of independent experts I have just mentioned. \nSome of them may agree with the 13 percent of those experts who said \nthis bill will do a lot to reduce security breaches. That is their \nright, and that is what a good Senate debate would be all about. But \nwhat the Senate should not do is pretend that this legislation is \nuncontroversial and try to rush it through without substantial \nrevisions and the chance for Senators on both sides of the aisle to be \nheard.\n  Now, I think we all understand why some in the Senate would feel we \nhave to move immediately on this issue and in effect be tempted to rush \nto action here. We have all understood there have been a number of \nrecent high-profile hacks that have drawn attention to the need to \nimprove our Nation's cyber security--and I don't disagree with the \nimportance of that at all.\n  For example, a major company in Oregon was hacked by the Chinese \nsimply because they were trying to enforce their rights under trade \nlaw.\n  So this is not some abstract issue for the people I represent. We \nhave seen it in my home State.\n  So these high-profile hacks, like the one we saw here recently, is \nobviously drawing attention to the need to improve cyber security. The \nrecent compromise of a very large amount of Office of Personnel \nManagement data is obviously the latest of these, but it is certainly \nnot going to be the last.\n  Every single time I read about these kind of hacks, what I do is--and \nI have a very talented staff from the Intelligence Committee and my own \noffice to assist me--I try to reach out and talk to experts in the \nfield about ways to improve cyber security. But that doesn't mean every \nsingle piece of legislation with the word ``cyber security'' in it is \nautomatically a good idea that ought to be blessed without revision in \nthe Senate.\n  The fact is, this particular cyber security bill is largely focused \non trying to make it more difficult for individuals to be able to take \non corporations. I understand why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce likes it \nso much. They have always been concerned about the rights of the large \ncorporations. Sometimes the inevitable is, well, we are concerned about \nthe large corporations, let's make it harder for individuals to be able \nto get a fair shake in the marketplace. But in my judgment, the actual \ncyber security value of this bill would be very limited, and the \nconsequences for those individuals who are trying to get a fair shake \nwould be quite serious.\n  I am going to turn in a moment to the substance of the CISA bill to \nexplain why I consider it so problematic and why it needs a major \nrevision. But first I am going to take just a few minutes to discuss \nproposals that I believe would actually make a difference in terms of \nimproving American cyber security.\n  First, the most effective way to improve cyber security is to ensure \nthat network owners take responsibility for the security of their \nnetworks and effectively implement good security practices. This \nproposal was the centerpiece of a 2012 bill called the Lieberman-\nCollins cyber security bill, and in my view that legislation was just a \nfew changes away from being good cyber security law. Unfortunately, the \nnotion of having the government create even voluntary standards for \nprivate companies was strongly opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nand the Congress has not revisited it since.\n  Beyond ensuring that network owners take responsibility and implement \ngood security practices, it is also important to ensure that government \nagencies do not deliberately weaken security standards.\n  I know the Presiding Officer in the Senate has a great interest, as I \ndo, in\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\ninnovation and American competitiveness. It is pretty hard--when we say \nthe words: The American Government is actually thinking, as the FBI \nDirector has talked about, about requiring companies to build \nweaknesses into their products--it is pretty hard to get your arms \naround this theory, not the least of which is the reason that once the \ngood guys have the keys, the bad guys will also have the keys, which \nwill facilitate cyber hacking.\n\n  I have been skeptical of these statements from senior FBI officials \nsuggesting that U.S. hardware and software companies should be \nrequired, as I would characterize it, to weaken the security of their \nproducts because encryption and other advanced security measures are a \nkey part, a key compound of actually improving cyber security.\n  I was pleased to see that in the other body, just last week, a new \namendment from Representatives Massie and Lofgren to prevent the \ngovernment from deliberately weakening encryption standards was voted \non, and I am very hopeful the Senate will eventually follow suit. In \nfact, I offered that concept in the Intelligence Committee, and \nregrettably it did not pass.\n  With regard to government-held data, it is absolutely imperative that \nFederal agencies receive the funding and expertise they need to develop \nand implement strong network security programs and to ensure that they \nhave the technical and administrative controls in place to combat a \nwide range of cyber security threats.\n  I also believe our government needs to be in a stronger position to \nrecruit and retain a capable Federal cyber security workforce by \nensuring that cyber security professionals can find opportunities in \ngovernment that are as rewarding as those in the private sector. In \norder to ensure that there are enough professionals to fill positions \nin both the private sector and the government, it is obvious that there \nis going to need to be an investment in the education of the next \ngeneration of cyber security leaders.\n  As we talk about responsible approaches to deal with these cyber \nissues, I would like to note that I consider the Consumer Privacy \nProtection Act--a piece of legislation initiated by Senator Leahy--to \nbe another step in the right direction. This legislation creates a \ncomprehensive approach to data security by requiring companies to build \na cyber security program that can defend against cyber attacks and \nprevent data breaches. It also protects a wide range of personal \ninformation, not just name or financial account information but also \nonline user names and passwords, information about a person's \ngeolocation, and access to private digital photographs and videos.\n  Unlike CISA, this legislation would, in my view, provide real tools \nto address the kinds of recent cyber attacks we have seen in the news, \nsuch as the celebrity photo hack. Unlike CISA, it would also empower \nindividuals by requiring companies to notify consumers if their \ninformation has been lost and would protect the rights offered under \nsome State laws for consumers to sue in the event of a privacy \nincident. The Consumer Privacy Protection Act is the right kind of \nresponsible, thoughtful approach to cyber security, which is \nlegislation that will help us get an added measure of security and \npublic protection, while at the same time protecting the individual \nliberties and the privacy of our people.\n  Finally, in my judgment, our country needs to be willing to impose \nconsequences on foreign entities that attempt to hack into American \nnetworks and steal large quantities of valuable data. These hacks are \nundermining our national security, our economic competitiveness, and \nthe personal privacy of huge numbers of Americans. These consequences \nshould draw on the full range of American power, depending on the \nnature of the hack and the entity responsible.\n  It would be a failure of American imagination to say that the only \nway to respond to foreign hacking is to have our military and \nintelligence agencies ``hack back,'' as the concept has been known, at \nthe parties responsible. We are the most powerful country in the world, \nand our government has a wide variety of tools at its disposal, \nincluding economic sanctions, law enforcement, and multilateral \ndiplomacy. And building a multifaceted strategy to deter foreign \nhacking is going to require all of those kinds of tools I have \nmentioned by way of articulating responsible steps to deal with cyber \nsecurity, steps that protect both our security and liberty. All of \nthose tools are ones we will have to draw on.\n  Having laid out ways that the Senate on a bipartisan basis can \nimprove cyber security, I want to turn to the proposal in detail that \nis now in front of the Senate. As I have said, I believe it makes sense \nto encourage private companies to share information about cyber \nsecurity threats. Cyber is a problem. Sharing information can be \nuseful, but it is also vital that information sharing not be bereft of \nprivacy protections for law-abiding Americans.\n  Cyber security is a problem. Information sharing is a plus. But let's \nmake no mistake about it--an information-sharing bill that lacks \nprivacy protections really is not a cyber security bill; it is a \nsurveillance bill. That is what has been one of my major concerns about \nthis legislation, that the legislation in front of the Senate--we \ntalked about the flaws in the process, but substantively, if you have \nan information-sharing bill that lacks adequate privacy protections, it \nis a surveillance bill by another name.\n  When the Senate Intelligence Committee voted on the CISA bill, I \nopposed it. I opposed it because I believe its insufficient privacy \nprotections will lead to large volumes of Americans' personal \ninformation, personal information from law-abiding Americans who have \ndone nothing wrong--that they will be faced with the prospect that \ntheir information is shared with the government even when that \ninformation is not needed for cyber security. When I say ``personal \ninformation,'' I am talking about the contents of emails, financial \ninformation, and what amounts to any data at all that is stored \nelectronically.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have stressed that companies will have a choice \nabout whether to participate in this information-sharing part of the \nlegislation. That is true, but while corporations will have a choice \nabout whether to participate, they will be able to do so without the \nknowledge or consent of their customers, and they will receive broad \nliability protections when they do so. The CISA bill as written trumps \nall Federal privacy laws.\n  Furthermore, once this information is shared with the government, \ngovernment agencies will be permitted to use it for a wide variety of \npurposes unrelated to cyber security. The bill creates what I consider \nto be a double standard--really a bizarre double standard in that \nprivate information that is shared about individuals can be used for a \nvariety of non-cyber security purposes, including law enforcement \naction against these individuals, but information about the companies \nsupplying that information generally may not be used to police those \ncompanies.\n  I will tell you, I think that will be pretty hard to explain at a \ntownhall meeting in virtually any corner of America because I believe \nit is wrong to say that the privacy rights of corporations matter more \nthan the privacy rights of individual Americans.\n  I expect that some colleagues will say that it is not their intent to \nauthorize this excessively broad collection. The argument will be that \nthis is legislation to encourage companies to share information about \nactual cyber security threats, such as lines of malicious code and \nsignatures of hostile cyber actors. Again, I would say to colleagues \nthat I am all for encouraging companies to share information about \ngenuine security threats, but if you read the language that is now \nbefore the Senate in the cyber security bill, the language of that bill \nis much broader than just sharing information about genuine security \nthreats.\n  If Senators want to pass a bill that is focused on real cyber \nsecurity threats and includes real protection for Americans' privacy, \nthen the Senate should add language specifying that companies should \nonly provide the government with individuals' personal information if \nit is necessary to describe a cyber security threat. That does not seem \nto me to be an unreasonable protection for the privacy of Americans, \nthat the Senate would adopt language specifying that the companies \nprovide the government with individuals' personal information if it is \nnecessary to\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\ndescribe a cyber threat. That is pretty obvious.\n  We can explain that, I would say to the distinguished President of \nthe Senate, at a townhall meeting, that if it is related to a cyber \nsecurity threat, then the companies would provide individuals' personal \ninformation. But this would discourage companies from unnecessarily \nsharing large amounts of their customers' private information with the \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, the cyber security bill in front of the Senate now \ntakes the opposite approach. It only requires companies to withhold \ninformation that is known at the time of sharing to be personal \ninformation unrelated to cyber security. This approach will clearly \ndiscourage companies from closely reviewing the information that they \nshare and will lead to a much greater amount of Americans' personal \ninformation being transferred needlessly to government agencies.\n  I hope that here in the Senate there will be an opportunity to \ncarefully consider the potential consequences of this legislation \nbefore voting to rush it through by an expedited process.\n  I have said here several times that cyber security is a real problem, \nand policymakers are going to have to deal with it. In fact, I will go \nso far as to say that the issue of cyber security is going to be an \nongoing and enduring challenge of the digital age. It is my view that \nevery Senator who serves in this body today can expect to deal with \ncyber security questions for the rest of their career in public \nservice. Voting to rush a bill through, however, is not going to make \nthese problems somehow go away, and it will have real consequences for \nour constituents for years to come, and in particular, it will not make \nus safer and will jeopardize the rights of individual Americans.\n  Before I wrap up, I believe it is important and I have an obligation \nto draw my colleagues' attention to one final issue. As of this \nafternoon, there is a secret Justice Department legal opinion that is \nof clear relevance to this debate that continues to be withheld from \nthe public. This opinion remains classified. The Senate rules prohibit \nme from describing it in detail. But I can say that it interprets \ncommon commercial service agreements and that in my judgment is \ninconsistent with the public's understanding of the law.\n  So this gets back to a question I have talked about on the floor \noften, which is secret law, when the public reads one thing and there \nis a secret interpretation that goes in another direction and it \ncontributes to the public's cynicism about Washington.\n  As always, I certainly see it as my job to say that colleagues can \ndecide whether to take my counsel, but I believe any Senator who votes \nfor this legislation, without reading this secret Justice Department \nlegal opinion I have referred to, is voting without a full \nunderstanding of the relevant legal landscape. If Senators do not \nunderstand how these common commercial service agreements have been \ninterpreted by the executive branch, then it will be harder for the \nSenate to have a fully informed debate on the cyber security \nlegislation, whether it is considered now or later.\n  I would also like to note for the record that I have repeatedly asked \nthe Justice Department to withdraw this opinion and to make it public \nso anyone who is party to one of these commercial service agreements \ncan decide whether their agreement ought to be revised. The Justice \nDepartment has chosen not to take my advice on either of my \nsuggestions.\n  In public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the \ndeputy head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel told me \nshe personally would not rely on this opinion today, and I appreciate \nher view on that matter. Yet, until the opinion is withdrawn, I believe \nSenators should be concerned about other government officials choosing \nto rely on it at any time. In my judgment, that is a very clear \ninstance of the government developing what is essentially secret law--\nlaw that is at variance with what you read if you are in a coffee shop \nin Arkansas or Utah or anywhere else.\n  The reality is, as I have said often on the floor, operations always \nhave to be secret, as do the sources and methods. Chairman Hatch \nremembers this from his service on the Intelligence Committee. \nOperations always have to be secret, but the law ought to be public \nbecause that is how the American people have confidence in how we make \ndecisions in our Republic.\n  I will close by saying it is quite obvious at this point that I have \nsignificant reservations about the cyber security bill. I believe a \nnumber of Senators are going to share these concerns. I will let them \nspeak for themselves, although I believe Senator Leahy's strong \nstatement yesterday was certainly on point. Yet I will also say, even \nto my colleagues who are inclined to vote for this bill, that I hope \nall Senators will think about whether this is an appropriate process \nfor this sort of legislation.\n  I have already said I believe Senators are going to be dealing with \ncyber security questions for the rest of their time in public service, \nbecause in the digital age, I think we are going to see a constant \nevolution in this field with respect to these threats and both the \ntechnical and political concerns that are raised by them.\n  Should the Senate be rushing a bill like this through by tacking it \nonto an unrelated defense measure? Is this the best way to show the \nAmerican people, once again, that security and liberty are not mutually \nexclusive and that it is possible to do both?\n  If Senators share the concerns I have raised, I hope they will oppose \nthe cyber security amendment if it is brought up for a vote on the \nDefense bill. I hope Senators will support this issue, which has been \nbrought to the floor under a different process--a process that involves \nregular order, so every Senator on both sides of the aisle will have an \nopportunity to make the revisions I believe it needs and to offer their \nown ideas.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                       Trade Promotion Authority\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the House of Representatives moves \ncloser to a vote on the Senate-passed legislation to renew trade \npromotion authority, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the \nlinks between our Nation's trade policy, foreign policy, and national \nsecurity. Whether it is Russia's aggression toward the Ukraine, civil \nwars in the Middle East or ongoing efforts to prevent nuclear \nproliferation, the world faces a number of challenges that are \nimpacting the future geopolitical landscape.\n  In all of this, the question we have to consider is: Going forward, \nwhat role will the United States play? Are we going to lead or are we \ngoing to follow?\n  Make no mistake, the path we take on international trade will say a \nlot about how we plan to answer those questions.\n  Consider a few facts. In the next few years, China will likely pass \nthe United States as the world's largest economy. It is already the \nworld's largest exporting country. China is continually seeking to \nexpand its influence in order to dictate the terms of international \ntrade, particularly in places like Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, \nand Latin America.\n  In other words, when we are talking about trade and the possibility \nof the United States retreating from the international marketplace, \nChina is the proverbial 800-pound gorilla in the room. Indeed, any \nground we cede in leading the world on trade is, more likely than not, \nground ceded to China.\n  I have heard many people--including Members of Congress--express \ntheir concerns about China, both strategically and economically, and \nrightfully so. After all, when it comes to trade, China has constantly \nshown a disregard for international norms and standards. However, oddly \nenough, many of those same people who talk the most about the threat \nposed by China have expressed opposition to TPA, the trade promotion \nauthority bill, and to the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. This is \npuzzling and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the Senate TPA \nbill and free trade in general.\n  If we are serious about keeping China and its growing economic and \npolitical influence in check, getting a strong TPP agreement that \nadvances U.S. interests should be a top priority. In addition, if we \nwant to eventually convince China to change their harmful practices, a \nhigh-standard TPP agreement would naturally be a big step in the right \ndirection.\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\n  Free-trade agreements like TPP, if done correctly, should provide new \nrules for trade in the 21st century. They should set modern standards \nfor economic liberalization and integration, including the protection \nof foreign investments and intellectual property rights and the \nmarginalization of state-owned enterprises.\n  We need to be setting the standards and writing the rules on trade so \nour workers, innovators, researchers, and job creators can fairly \ncompete in the global market. If we don't lead, if we sit on the \nsidelines, Americans will be competing on an imbalanced playing field, \nwith rules designed specifically to disadvantage us. Given that TPP \ncountries comprise 40 percent of the world economy, it is vital we \nimprove our ability to compete in that region.\n\n  Moreover, if TPP fails, we will lose influence in one of the most \neconomically dynamic and strategic regions of the world, and any \nleadership vacuum left by the United States will almost certainly be \nfilled by someone else and, in this case, most likely China.\n  But don't just take my word for it. Congress recently received a \nletter from 17 former Secretaries of Defense and retired military \nleaders, including Colin Powell, Leon Panetta, William Perry, and \nDonald Rumsfeld.\n  In that letter, these leaders said:\n\n       We write to express our strongest possible support for \n     enactment of Trade Promotion Authority legislation, which is \n     critical to the successful conclusion of two vital \n     agreements: the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the \n     Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). \n     Indeed, TPP in particular will shape an economic dynamic over \n     the next several decades that will link the United States \n     with one of the world's most vibrant and dynamic regions. If, \n     however, we fail to move forward with TPP, Asian economies \n     will almost certainly develop along a China-centric model. In \n     fact, China is already pursuing an alternative regional free \n     trade initiative. TPP, combined with TTIP, would allow the \n     United States and our closest allies to help shape the rules \n     and standards for global trade.\n\n  The concerns outlined in this letter went beyond China.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       The stakes are clear. There are tremendous strategic \n     benefits to TPP and TTIP, and there would be harmful \n     strategic consequences if we fail to secure these agreements. \n     In both the Asia-Pacific and the Atlantic, our allies and \n     partners would question our commitments, doubt our resolve, \n     and inevitably look to other partners. America's prestige, \n     influence, and leadership are on the line. With TPP \n     originating in the Bush administration, these agreements are \n     fundamentally bipartisan in nature and squarely in our \n     national security interest. It is vitally important that we \n     seize the new strategic opportunities these agreements offer \n     our nation.\n\n  When 17 former Secretaries of Defense, admirals, and generals who \nserved under both Republican and Democratic administrations have joined \ntogether with such a strong message, they probably have a point, and \nCongress had better listen closely.\n  Many people, including a number of our colleagues in Congress, \ncontinually argue that one of the best uses of American power would be \nto better promote human rights and democracy in developing countries \nand increase our efforts at alleviating poverty. I don't necessarily \ndisagree with that sentiment.\n  Indeed, while there are different opinions about how we can best \naccomplish these goals, I think most of us in Congress, in both the \nSenate and the House, agree with the basic premise that we should \ncontinually be working to expand our influence and advance our values, \nparticularly in the developing world.\n  History has demonstrated that the best way to accomplish these \nobjectives is to increase U.S. trade with these countries. Indeed, if \nwe want to export the benefits of American exceptionalism, capitalism, \nwork ethic, and democracy, a freer, expanded exchange of goods is \nabsolutely the best way to do it.\n  Trade is an effective exercise of America's economic power and \ninfluence, trade is how you spread capitalism and encourage other \ncountries to open their economies, trade is how you export American \nvalues in the developing world, and, most importantly, trade is how you \ncounter the growing influence of countries like China in the world \neconomy.\n  The stakes are high. The importance of TPP and other trade agreements \nto our strategic and security interests is obvious, and given that \nreality, the importance of TPA should be just as obvious.\n  Put simply, without TPA, there is no TPP. That is just a fact. Sure, \ntechnically speaking, TPA is not required for the administration to \ncomplete negotiations and send the agreement to Congress, but \ntechnicalities aside, that route is unlikely to yield a desirable \nresult, both in terms of the substance and process.\n  Japan and Canada, two of our largest trading partners in the TPP \nnegotiations, have each stated they are reluctant to bring their final \noffers to the table until Congress provides the administration with \nTPA. Trade promotion authority assures our trading partners that if \nthey reach an agreement, it will not be unraveled when it is sent to \nCongress for approval. This allows our negotiators to get the best deal \npossible.\n  TPA also ensures that Congress has a meaningful role in crafting the \nspecifics of the agreement by setting objectives, mandating \ntransparency, and requiring periodic updates. Under the Senate-passed \nbill, Congress will have more authority than ever to review and respond \nto the administration on individual trade agreements.\n  Long story short, TPA is absolutely necessary for advancing U.S. \ninterests abroad and protecting the opportunities for millions of \nAmericans to earn and compete for a livelihood in an increasingly \nglobal trade environment.\n  With the House TPA vote set to take place in a matter of days, I hope \nour colleagues in the other Chamber will recognize the strategic and \neconomic realities we face as a country and be willing to advance our \nNation's interests and security. I am confident that most of them will \nmake the right choice, and it will be good for America as well as them.\n\n\n                       Child Support Enforcement\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak about another \nmatter of great importance not just to me but to everybody.\n  Last year, after the midterm elections, the Obama administration \nquietly and without much fanfare proposed a massive, far-reaching rule \nthat would overturn a number of bedrock principles of child support \nenforcement and welfare reform, chief among them being the principle \nthat parents should be financially responsible for their children.\n  This was just the latest attempt on the part of the Obama \nadministration to bypass Congress and work to enact policies through \nexecutive fiat. Sadly, it wasn't even the first time this \nadministration tried to gut welfare reform. Indeed, we all remember a \nfew years back when the administration granted itself the unprecedented \nauthority to waive critical welfare work requirements.\n  Put simply, this latest rule would make it easier for noncustodial \nparents to evade paying child support. It would undermine a key feature \nof welfare reform, which is that single mothers can avoid welfare if \nfathers comply with child support orders.\n  I am fundamentally opposed to policies that allow parents to abdicate \ntheir responsibilities, which, in return, results in more families \nhaving to go on welfare. I think most Americans would agree with me. \nThat is why I, joined by Senator Cornyn and House Ways and Means \nCommittee Chairman Paul Ryan, have introduced legislation that would \nprevent the Obama administration from bypassing Congress in yet another \nattempt to subvert key features of welfare reform. I regret that we \nmust take this action.\n  In the past, Members of Congress have generally been able to find \ncommon ground and work on a bipartisan basis to address issues relating \nto child support. In fact, Congress recently passed, and the President \nrecently signed legislation, that made improvements to child support \nenforcement policies.\n  In 2013, the Senate Finance Committee reported a series of ambitious \nproposals related to child support enforcement. At that time, we \nrequested input on these proposals from the Obama administration. At no \ntime did administration officials indicate that the Department of \nHealth and Human Services was quietly working to advance a massive \noverhaul of child support enforcement, much less that it was planning \non doing so without the help or input of Congress.\n  It is important to note that this secretive preparation only came to \nlight\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nafter the recent elections. That suggests to me that the administration \ndoes not have faith that its proposal can withstand public scrutiny and \nthat they have no interest in making a full and transparent \njustification for the policies they are trying to ram through.\n  Truth be told, Chairman Ryan and I have introduced our legislation \nmore out of sorrow than anger. For many months, our offices attempted \nto work out an equitable arrangement with the Obama administration. We \ntried to convince HHS to withdraw the problematic features of the rule, \nand in exchange we would agree to engage in a substantive, productive \ndiscussion on how to move forward with improvements to child support \nenforcement.\n  I firmly believe there is room for common ground. In fact, there are \na number of features of the administration's proposed rule that could \ngenerate bipartisan support. But any workable solution would have to \ninclude the full participation and ultimate consent of the legislative \nbranch. Any changes to the law would have to go through Congress and \nnot simply be dictated by the administration.\n  So Chairman Ryan and I will do all we can to get our bill through \nCongress and present it to the President. If we are successful, I hope \nhe will sign it and commit to working with us in the future to advance \nreforms to child support enforcement. I stand ready to work with the \nadministration and any of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and \nboth sides of the Capitol to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1986\n\n   (Purpose: To reauthorize and reform the Export-Import Bank of the \n                             United States)\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kirk, I send an \namendment to the desk to the text proposed to be stricken by amendment \nNo. 1463.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Ms. Ayotte], for Mr. Kirk, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1986 to the language proposed \n     to be stricken by amendment No. 1463.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to talk about an important amendment that was offered by \nSenator Kirk, which I cosponsor, and that is the reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  I can tell you that in my home State of New Hampshire, on Monday, I \nwas at a roundtable at GE Aviation. GE Aviation has over 700 jobs in \nthe State of New Hampshire. They are building a new facility there. The \nExport-Import Bank provides a company like GE Aviation the opportunity \nto obtain financing to export its products that are manufactured in the \nUnited States of America, in New Hampshire, to other countries \noverseas, increasing the opportunity for American manufacturing jobs.\n  At that company, on Monday, they invited a lot of their suppliers and \nsmall businesses who also have either used Ex-Im financing or are \nsuppliers for the larger companies that use Ex-Im financing.\n  One of those companies that were around the table that had used Ex-Im \nfinancing in New Hampshire was Boyle Energy in Concord. In fact, Mike \nBoyle, who is the CEO of Boyle Energy, has been able to use Ex-Im \nfinancing to grow New Hampshire jobs. He has a vision for a new plant \nin Merrimack, NH, that he is ready to expand. If he can get this \nfinancing, he is going to be selling more of his great products \noverseas, creating more jobs in New Hampshire.\n  Yet, this Bank expires at the end of June. This is a very important \ntool for American businesses. This program--and I wish I had this \nproblem with every program in Washington--actually returns money to the \nTreasury, and it creates American jobs.\n  The reason this type of financing is available is because of the risk \nthat is often taken in exporting products and there aren't commercial \nloans always available. The Ex-Im Bank has the ability to allow \nfinancing for our businesses in America. In fact, other countries \naround the world have programs such as this, and that are much more \nextensive. So without the Ex-Im Bank, it is not a level playing field \nfor our American companies that want to manufacture in the United \nStates of America. The Ex-Im Bank will allow access to financing that \nwill enable businesses to create American jobs.\n  Also around that table on Monday at GE Aviation was Goss \nInternational. They manufacture great printing presses in New \nHampshire. We are very proud of them. They have also been able to use \nEx-Im financing. If that financing doesn't go through, we heard from a \nrepresentative of Goss that, in fact, they could lose up to 40 jobs in \nmy home State of New Hampshire. So it is important that we reauthorize \nthis Bank.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Illinois for offering this amendment \nto reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank so that our companies here in the United \nStates of America can manufacture here, sell to consumers around the \nworld, and have access to this financing. In fact, in New Hampshire \nthere have been about 36 companies--many of them small companies--that \nwere able over the last several years to use Ex-Im financing to create \nNew Hampshire jobs.\n  This is about jobs in the United States of America. This is about \ncompeting. We recently had the TPA--trade promotion authority--on the \nfloor to expand opportunities for trade. This goes hand in hand with \nthat legislation so that companies have opportunities to get financing \nto create jobs here and return money to the Treasury. I wish I could \nsay that about every program--that it returns money to the Treasury. \nThe default rate at Ex-Im Bank is lower than with commercial loans.\n  I hope that Senator Kirk's amendment will get a vote on the Senate \nfloor, that we can get this reauthorized before the expiration date at \nthe end of this month, and that we can continue to allow this financing \nfor American businesses to continue to build and create products to \nsell overseas and to create American jobs. This is what this financing \nallows these businesses to do. This is very important in making sure \nthat we remain competitive and that we have more jobs here and that we \ncontinue to sell our great products built here in the United States of \nAmerica around the world.\n  So I am very honored to support this amendment. I hope we will get a \nvote on this amendment on the Defense authorization bill or get a vote \nand make sure that we have this passed before the end of this month \nwhen this Bank expires so that we could have continuity in this \nimportant financing mechanism for our businesses here in this country.\n  In addition to the businesses I previously mentioned that were around \nthe table on Monday, I also want to mention GKN Aerospace from \nCharleston, which is a larger business with a smaller footprint in New \nHampshire that has been able to export and create jobs in New Hampshire \nand across the country. In addition to that, we were so glad to hear \nfrom other businesses in New Hampshire that were able to rely on this \nimportant financing mechanism.\n  I am very glad to support Senator Kirk's amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Space Program Cut\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I just learned that the CJS subcommittee \nof the Appropriations Committee reported a bill out that made a \nsubstantial cut in the request for commercial crew in order for us to \nbe able to have Americans flying on American rockets to and from the \nInternational Space Station, instead of having to rely on the Russian \nSoyuz, which we buy and have been buying those ever since we shut down \nthe space shuttle at something like $60 million to $70 million per\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\npassenger going up to the space station.\n  Now, the whole idea was that since we cooperated with the Russians in \nbuilding this space station, we would both have the means of \ntransportation to get up there. We do have the means of transportation \nof getting cargo to and from the space station, since we shut down the \nspace shuttle, but we are in the process of a competition between \nseveral companies--especially those that have been selected in the \ncompetition by NASA, Boeing and SpaceX. Each of them has been granted \nmoney to develop all of the redundancies and safety and escape systems \nin their spacecraft capsule in order to make it safe for Americans to \ngo to and from the International Space Station.\n  Now, I can tell you that for the average American on the street, \ntheir image of our space program is one that since the space shuttle \nshut down in 2011, they think the space program is over, when, in fact, \nit is really just beginning, and we are going to Mars in the decade of \nthe 2030s. Well, that is the whole point of our being able to rely on \nour own spacecraft and on our own rockets, instead of relying on the \nRussians.\n  If this cut is sustained--and this is a cut from a request of $1.24 \nbillion for this competition for making American rockets safe and \ncreating the spacecraft to take Americans to the space station--it will \nhave been cut to $900 million. If that cut in the subcommittee is \nsustained in the full committee and ultimately in the final \nappropriations bill, it is going to delay us from being able to launch \nAmericans on American rockets.\n  Instead of 2017--just 2 years from now--it will delay us another 4 \nyears. That is 4 more years of relying on the Russians. Now, I know \nthere are a bunch of Senators around here that do not like the fact of \nthe aggressiveness of Vladimir Putin. Well, this is one way to wean \nourselves from having to depend on them.\n  The final comment on this subject is that the money that supposedly \nis being cut, which is just a little over $300 million, we would lose \nin still paying that money to the Russians to fly an additional 2 \nyears. We need to wake up to what is happening. Senator Mikulski will \nbe offering an amendment to the full Appropriations Committee to \nrestore that cut. I hope Senators will understand all the nuances and \nsupport Senator Mikulski.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1986\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I seek to speak on my amendment on behalf of \nthe Export-Import Bank. I would like to say the Export-Import Bank is \nset to expire this year on June 30. It allows thousands of American \ncompanies to advance their technology overseas. Without these loans, \nmany American jobs would be ceded to China or Europe.\n  Now, 200,000 American workers depend on Ex-Im, plus 46,000 in my home \nState of Illinois. They work for these companies that depend on Ex-Im's \nbacking to make exports happen. Some people are interested in killing \nthis agency because it may be a government handout agency. It is not. \nIt actually makes the taxpayer $1 billion a year. In the last 3 years, \nit has earned the U.S. Treasury over $3 billion.\n  I will be offering the Kirk-Heitkamp amendment to keep this Bank \nalive. I want to thank Senators Blunt, Cantwell, and Manchin for \ndefending these American jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. This is legislation we are currently considering \nthat we need to pass. It is important for our military, and it is \nimportant for the American people. I have offered a number of \namendments, and I rise to speak about three of those amendments at this \npoint.\n  The first is amendment No. 1483, which involves RPA flight training. \nEssentially, amendment No. 1483 would instruct the Air Force to \nconsider allowing private contractors to provide the Air Force with \ntraining for remotely piloted aircraft or RPAs. These are the vehicles \nused in unmanned aerial systems, commonly called UAS.\n  Currently, the Air Force is training pilots for RPAs, remotely \npiloted aircraft, within the service itself. But there are some very \nskilled private contractors. In fact, the people who make unmanned \naircraft could be doing high-quality training for them as well, \nparticularly in concert with our universities that provide aviation \ntraining.\n  Right now the Air Force faces a real challenge in training a \nsufficient number of unmanned aircraft pilots to meet operational \ndemands. Specifically, this amendment directs the Air Force to evaluate \nthe use of private contractor facilities, equipment, and trainers to \nincrease the number of qualified pilots for our RPA missions. It \nrequires the Air Force to detail various aspects of their shortfall in \nmanning RPAs, the authorized number of personnel assigned to the \nmissions, and the identification and assessment of actions to address \nthat shortfall.\n  In this rapidly growing era of unmanned aerial systems technology, it \njust makes sense for the military to partner with companies and \nuniversities that have the expertise to provide the critical training \nthe military needs. It is cost effective. It is efficient. It is good \nfor the military and our country. Right now the demand for unmanned \naerial systems is so strong worldwide that the Air Force has all of its \npilots flying the missions. That does not give them the resources, the \npilots to train more pilots to fly unmanned aerial systems.\n  So this is a way that we can help the Air Force train these new \npilots with the very contractors that make things such as Global Hawk, \nPredator and with our universities that provide aviation training. I \nthink it would be of great benefit and assistance to the Air Force.\n  The second amendment that I want to talk about is amendment No. 1484. \nThis one seeks to give the Air National Guard units a larger role in \nthe Global Hawk unmanned aerial systems mission. Specifically, this \nmeasure directs the Air Force to determine the feasibility of \npartnering the Air National Guard with Active-Duty Air Force to operate \nand maintain the Global Hawk. The RQ-4 Global Hawks, including the \nBlock 20, Block 30, and Block 40 variants, are the Air Force's high-\naltitude, long-endurance aircraft for intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance.\n  They are currently operated and maintained only by Active-Duty \nforces. But the Air National Guard could be providing a valuable \nadjunct to the Air Force's regular personnel if we allow them to do \nthat. The North Dakota Air National Guard, for example, already \noperates and maintains the armed MQ-1 Predator, and does it \nexceptionally well. They and units like them are clearly capable of \ntaking on part of the Global Hawk mission, in association with their \nActive-Duty counterparts.\n  This amendment would further the joint operations which have been a \nmajor initiative of all of the armed services, the Guard, and the \nReserves in recent years, and they have done a tremendous job on \njointness. It has made our military stronger, more effective, and more \nresponsive. We need to continue to build on that joint operation. That \nis exactly what this amendment does.\n  The third amendment that I would like to discuss is amendment No. \n1485. It regards the Nuclear Force Improvement Program. This amendment \nseeks to fortify the Nuclear Force Improvement Program, or NFIP, which \nI believe is crucial to our national security both now and well into \nthe future. The reality is that we are facing an increasingly \nnuclearized future. Nations such as Iran, North Korea, and others have \nor are developing nuclear weapons.\n  That means we must maintain a credible, decisive nuclear deterrent. \nThat is what the Nuclear Force Improvement Program is all about. In \n2014, the Air Force initiated the program to bolster and enhance its \nnuclear missions, including the intercontinental ballistic missile, \nICBM, and nuclear-capable bomber missions. The program involves a wide \nrange of efforts to improve morale, update facilities and equipment, \nand reinvigorate the nuclear-related career fields in the Air Force.\n  We need to continue to invest in and build this program. \nSpecifically, my amendment provides that the nuclear mission should be \na top priority for the\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\nDepartment of Defense and the Air Force; that Congress should support \ninvestments which sustain progress made under the Nuclear Force \nImprovement Program; that the Air Force should regularly inform \nCongress on the program's progress and any additional requirements it \nmay identify; and that future Air Force budgets should reflect the \nimportance of the nuclear mission and the need to support personnel \nperforming the nuclear mission.\n  The bottom line is that the men and women assigned to the nuclear \nmission in the U.S. Air Force are doing incredibly important work every \nday for the security of our country. We need to do all we can to \nsupport them. We need to provide them with the support they deserve so \nthey can continue to do the job we ask them to do and do it at the \nlevel that our security requires.\n  The Nuclear Force Improvement Program is a success, and the Air Force \nneeds to extend it into the future and continue to shore up the \nfoundations of our nuclear deterrent, which is, itself, at the \nfoundation of national security.\n  In conclusion, let me say that working on legislation as essential as \nthe defense of our Nation is and should be a bipartisan effort. The \nSenate Armed Services Committee passed this bill out of committee with \na bipartisan vote of 22 to 4. Let's come together and do this for the \nAmerican people and the men, women, and families who have undertaken \nthe great and noble effort to protect our country.\n  I want to thank both the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and \nthe ranking member for their hard work, for their bipartisanship, and, \nagain, offer my support as we work to pass this vitally important \nlegislation for our military and for this great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I wish to tell you a little bit about \nGregg Keesling, a dad and small business owner from Indianapolis. I \nhave gotten to know Gregg over the past few years because Gregg and his \nwife Jannett lost their son Chancellor to suicide while Chancellor was \nserving in Iraq in 2009, joining a club he often says he doesn't want \nanyone else to join.\n  On the poster, this is Gregg and this is Chancellor. This is \nChancellor again, on duty. This is the memorial they had for \nChancellor.\n  Gregg recently said that he sees the invisible wounds borne by our \nmen and women in uniform as ``one of the greatest challenges that our \ncountry faces.'' And he noted that ``we're going to face this challenge \nfor many years to come.'' Gregg is right. We have lost more troops to \nsuicide than in combat each of the past 3 years. We lost more than 400 \nActive-Duty, Guard, and Reserve servicemembers last year alone. It is \nalso estimated that we lose 22 veterans to suicide every single day. \nThese are preventable deaths.\n  We must do more to get these men and women the mental health care \nthey have earned. We need to remind our troops and veterans, along with \nour friends and family, that it is OK to share the burden of their \npersonal struggles. It is a sign of strength to seek help. Our \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families sacrifice for us, so we \nmust do everything possible to support them.\n  Last year we passed and the President signed into law the Jacob \nSexton Military Suicide Prevention Act, which for the first time \nrequires an annual, in-person mental health assessment for all \nservicemembers, whether they are Active, Guard, or Reserve. Just like \nphysical health, mental health is an essential piece of military \nreadiness. We need to have an attitude of all-in toward providing \nsupport for mental health challenges and also for the day-to-day \nstruggles we know contribute to suicide risk, such as financial \nproblems, relationship issues--things that are never made easier by \nmilitary life.\n  The Sexton act was named for a member of the Indiana National Guard \nwho took his own life while home on leave from Afghanistan in 2009. \nJeff and Barb Sexton, Jacob's parents, have been incredible partners in \nthis work. Jeff recently spoke about the decision he and his wife made \nto speak out about military suicide.\n  This is SPC Jake Sexton. Here he is in his Humvee, and here he is \nserving as well. His parents, Jeff and Barb--actually, it was Jeff in \nparticular, his dad, who said:\n\n       I had three choices: I could crawl in a corner, I could \n     crawl in a bottle or I could stand up and fight. It's not \n     been an easy job, but it's something I feel me and my wife \n     have to do.\n\n  The Keeslings and the Sextons are courageously telling their stories \nto help prevent any more families from going through this nightmare. \nCongress needs to continue to answer their call. This is an issue we \ncannot let up on because there is so much more important work to do.\n  This year, we are taking the next step in the continuum of care and \nfocusing on improving the quality of and access to mental health care \nthrough Department of Defense providers, VA providers, and private \ncommunity providers.\n  This year, we introduced the servicemember and veteran mental health \ncare package--three bills. Each improves access to quality mental \nhealth care for servicemembers and veterans. The care package aims to \nimprove mental health care by focusing on direct care providers at DOD \nand VA, community providers in their own towns, and the training of \nphysician assistants as mental health providers.\n  I thank Chairman McCain and Senator Reed for working with me to \ninclude elements of the care package in the national defense bill, \nspecifically those elements which deal with DOD and care for \nservicemembers.\n  I wish to go through the care package provisions in the NDAA briefly \nand offer two amendments to ensure that these provisions support not \nonly servicemembers but also veterans.\n  First, section 716 is based on the first of our care package bills, \nthe Community Provider Readiness Recognition Act. It is cosponsored by \nmy friend, Senator Joni Ernst, and it creates a special military-\nfriendly designation for providers who choose to receive training in \nmilitary culture and the unique needs of servicemembers and military \nfamilies. Providers who receive this designation would be listed in a \nregularly updated online registry, allowing servicemembers to search \nfor designated providers in their area.\n  This bill is inspired by the Star Behavioral Health Provider Network, \nwhich is a program that the Military Family Research Institute at \nPurdue University built in Indiana to train providers to better \nunderstand military culture and medical treatments. Designating a \nprovider as part of the Star Behavioral Health Provider Network helps \nservicemembers and their families make informed choices about where to \nseek care. This can easily be translated on a national scale so that \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families know which private mental \nhealth care providers are well-suited and trained to treat them.\n  Mr. President, second, section 713 of the NDAA is drawn from another \ncare package bill, the Military and Veterans Mental Health Provider \nAssessment Act, cosponsored by my friend Senator Roger Wicker of \nMississippi.\n  This legislation requires that all of DOD primary care and mental \nhealth providers have received evidence-based training on suicide risk \nrecognition and management and that their training be updated to keep \npace with changes in mental health care best practices.\n  It also requires DOD to report to Congress on the military's current \nmental health workforce, the long-term mental health needs of \nservicemembers and military families, and how we ensure DOD meets those \nneeds.\n  Finally, it requires the Department of Defense to bring us a plan to \nassess mental health outcomes in DOD care, variations in outcomes \nacross different DOD health care facilities, and barriers to DOD mental \nhealth providers implementing the best clinical practice guidelines and \nother evidence-based treatments.\n  Finally, by including elements from the Frontline Mental Health \nProvider Training Act, cosponsored by my friend Senator John Boozman \nfrom Arkansas, the NDAA calls on the Department of\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\nDefense to train physician assistants to specialize in psychiatric care \nin order to help meet the increasing demand for mental health services \namong servicemembers and their families. We are also working to extend \nthe same spectrum of care to our veterans, and we are working toward a \nhearing on the corresponding veterans bills for this mental health care \npackage in the months ahead. These are smart, bipartisan provisions \nthat address one of the most serious challenges facing our military, \nour veterans and our country.\n  We must improve the mental health care at the Department of Defense \nand the Veterans' Administration and at private community providers \nfrom Ellsworth, ME, to Evansville, IN, to the shores of California so \nthey are better able to serve our servicemembers, veterans, and their \nfamilies. It is absolutely essential that we have coordination and \ncontinuity for servicemembers and their families as they transition to \nveteran status.\n  I will leave you with a couple of brief thoughts from two brave \nHoosiers I have the privilege to know and have gotten to know well. \nJeff Sexton, Jacob's dad, put it this way: ``It is one thing to lose \nsomeone you love in the war. It is a whole other thing to lose them to \nthe war.'' And Gregg Keesling, Chancellor's dad, concluded this: ``The \nbottom line is I don't want anybody to go through what we've gone \nthrough.''\n  We must act and we must act now before any more families have to \nexperience this loss from suicide. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport the care package provisions for servicemembers and to later \nextend them to our veterans who need our help and who need us to stand \nup for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am coming to the floor to speak on \nbehalf of an amendment I am offering, along with Senators Schatz, \nUdall, Blumenthal, Heinrich, Tester, Merkley, and Baldwin.\n  Today, it was announced that President Obama is going to be sending \nanother 450 troops to Iraq to help assist in the fight against ISIL. \nThat will mean we now have 3,500 troops in position throughout Iraq \nassisting in the battle against ISIL within those borders. This marks \nalso nearly a year since we have reengaged in military activities in \nIraq and in Syria, both with support forces for the Iraqis, with \ntraining for those who are fighting in Syria, and major air operations \ntargeting ISIL.\n  I think there is broad bipartisan consensus here that the United \nStates needs to take the fight to this enemy--an enemy that is seeking \nto occupy an enormous amount of territory in a very dangerous region \nfrom which it can plot attacks against the United States. But I also \nthink there is bipartisan agreement that we should do our \nconstitutional duty; that we should authorize this war against ISIL. My \nhope is the Foreign Relations Committee--of which I am a member, of \nwhich the Presiding Officer is a member--will have that debate in the \nupcoming months.\n  But given that we are authorizing hundreds of millions of dollars in \nthis bill in order to take the fight to ISIL, I think it makes sense to \nhave some commonsense limitations on the use of that money that are in \nkeeping with the very public promises the President has made.\n  President Obama has stated very clearly that he does not think it is \na wise strategy to reinsert major combat troop operations into the \nMiddle East. I agree with him. I think many of us agree with him. There \nis nothing about the last 10 years of American occupation in Iraq that \ntells us that U.S. troops inside Iraq can have the effect of killing \nmore terrorists than are created, in part, through the recruitment \nbenefit of major U.S. combat operations.\n  So the amendment we are offering today is a fairly simple one. It \nwould prohibit the use of major combat--of large numbers of combat \ntroops in the fight against ISIL, with certain commonsense exceptions: \nan exception for rescue operations, an exception for intelligence-\ngathering exercises, and an exception for special operations in and \nthroughout the region; special operations like the one we used to kill \na high-ranking ISIS commander just within the last several weeks.\n  We think it is important that Congress weigh in and state what we \nbelieve to be the desire and imperative of our constituents; that we \nlearn from the mistakes of the Iraq war; that we don't repeat them by \ninserting thousands of American ground troops back into Iraq or perhaps \nSyria.\n  ISIS was created, first and foremost, primarily by a political vacuum \ninside Iraq, not a military vacuum. We need to acknowledge that any \nstrategy to ultimately defeat ISIL, as we are all committed to, has to \nfirst and foremost have a realistic political strategy on the ground to \ndivorce Sunni populations from this death cult that is ISIL.\n  Sunni grievances grew throughout Nouri al-Maliki's reign. They were \ndenied an equitable share of oil revenues. They were excluded from \ngovernment jobs. There were real atrocities committed against Sunni \ncommunities--mass incarcerations, torture, extrajudicial killings. If \nwe don't have an Iraq Government that is committed to being inclusive \nof Sunni populations, there is no amount of American troops on the \nground that can heal those divisions. In fact, what we know about the \nIraq war is that major American combat operations on the ground in Iraq \nhave an effect of exacerbating those divisions rather than healing \nthem. They give space for people like Maliki to try to marginalize \nthese populations. They increase suffering on the ground, especially \nfor these populations that aren't represented effectively within the \nreigning Shiite government in Baghdad.\n  So if we really want to learn lessons from the past, then let's take \nPresident Obama at his word. Let's include in the NDAA a commonsense \nlimitation, with exceptions, with respect to the deployment of major \nground operations inside Iraq.\n  Now, there are some people who will say this isn't the role of \nCongress. I would just state for the record that there are a litany of \nexamples in the past in which Congress has placed commonsense \nlimitations on our authorizations for military force. In fact, the \nPresident, in submitting a proposed AUMF to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee several months ago, in fact, included in that authorization \nof military force a limitation on ground forces. So this would be \nentirely consistent with the history of this body but also with the \nproposal the President has made.\n  I know, from having visited our troops in Iraq and in Afghanistan, \nthat it is easy for us to believe there is no mission that U.S. \nsoldiers can't take on; that their capability, that their bravery, that \ntheir courage, that their adaptability knows no bounds. They have done \nadmirable work inside Iraq over the course of the last 10 years, but \nwhat we know is that those troops inside Iraq also made Iraq what our \nown intelligence community called the cause celebre for the \ninternational terrorist movement, drawing in thousands of would-be \nterrorists to fight the Americans.\n  What we know is that the ISIS we are fighting today is a follow-on \norganization from Al Qaeda in Iraq, which was created because of the \nAmerican invasion and occupation--maybe not in whole but certainly as \nthe primary influence.\n  So we hope to be able to have a full debate on an authorization of \nmilitary force. But with the inability to move that piece of \nlegislation through the Foreign Relations Committee, we think it is \nproper on the NDAA to hold the President at his word, place a \ncommonsense limitation on the use of ground troops and learn from the \nmistakes of the last 10 years inside Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1986\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I urge this Chamber to reject the motion to \ntable my amendment, which put forward reforms to the Export-Import \nBank. I would say to Members that this is going to be a key scored vote \nby the\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers; \nthat, without my amendment, we would not have the reforms to make sure \nEx-Im works at least 25 percent of its portfolio with small businesses.\n  I urge Members to vote no on the motion to table my amendment by Mr. \nShelby that I understand is coming up. This is a key test vote, Export-\nImport Bank. With a good bipartisan vote, I would think we would have \npeople supporting the Kirk-Heitkamp-Blunt-Graham reform legislation for \nEx-Im.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, very briefly. Senators Ayotte and Kirk's \namendment is coming up. There will be a motion to table. What we are \ntrying to do is basically show support for the Ex-Im Bank, which is due \nto expire in June. We are trying to find a vehicle, a must-pass piece \nof legislation, to keep the Bank afloat. I think it is very important \nto the American economy that American manufacturers not be \ndisadvantaged. The Ex-Im Bank makes money for the American taxpayer. \nChina's Ex-Im Bank is larger than France, Germany, the United States, \nand England's combined.\n  What does this mean to the average person? When a product is made in \nthe United States and sold into the developing world without the Ex-Im \nfinancing mechanism available to American manufacturers, we are going \nto lose market share to other countries like China, France, Germany \nthat produce wide-body jets and other products. Eighty-nine percent of \nthe people who get help from the Ex-Im Bank are small businesses.\n  This is an attempt to show the investor community and those who are \nwatching this issue that the Senate is in support of the Bank. So I am \nurging a ``no'' vote on tabling. We had to do this procedurally. So \nthis will be a signal to the markets that the Senate is in support of \nthe Bank. I urge everyone who believes the Bank is vital to American \nexports and not against unilateral surrendering of market share to the \nChinese and other competitors to vote no. There will be another vote of \nour choosing on a vehicle that will have to get to the President's \ndesk. This is not the last vote we will take on Ex-Im Bank.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I understand we have a vote scheduled at 5 \no'clock, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak for about 60 \nseconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1473\n\n  I came to the floor today to speak in favor of an amendment described \nearlier in the afternoon by Senator Vitter. This is an amendment, of \ncourse, to the National Defense Authorization Act that makes certain \nour U.S. Army is able to maintain the current number of brigade combat \nteams.\n  Sequestration is creating significant problems in many arenas but no \nmore important than in the area of our Army and defense. The concern is \nthat in the process of downsizing the Army as a result of sequestration \nand other reductions in available funding, brigade combat teams would \nbe eliminated. Senator Vitter's amendment, which I support and am a \ncosponsor of, would eliminate that as an option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1986\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Ayotte-Kirk amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment, which is a long-term reauthorization of the Export-Import \nBank. In my opinion, after evaluating this issue during a series of \nhearings in the Senate banking committee, there is no compelling case \nto reauthorize the bank.\n  After years of efforts to reform the Export-Import Bank, it has \nbecome clear to me that its problems are beyond repair and that the \nBank's expiration is in the best interest of American taxpayers. Nearly \n99 percent of all American exports--over $2 trillion--are financed \nwithout the Export-Import Bank's help, which demonstrates that the \nsubsidies are more about corporate welfare than advancing our economy.\n  I believe the Export-Import Bank has outlived its usefulness and \nshould be allowed to expire.\n  At this point, I move to table the Kirk amendment No. 1986 and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Florida (Mr. Rubio) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nToomey).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I am very excited about the Kirk-\nHeitkamp amendment getting an overwhelming show of support. The reality \nis that if we do not vote on the Kirk-Heitkamp bill itself and pass it \nout of this Chamber, at the end of this month, the charter for the Ex-\nIm Bank will expire.\n  This vote has nothing to do with the charter for the Ex-Im Bank. It \ndoes nothing to prevent the charter for the Ex-Im Bank from expiring. \nThis is at a time when China and India are pumping billions of dollars \ninto their export credit agency. This is at a time when we have $15 \nbillion worth of credit waiting to move through the Ex-Im Bank so we \ncreate jobs here in our country--jobs for American workers--and we are \nstalling the Bank.\n  When we had this discussion during the TPA debate, we wanted to have \na vote that would guarantee we would have an opportunity to prevent the \ncharter for the Ex-Im Bank from expiring. That is not this vote today.\n  I am extraordinarily gratified by the show of support because what it \nreally does tell us is if we bring up an Ex-Im Bank bill on its own--an \nextension bill on its own--we will be able to prevent something from \nhappening that could have catastrophic economic results in this \ncountry. So I urge this body to find a path forward to prevent the Ex-\nIm Bank charter from expiring, to have a path forward to honor our \ncommitments that were made during an earlier vote so we can have a vote \nand actually move this bill forward and not simply have a vote to show \nsupport but actually pass a bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Dakota yield \nfor a question?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for her comments and I ask her this \nquestion: So that we understand the procedure that just took place, \nthere was an amendment offered that would have extended the Ex-Im Bank \nand then a motion to table it, and I believe 60 Members or more voted \nagainst the motion to table, which shows a positive sentiment about \nextending the Ex-Im Bank charter. After that vote, the sponsors of the \namendment withdrew the amendment from this bill.\n  So at this moment in time, I wish to ask the Senator, for absolute \nclarity: We have nothing before us that would extend the Ex-Im Bank \neither in this bill or in any other manner before the end of June when \nit expires; is that correct?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And that creates a disadvantage for businesses in \nIllinois, and I am sure in North Dakota, in terms of exports and jobs, \nand unless we do take this seriously and quickly, they will be \njeopardized.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I think the other thing it does also is it is a signal \nto all of those companies we are competing with, whether it is China or \nIndia, that we are out of the business, and that opens a wide path for \nthem to be in the business of exports. So this takes us out of the \nbusiness of financing exports, which is going to have and will have \ncatastrophic results. We don't have a path forward, and the charter of \nthe Bank expires at the end of this month. Without a path forward, we \nare opening an opportunity for our competitors to take those exports \nand to take away our opportunity to have those jobs.\n  So I am very gratified by the result of this vote because I think it \nsignals support for Ex-Im Bank. When we get this kind of support from \nthe U.S. Senate--almost veto-proof support--maybe we ought to move the \nbill. People will say there isn't an opportunity to do that; there is \nno path forward. Let me tell my colleagues that there is no one in the \ncountry who believes that is true. If there is a will, there is a way.\n  We have to have a vote on the Export-Import Bank by the end of the \nmonth and get it over to the House so the House can support it and move \nthis forward or we will be playing chicken with the exports of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Yes.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Senator Ayotte, in offering this amendment, talked \nabout a forum in New Hampshire at General Electric where a number of \nsmall businesses participated. Senator Cantwell and I were at that \nforum. We heard testimony from an employee of a company called Goss \nInternational, which makes large printing presses and competes mostly \nwith Germany but with countries around the world. One of the issues she \nspoke about is that they have $10 million in deals that are sitting on \nthe table at Ex-Im that they need to have approved before the end of \nJune when the authorization expires. If those don't get approved, they \nare not going to be able to create 45 new jobs they are talking about \nbeing able to create as part of that deal.\n  So if the authorization for Ex-Im expires, not only is Goss going to \nhave trouble with those jobs, but companies across this country are \ngoing to lose jobs that would be created if those financing deals could \ngo through; isn't that the case?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. In fact, the case is nearly $16 billion worth of \nAmerican business and American exports that create American jobs will \nlanguish in the pipeline at the Ex-Im Bank because we foolishly let a \ncharter expire at a time when we are in competition for exports, a \ncompetition for commerce throughout the world.\n  When we debated trade promotion--and a lot of us took some tough \nvotes on TPA--we were promised a vote that would be mutually agreed \nupon here so we could advance the Ex-Im Bank by the end of June. We \nhaven't gotten that vote because today all we did was show--I think \nrightfully so--that we have tremendous support in this body for the Ex-\nIm Bank and we shouldn't be held hostage to the narrow ideology of a \nfew.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Yes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator from North Dakota has obviously been \nworking so hard on this in the Banking Committee, and she understands, \nI believe, that when the Bank expires on June 30, there is about $12 \nbillion of approved deals that are in the process, and they will not be \napproved while the Bank is not operating; is that correct?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. That is correct. The last number I was given, I say to \nmy friend, the Senator from Washington, was almost $5.5 billion.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. So today's vote is a symbolic vote but does nothing to \nhelp us resolve the issue for getting this approved before June 30.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Unfortunately, too often we have symbolic votes that \ndon't have real consequences in the real world. Our wonderful \nbusinesses that are outcompeting and outmanufacturing and outdeveloping \nand outresearching the rest of the world are now with their hands tied \nbehind their backs and losing credits as we stand.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Are there a lot of small businesses in South Dakota \nthat are a part of this export economy?\n  I say that because I think a lot of people get the impression that \nthis is about big manufacturers. I have always said those guys will \ntake care of themselves; they have lots of people here to take care of \nthem. But the small people who will actually lose business on June 30 \ndon't have people here and that is why we are fighting so hard to get a \nvote before June 30 that actually will go over to the House on a \nvehicle.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. We have companies in Wahpeton, ND, where bankruptcy has \nbeen prevented because they have been able to find their way to the Ex-\nIm Bank and actually find their way to a credit relationship with their \nimporters.\n  We have a company in West Fargo that builds portable wheelchair ramps \nand they have saturated the market here and they are marketing these \nall\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\nover the country. They will tell us today and tell anyone who will \nlisten that the only reason they are as successful as they are is \nbecause of the credit agency, the Export-Import Bank.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for her leadership in committee. As \nshe said, with 65 votes, we can do a lot of things to get this \nlegislation out of here, so we will certainly be looking for those \nopportunities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, before I ask my question, I wish to thank Senator \nHeitkamp and Senator Cantwell and Senator Shaheen. These three women \nhave been just stalwart on this. We were on different sides on the \ntrade vote, and I remember how hard they pushed for a real commitment, \nwhich I think in good faith they believed they got.\n  I am afraid what we saw here tonight is quite cynical. It doesn't do \nanything. I don't get what the point was.\n  Wouldn't it be far better if we got a commitment from the majority \nleader to set aside some time right after this bill--certainly before \nthe end of this month, because as Senator Cantwell always tells us, the \nend of the month is the end of the Bank.\n  So if we could get a commitment, I am asking my friend, would she be \nwilling to agree to a time agreement so we wouldn't have to take up \ndays and days and days to get this reauthorization done?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Absolutely. I think we have a vehicle, as we can say, \nfor the Kirk-Heitkamp bill, which was, in fact, this amendment we just \nvoted on. We have overwhelming support in the Senate. We will do \nanything we can to move this authorization forward because without it \nwe are costing American jobs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another point I wish to make to my friend is I don't know \nif she is aware, but California has well over $1 billion of projects on \nthe line. Even in our State, that is significant.\n  I just wanted to thank her and Senators Cantwell and Shaheen and \nothers who have worked so hard. I have been here a long time, and I \nknow a cynical ploy when I see it. I just saw it.\n  I know how easy it is to resolve this problem. You have an \noverwhelming, filibuster-proof number of people who want this Bank \nreauthorized. All you probably need is an hour or so. Anytime night or \nday, we will come in. I would hope and I would ask my friend if she and \nher colleagues will pursue a meeting or ask directly at some point in \ntime for a commitment to take this up and, within a reasonable time \nlimit, get it done.\n\n  In my State, many jobs are dependent on this, and all across the \nNation, as you have eloquently pointed out, as well as Senators \nCantwell and Shaheen. I thank you for your leadership.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I thank my friend from California.\n  I would say that as much as relationships here matter, what matters \nmore to me is Americans working. What matters more to me are the jobs \nthat will be lost and the opportunities that will be lost, as these \nmanufacturing facilities and as these great innovative manufacturers \nhave worked so hard. Think about all the work that is behind almost $16 \nbillion worth of credit, all the relationships. All of a sudden, they \nhave to say to their customer: Guess what. I am not there.\n  I would suggest that one of the most heart-wrenching stories I have \nheard about the loss already of a big deal came out of California--a \n100-percent disabled vet who told us he has already lost $57 million \nand he is on a path to lose a $200 million deal out of the Philippines, \nand that means jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  In California, jobs matter. In North Dakota, jobs matter. All across \nthis country, jobs matter. If we can start putting the focus on jobs \nand the American worker first instead of ideology and politics, if we \nstop playing games, we can get things done here.\n  What was interesting to me is people say: Well, there is no path \nforward.\n  Really? I think that if we needed a bill passed, if, in fact, we were \nin a spot where in 2 weeks or 2-plus weeks we were going to lose the \ncharter of the Ex-Im Bank--and we are in that spot. If you really care \nabout the Ex-Im Bank, if you really care about American jobs, you would \nfigure out a way to pass this bill out of the Senate for which we have \n65 votes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1548 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I wish to honor and thank Janet Burrell \nfor her 37 years of talented and dedicated public service upon her \nretirement from the Senate. Her career in the Senate spans an \nimpressive array of issues and responsibilities--all of which she met \nwith grace, skill, and good cheer. For the last 16 years, Janet has \nserved as the office administrator for the Democratic staff of the \nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Janet started her career in the Senate on the Committee on Finance in \n1985 as a staff assistant. She and her colleagues worked around the \nclock--taking shifts, day and night--to help enact the mammoth and \nhistoric Tax Reform Act of 1986. From the Committee on Finance, she \nmoved to the Committee on Environment and Public Works and, finally, to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is now the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Over her 30 years of service in the Senate, Janet worked on teams \ntackling a wide range of legislation, moving from the Tax Reform Act of \n1986 to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in 2003. She has worked for six \nSenators over the years, including both Republicans and Democrats, in \nboth the majority and the minority, and even in a Senate evenly split \nbetween Democrats and Republicans.\n  Along the way in her Senate career, Janet learned and mastered a \nbroad array of new skills from managing human resources to operating \ncomputers to learning the intricacies of how to make a committee run \nsmoothly. She was the office administrator of the now-Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs during the 9/11 terrorist \nattacks, when anthrax was discovered in the Senate, and even during an \nearthquake. The challenges were difficult and diverse but Janet rose to \nevery task. Among other things, at the time of the anthrax incident, \nJanet supervised the young staff who opened the mail. In that capacity, \nit was among her responsibilities to calm the fears of the staff and \ntheir worried parents. She was also responsible for figuring out \nevacuation drills for scenarios like a biological attack, terrorist \nattack, or active shooter--risks that few could have envisioned when \nshe started with the committee 16 years ago. Janet also helped shape \nSenate history. Beginning in 2004, she played an instrumental role in \norchestrating the committee's transition from the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Prior to serving in the Senate, Janet worked in the House of \nRepresentatives for my former colleague, Ralph H. Regula of Ohio, and \nshe served 7 years in the executive branch at the U.S. Office of \nGovernment Ethics and at the U.S. General Services Administration.\n  In every office that she was a part of, Janet acted as a force of \ncalm and generosity at the center of chaotic day-to-day, week-to-week \nschedules. Her colleagues are quick to share stories of times when \nJanet went above and beyond the call of duty to make someone's day \nsmoother. In fact, they tell me that her selflessness and kindness was \nreflected in every task she took on. One of Janet's former staff \ndirectors said that Janet, ``always did whatever had to be done to make \nsure that\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\nothers felt and understood how much they were appreciated.'' I couldn't \nagree more. She truly embodies the Golden Rule by always treating \nothers as she would want to be treated. As she gracefully exits her \nlifelong career in public service, Janet leaves behind a family of \ncolleagues that will miss her and long remember her.\n  As we speak of Janet's most significant accomplishments, I would be \nremiss if I did not mention Janet's daughter Ashley, the apple of her \neye. Ashley got an early start in the Senate--as an infant in the \nSenate day care center. She went on to be one of the few students at \nher high school to earn a full international baccalaureate diploma. \nFrom there, Ashley earned an advanced degree in counseling and is now \nfully licensed, helping numerous young adults and families as they cope \nwith life's challenges. Clearly, the apple did not fall far from the \ntree.\n  Upon her retirement, I thank Janet for the many invaluable \ncontributions she has made to our committee, the Senate, the Federal \nGovernment, and our Nation. I congratulate her on a truly remarkable \ncareer. On behalf of all of us in the Senate, I want to wish her and \nher family the very best in all that lies ahead for each of them. \nGodspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S4019-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       CONGRATULATING B. GREEN & COMPANY ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nrecognize a special Baltimore company--B. Green & Company--on its 100th \nanniversary, which will be celebrated this Saturday, June 13. Benjamin \nGreen founded this great Baltimore company one century ago. He was an \nimmigrant from Lithuania who worked as a street peddler before starting \na wholesale grocery business in 1915 in a rowhouse located at 828 West \nBaltimore Street. He made deliveries to Baltimore-area grocery stores \nby horse-drawn carts and later by ``tin lizzy'' type trucks.\n  One hundred years ago, warehouses were multistoried buildings, \nrecord-keeping, inventories, and billing were done by hand, and most \nitems--even commodities like butter--were sold in bulk. Today, we have \nsprawling one-story warehouses accessible by tractor-trailer trucks. \n``Just in time'' inventories are tracked by barcode. Computer software \nhas automated much of the book-keeping and billing. And products of all \ntypes are sold in more convenient packages.\n  B. Green & Company was--and remains--a family business. All of \nBenjamin Green's children--his sons Sam and Bernie and his daughters \nRose, Anna, Sarah, and Dora ``Duckye'' and their spouses joined in \nsupporting the business, learning it from the ground up. As they \ndeveloped their own areas of expertise, the size and nature and status \nof the company grew. The third generation of the family joined their \nparents in the business in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the remaining \nfamily members in the business are chief executive officer Benjamin \n``Benjy'' Green and his cousins Ben Sigman, chairman emeritus; and \nBernice Sigman, a retired physician and board member.\n  For a company to survive and prosper for 100 years, it needs to \nevolve and change with the times. During World War II, the company \nstarted supplying food to military bases and grew into the largest \nmilitary commissary supplier on the east coast. In 1948, B. Green & \nCompany was one of the first food wholesalers to use data processing \nequipment. Also, that year, the company relocated to the first single-\nstory warehouse in the area at 2200 Winchester Street. A catastrophic \nfire destroyed the entire warehouse and most of the corporate offices \nin 1959, but the company had such strong relations with its suppliers \nand customers that it was able to resume delivering groceries from a \nrented warehouse within a few days.\n  In 1966, B. Green & Company purchased Capital Wholesale Grocery \nCompany, which allowed it to add the Cash & Carry business. The \ncorporate offices were moved to 400 West Conway Street where the Cash & \nCarry was located. In 1968, the company acquired Colonial Foods \nDistributing Company to add gourmet and specialty foods and snack items \nto the main grocery products, and to add some national chains as \ncustomers. In 1972, the company acquired property at 3601 Washington \nBoulevard from Westinghouse to expand warehousing capacity, and the \ncorporate offices relocated there in 1975. Three years later, the \ncompany acquired Southern Beef Company to expand its line of meat \nproducts.\n  B. Green & Company eventually became the largest grocery wholesaler \non the east coast. In 1979, it helped pioneer warehouse-style, low-\nprice, no-frills supermarkets by opening the York Warehouse Food \nMarket. In 1983, using state-of-the-art technology, it became one of \nthe first wholesalers to use a mechanized warehouse system. In 1989, \nthe Maryland Stadium Authority, by the ``right of eminent domain'', \ncondemned the 400 West Conway location to build Oriole Park at Camden \nYards. Cash & Carry moved to its current location at 1300 South Monroe \nStreet.\n  By 1991, with annual sales of $675 million, B. Green & Company ranked \n263d on Forbes magazine's list of the Nation's largest private \ncompanies. But the company continued to evolve, shifting its focus from \nwholesaling to retailing. In 1992, it sold its military distribution \nbusiness to Nash Finch, a Minnesota-based wholesale grocery \ndistributer. In 1993, it sold its civilian distribution business to \nRichfood of Richmond, VA.\n  Today, B. Green & Company runs several different food operations. It \nstill distributes groceries to food retailers who are too small for the \nbig wholesalers. It continues to run Cash & Carry from the warehouse at \n1300 South Monroe Street and another one located at 2401 Belair Road. \nCash & Carry is a members-only warehouse where many corner grocers in \nthe area can shop for goods. And it operates two ``everyday-low-price'' \nFood Depot stores in Baltimore at the Belair Road site, which opened in \n1996, and at 2495 Frederick Avenue, which opened in 2008. These stores \nushered in a new generation of urban full-service supermarkets, \nfeaturing a fresh seafood and fish department, one of the largest and \nmost diversified produce departments in Baltimore City, a full-service \ndeli and bakery, and a meat department with a great variety of products \nand cuts of meat. The stores succeed as independent grocers by \ncustomizing their products and services to the neighborhoods they \nserve. Store managers and associates are encouraged to suggest products \nand merchandising strategies. In 2011, the company expanded into Howard \nCounty with a new format, the Green Valley Marketplace at 7280 \nMontgomery Road in Elkridge, MD. Green Valley Marketplace is a new \nsuburban supermarket.\n  I am proud that B. Green & Company launched a campaign to expand \nhealthy food choices in the city's poorest neighborhoods in a \npartnership with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health \nthat encourages shoppers to buy healthier items and fewer highly \nprocessed foods. Many Food Depot customers rely on the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program. The stores have licensed dieticians \nonsite who teach customers how to shop for and prepare healthy meals on \na budget.\n  Today, B. Green & Company employs nearly 500 associates, who are \nconsidered extended family. Benjy Green knows most of them by name and \ncan recount their backgrounds. The company thrives 100 years after its \ncreation because, as Benjy put it, ``we know the neighborhood we serve \nbetter than the other guy''. It thrives because it treats its employees \nand its customers with respect. It thrives because it fulfills a vital \nfunction in communities across Baltimore and the surrounding area. I \nwould ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating B. Green & Company \non its 100th anniversary and sending best wishes for the next 100 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S4019-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4019-S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING JAYDYN CHILD\n\n Mr. DAINES.

LEODREY WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I honor Dr. Leodrey Williams, \nchancellor of the Southern University Agricultural Research and \nExtension Center, on his retirement after 50 years of public service.\n  Dr. Williams is a 1961 graduate of Southern University of Louisiana \nin vocational agriculture education. Immediately upon graduation, he \nbegan his distinguished career by joining the U.S. Army and training as \nan oral x-ray technician and hygienist. He then began working for \ncooperative extension, where he helped to build the new curriculum by \nassisting and launching the program throughout the State of Louisiana. \nHe earned a master of science degree in 1970 and doctor of education \ndegree in 1975 from Louisiana State University. After 5 years as an \nagriculture specialist, Dr. Williams returned to Louisiana State \nUniversity as an associate professor and director of equal employment \nopportunity and civil rights. In 1991, Dr. Williams co-chaired a \nnational task force that studied America's cooperative extension \nsystem. He was subsequently appointed Special Assistant to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture Extension Administrator, and he was later \nnamed the National Director of Extension.\n  Besides his active involvement in agriculture, Dr. Williams has \nserved as a consultant to the governments of Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, \nand Republic of South Africa in the areas of extension administration \nand adult and continuing education. During his visits to China, \nHonduras, and Liberia, he assisted in developing strategies for \nuniversity collaboration and exchange, along with addressing concerns \nand issues facing urban populations.\n  For the past 14 years, Dr. Williams has been the first chancellor for \nthe Southern University Agricultural Research and Extension Center. He \nhas served the citizens of Louisiana, Louisiana State University, and \nthe Southern University System with his knowledge, skill, enthusiasm, \nand leadership.\n  I am pleased to honor the esteemed career of Dr. Leodrey Williams. I \nthank him for his years of service to our state and country and wish \nhim the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S4020-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S4020-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S4020-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13405 OF JUNE 16, 2006, WITH \n                       RESPECT TO BELARUS--PM 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From \n     Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the \n     current system of privately financed campaigns for election \n     to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often \n     perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United \n     States by--\n       (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived \n     conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large \n     campaign contributions from private interests that are \n     directly affected by Federal legislation;\n       (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators' \n     accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to \n     be accountable to the major contributors who finance their \n     election campaigns;\n       (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by \n     allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and \n     unfair influence within the political process;\n       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through \n     legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal \n     access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;\n       (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to \n     mount competitive Senate election campaigns;\n       (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive \n     elections; and\n       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with \n     fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry \n     out their public responsibilities.\n       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From \n     the Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that \n     providing the option of the replacement of large private \n     campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair \n     Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections \n     to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--\n       (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest \n     created by fully private financing of the election campaigns \n     of public officials and restoring public confidence in the \n     integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative \n     processes through a program which allows participating \n     candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution \n     limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be \n     sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral \n     campaigns;\n       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the \n     accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect \n     them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to \n     participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that \n     constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and \n     participate in the program;\n       (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign \n     contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence \n     within the political process by facilitating the expression \n     of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging \n     political participation, and incentivizing participation on \n     the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar \n     contributions;\n       (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that \n     may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated \n     based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the \n     influence of campaign contributions;\n       (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run \n     for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;\n       (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by \n     citizens of every level of wealth; and\n       (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with \n     raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their \n     public responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emission fees, reduce the \nrate of the corporate income tax, provide tax credits to workers, \ndeliver additional benefits to retired and disabled Americans, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce, \nalong with my lead cosponsor, Senator Schatz of Hawaii, the American \nOpportunity Carbon Fee Act of 2015.\n  We announced this legislation this afternoon at an event hosted by \nthe American Enterprise Institute, and I want to thank the American \nEnterprise Institute for their hospitality. I think their interest in \nthis idea clearly reflects the difference between core conservative \neconomic principles and simply being pushed around by the hectoring of \nthe fossil fuel industry. There is a difference between the two, and \nthis bill meets legitimate conservative economic principles.\n  I will start by saying the obvious, which is that climate change is \nreal. It is virtually universal in peer-reviewed science that climate \nchange is real, that carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels is \ncausing unprecedented climate and oceanic changes. Every major \nscientific society in our country has said so. Our brightest scientists \nat NOAA and at NASA are unequivocal. The fundamental science of climate \nchange is, indeed, settled.\n  In the details of local application and the extent to which a \nparticular storm is caused by or exacerbated by climate change, in the \nvagaries of prediction about how things are going to be 10 or 15 years \nout at those margins, yes--there is always room for conversation and \ndebate at the margins, but the core science of climate change is beyond \nlegitimate debate. It is known science, like debating gravity.\n  Americans get it. In poll after poll, Americans understand that \nclimate change is real, know that humans are the cause, and want their \ngovernment to do something about it.\n  Climate change is not our only national challenge. The Federal Tax \nCode, for example, is a mess, with one of the highest corporate tax \nrates in the developed world, while some take advantage of loopholes to \npay far less than others and, indeed, some pay nothing at all. We have \nan economic recovery that has left far too many Americans behind, and \nwe have a job market that has still not fully rebounded.\n  What if our answer to climate change helped address those other \nconcerns as well? What if that approach was firmly grounded in core \nconservative economic principles, values such as property rights, \nmarket efficiency, and personal liberty?\n  Aparna Mathur of the free-market think tank the American Enterprise \nInstitute conducted an analysis with a colleague from the Brookings \nInstitution showing that a carbon fee could reduce emissions, shore up \nthe country's fiscal outlook, and play an important part in broader tax \nreform. AEI's Kevin Hassett, Steven Hayward, and Kenneth Greene have \npointed out that a carbon fee could obviate some environmental \nregulations. The idea behind it is extremely simple. You levy a price \non the thing you don't want--carbon pollution--and you use the revenue \nto help with things you do want.\n  Whether they are called neighborhood effects or negative \nexternalities, the effects of carbon pollution harm us all. \nConservative economist Milton Friedman wrote that the government exists \nin part to reduce such harms. When the costs of such externalities \ndon't get factored into the price of a product, conservative economic \ndoctrine--indeed, all economic doctrine--classifies that as a subsidy--\na market failure. Right now for fossil fuel producers, that subsidy is \nimmense, giving them artificial advantage over cleaner energy sources. \nThe International Monetary Fund just postulated that the annual subsidy \njust in America to the fossil fuel industry is $700 billion. We tend to \ntalk around here in budget cycles of 10 years. That means it is $7 \ntrillion in a budget cycle. That is a subsidy, all right.\n  A carbon fee can repair that market failure by incorporating unpriced \ndamage into the costs of fossil fuels. Then the free market--not \nindustry, not government--can drive the best energy mix for the \ncountry, with everyone competing on level ground.\n  That is how Nixon's Treasury Secretary and Reagan's Secretary of \nState George Shultz sees it. He and the late Nobel laureate Gary S. \nBecker made the case for a carbon fee in the Wall Street Journal. They \nwrote:\n\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\n\n       Americans like to compete on a level playing field. All \n     players should have an equal opportunity to win based on \n     their competitive merits, not on some artificial imbalance \n     that gives someone or some group a special advantage.\n\n  Such as a $700 billion-a-year special advantage.\n  Just last week, even the CEOs of Europe's major oil companies called \non governments to institute national prices on carbon.\n  This could be a big economic win. George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary \nHank Paulson said, ``A tax on carbon emissions will unleash a wave of \ninnovation to develop technologies, lower the costs of clean energy, \nand create jobs, as we and other nations develop new energy products \nand infrastructure.''\n  It is in that spirit that I am introducing the American Opportunity \nCarbon Fee Act--a framework I hope both Republicans and Democrats can \nembrace. The bill would establish an economy-wide carbon fee on carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The fee would be assessed \nway upstream where it is easiest to administer, minimizing the universe \nof taxpayers and the compliance burden--at the coal mine, at the \nnatural gas processing station, and at the petroleum refinery.\n  Other sources of greenhouse gas emissions would be charged at \nexisting reporting requirements that are rate tied to the carbon \ndioxide equivalency of each gas. Fluorocarbons are assessed at a \nspecial rate that accounts for their high greenhouse potency. \nSequestering, utilizing, or encapsulating carbon dioxide earns you a \ncredit.\n  My bill sets the fee per ton of carbon emitted at $45 for 2016. That \nis the central range of the social cost of carbon as estimated by the \nOffice of Management and Budget. That fee would increase each year at a \nreal 2 percent. When emissions fall 80 percent below 2005 levels, the \nannual adjustment falls to inflation.\n  Border adjustments for the trade of energy-intensive goods include \ntariffs on such goods imported from countries with weaker or no carbon \npricing--to make sure we protect our industries at home--and rebates \nfor U.S. exporters of energy-intensive goods. We took care to design \nthe border adjustments to achieve harmony with World Trade Organization \nrules.\n  According to the nonpartisan group Resources for the Future, this \ncarbon fee proposal would reduce U.S. CO2 emissions by more \nthan 40 percent by 2025.\n  In addition to the environmental benefits, of course, a carbon fee \nalso generates revenue. In this case, it would generate over $2 \ntrillion in revenue over 10 years. We intend to return every dime of \nthat to the American people. Here is how.\n  First, the bill lowers the top marginal corporate income tax rate \nfrom 35 percent to 29 percent. This would cut American corporate taxes \nby almost $600 billion over the first decade.\n  Second, it provides workers with a $500 refundable tax credit--$1,000 \nfor a couple--to offset the first $500 paid each year in Social \nSecurity payroll taxes. The credit would grow with inflation. The tax \ncredits would return over $750 billion to American households over the \nfirst 10 years.\n  Third, it would give benefits to Social Security recipients, veterans \nprogram beneficiaries, and certain other groups of retirees at the same \nlevel as the tax credit. These benefits would total more than $400 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Finally, the bill would establish a block grant for States, totalling \n$20 billion in 2016 and growing with inflation, to help with low-income \nneeds, rural households, and transitioning workers. Governors in these \nStates will know best what to do with the funds. In West Virginia, for \nexample, they could use the money to transition coal workers into the \ntechnology jobs of the future or to shore up the beleaguered pension \nplans of coal miners. Rhode Island, on the other hand, might choose to \nmake homes more energy efficient. And we have a reporting mechanism for \nthe public to transparently track where the money is going to assure \nthat it is all going back to the American people.\n  The entire bill is 37 pages long--short, simple, straightforward. It \nwould cut back on the pollution that threatens dramatic changes to our \nhome planet. It would cut taxes. It would end a grievous market \ndistortion. It would start a wave of investment and innovation.\n  With this bill, Senator Schatz and I extend an open hand, or as one \nRepublican former Congressman who cares about the climate change \nproblem said: It extends an olive limb to conservatives everywhere.\n  Whether you want to pursue tax reform or support the free market for \nenergy, or as Senator Graham suggested this week, honestly address the \nreal effects of climate change, this can be a vehicle. I hope my \ncolleagues will agree with me that this is a discussion that we can \ncontinue. I look forward to trying to find a way forward that is better \nthan simply ignoring this problem, pretending that it does not exist, \nand sleepwalking through our moment in history.\n  It is time to wake up. I have an attachment here that summarizes some \nof the support from conservatives and business leaders for a carbon \nfee. I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Conservatives and Business Leaders Support a Carbon Fee\n\n\n                      Former Republican Appointees\n\n       ``A tax on carbon emissions will unleash a wave of \n     innovation to develop technologies, lower the costs of clean \n     energy and create jobs as we and other nations develop new \n     energy products and infrastructure.''--Henry M. Paulson, \n     Treasury Secretary under President George W Bush\n       ``How can you possibly create a level playing field? By \n     taking a step that makes all forms of energy bear not only \n     their immediate costs of energy, but also the costs of the \n     pollution they emit . . . So my proposal is to have a \n     revenue-neutral carbon tax.''--George P. Schultz, Secretary \n     of Labor under President Nixon, Treasury Secretary under \n     Presidents Nixon and Ford, and Secretary of State under \n     President Reagan\n       ``A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the \n     best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions . . . Rather \n     than argue against [President Obama's] proposals, our leaders \n     in Congress should endorse them and start the overdue debate \n     about what bigger steps are needed and how to achieve \n     them.''--William D. Ruckelshaus, EPA Administrator under \n     Presidents Nixon and Reagan; Lee M. Thomas, EPA Administrator \n     under President Reagan; William K. Reilly, EPA Administrator \n     under President George H. W. Bush; and Christine Todd \n     Whitman, EPA Administrator under President George W. Bush\n\n\n                    Conservative Members of Congress\n\n       ``I am no scientist, but I've traveled throughout the world \n     with Senator McCain and others, and seen the effects of a \n     warming planet. . . . I've been told by a lot of business \n     leaders in South Carolina, `Senator Graham, once you price \n     carbon in a reasonable way, this green economy that we're \n     hoping for really will begin to flourish.''--Senator Lindsey \n     Graham (R-SC)\n       ``I wish we would just talk about a carbon tax, 100 percent \n     of which would be returned to the American people.''--Senator \n     Bob Corker (R-TN)\n       ``If there's one economic axiom, it's that if you want less \n     of something, you tax it. Clearly, it's in our interest to \n     move away from carbon.''-- Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ)\n       ``We should eliminate all the subsidies. No more Solyndras. \n     No more production tax credits for wind. No more credits for \n     electric vehicles. No more special tax provisions for oil and \n     gas. Level the playing field. The big challenge is reaching \n     fellow conservatives and convincing them that the biggest \n     subsidy of all may be to belch and burn into the trash dump \n     in the sky--for free. That lack of accountability may be the \n     biggest subsidy of them all.''--former Representative Bob \n     Inglis (R-SC)\n\n\n                        Former Republican Aides\n\n       ``The scientists tell us that world temperatures are rising \n     because humans are emitting carbon into the atmosphere. Basic \n     economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally \n     get less of it. So if we want to reduce global emissions of \n     carbon, we need a global carbon tax.''--N. Gregory Mankiw, \n     economic advisor to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and \n     Harvard economist\n       Using a carbon tax to fund a payroll tax cut ``would be \n     very good for the economy and as an adjunct, it would reduce \n     also carbon emissions into the environment.''--Arthur B. \n     Laffer, economic advisor to President Reagan\n       ``Although a general carbon fuel tax is moot for the \n     moment, the idea will not go away. If carbon dioxide \n     emissions are to be reduced further in the U.S., such a tax \n     will achieve the goal with less economic waste than new \n     bureaucratic hurdles.''--Martin Feldstein, former Chairman of \n     President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors\n\n\n              Conservative Thought-leaders and Economists\n\n       [Why a carbon tax?] ``First, it is a less expensive, more \n     efficient and more effective\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\n     policy than the status quo. . . . Second, greenhouse gas \n     emissions impose risk. . . . Third, it is the principled \n     conservative position. Government's role is to protect the \n     rights to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of \n     happiness.''--Jerry Taylor, former vice president at the Cato \n     Institute and cofounder of the Niskanen Center\n       ``We have a unique opportunity to end the rancorous debate \n     about climate change, a debate that is poisoning the air--the \n     political air, that is--and inhibiting progress on two \n     fronts: progress on addressing the possibility that we are on \n     the road to a catastrophic warming of the globe, and progress \n     on reforming our anti-growth tax structure, which is so \n     inequitable that it is straining the public's belief in the \n     fairness of capitalism and what we like to call `the American \n     Dream.'

SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPOSITION \n                   OF ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC \n                   PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (in this \n     section referred to as the ``DPRK'') tested nuclear weapons \n     on 3 separate occasions, in October 2006, in May 2009, and in \n     February 2013.\n       (2) Nuclear experts have reported that the DPRK may \n     currently have as many as 20 nuclear warheads and has the \n     potential to possess as many as 100 warheads within the next \n     5 years.\n       (3) According to the 2014 Department of Defense report, \n     ``Military and Security Developments Involving the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea'' (in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``2014 DoD report''), the DPRK has proliferated \n     nuclear technology to Libya via the proliferation network of \n     Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan.\n       (4) According to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea also \n     provided Syria with nuclear reactor technology until 2007.''.\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\n       (5) On September 6, 2007, as part of ``Operation Orchard'', \n     the Israeli Air Force destroyed the suspected nuclear \n     facility in Syria.\n       (6) According to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea has \n     exported conventional and ballistic missile-related \n     equipment, components, materials, and technical assistance to \n     countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.''.\n       (7) On November 29, 1987, DPRK agents planted explosive \n     devices onboard Korean Air flight 858, which killed all 115 \n     passengers and crew on board.\n       (8) On March 26, 2010, the DPRK fired upon and sank the \n     South Korean warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her crew.\n       (9) On November 23, 2010, the DPRK shelled South Korea's \n     Yeonpyeong Island, killing 4 South Korean citizens.\n       (10) On February 7, 2014, the United Nations Commission of \n     Inquiry on human rights in DPRK (in this subsection referred \n     to as the ``Commission of Inquiry'') released a report \n     detailing the atrocious human rights record of the DPRK.\n       (11) Dr. Michael Kirby, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry, \n     stated on March 17, 2014, ``The Commission of Inquiry has \n     found systematic, widespread, and grave human rights \n     violations occurring in the Democratic People's Republic of \n     Korea. It has also found a disturbing array of crimes against \n     humanity. These crimes are committed against inmates of \n     political and other prison camps; against starving \n     populations; against religious believers; against persons who \n     try to flee the country--including those forcibly repatriated \n     by China.''.\n       (12) Dr. Michael Kirby also stated, ``These crimes arise \n     from policies established at the highest level of the State. \n     They have been committed, and continue to take place in the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because the policies, \n     institutions, and patterns of impunity that lie at their \n     heart remain in place. The gravity, scale, duration, and \n     nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country \n     reveal a totalitarian State that does not have any parallel \n     in the contemporary world.''.\n       (13) The Commission of Inquiry also notes, ``Since 1950, \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has engaged in the \n     systematic abduction, denial of repatriation, and subsequent \n     enforced disappearance of persons from other countries on a \n     large scale and as a matter of State policy. Well over \n     200,000 persons, including children, who were brought from \n     other countries to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n     may have become victims of enforced disappearance,'' and \n     states that the DPRK has failed to account or address this \n     injustice in any way.\n       (14) According to reports and analysis from organizations \n     such as the International Network for the Human Rights of \n     North Korean Overseas Labor, the Korea Policy Research \n     Center, NK Watch, the Asian Institute for Policy Studies, the \n     Center for International and Strategic Studies, and the \n     George W. Bush Institute, there may currently be as many as \n     100,000 North Korean overseas laborers in various nations \n     around the world.\n       (15) Such forced North Korean laborers are often subjected \n     to harsh working conditions under the direct supervision of \n     DPRK officials, and their salaries contribute to anywhere \n     from $150,000,000 to $230,000,000 a year to the DPRK state \n     coffers.\n       (16) According to the Director of National Intelligence's \n     2015 Worldwide Threat Assessment, ``North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the \n     United States and to the security environment in East \n     Asia.''.\n       (17) The Worldwide Threat Assessment states, ``North Korea \n     has also expanded the size and sophistication of its \n     ballistic missile forces, ranging from close-range ballistic \n     missiles to ICBMs, while continuing to conduct test launches. \n     In 2014, North Korea launched an unprecedented number of \n     ballistic missiles.''.\n       (18) On December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation declared that the DPRK was responsible for a \n     cyberattack on Sony Pictures conducted on November 24, 2014.\n       (19) From 1988 to 2008, the DPRK was designated by the \n     United States Government as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (20) The DPRK is currently in violation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), 1874 \n     (2009), 2087 (2013), and 2094 (2013).\n       (21) The DPRK repeatedly violated agreements with the \n     United States and the other so-called Six-Party Talks \n     partners (the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Russian \n     Federation, and the People's Republic of China) designed to \n     halt its nuclear weapons program, while receiving significant \n     concessions, including fuel, oil, and food aid.\n       (22) The Six-Party Talks have not been held since December \n     2008.\n       (23) On May 9, 2015, the DPRK claimed that it has test-\n     fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the DPRK represents a serious threat to the national \n     security of the United States and United States allies in \n     East Asia and to international peace and stability, and \n     grossly violates the human rights of its own people;\n       (2) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury should impose additional sanctions against the DPRK, \n     including targeting its financial assets around the world, \n     specific designations relating to human rights abuses, and a \n     redesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terror; and\n       (3) the President should not resume the negotiations with \n     the DPRK, either bilaterally or as part of the Six-Party \n     Talks, without strict preconditions, including that the \n     DPRK--\n       (A) adhere to its denuclearization commitments outlined in \n     the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks;\n       (B) commit to halting its ballistic missile programs and \n     its proliferation activities;\n       (C) cease military provocations; and\n       (D) measurably and significantly improve its human rights \n     record.\n\n    TITLE II--ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n                   Subtitle A--Organizational Matters\n\n     SEC. 5201.

and\n       (iii) the Export Express Program, established under \n     7(a)(34) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(34)), \n     under which--\n\n       (I) exporters are provided with a streamlined method to \n     obtain financing backed by the Small Business Administration \n     for loans and lines of credit of not more than $500,000;\n       (II) lenders use their own credit decision process and loan \n     documentation;\n       (III) the Small Business Administration determines \n     eligibility and provides a loan approval in 36 hours or less;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 198, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 198) commemorating the 150th \n     anniversaries of the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, often \n     referred to as the ``Second Founding'' of the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on September 17, 1787, George Washington, \nJames Madison, and their fellow framers made the momentous decision to \nsign the Constitution and send it along to the American people for \nratification--marking a new beginning in our Nation's profound \nexperiment in democracy.\n  While the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 \nestablished the firm foundation for our democracy, it was not complete \nbecause it did not address the vexing issue of slavery. It would take \nmore than seven decades and a bloody civil war before our founding \ncharter would right that wrong.\n  This year marks the sesquicentennial, or the 150th anniversary, of \nthe Thirteenth Amendment, which, along with the Fourteenth and \nFifteenth Amendments, has been described by scholars as our Nation's \n``Second Founding.'' Ratified by President Lincoln and his generation \nafter the Civil War, these second founding amendments transformed our \noriginal charter by ending slavery, banning racial discrimination in \nvoting, and elevating liberty and equality to a central place in our \nconstitutional order. While we rightly celebrate our original founding \ncharter, we have often overlooked the importance of these subsequent \namendments, which has served as the bedrock and inspiration to \nprocuring equality for racial minorities and women.\n  On January 31, 1865, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment to end \nslavery and sent it to the States for ratification. Passage of that \namendment was by no means an easy feat. As brilliantly captured by \nSteven Spielberg in his film ``Lincoln,'' the final vote was every bit \nas dramatic as the film's portrayal. Doris Kearns Goodwin's award-\nwinning book, ``Team of Rivals,'' noted that before this historic vote: \n``Every available foot of space, both in the galleries and on the floor \nof the House, was crowded at an early hour,'' and the attendees \nincluded Chief Justice Chase and the members of the Supreme Court, \nalong with Secretary of State William Seward.\n  Without the support of five Democrats who became the swing votes, the \namendment would never have passed. One Pennsylvania congressman, \nknowing that his vote could very well cost him his seat, said right \nbefore he cast his vote that ``If by my action today I dig my political \ngrave, I will descend into it without a murmur.'' I am proud to say \nthat both of Vermont's Senators voted in favor of the amendment, \nincluding Senator Solomon Foot, who served as President pro tempore of \nthe Senate during the Civil War, and Senator Jacob Collamer, who was \ncalled the ``Green Mountain Socrates'' by Senator Charles Sumner of \nMassachusetts. Upon the amendment's passage, Secretary of War Edwin \nStanton ordered 100 guns to fire with their heaviest charges while the \nnames of those who voted in favor of the amendment were read aloud \nbecause ``History [would] embalm them in great honor.''\n  Upon passage, President Lincoln received praise from even his most \nardent critics, including the prominent abolitionist William Lloyd \nGarrison, who once burned a copy of the Constitution while calling it a \nproslavery document.\n  While this year marks the 150th anniversary of the passage and \nratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, we should celebrate the \nsecond founding amendments together, for they are inextricably bound. \nThe Fourteenth Amendment, passed in 1866 and ratified in 1868, is \nperhaps the single most influential amendment passed after the Bill of \nRights. This week also marks the 149th anniversary of the passage of \nthe 14th Amendment in the Senate. It was under the command of the \nFourteenth Amendment providing equal protection for all citizens that \nthe Supreme Court held that separate was inherently unequal in Brown v. \nBoard of Education; that marriage is a fundamental right that cannot be \ntainted with racial discrimination in Loving v. Virginia; that women \ncould not be denied admission into an all-male military institute \nbecause of their gender in United States v. Virginia; and many others, \nincluding hopefully, that the fundamental right to marriage extends to \nall individuals regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity in \nObergefell v. Hodges.\n  Ratification of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot be \nseparated from the Fifteenth, which outlawed racial discrimination in \nvoting. In 1865, one month after the end of the Civil War, William \nLloyd Garrison called for disbanding an anti-slavery society of which \nFrederick Douglass and others were members. Prescient as ever, and \nabout 100 years before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, Frederick \nDouglass responded that ``Slavery is not abolished until the black man \nhas the ballot.''\n  As we celebrate the second founding amendments, we must also take \ntime to recognize that issues of race continue to plague our Nation. \nAnd as far as we have come, we still have a lot further to go in our \nmarch toward a more perfect union. There are some who would confine the \nfight for civil rights to a bygone era. They see it as a remnant of the \ndistant past in our Nation's history. And they cite the election of an \nAfrican American president as evidence that we have somehow achieved \nfull equality under the law. But we know the struggle for equality and \nfor civil rights is ongoing. The fight for a more perfect union is one \nthat every generation must contribute to--including this one.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 198) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/10/senate-section/article/S4061-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 11, 2015\n\n  Mr. FLAKE.
