Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                           Clay Hunt SAV Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last night I joined Members of both \nparties to recognize the latest bipartisan achievement for the American \npeople.\n  The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which will provide important support to our \nNation's veterans, passed the House and Senate with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. It is on its way to President Obama's desk, and I \nam confident he will sign it.\n\n\n                             Keystone Bill\n\n  Mr. President, today the House of Representatives is expected to pass \nyet another bipartisan bill for him to sign, the Keystone jobs bill. It \nis just common sense. That is why this bipartisan legislation already \npassed the Senate with support from both parties. That is why labor \nunions support it, and that is why the American people support it. \nAmericans know construction of this infrastructure project would pump \nbillions into the economy and support thousands of good jobs. They also \nknow America could achieve this with, as the President's own State \nDepartment has indicated, minimal environmental impact.\n  Americans are urging President Obama not to interfere in the review \nprocess for political reasons any longer. Americans are urging the \nPresident to finally heed scientific conclusions his own State \nDepartment already reached. Let American workers build this \ninfrastructure project. Sign this jobs and infrastructure bill.\n  Powerful special interests may be demanding that the President veto \nKeystone jobs, but we hope he will not. If the President does \nultimately bow to these special interest demands, that is a discussion \nwe can have then. But either way Americans should know this: The new \nCongress will not stop pursuing good ideas.\n  This new majority is committed to refocusing Washington on the \nconcerns of the middle class, and the passage of bipartisan bills such \nas Keystone, Clay Hunt, and Keystone jobs shows we are doing just that.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. President, on a different matter, Democrats are blocking Homeland \nSecurity funding in order to defend Executive overreach the President \nhas said himself, on many different occasions, he didn't have. As I \nindicated yesterday, this is the reason the Senate can't move forward, \nso it needs to come to an end. This is the simplest and most obvious \nway it can.\n  Many Democrats previously indicated opposition to the kinds of \noverreach described by President Obama himself as unwise and unfair. So \nall they have to do is back up those words with some action. If \nDemocrats claim to be against overreach and claim to be for funding the \ncritical activities of the Department of Homeland Security, then there \nis no reason for them to continue their party's filibuster.\n  So vote with us to allow the Senate to actually debate Homeland \nSecurity funding instead. We have already offered a fair and open \ndebate that would allow for amendments from both parties. If the bill \nneeds to be amended, that is when it could be, when we actually get on \nthe bill and offer amendments.\n  This is about Democrats being confronted with a choice: filibuster \nfunding for Homeland Security to protect overreach of President Obama \nhimself, referred to as ``ignoring the law'' or allow the Senate to \ndebate, vote, and amend the very funding they claim to want.\n\n\n                              AUMF Funding\n\n  Mr. President, one final and critically important matter. This \nmorning we received the President's proposed authorization for the use \nof military\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\nforce against ISIL and its affiliates. It was clear from the outset \nthat a successful military campaign to defeat ISIL would require a \nmultiyear effort, so it is certainly in order for Congress to debate an \nauthorization such as this.\n  Because Congress must meet its responsibility to decide whether our \nmilitary should use force, the Senate will review the President's \nrequest thoughtfully. Individual Senators and committees of \njurisdiction will review it carefully, and they will listen carefully \nto the advice of military commanders as they consider the best strategy \nfor defeating ISIL. Because this decision demands such serious \nconsideration, I want our Members to have an early opportunity to \ndiscuss the President's request. That is why later today our \nconference, the Republican conference, will meet for a discussion led \nby Senators Corker and McCain.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n               Recognition of the Acting Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Paul). The assistant Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Necessary Absence\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am standing in today for the Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, who is absent for a medical procedure. He was \nwith us yesterday and will be returning after the break. We wish him a \nspeedy recovery. He has gone through quite a bit after the accident \nthat he endured on January 1, and we wish him the very best and quick \nrecovery.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. President, we are going to have a chance to do something this \nweek that is important, to fund the Department of Homeland Security. \nThis was a department created after 9/11 for obvious purposes. We never \nwant America to be vulnerable again to that type of extremist terrorist \nattack and all the death and destruction it brought with it.\n  So on a bipartisan basis we created this Department. Twenty-two \ndifferent agencies were merged into one so we would have a common \neffort to keep America safe and secure, and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has done a great job. Secretary Jeh Johnson, who is currently \nthe leader of that agency, is an extraordinarily gifted, talented man, \nand he is doing his best to keep America safe.\n  We should do everything we can to keep it safe, too, and that means \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives need to do their job when \nit comes to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  As everyone knows, when we talked about funding the agencies of \ngovernment this past December after the election, there was only one \nagency, one department, which the Republicans singled out and said we \nwill not properly fund this one department.\n  What was it? The Department of Homeland Security. I don't understand \nthis.\n  If the Department of Homeland Security has the singular \nresponsibility of keeping America safe, why would we risk the security \nand safety of America by not properly funding the Department? But the \nHouse Republicans insisted on that position and Senate Republicans \nbacked them up.\n  Why would they jeopardize America's security over the funding of DHS? \nSo the Republicans could engage in a political debate over President \nObama's immigration policy. It is an important debate. It is a worthy \ndebate. There is no reason we shouldn't engage in this debate. But why \nwould the Republicans insist that this debate be at the expense of \nfunding the Department of Homeland Security? It doesn't make any sense. \nIn fact, we are running a great risk by what we call continuing \nresolutions instead of regular budgetary appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Secretary Johnson has talked to us about what is going to happen if \nwe don't properly fund the Department of Homeland Security. There are \ngrants that are given through DHS to fire departments and police \ndepartments across America to train their personnel, to upgrade their \nequipment, and to be ready, God forbid, for the next challenge that \nfaces America.\n  Yet the Republicans insist on stopping that grantmaking to the local \npolice departments in your community and mine--and to the fire \ndepartments--so they can engage in a debate with the President over \nimmigration.\n  What is it about the President's immigration policy that infuriates \nthe Republicans? Could it be that the President has said he wants to \nprioritize deportations in America so that we, in fact, are going to \ndeport those who are the most dangerous in the United States? I hope \nthat is not it because the President's position is something most \nAmericans would endorse, heartily endorse.\n  Could it be they object to the President's proposal that those who \nare here undocumented--parents of American citizens and parents of \nlegal residents--that those who are here undocumented step forward, pay \ntheir taxes, submit themselves to a criminal background check in order \nto have a 2-year temporary work permit? I doubt many Americans would \ndisagree with that. It would mean these tax-paying workers would be \nchecked, and if there is any problem, deported.\n  The Republicans want to stop that. They disagree with the President's \nExecutive order. I think we ought to have that debate but not at the \nexpense of funding the Department of Homeland Security, but that is \ntheir position.\n  So in 16 days the Department of Homeland Security runs out of money. \nThe Department entrusted with keeping America safe from terrorism runs \nout of money.\n  What are we going to do about it? There is something very easy we can \nturn to. It is on the Senate Calendar of Business. It is on every desk \non the floor or available to every Senator: S. 272, a bill introduced \nby Senators Shaheen and Mikulski to make the appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to give them the budget they need to \nprotect America. It takes out all of the immigration riders insisted on \nby the House and takes us down to the basics.\n  So are we going to fund the Department of Homeland Security?\n  Well, the Republican majority leader has insisted he will stand in \nthe way of funding DHS unless we can get into this political debate \nabout immigration. I think that is shortsighted.\n  Senator Reid came to the floor a few days ago and said: We are \nprepared to engage in this debate on immigration--but not at the \nexpense of the Department of Homeland Security. We have had three votes \non the floor of the Senate and this effort by the Republicans has \nfallen woefully short in every single vote to receive the 60 votes \nnecessary.\n  So why does the majority leader insist on sticking with this \napproach? It is hard to explain. It could be that within his own \ncaucus--and maybe he personally thinks that the efforts of the \nPresident to protect certain people from deportation are just plain \nwrong.\n  One of those efforts is one I heartily support myself. It is called \nDACA. DACA was an Executive order issued by the President in 2012. In \nthat Executive order the President said those who are eligible under \nthe DREAM Act would be given protection from deportation.\n  The DREAM Act was a piece of legislation I introduced 14 years ago \nwhich said: If someone was brought to America as an infant, a toddler, \na small child, and they stayed in America, had no serious criminal \nissue, finished high school, and they were prepared to enlist in the \nmilitary or go on to college, they would get a path to legalization. \nThat is what the DREAM Act said. It has never become law.\n  But these young people, we estimate 2 million nationwide, are left in \nlimbo. They came to America, were brought to America at an early age, \ngrew up in America, went to American schools, pledged allegiance to our \nAmerican flag, sang our national anthem, and believed they were \nAmericans. Then they were told, sorry, but you don't have the necessary \ndocumentation. You are not here legally.\n  So they are left in limbo. They have nowhere to turn. Under the laws \nof the United States they are subject to deportation. President Obama \nsaid on a 2-year basis we will protect these young people from \ndeportation. They will have a background check, they will pay their \nfees, and on a 2-year basis they can live in America without fear of \ndeportation and work in America or go to school in America. Those are \nthe DREAMers. That is the DACA provision which the Republicans are \nopposing in the House of Representatives. It\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\nis the provision which the majority leader insists we vote on before we \ncan fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  I think it is instructive to introduce these DREAMers to Members of \nthe Senate who may not know who they are, and I want to introduce two \nof them today: Nelson and John Magdaleno. Nelson is on the left in the \nsuit, and John is on the right on his graduation today. They were \nbrought to the United States from Venezuela when Nelson was 11 and John \n9 years old. They were both honor students at Lakeside High School in \nAtlanta, GA. In high school John was the fourth highest officer and \ncommander of the Air Honor Society in his Junior ROTC.\n  Nelson and John both went to the Georgia Institute of Technology, one \nof the most selective engineering schools in America. In 2012 Nelson \ngraduated from Georgia Tech with honors and a major in computer \nengineering.\n  President Obama established the DACA Program shortly after Nelson \ngraduated from Georgia Tech. Thanks to DACA, Nelson has been working \nsince 2012 as a computer engineer for a Fortune 500 semiconductor \ncorporation.\n  John also received DACA in 2012, while he was still a student at \nGeorgia Tech. He then worked for 2 years as a researcher in a \nbiomedical engineering lab at Georgia Tech, researching glaucoma, one \nof the leading causes of blindness.\n  In 2014 John graduated from Georgia Tech with a major in chemical and \nbiomedical engineering and with the highest honors. He is now working \nas a process engineer with a Fortune 500 company.\n  Nelson Magdaleno wrote me a letter, and here is what he said:\n\n       To me DACA means an opportunity to be able to live my \n     dreams and contribute to society in ways that I could not \n     have imagined. DACA means one of my life goals, owning my own \n     company, could be a possibility in the future. DACA means a \n     chance. DACA means the American Dream.\n\n  His brother John wrote, and here is what he said:\n\n       I consider an American to be someone who loves, and \n     wholeheartedly dedicates themselves to the development of \n     this country. From age nine, I have made the United States my \n     home, and it has made me the man I am today. I proudly call \n     myself an American.\n\n  When you hear the stories of these two young men, who attended \ncollege and finished without any government assistance or loans, who \nworked hard to get their degrees in challenging fields such as computer \nengineering, who went to one of the best schools in America, who now \nhave talents and skills that create opportunities not only for \ndiscovery but for innovation and entrepreneurship, I wonder: What are \nthe Republicans thinking when they say these two individuals don't \nbelong in America, that they need to be deported, that they need to be \nsent back to Venezuela, a country neither of them really knows. Is that \nthe answer to America's future? Is it to export the most talented \nminds, the hardest working individuals, and that the amazing \nachievements they have made in their lives are to be ignored? I don't \nthink so.\n  I think Americans by and large believe in fairness. Fairness says we \nwill not hold the children of the parents who were responsible for \nwrongdoing responsible themselves. If you are pulled over for speeding, \nyou may get a ticket. But it would be fundamentally unfair to give one \nto the child sitting in a car seat in the car. They weren't driving. \nThese kids weren't driving either. Their parents came to America \nwithout any permission from the children. But they set up a life here \nand they made a good life here. Should we now penalize these children \nbecause their parents came to America?\n  That doesn't make sense. Frankly, it doesn't represent what this \ncountry is all about. We are a nation of immigrants, and the immigrants \nwho come here make a difference. They bring not only a determination \nfor a better life, but they are risk takers. They leave it all behind \nfrom wherever they were. They come to America and risk it all in the \nhopes they will have a better life and, even more importantly, that \ntheir children will. That is who we are. That is what America is all \nabout and has been from the beginning of time.\n  Why would we turn our backs on this heritage? Why would we ignore the \nopportunity these young people bring? That is the Republican position, \nat least the one stated by the House of Representatives. It has been \nsummarily rejected now three different times on the floor of the \nSenate. Yet the majority leader comes to us today and says he may do it \nagain.\n  This is not fair to the Department of Homeland Security, it is not \nfair to John and Nelson, and it is not fair to this country. Let us do \nthe right thing. Let's fund the Department of Homeland Security before \nwe leave for any recess. Let's get it done so that Department can \nprotect America.\n  The majority leader talked about what we have achieved here--the \nKeystone Canadian pipeline act, which was the highest priority of the \nSenate Republicans. TransCanada, a Canadian corporation, would be able \nto transport oil from Canada to a refinery in Texas and then export it \nfrom the United States. There are benefits of construction, of course, \nand 35 permanent pipeline jobs, of course. But in the end the refined \noil coming in from Canada will not benefit the American economy. We had \nan amendment on the floor that would address that very issue, and every \nsingle Republican said we will not vote to keep that refined oil \nproduct in America.\n  We also suggested that if we are going to build a pipeline in \nAmerica, we use American steel. Let's put American workers to work at \nthe steel mills to make the steel that is necessary to build the \npipeline, and that too was rejected by the Republicans. They said no, \ninsisting on American steel won't be part of this so-called pipeline \njobs projects.\n  Well, I think there are better ways to get the economy moving forward \nand to create more jobs. One of them is infrastructure, and I am sure \nwe will debate it at a later time.\n  The other thing mentioned by the majority leader was the Clay Hunt \nbill, which was a bill that was needed and important, related to \nveteran suicide, and it passed overwhelmingly, to no one's surprise.\n  Why was this bill held up in the previous Congress? There was an \nobjection to bringing the bill to the floor by a Republican Senator--by \na Republican Senator. There was no obstruction in passing this bill on \nthe Democratic side, and I am glad it passed. I know the President is \nabout to sign it.\n  The other thing I want to mention is that it is unfortunate we are \nleaving this week for the 1-week Presidents Day recess. We are leaving \nat a time when the nomination of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General \nof the United States is still pending. She has been pending, I \nunderstand, longer than any nominee for Attorney General in recent \nhistory.\n  I went through the hearing with her and there was no opposition--\nnone. They asked the witnesses who were brought in if any one of them \nobjected to her being Attorney General, and not one would raise their \nhand. There were no objections. There is no objection to this woman \nserving our Nation. She has been the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York. She has done an amazing job. Why are they holding \nher up? What is the purpose in this? We should approve her nomination \nbefore we leave this week.\n\n\n                       Pullman National Monument\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a Chicago neighborhood that has played a \nsignificant part in our country's African-American and labor history is \nbeing recognized next week in an exciting way. Next Thursday President \nObama is going to declare the Pullman Historic District on the South \nSide of Chicago a national monument. This is the first time a unit of \nthe National Park Service would be established in Chicago.\n  This designation is the result of a collaborative effort by the \nbusinesses, residents, and organizations of the Pullman area in Chicago \nto restore and preserve this unique community. The people who are part \nof the Pullman legacy helped shape America as we know it.\n  The Pullman neighborhood includes almost 90 percent of the original \nbuildings the railcar magnate George Pullman built a century ago for \nhis factory town to build railroad cars. It was the birthplace of the \nNation's first black labor union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car \nPorters.\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\n  Pullman workers fought for fair labor conditions in the late 19th \ncentury, and Pullman porters helped advance America's civil rights \nmovement.\n  During the economic depression of the 1890s, the Pullman community \nwas the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in the United \nStates, which helped to lead to the creation of Labor Day as a national \nholiday. The Pullman porters are credited with creating the African-\nAmerican middle class.\n  I have supported this designation for some time and have introduced \nlegislation with my colleague Senator Kirk and with Congressman Robin \nKelly to make the site a national historical monument.\n  Alderman Anthony Beale of Chicago's 9th Ward has worked hard to \ngarner support for the recognition of Pullman. Many others in Chicago \nhelped advance the proposal: Eleanor Gorski, with the Chicago \nDepartment of Planning and Development; David Doig, president of \nChicago Neighborhood Initiatives, Lynn McClure and LeAaron Foley with \nthe National Parks Conservation Association, and many others who drew \nattention to the historical significance of this neighborhood.\n  The Pullman national monument will be an important addition to the \ncurrent National Park System. It highlights stories from communities \nthat are rarely represented in other national parks. The park's urban \nlocation on Chicago's South Side makes it easily accessible to millions \nof people by public transportation--again setting Pullman apart from \nother national parks.\n  The National Park Service is associated with national wonders such as \ngeysers and forests. Urban national parks are few and far between. With \nthis designation, the Pullman neighborhood is joining the ranks of the \nNational Mall and the Statue of Liberty as national parks accessible in \nurban areas. The monument will also provide an opportunity for tourism \nand job creation--much needed in this community.\n  It is only right that Pullman be preserved and honored as a part of \nour National Park System. I commend the President for this decision to \nshowcase the prominence and legacy of Pullman in our Nation's history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes today to talk \nabout my growing concern over President Obama's policies regarding \nseveral major national security issues.\n  Of course, the President has just today sent over to Congress an \nauthorization for use of military force against ISIL, the Islamic \nState, but over the past 6 years, as the quantity and frequency of \ninternational crises have grown, there have been some very clear trends \nthat have emerged from this administration's foreign policy.\n  First, we have seen what might be dubbed the red-line syndrome in \nwhich the President uses stern language and strong rhetoric toward a \nhostile foreign regime or terrorist group and then backs it up with \neither total inaction or ineffectual action, thus inviting not respect, \nnot fear, but ridicule.\n  The most infamous example, of course, is when the President remarked \nthat the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al Assad of Syria would \nconstitute a red line and then, after Assad had crossed that red line \nand used chemical weapons on his own people, the President did \nessentially nothing in response, thus damaging the United States' \ncredibility on the world stage in the eyes of both our friends and our \nfoes.\n  And I don't have to remind the Senate what has happened since that \ntime. More than 200,000 Syrians have lost their lives in this terrible \ncivil war, and millions of Syrians have become displaced, either \ninternally within the country or outside of the country in refugee \ncamps, such as those I visited in Turkey and others in Lebanon and \nJordan, just to name a few places.\n  So there are consequences associated with tough talk and no action.\n  The second pattern I have observed is what might be what my dad \ncalled, when I was growing up, paralysis by analysis. In other words, \nthis is what some have called just plain dithering.\n  I think what the President seems to regard as a deliberative process \nand as a virtue others call dithering or paralysis by analysis. We can \nthink of numerous examples, starting with the snail-like pace of the \nPresident's decision process early in his administration with regard to \nwhether to surge U.S. forces in Afghanistan and, if so, what long-term \nrole we should play there.\n  Again, in today's Washington Post, when I got up and was getting my \nfirst cup of coffee, I was reading that now apparently the \nadministration is starting to reassess again their commitment to \nAfghanistan.\n  But the list of the President's paralysis by analysis is lengthy. The \nsituation in Ukraine is another painful example. In Ukraine, the \nPresident has stood idly by and watched Russian President Vladimir \nPutin carry out a de facto invasion of Ukraine, starting with Crimea, \nand continuing today in eastern Ukraine.\n  From ``mysterious little green men'' to columns of full-up Russian \ntanks, the hand of Putin in the Ukraine has been unmistakable. It has \nbeen the most blatant land grab by a force that Europe has seen in \nquite some time. Yet the best President Obama has been able to do is \nmore hollow rhetoric.\n  Now there have been modest economic assistance and nonlethal military \nresources to Ukraine's Government, and there have been some sanctions, \nbut they apparently have not worked to dissuade Putin.\n  The Senate might recall what I recall when the President of Ukraine \ncame to speak to a joint session of Congress just a few months ago when \nhe asked for more aid, lethal aid to fight and defend his country. But \nhe did say: Thank you for the blankets. Obviously you can't win a war \nwith blankets.\n  By the way, the President's policies toward Russia have been an \nunabated disaster, dating all the way back to his 2009 reset of \nrelations with Russia, and Vladimir Putin has taken full advantage of \nthe opening that he sees and the lack of resoluteness on the part of \nthe U.S. Government.\n  We have little to show for this so-called reset except realities such \nas this: the aforementioned Russian annexation of Ukraine, a Russian \nviolation with impunity of President Reagan's landmark intermediate-\nrange nuclear arms treaty, which now poses a direct threat to the \nsecurity of our NATO allies in Europe.\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\n  We have also seen a steady flow of Russian weapons and other support \nto the blood-thirsty butcher of Syria, Bashar al Assad, who, as I \nmentioned earlier, has slaughtered more than 200,000 of his own country \nmen and women.\n  The President's paralysis by analysis has also infected his \nincoherent approach in dealing with the terrorist army of ISIL, the so-\ncalled Islamic State. In 2011, after he pulled negotiations with the \nIraqis on a status-of-forces agreement, the Obama administration \nproceeded with a misguided plan to pull the plug on the American \npresence in that country, thus squandering the blood and treasure that \nAmericans invested in trying to liberate the Iraqis and provide them \nwith a better future.\n  While it is true the Iraqis had not agreed to the U.S. conditions to \nan enduring American presence, including legal immunity for our troops, \nthe administration simply gave up and failed to expend the political \ncapital necessary to secure a status-of-forces agreement and to \npreserve the security gains in Iraq that, as I have said, had been paid \nfor by American blood and treasure.\n  The resulting security vacuum, coupled with an incompetent and \ncorrupt Prime Minister, set the conditions for ISIL to make alarming \ngains in territory and power in Iraq last year.\n  As chaos took hold in Syria, ISIL and other terrorist groups were \nflourishing. We know that in 2012 many of the President's most senior \nNational Security Advisers--including then-CIA Director David Petraeus, \nthen-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, and then-Secretary of Defense Leon \nPanetta--all of them recommended at that time that the President \ninitiate a program to arm vetted moderate Syrian rebels.\n  President Obama refused, publicly remarking just 1 year ago that \nISIL, the Islamic State in the Levant, was the JV team of terrorist \ngroups. Today, of course, the irony is the President has now sent us an \nauthorization for the use of military force to fight this JV team, as \nhe called it 1 year ago.\n  Then last summer, when the challenge had grown many times more \ncomplex and more difficult, the President dusted off the idea and moved \nahead with it.\n  This is not exactly a picture of decisive leadership, nor is it \ndesigned to instill respect--indeed, fear--in our enemies nor \nconfidence in our allies.\n  Today, with ISIL growing in strength in our region, our Commander in \nChief cannot even bring himself to call the evil they represent by \ntheir rightful name. He refuses to acknowledge ISIL is a radical \nIslamist group, even after these jihadists have beheaded numerous \nAmerican citizens, other Western captives, and burned alive a pilot \nfrom one of our closest allies, Jordan.\n  And then, of course, there is the most recent tragic news about Kayla \nMueller, the young humanitarian aid worker who tragically lost her life \nin the hands of ISIL terrorists, after being held captive in Syria \nsince 2013. Kayla, from Phoenix, AZ, had been assisting the group \nDoctors Without Borders.\n  In 2011, in a video she posted on YouTube, remarking about the \nslaughter by Bashar al Assad of his own citizens in Syria, and the \nrampage of ISIL, she said that ``silence is participation in this \ncrime.''\n  Well, the President chose to use his recent speech at the National \nPrayer Breakfast that I attended, along with my wife and friends from \nDallas, to paint a picture of moral equivalence between the barbaric \nentity known as ISIL and Christian crusaders from centuries ago. I have \nto say I am not the only one, apparently, who was confused by this \nequivalency or this comparison the President used during his remarks \nthat morning.\n  This week, as Congress has now received the President's draft \nauthorization for use of military force against ISIL, most of us still \nlack a clear understanding of the strategy the President seeks to \nemploy in order to degrade and destroy this threat.\n  Even though the military campaign began last August, I know the \nPresiding Officer has served with distinction in the U.S. Marine \nCorps--and one of the things I hope the President will answer is how he \nhopes to defeat ISIL with just airstrikes. Indeed, as I understand from \nthe military experts, you can't hope to win a conflict like this by \nblowing up things with airstrikes. You actually have to hold the \nterritory so the enemy doesn't reoccupy it once you have moved on \nsomewhere else.\n  The strategy we have heard so much about clearing, holding, and \nbuilding, which seems to be an essential strategy when it comes to \nwinning a conflict such as this, is nowhere to be seen in the \nPresident's strategy to have airstrike after airstrike after airstrike.\n  So I hope the President will enlighten us on what strategy he seeks \nto employ in order to degrade and destroy ISIL. If not, I trust that \nMembers of the Senate on both sides of the aisle will offer their ideas \nabout the kind of strategy that could have a reasonable chance of \nsuccess.\n  I personally am reserving judgment on this authorization for use of \nmilitary force until I learn more about the President's strategy and \nhear more about what sort of consensus we can have in the Senate about \na strategy that has a reasonable chance of success.\n  I take very seriously--as I know every single Member of this Senate \ndoes--the granting of authority to use military force, putting our men \nand women in uniform in harm's way to protect not only us but our \nnational security interests around the world. So this is one of the \nmost serious and most important sorts of debates we can have as Members \nof the Senate. But I worry about the flawed policies I have identified \nand that these are really just the tip of the iceberg.\n  In future remarks, I wish to come back and address a national \nsecurity threat that I think is perhaps the most urgent, and that is of \nIran's relentless quest for nuclear weapons, as well as the impact on \nour closest ally in the Middle East, the State of Israel.\n  Recently one of America's finest generals and former Commander of the \nUnited States Central Command, Gen. James Mattis, testified before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee that the United States needs ``to come \nout now from its reactive crouch and to take a firm strategic stance in \ndefense of our values.''\n  I couldn't agree more. The world is safer and more stable when \nAmerica leads, leads from the front, not from the rear, and when we say \nwhat we mean and we mean what we say, and we back it up with action.\n  If the President can't do that, then over the last 2 years of his \nadministration it will be incumbent upon Republicans and Democrats in \nCongress to lead the way in the absence of Presidential leadership and \nto do what we can do within our authority to prevent further erosion of \nAmerican credibility on the world stage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

Mr. President, last Tuesday President Obama met with 10 \npeople at the White House. These are people who had written him letters \nabout the health care law. The White House said it designed this little \npublicity stunt to remind people to sign up for insurance on \nhealthcare.gov by the deadline date of Sunday, February 15.\n  At his meeting the other day the President said that the people there \nwere ``a pretty good representative sample of people whose lives have \nbeen impacted,'' as he said, ``in powerful ways.''\n  I will tell you, if President Obama really wanted a representative \nsample, he would have included some of the people his law has affected \nin alarming and expensive ways. What does the President have to say to \nthose people? Why didn't he invite any of them to the White House for \nhis photo-op?\n  Here is what the New York Times wrote on Sunday, February 8. This is \nthe Sunday Review, New York Times. The headline is ``Insured, but Not \nCovered: New policies have many Americans scrambling.'' Why isn't the \nPresident willing to talk to those people\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\nwho are scrambling all across the country who may have insurance but \nare not covered?\n  The story starts off by telling the story of one woman in New York \nCity. Her name is Karen Pineman. She lost her existing health insurance \npolicy because it didn't meet all the mandates President Obama said a \nhealth insurance policy had to include. It might have worked very well \nfor her, but it didn't work well enough for President Obama, so she \nlost her coverage.\n  The article says that ``she gamely set about shopping for a new \npolicy through the public marketplace.'' After all, she had supported \nPresident Obama and she had supported the health care law, as they say, \nas a matter of principle.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Ms. Pineman, who is self-employed, accepted that she'd have \n     to pay higher premiums for a plan with a narrower provider \n     network and no out-of-network coverage.\n\n  So here she is--supported the law but then lost her insurance and had \nto buy other insurance with a narrower provider network and higher \npremiums. She accepted that she would have to pay out of pocket to see \nher primary care physician because her primary care physician didn't \nparticipate and wasn't part of that narrow network. She even accepted, \nthe New York Times reports, having copays of nearly $1,800 to have a \ncast put on her ankle in an emergency room after she broke her ankle \nplaying tennis.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       But her frustration bubbled over when she tried to arrange \n     a follow-up visit with an [orthopedic surgeon] in her \n     network.\n\n  She had to buy the insurance under President Obama's law because she \nlost her own insurance even though the President had promised her ``if \nyou like your insurance, you can keep it.''\n  The article goes on:\n\n       The nearest doctor available who treated ankle problems was \n     in Stamford, Conn.\n\n  She is in New York City. She lives in New York. The closest doctor \nwho was in her network was in Connecticut. She has had it. She said:\n\n       It was ridiculous--didn't they notice it was in another \n     state?\n\n  What does President Obama have to say to this woman in New York? I \nsee she wasn't included in the photo-op they had at the White House \nwith the 10 people who wrote letters to the President. What does he \nthink about the powerful negative ways his health care law is affecting \nher life? After all, the New York Times thought it was enough that they \nwould devote the front page of the Sunday Review section this past week \nto ``Insured, but Not Covered: New policies have many Americans \nscrambling.''\n  The article sums it up this way:\n\n       The Affordable Care Act has ushered in an era of complex \n     new health insurance products featuring legions of out-of-\n     pocket coinsurance fees, high deductibles and narrow provider \n     networks.\n\n  All of ObamaCare's mandates force insurance companies to use things \nlike these deductibles and narrow networks to keep premiums from going \nup even faster. Remember, the President said premiums would go down by \n$2,500 per family. They have actually gone up, not down, and they have \ndone all these things so they wouldn't go up even faster.\n  The New York Times article says that under ObamaCare these insurance \nplans come with ``constant changes in policy guidelines, annual shifts \nin what's covered and what's not, monthly shifts in which doctors are \nin and out of network,'' and surprise bills for services people thought \nwould be covered. Is the President proud of that? He stood up and said \nthe Democrats should forcefully defend and be proud of the law. I don't \nsee one Democrat on this floor of the Senate who is standing here to \nforcefully defend and be proud of this law.\n  The article goes on to say that for many people it is all so \nconfusing and so expensive ``that they just avoid seeing doctors.'' \nWhat does President Obama have to say to people who are so confused by \ntheir insurance now that the easiest path is to just not go for health \ncare?\n  According to a recent poll, 46 percent of Americans said that paying \nfor basic medical care is a hardship for their family. Forty-six \npercent say it is a hardship for their family. Where was it a year ago? \nWell, it is actually up by 10 percent.\n  The President said that things would get better, that people would \nlike the health care law, and that Democrats should forcefully defend \nand be proud of it, but 10 percent more people this year than last year \nsay that it is harder to pay for basic medical care, that it is a \nhardship for their family. What does he say to these people? What does \nthe President of the United States say to these people who said his \nAffordable Care Act is making their life more of a hardship?\n  This is an extensive article, ``Insured, but Not Covered,'' in the \nSunday issue of this week's New York Times.\n  There is another example from this article--Alexis Gersten, who lives \nin a town called East Quogue. She bought ObamaCare health insurance \ncoverage for her family. Then she found out that they did have \ninsurance, but they weren't covered. When her son needed an ear, nose, \nand throat doctor, the nearest one in her network was in Albany, NY, \nwhich is 5 hours away from where she lives. Even though her own \ncardiologist was on the network list, he said he didn't take her plan. \nShe ended up driving an hour to see a new cardiologist. Finally, there \nwas a dispute over deductibles that left her with a pediatrician's bill \nfor $457.\n  Five hours to take her son to a specialist? Is that what the \nPresident means when he says the Democrats should forcefully defend and \nbe proud of this law they voted for? Almost $500 out of pocket to see a \npediatrician? Is that the kind of powerful effect President Obama \nwanted his health care law to have on families? That is what he said \nlast week, ``a powerful effect on their lives.'' What does the \nPresident have to say to this woman, to Alexis?\n\n  The only reason health care costs are not even higher for a lot of \npeople is because the Obama administration decided to give subsidies to \nsome people to help hide the true costs. Over the next few months, the \nSupreme Court is going to decide if President Obama is breaking his own \nlaw by giving out some of those subsidies.\n  Millions of people in 37 States may suddenly find that they have to \nbear the expenses of ObamaCare entirely on their own, buying insurance \nthat many of them don't want, don't need, and can't afford, covering \nlots of things they would never buy insurance for if given the personal \nchoice, but the President says they must because he seems to know more \nabout what they need for their families than they do.\n  Last December several of us asked the administration to start warning \npeople, people who buy insurance through the healthcare.gov Web site--\nthe disastrous Web site--to inform those people that they may lose \ntheir subsidies come this summer when the Supreme Court makes its \nruling.\n  We asked the administration--the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, the Secretary of Treasury--to let us know how the \nadministration plans to protect people who might get caught in the mess \nthat President Obama and his administration and all the people who \nvoted for it created. All we have heard in response is that the \nadministration has no plans--no plans--to warn anyone or to do anything \nto help Americans harmed by the President's health care law. This has \nthe potential to be yet another ObamaCare train wreck.\n  Another study came out last month that looked at the change in health \ninsurance coverage for the first 9 months of 2014. It found that there \nwas a total change of about 8 million more people who actually have \ncoverage. The problem is that most of those people were just added to \nMedicaid. Medicaid is a program that is already broken and doesn't work \nwell. As a doctor who has taken care of patients in Wyoming for almost \na quarter of a century, I can tell you that Medicaid across the country \nis a broken system. Yet the people who have gotten health insurance--\nnot care; the President is quick to use the word ``covered,'' but he \ndoesn't use the word ``care'' because there is a huge difference. I can \ntell you that as a doctor. There were about 6 million people enrolled \nin the individual market, mostly through the exchanges, except 5 \nmillion people lost their insurance that they had gotten before through \nwork.\n  So when you take a look at the net effect on coverage, 89 percent of \nthose newly covered got it through Medicaid. That works out to a net \ngain of a little under 1 million people who actually got private \ninsurance, in spite of the exchanges and in spite of the subsidies.\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\nSeven and a half million got it through Medicaid. All of that expense \nand all of the hardship President Obama caused on American families--\nfamilies who have suffered as a result of the President's health care \nlaw--and most of the net gain in coverage is people who went onto \nMedicaid?\n  The American people didn't ask for this. If President Obama actually \ntalked with a real representative sample of Americans, he would know \nthat. But he doesn't. He only hears what he wants to hear. He \ndisregards the rest. He didn't do that last week. He still refuses to \nlisten to people who have been hurt by his law.\n  It is time for the President to be honest with the American people \nabout the ways his law has harmed them. This is it--New York Times, \nSunday, February 8, ``Insured, but Not Covered: New policies have many \nAmericans scrambling.''\n  It is time for the President to start working with Republicans to \ngive people the kind of health care reform they wanted all along--\naccess to the care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost. \nThat is what the American people are demanding, and that is what they \ndeserve, and that is what Republicans are going to give them when we \nget the opportunity to do so. It is time for President Obama to join \nus.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are running out of time until the \nDepartment of Homeland Security shuts down, and the majority doesn't \nseem to have any real plan to avoid it.\n  There are 17 days left--with a week of recess in between--until tens \nof thousands of DHS workers are furloughed, fire grants to local fire \ndepartments are no longer sent out, and training local first responders \nin handling terrorist attacks stops dead in its tracks. Yet each day \ncomes with a new round of finger-pointing from Republicans eager to \npass the buck to the other Chamber.\n  The distinguished majority leader, my friend, Senator McConnell, and \nmy friend from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, and many other Republicans \nin this body have said it is time for the House majority to come up \nwith a new plan. The House of course says it is the Senate majority \nthat needs to act again. This morning Speaker Boehner, astoundingly, \nsaid the House would not pass another DHS bill. He is tied in such a \nknot he can't move, even though he knows his failure to move risks a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  The House of course says it is the Senate majority that needs to act \nagain, and yesterday the majority leader said the onus was now on the \nHouse to fund DHS. This morning the majority leader said the onus is \nnow on the Senate. We have all kinds of Abbott and Costello behavior \ngoing on. The funny thing is the finger-pointing is not at the \nDemocrats. They are pointing at each other as to who is to blame.\n  The American people are getting whiplash from listening to the \nRepublican leadership on this issue. The Republicans need to sort out \nthe divisions within their own caucus before they deflect any blame on \nDemocrats, because while Democrats remain united in both Houses in \nsupport of a clean bill, the Republican majority is busy playing a game \nof hot potato with national security funding.\n  The disunity and delay has led a few Republicans to start talking \nabout a continuing resolution that would guarantee another cliff and \nmore brinkmanship and underfund DHS in the meantime. Delaying this same \nstandoff by a few weeks or months isn't a very good plan B. It is \nhardly a plan at all.\n  Secretary Jeh Johnson described the CR for DHS this way: ``It's like \ngoing on a 300-mile trip with a five-gallon tank of gas.''\n  Let me give a few examples of why a Republican continuing resolution \nis a very poor plan B.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will my friend from New York yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield for a question when I finish my remarks, \njust as he was nice enough to yield to me a few days ago.\n  First, without a bipartisan full-year bill, the Secret Service cannot \nmove forward with the critical reforms recommended by an independent \npanel of experts made after the White House fence-jumping incident.\n  Second, we can't upgrade the biometric identification system that \nprevents terrorists from coming into the country. Republicans and \nDemocrats negotiated an additional $25 million for DHS to upgrade the \nsystem that allows them to stop terrorists from coming through an \nairport or on a cargo ship and into the United States. A CR does not \nprovide that funding.\n  Third, Secretary Johnson has said the Department will be constrained \nby a CR from improving security along our southwest border and \nmaintaining the resources we added to deal with last summer's border \ncrisis. Some say, Why does a CR constrain all of this? Because it is \njust ratifying last year's funding, and when new situations have \nemerged--new terrorist threats, new trouble on the border--we can't \nchange the budget. It makes no sense. No company would simply pass last \nyear's budget when they are experiencing new challenges; neither should \nour government.\n  In short, a CR just doesn't work. It is not how we should be funding \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  So we implore our Republican colleagues: Don't shut down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, don't set up another shutdown, and \ndon't underfund the men and women who work 24/7 to keep us safe. Pass a \nclean appropriations bill and give the people on the frontlines of \ndefending this country the tools they need to get the job done.\n  I will be happy to yield for a question to my good friend, the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from New York--I don't \nhear any Republicans talking about a shutdown and I don't hear any \nRepublicans talking about a continuing resolution. I just hear \nRepublicans talking about taking up the bill the House has passed, \nwhich is a $40 billion appropriations bill and having a vote on it. But \nisn't it true that Democrats are united in blocking our ability to even \nconsider that $40 billion appropriations bill?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend for the question. It is nice to see \nhim standing on the Democratic side. I hope he tries it again. If he \nlikes it, he might do it more often.\n  I would say this: We all know what Speaker Boehner did. The hard \nright in the House said we want to force the President to undo his \nExecutive order. They know if they put it on the floor alone, the \nPresident might veto it, so they attached it to Homeland Security and \nthey basically say to the President, the only way we will fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is if we include these unpalatable \nriders, which the President has said he would veto.\n  So there is a simple solution.\n  That would force a shutdown. What the House did is say if we don't do \nit our way, we are shutting down the government. That didn't work 2 \nyears ago--and that effort was led by the junior Senator from Texas, \nnot my friend, the senior Senator from Texas--and it is not going to \nwork today. Everyone knows what our colleagues in the House did. They \nare playing hostage. They are holding a gun to the head of America and \nsaying unless we do it their way, they are going to shut down the \ngovernment. That is why they attached it.\n  Let me repeat to my dear friend from Texas: No one objects to \ndebating what the President did on Executive orders. We welcome that \ndebate. It is the act of tying it to funding the government--the same \nthing they did with ObamaCare a few years ago--that says we are going \nto shut down the government unless we get our way.\n  So the logical solution--and I will yield in a moment--is very \nsimple: Pass the Department of Homeland Security bill. If they don't \nwant to shut\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\ndown the government, pass a clean Homeland Security bill and then the \nmajority can put immigration on the floor and we can debate it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, again, I don't hear any Republicans \ntalking about shutting down the government. Indeed, the deadline, as I \nunderstand, is February 27 for this appropriations bill. What we are \nhaving is a discussion about the President's abuse of his authority \nunder the Constitution by issuing the Executive order. I understand we \ndisagree about that--and we ought to have that debate--and the public I \nthink would insist that we honor our oath by making sure we protect and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States, including against \nPresidential overreach.\n  I ask my friend, is it going to be the consistent position of our \nDemocratic friends in the Senate that they are going to block us from \neven getting on the bill so that then they can offer amendments to \nstrip out the parts they don't like? That is the way the Senate is \nsupposed to work, but it doesn't work that way when Democrats are \nfilibustering this $40 billion appropriations bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Texas for his good question. I \nagree with parts of what he said. First, I agree that we disagree on \nthe President's Executive order.\n  Second, I agree we ought not debate it in a hostage-taking situation. \nOur colleagues in the House may not have used the word ``shutdown.'' It \ndoesn't matter. Their actions speak louder than words. When they attach \nthese proposals to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations \nbill and say we are not going to fund Homeland Security unless we get \nsome of these proposals, that is saying we will shut down the \ngovernment unless we get our way. Sure, they will not shut down the \ngovernment if we vote for all of their extraneous immigration \nprovisions, and then next time they will attach something else and then \nsomething else. But they are using the threat of a government shutdown \nto try and get their way. That has not worked in the past and it will \nnot work today.\n  So we Democrats are not blocking any debate. We are happy to debate \nfunding the Department of Homeland Security. We are happy to debate \nimmigration. Challenge us. Pass Homeland Security, put immigration on \nthe floor, and see if any Democrat tries to block that debate. We \nwelcome that debate. We think we will win that debate. I know my good \nfriend from Texas disagrees with that.\n  But that is not the issue. The issue is again that unless Democrats \ndo it our way, we are shutting down the government. That is what the \nHouse did and so far that is what the Republican majority in the Senate \nis going along with. That is government shutdown. That is hostage-\ntaking. That hasn't worked in the past and it will not work now.\n  It is unprecedented. The junior Senator from Texas came up with this \nkind of thinking, and unfortunately too many of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle go along with him, either out of conviction or \nfor some other reason.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one last \nquestion? He has been very gracious, and I appreciate it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Of course. I enjoy these debates.\n  Mr. CORNYN. While I don't agree with his answers, I appreciate the \nspirit in which we are actually having a discussion. But I wonder if he \ncan explain to me how it is that the majority is blocking Department of \nHomeland Security funding when the House has passed a $40 billion bill. \nRepublicans have been united in voting to proceed to get on the bill \nand then allowing an amendment process where the minority can then move \nto strike the provisions they don't like. That is the way the Senate is \nsupposed to operate.\n  How is it that Republicans are blocking Department of Homeland \nSecurity funding under those circumstances? I don't understand that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would just ask the rhetorical question--and I thank my \ncolleague--why did they attach these provisions, inimicable to the \nPresident, inimicable to us, to the Department of Homeland Security \nbill, which has nothing to do with it? It was not because they wanted a \ndebate, not because they wanted to fund Homeland Security. There are \neasy ways to do that. They wanted to say that unless we do it their \nway, they are not going to fund Homeland Security and they are going to \nshut down a major portion of the government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue.

Mr. President, I rise briefly today to recognize the \nextraordinary story of my fellow Mississippian Malcolm Butler, who \nhails from Vicksburg, MS, and attended Hinds Community College. Mr. \nButler, a cornerback for the New England Patriots, made the game-\nwinning interception in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by \nRick Cleveland.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Daily Journal, Feb. 3, 2015]\n\n      Vicksburg's Butler Rises Up as Mississippi's Latest NFL Hero\n\n                          (By Rick Cleveland)\n\n       You wait in line, easing around one car-length at a time. \n     Finally, you roll down your window and the voice over the \n     microphone says, ``Welcome to Popeyes. Can I take your \n     order?''\n       Malcolm Butler was that voice, the one who asks you if you \n     want your chicken spicy or mild, your tea sweetened or \n     unsweetened.\n       Before he became a Super Bowl hero, Malcolm Butler worked \n     the to-go window at Popeyes. That was after nobody much had \n     recruited him out of Vicksburg High School. That was after he \n     was kicked off the Hinds Community College football team \n     after a campus altercation.\n       ``Welcome to Popeyes, can I take your order?''\n       Well, sure, I'll have a pass interception on the goal line \n     to win the Super Bowl.\n       Malcolm Butler's story is for everybody who a makes a huge \n     mistake. Who flunks the big exam. Who gets kicked out of \n     school. Who gets fired. Who gets told they aren't quite good \n     enough or tall enough or fast enough.\n       Malcolm Butler, Super Bowl hero.\n       Twenty-six seconds remained. The Seattle Seahawks had \n     second-and-goal at the New England one-yard-line trailing 28-\n     24. The Hawks needed three feet, 36 inches for victory.\n       There were 22 players on the field. Would Russell Wilson, \n     the great star from Wisconsin, give it to Marshawn Lynch, the \n     irrepressible one from Washington, or throw to Doug Baldwin \n     of Stanford? Would they run behind James Carpenter of Alabama \n     or Justin Britt of Missouri? Who would make the big defensive \n     play: Vince Woolfork, the monster out of Miami, or Dont'a \n     Hightower of Bama?\n       So many questions, just one answer.\n       Only heaven or Pete Carroll knows why the Seahawks didn't \n     give the ball to Lynch, but they did not.\n       No, they ran out of the shotgun. They didn't even fake it \n     to Lynch. The Seahawks ran a straight pass. Ricardo Lockette \n     split out wide to the right behind Jermaine Kearse. The call \n     was for Kearse to clear a path for Lockette to run a simple \n     slant pattern.\n       Malcolm Butler never let it happen. Later, he would say he \n     saw what would happen before it happened. He saw it in his \n     mind's eye. Butler didn't let Kearse get in his way. He broke \n     in front of Lockette before Russell even released the ball. \n     And then, somehow, he caught the ball during the collision.\n       Malcolm Butler, Super Bowl hero.\n\n\n                           Summon the Heroes\n\n       Mississippi has produced so many over the years. Jerry Rice \n     starred in three Super Bowls. Eli Manning was the MVP in two \n     of them. Brett Favre led the Packers to a Super Bowl title. \n     L.C. Greenwood sacked Roger Staubach four times in one Super \n     Bowl. The great Willie Brown of Yazoo City once returned a \n     Fran Tarkenton Super Bowl pass 75 yards for a Super Bowl \n     touchdown. Walter Payton helped the Bears shuffle to a Super \n     Bowl ring.\n       But Jerry Rice was the greatest receiver in the history of \n     the game. Eli Manning's pedigree is known to all. Favre was \n     in the process of winning three straight NFL MVPs. Greenwood \n     was part of Pittsburgh's Iron Curtain. Willie Brown might be \n     the greatest corner in the history of the sport. Payton was \n     Payton.\n       Malcolm Butler? After they let him back on the team at \n     Hinds, he had no Division I scholarship offers. He played his \n     college football at West Alabama, formerly Livingston. When \n     he finished Livingston, 32 NFL teams had a chance to draft \n     him. None did.\n       But Malcolm Butler kept working, kept believing.\n       Against all odds, he made the team, worked his way into the \n     rotation and made\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\n     the biggest play in the most important game.

Madam President, I would like to speak on the subject of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. The Keystone XL approval bill which we passed \nin the Senate will be voted on this afternoon in the House. I believe \nthe House will pass the bill with a strong bipartisan majority, just as \nwe did in the Senate.\n  This bill is about energy, it is about jobs, it is about economic \ngrowth, and it is about national security through energy security. I \nhave been on the floor in the Senate talking about all these issues as \nwe worked on this bill. The Keystone XL Pipeline approval bill was the \nfirst bill we took up in the Senate in this Congress, S. 1. I think \nthere were on the order of 250 amendments filed on the bill and we \nvoted on more than 40 amendments with rollcall votes. We debated, \nSenators brought forward their amendments, and we voted on the bill and \nthe bill passed, as I say, with a strong bipartisan majority.\n  Now the House will vote, as I say, this afternoon on the bill as \nwell. I think it is remarkable that today is the day we will pass the \nbill completely through the Congress. I think it is remarkable because \nit is on the very same day the President has sent to the Congress an \nAUMF, authorization for use of military force, to deal with ISIS. It is \non the very same day the President has sent us an AUMF, authorization \nfor use of military force, to actually send our soldiers, our men and \nwomen, our combat resources to the conflict in the Middle East, the \nvery same day we are passing legislation that will help our Nation with \nthe production of more energy, not only in the United States but also \nworking with our closest friend and ally, Canada.\n  This pipeline is about the infrastructure we need to help us move to \nenergy security, meaning that we produce more energy than we consume. \nToday in the United States we consume about 18 million barrels of oil a \nday. Of that total, we produce about 11 million barrels a day, and we \nimport from Canada about 3 million barrels a day. So if we do the math, \nthat means there are about 4 million barrels a day we need to import \nfrom other countries. We get about half of that from OPEC, roughly 2 \nmillion barrels a day. The Keystone XL Pipeline will move 830,000 \nbarrels a day. Some of that will be produced in Canada, some of it will \nbe produced in the United States, but it will move 830,000 barrels a \nday to our refineries. That is almost 1 million barrels a day we don't \nhave to import from somewhere else.\n  So go back to the math. I just said we were importing from countries \nother than Canada 4 million barrels a day, half of that from OPEC--\nabout 2 million barrels a day. This project is almost half of what we \nare importing from OPEC right now. That is why I say it is remarkable \non the very same day that we are working to build energy security for \nthis country, where we are working to develop the infrastructure we \nneed to move oil from where it is produced to where it is refined and \nconsumed in this country, we are also dealing with the conflict in the \nMiddle East. OPEC--we are getting oil from the Middle East and we are \ndealing with conflict in the Middle East. Let's break that cycle, \nright?\n  At the point that we produce more energy than we consume, we are more \nenergy secure. It is not only about growing the economy and creating \njobs, but that means we don't have to get oil from OPEC anymore. That \nis one more reason we may not have to be involved in a conflict in the \nMiddle East in the future. So here we are in a bipartisan way in the \nCongress doing the work the people sent us to do in the Senate and in \nthe House on a project that has overwhelming bipartisan support, on a \nproject where all six States on the route of this pipeline--Montana, \nSouth Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas--all of the States have \napproved it.\n  They didn't have to particularly hustle because they had 6 years to \ndo it. The administration has held up this project for 6 years. Here we \nare with something that Congress overwhelmingly supports on a \nbipartisan basis. All six States that have this pipeline have approved \nit, and the American people overwhelmingly support it.\n  In poll after poll, 65 to 70 percent of the American public said, \nyes, build this infrastructure, create an energy future where we \nproduce the oil and gas we need in America and we work with Canada. We \nthe American people don't want to rely on OPEC or the Middle East \nanymore for our energy. We don't want to have to import oil from the \nMiddle East. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  On the very day we are approving this bill through Congress, we are \ngetting the President's request for the use of military force. He is \nsending that agreement to us and, I believe the President is saying to \nus, Congress, join with the Obama administration to work to deal with \nthe terrible problem of ISIS, and we need to do that.\n  We are going to give that AUMF, authorization for use of military \nforce, careful consideration. I think the Congress will work its will. \nThen we will, together, as representatives of the American people--the \nExecutive and the legislative branch--work to defeat ISIS.\n  Just as the President is sending that document today, we are sending \nhim a document. We will be sending him a law dutifully passed by both \nthe Senate and the House in a bipartisan way and saying, Mr. President, \nwe need you to work with us too. Just as you want Congress to work with \nyou on an authorization for use of military force, we want you to work \nwith us on behalf of the American people who have spoken loudly and \nconsistently that they want energy security.\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\n  Mr. President, we need you to work with us to build that vital \ninfrastructure so we can produce our energy here at home and work with \nour closest friend and ally, Canada, and not be dependent on energy \nfrom the Middle East anymore.\n  Don't be fooled--don't be fooled. We are in a battle right now for \nglobal market share to determine who is going to produce energy in the \nfuture. Is it going to be OPEC? Is it going to be Russia? Is it going \nto be the United States? Who is going to produce energy in the future? \nThe reason the price at the pump has come down over $1 over the course \nof the past year is because we are producing so much oil and gas in the \nUnited States and because we are getting more from Canada. More supply \npushes prices down. If that were a tax cut, it would equate to more \nthan a $100 billion tax cut for the American consumer. So what is going \non?\n  On a global basis OPEC is pushing back, because they know if they \npush back, instead of our industry and our energy industry in this \ncountry continuing to grow, it starts to shrink again. Who is back in \nthe driver's seat? OPEC is back in the driver's seat. What do you \nsuppose is going to happen then? Prices will go right back up, and that \nbenefit consumers get at the pump we will not have anymore. Also, that \nsecurity issue I am talking about we will not have because we will have \nto continue to bring in oil from the Middle East. This is about a long-\nterm strategy for national security.\n  It is more than just sending our combat resources into a conflict. A \nlong-term strategy for national security also includes energy security, \nand just as the President is sending us an AUMF today, we are sending \nhim legislation today that will make our Nation more energy secure. I \nhope the President will join with us in that endeavor on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  Thank you, and with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I was listening very carefully to the \nSenator talking about our situation with the pipeline, and there is \nsomething else I was going to talk about, but I want to make sure we \nsay it as often as we can. I have sent for a poster which I want to \nshare with the Senate.\n  My State of Oklahoma is more than just passively interested in the \npipeline. In the center of Oklahoma is a town called Cushing. Cushing, \nOK, happens to be the central location for the pipelines going \nthroughout the United States--east, west, north, and south. The \npicture, if it does arrive, that I wanted to share with everyone is of \nthis President who is trying to, I guess, insult our intelligence by \nhaving it both ways. I think the Senator from North Dakota made it very \nclear that the President is dragging his feet and that he has been able \nto successfully stop the pipeline from coming through.\n  The picture I will show is a picture of President Obama coming into \nmy State of Oklahoma and standing with all the barrels behind him in \nCushing, OK, announcing that he is not going to stop the pipeline from \ngoing south from Oklahoma down to the Texas border. That is very good \nbecause he cannot do it. The only place he can stop it is when it \ncrosses the international border. Of course that is where he is \ncontinuing to stop it.\n  I have to say he has lost the war of words on this because people \nknow we have an opportunity--that everything the Senator said is \ncorrect. We can be totally independent in no time at all. We are not \ntalking about years, we are talking about weeks and months. We can have \nour total independence just by lifting all the restrictions we have \nright now, not just the pipeline but what is happening on Federal land.\n  It is interesting. We have gone through this shale revolution in this \ncountry, and it has been so overwhelming. In the last 5 years it has \nbeen in spite of the President because he continues in his budget to \nhave all kinds of punitive provisions for the oil and gas industry. Yet \nbecause of what has happened with the shale revolution, the use of \nhydraulic fracturing, the horizontal drilling, we have increased our \nproduction over the last 5 years by 61 percent. All of the 61 percent \nis in private land or it is in State land. We have on Federal land a \nreduction. While the rest of the country has increased 61 percent, it \nhas been reduced by 6 percent. That is the dilemma we have right now.\n  It goes far beyond just the pipeline. We have an opportunity to be \ncompletely free--and I am talking about our Northern Hemisphere--being \nfree from dependence on anyone in any part of the world for our ability \nto produce the energy necessary to run this machine called America.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 452 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for moving \nahead on S. 295, which we call the Amy and Vicky Act.\n  The need for this bill arises because of the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 \ndecision last year in Paroline v. United States.\n  The Court at that time limited the recovery that a victim of a child \npornography offense could receive, even as additional wrongdoers saw \nher image as it was repeatedly posted on the Internet.\n  Rather than making the offender provide restitution for all the harms \ncaused by the repeated viewings, the Supreme Court limited the recovery \nagainst any one defendant to the relative harm that defendant caused.\n  This bill will expand the categories of loss for which the victim \ncould recover. It would reverse, then, the Supreme Court by permitting \nthe victim to recover up to the full loss from any one defendant, \nsubject to a minimum amount, depending upon the defendant's conduct. No \nlonger, then, would the victim receive restitution from each defendant \nlimited to that defendant's own actions. Each defendant would be \njointly and severally liable for the victim's entire loss.\n  The bill sets up a contribution procedure for those defendants, which \nthen would make the victim whole. Of course, that is the main point.\n  The choice is between the convicted child pornography offender being \nheld responsible for the full loss and the innocent victim not \nreceiving full compensation.\n  The Supreme Court ruled that the victim could not receive all her \nrestitution from any one single defendant,\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\neven as her damage suffered was compounded. This bill appropriately \nrejects that. I hope it is not the last time this Congress overturns a \nSupreme Court decision.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, as I was \nin the last Congress. I was pleased that the first legislation the \nJudiciary Committee took up when I became chairman was this bipartisan \nchild pornography bill, and I am glad to have shepherded that bill \nthrough the committee so that the Senate at this time can take it up as \none of its first legislative items.\n  We should all commend, as I do, Senator Hatch for his work on this \nvery important piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I am very pleased to see the Senate will \npass the bipartisan Justice for Amy and Vicky Act.\n  As an original co-sponsor of this bill, it's great to see that the \nSenate is helping ensure that victims of child pornography are able to \nreceive full restitution for the terrible harms that they have \nsuffered.\n  Last year, the Supreme Court issued a decision that sharply limited \nthe remedies available to victims of child pornography.\n  The case involved Pennsylvania resident ``Amy.''\n  ``Amy'' was just eight and nine years old when her uncle raped her. \nAmy received help from a therapist and her family, and began to heal. \nThen, at age 17, Amy learned that her uncle recorded the events and \ntraded them over the Internet. Amy is believed to be the most widely \ntraded image of child pornography: Her attorney estimates that over \n70,000 people have viewed these images.\n  I cannot begin to imagine the devastation Amy feels, so I turn to her \nown words. Amy writes:\n\n       Every day of my life I live in constant fear that someone \n     will see my pictures and recognize me and that I will be \n     humiliated all over again. It hurts me to know someone is \n     looking at them--at me--when I was just a little girl being \n     abused for the camera. I did not choose to be there, but now \n     I am there forever in pictures that people are using to do \n     sick things. I want it all erased. I want it all stopped. But \n     I am powerless to stop it just like I was powerless to stop \n     my uncle. . . . My life and my feelings are worse now because \n     the crime has never really stopped and will never really \n     stop. . . . It's like I am being abused over and over and \n     over again.\n\n  Amy has struggled to hold down a steady job, facing repeated \nbreakdowns. Amy estimates she has suffered $3.4 M in lost income and \ncounseling costs over the years.\n  Amy sought restitution from those who viewed and traded her image. \nThe Federal restitution statute allows a victim of child pornography to \ncollect restitution from those convicted of producing, trafficking, or \nviewing images of the victim's abuse.\n  But Amy faced a problem common in child pornography cases: Tens of \nthousands of people have trafficked in her image. When she attempted to \ncollect restitution, could she collect the full amount from any one \nperson? Or would she have to wait for tens of thousands of people to be \ncriminally convicted, collecting a small amount from each person, in \norder to be made whole?\n  Last April, in the case of Paroline v. United States, the Supreme \nCourt decided that Federal statute required the latter. The Supreme \nCourt recognized that this was unworkable, and it called on Congress to \nprovide a legislative remedy.\n  Last year, I responded to the Supreme Court's call by introducing the \nJustice for Amy Act, which would ensure that victims of child \npornography are able to receive full restitution, without having to \nappear in thousands of court cases.\n  It sought to amend the Federal restitution statute to provide that \nall defendants who produce, traffic, or possess child pornography of a \nvictim are jointly and severally liable for all of that victim's \ndamages, and may sue one another for contribution. This goal is to take \nthe burden off of the child victim, and places it on the child \npornographers. Once one defendant is found guilty, he is held liable \nfor the full damages and the burden is on him to sue all other \nwrongdoers to help pay the restitution award.\n  I am pleased to see that this commonsense approach has been adopted \nby and incorporated into the Justice for Amy and Vicky Act. I am proud \nto be an original co-sponsor of this important legislation that the \nSenate will pass today.\n  This bill provides one important first step in ensuring that victims \nof child sexual abuse receive the help they need. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues to provide additional protections \nfor America's children.\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, as a father of four, I am deeply \nconcerned by the very need for legislation like S. 295, the Amy and \nVicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act. It is \nappalling that even a single one of our children is subject to such \nbase and vile exploitation. As parents, and as a Nation, it is \nparamount we guard our children when there are those who would exploit \nthem in pornography, who would enslave them in human and sex \ntrafficking, and who would perpetrate this sickening crime upon them.\n  The Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Act is one \nmore step in laying the full consequences of these heinous crimes upon \nthe perpetrators. While current law brings criminals to justice before \nthe courts, it can leave the victims to reconstruct their lives with \nonly limited resources on hand. This bill would make sure victims of \nchild pornography have what they need to rebuild and restore their \nlives by making the perpetrators financially responsible.\n  Yet while it is a good and necessary step, nothing can ever truly be \ndone by the law or the courts to repair the damage that has been \nwrought on these lives. We must stop it before it begins. So let us \nhelp those who are in need of healing and stop those who would continue \nthis violence.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that any time during the quorum \ncalls be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, later this month, on February 27, funding \nfor the Department of Homeland Security will run out. I think we all \nagree this is a critical time for our country's national security, and \nit is important that we fully fund Department of Homeland Security to \nprotect Americans against terrorist attacks.\n  But in recent days several of my friends across the aisle have spoken \non this floor asserting that Republicans are trying to force a \nDepartment of Homeland Security shutdown. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth.\n  Essentially, their argument is that unless Republicans choose to \ncompletely agree with President Obama's egregious constitutional \nviolation of executive power to implement major changes in our \nimmigration laws--an issue which is clearly the responsibility of the \npeople's elected representatives--then Republicans will be responsible \nfor any lapse in DHS funding.\n  So to put all this in perspective regarding this situation and the \nassertion that a few of my colleagues have made, let me give you some \nthoughts. First, let's remember how we got into this situation to start \nwith. In 2008, a Presidential candidate by the name of Barack Obama \nsaid the following:\n\n       I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest \n     problems that we are facing right now have to do with trying \n     to bring more and more power into the executive branch and \n     not go through Congress at all. And that's what I intend to \n     reverse when I am President of the United States of America.\n\n  He went on to say when he was President:\n\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\n\n       America is a nation of laws, which means that as President, \n     I am obligated to enforce that law. I don't have a choice \n     about that. That's part of my job. But I can advocate for \n     changes in the law so that we can have a country that is \n     respectful of the law but also continues to be a great \n     country of immigrants.\n\n  Here is the key statement:\n\n       With respect to the notion that I can just suspend \n     deportations through executive order, that is just not the \n     case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has \n     passed.\n\n  I could go on and on about what the President has said about his \nlimitation of powers both as a candidate and as the President of the \nUnited States. Of course, he has violated and trampled on every word he \nhas said, broken many promise he has made, and taken just the reverse \nposition on everything he said about this issue on the Senate floor as \na Senator and now as President.\n  So Republicans have responded by simply saying: ``That is a violation \nof your Executive power. We think these issues ought to be debated and \nworked through the people's representatives, as they have been in the \npast.''\n  Because there is an association between the Department of Homeland \nSecurity funding and funding for certain aspects of immigration, \nRepublicans thought it would be worthwhile to bring a debate to the \nfloor so the public could hear what we have to say on this issue and so \nthat we could make adjustments through this process.\n  Having suffered through 6 years of this Presidency--4 years for me--\nled by a then majority leader of the Democratic Party, with Republicans \nnot being allowed to debate on the floor any significant issues that \nperhaps did not fit the Democratic agenda, new management has taken \nover here and opened up the process so that we can again be the \npeople's representatives and speak and debate on the floor, offer \namendments--winning some, losing some--and come to a conclusion.\n  Looking for the right vehicle, the only real vehicle, that would \nallow us to at least debate and offer our amendments in opposition to \nwhat the President is trying to do has been totally stifled through \nDemocrat filibustering, not even allowing us to move forward with the \nbill. So we are stuck here in a difficult situation, wanting to address \nthis egregious abuse of the power constitutionally designated to the \nPresident and at the same time needing to fund our necessary security \nneeds through the Department of Homeland Security.\n  By not allowing us to even bring this issue to the floor of the \nSenate and debate it back and forth, offering amendments to address \neach Senator's various concerns, we neglect to move forward on \nlegislation that addresses these two important needs: Number 1, the \nfunding of our national security through DHS, and Number 2, the issue \nof the President's constitutional overreach.\n  So we stand here frustrated with our inability to be able to go \nforward in the way the American people expect us to go forward, in the \nway this Senate has traditionally operated. Here we stand in a \nstalemate because one party says: ``No, we don't even want to let you \ntalk about it.'' One party says: ``No, we don't even want to take it \nup, offer our amendments.'' Maybe they are afraid they will not pass. \nThat is how it works here.\n  The irony is that at least eight Democrats, as I count, were very \ncritical when the President issued his Executive order regarding \nimmigration. They basically said: ``Yes, that does exceed his powers, \nand he should not have done that.''\n  Here is an opportunity for them to weigh in with their votes instead \nof just their rhetoric. Yet they will not even allow that to happen.\n  So we are caught here in this dilemma. But let me make a couple of \nthings absolutely clear, at least from my perspective. I do not believe \na departmental shutdown is the appropriate response to this issue. \nFunding and paying for essential functions of the Department of \nHomeland Security at a time when threats have never been higher is \nabsolutely critical. So we have to achieve that by whatever means.\n  By the same token, addressing this egregious constitutional violation \nand the President's broken promises relative Executive power on \nimmigration is a key issue the American people want debated now. It \nneeds to be debated. Both sides have agreed that we need immigration \nreform. But it ought to be done through the people's representatives \nand not through the wishes of the President of the United States when \nhe does not have the power to make these changes.\n  So I trust that we will be able to work through this in the next \nseveral days leading up to our recess or the end of this month when we \nhave to come to a conclusion. We are working hard to do that. We just \nwould like the opposing party, the Democrat Party, to allow its Members \nto say where they stand, to offer changes, to offer alternatives, and \nto offer amendments. It is important enough for us to do what we were \nsent here to do, and that is to represent the people in this country on \nthe critically important issues that lie before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the bill before us proves the axiom that \nbig things come in small packages. This bill, the Amy and Vicky Child \nPornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act, may only be several \npages long, but it is a very big bill.\n  In 1994, by enacting the Violence Against Women Act, Congress \nrequired that defendants who commit certain crimes pay restitution to \ntheir victims. I had a lot to do with that bill. These are crimes--such \nas the sexual exploitation of children--that have a particularly \ndevastating impact on victims, and they need help to put their lives \nback together.\n  Last year, in a case titled ``Paroline v. United States,'' the \nSupreme Court concluded that the restitution statute cannot provide the \nrestitution that Congress promised for child pornography victims. The \nonly way to fix this problem is to amend the restitution statute in a \nway that accounts for the insidious and evil nature of child \npornography itself.\n  The Supreme Court held in Paroline that under the statute as \ncurrently written, a victim can seek restitution only for losses that \nare directly related to an individual defendant's distribution or \npossession of specific images of her abuse. That is not only virtually \nimpossible to prove, but it pretends that defendants and images are \nisolated and self-contained. The truth is that in the Internet age, \ndefendants are part of a growing, shifting, and constantly active group \nof individuals who keep the victimization going. As the Supreme Court \nput it in Paroline last year, each viewing of child pornography is a \nrepetition of the child's abuse. Everyone who drives the trafficking in \nthose images repeats that abuse and contributes to a victim's losses. \nSome of them will be caught and prosecuted, while others will hide in \nthe shadows and seek safety in numbers.\n\n  The harsh reality for a victim is that the Internet has multiplied \nthe number of individuals who harm her and, at the same time, made it \nharder to identify them so she can seek restitution--or should I say, \nshe really can't seek restitution.\n  The bill before us today addresses this cruel catch-22. This bill is \nnamed for Amy and Vicky, the victims in two of the most widely viewed \nchild pornography series in the world.\n  When I reintroduced this bill on January 28, I also shared the story \nof Andy, a young man in Utah who is the victim in another widely \ndistributed child pornography series.\n  He is the named victim in more than 700 cases but has been granted \nrestitution under Paroline in only one-quarter of the cases in which he \nhas sought it and actually received restitution in just two of those \ncases.\n  This bill provides judges with options for calculating a victim's \ntotal losses and imposing restitution in different kinds of cases. That \nis not always easy for the very reason that I just described. A judge \nmust impose restitution in an individual case for losses that flow from \nongoing harm. But that is the diabolical nature of child pornography, \nand we must equip the criminal justice system to address it.\n  This bill helps victims in another important way. Today a victim must \nchase every single defendant to seek restitution, only to be told that \nshe\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\nmust seek the impossible and, therefore, receive next to nothing. In \naddition to providing a way for judges to require meaningful \nrestitution in individual cases, this bill allows defendants who harm \nthe same victim to seek contribution from each other to spread that \nrestitution cost.\n  Let me put it as simply as I can. The current statute maximizes a \nvictim's burden and minimizes her restitution. This bill minimizes a \nvictim's burden and maximizes her restitution.\n  Both Amy and Vicky personally endorse this bill. National victim \nadvocacy groups also support it, including the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, the National Organization for Victim \nAssistance, the National Crime Victim Law Institute, the National \nCenter for Victims of Crime, the National Task Force to End Sexual and \nDomestic Violence Against Women, and the Rape, Abuse and Incest \nNational Network.\n  Last October I received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the \nattorneys general of 43 States--22 Republicans and 21 Democrats. This \nhas, in fact, been a truly bipartisan effort.\n  The senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, has been my partner \nfrom the start in developing this legislation and has been a champion \nfor crime victims for many years. It is important to have him on this \nbill. He is one of the great leaders in the Senate today, and we intend \nto do more together in the future.\n  The cosponsors include 22 Republicans and 17 Democrats. Big things \nreally do come in small packages.\n  I have been contacted by advocates working with dozens of countries \naround the world to tackle the problem of child pornography and \nexploitation. They emphasize the need for meaningful restitution and \nsay that this legislation can be an example for other countries to \nfollow.\n  Congress in 1994 required full restitution for child victims of \nsexual exploitation. The Supreme Court last year confirmed that the \nrestitution statute cannot keep that promise to victims of child \npornography.\n  Enacting this legislation shows Congress at its best, stepping up and \ntaking the action necessary to address this problem. Amy, Vicky, and \nAndy are counting on us.\n  This is an extremely important bill. It means that victims of child \npornography--usually videos that are shipped all around the world and \nseen by, maybe, millions--have the chance of being able to get true \nrestitution under this bill. Before that, they would have to go and sue \neveryone who was involved, and there is no way they could find that \nout, no way they could really do that, no way they could really get \nrestitution and justify the attorneys' fees, and no way they could \nreally vindicate themselves and show these people, these horrible \npeople who do these things to children, that they are not going to get \naway with it anymore.\n  This bill eliminates all of that. This bill makes it possible for the \nvictims of pornography and childhood exploitation to be able to recover \nand to get restitution for the very poor treatment they have undergone.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Amy and \nVicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act, which my \ngood friend Senator Orrin Hatch has requested a vote on this afternoon.\n  First, I thank Senator Hatch for his work on this important \nlegislation. I was proud to work alongside him as the Democratic \ncosponsor of his bill, and he has been an absolute force in pushing \nthis bill in the Judiciary Committee and to the floor today. We have \nhad a great partnership and have worked on many things together, and I \nthink I join every one of my 99 colleagues in telling the Senator from \nUtah how much respect we have for him.\n  Our bill does one important thing. It fixes a flaw in our restitution \nsystem for pornography victims. You see, in this day and age, victims \nof child pornography face ongoing harm every time a video or picture of \nthem is shared and viewed on the Internet. As the Supreme Court \nexplained about a victim:\n\n       These sexual abuse crimes are compounded by the \n     distribution of images of her abuser's horrific acts, which \n     meant the wrongs inflicted upon her were in effect repeated; \n     for she knew her humiliation and hurt were and would be \n     renewed into the future as an ever-increasing number of \n     wrongdoers witnessed the crimes committed against her.\n\n  The horror of sexual abuse can be long lasting. It can constitute the \nloss of income, medical care, psychiatric counseling, and therapy. The \nvictims of sexual abuse, therefore, are absolutely in the right to seek \nrestitution from those evil criminals who perpetuate the original crime \nby sharing and viewing images of the crime.\n  A 2014 Supreme Court case, Paroline v. United States, placed a heavy \nburden on the child pornography victims trying to recover restitution. \nThe tragic effect of the Supreme Court's decision in the Paroline case \nwas this: The more widely viewed the pornographic image of a victim and \nthe more offenders there are, the more difficult it is for the victim \nto recover for her anguish and her damages.\n  For the perpetrators of child pornography, there should not be safety \nin numbers.\n  Now, the bill that Senator Hatch has led on and I was proud to \ncosponsor rights this wrong. Our bill provides a method for these \nvictims to seek restitution for the total harm they endured from this \nhorrific victimization. Specifically, the Amy and Vicky Act does three \nthings that reflect the nature of these crimes. First, it considers the \ntotal harm to the victim, including from individuals who may not yet \nhave been identified. Second, it requires real and timely restitution. \nAnd, third, it allows defendants who have contributed to the same \nvictims' harm to spread the restitution cost among themselves.\n  These specific changes are supported by the attorneys general of 43 \nStates and countless national victim advocacy groups, such as the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and they have wide \nbipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Once again, I commend my colleague Senator Hatch for the great work \nhe has done on this and other things.\n  As I said while he was not in the Chamber, I look forward to our \nworking on many other causes together. He is a great leader and very \nwell respected by me and all of his colleagues.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this important measure to give more \npower to the victims of sexual abuse to seek redress, closure, and \njustice for the crimes--the dastardly crimes--committed against them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, amendment No. 250 is agreed to.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                     (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n       On page 4, beginning on line 22, strike ``sexual conduct \n     (as those terms are defined in section 2246)'' and insert \n     ``sexual contact (as those terms are defined in section 2246) \n     or sexually explicit conduct (as that term is defined in \n     section 2256)''.\n\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, shall it pass?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Amy and Vicky Child \n     Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because \n     it drives production, which involves severe and often \n     irreparable child sexual abuse and exploitation.\n       (2) The harms caused by child pornography are more \n     extensive than the harms caused by child sex abuse alone \n     because child pornography is a permanent record of the abuse \n     of the depicted child, and the harm to the child is \n     exacerbated by its circulation. Every viewing of child \n     pornography is a repetition of the victim's original \n     childhood sexual abuse.\n       (3) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result \n     of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals \n     have viewed and will in the future view images of their \n     childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason \n     that child pornography is outlawed.\n       (4) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who \n     reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a \n     victim's childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining \n     and aggravating the harms to that individual victim.

Mr. President, along with my colleagues I just had the \nopportunity to be at the unveiling of the statue of Senator Barry \nGoldwater in Statuary Hall.\n  I had the privilege of serving with Barry Goldwater. We traveled \ntogether many times. He came to Vermont at different times with me, and \nwe became very close friends. It was interesting to watch Senator \nGoldwater form alliances across the aisle with different people. But I \nremember expressly one very personal thing.\n\n  I was very close to my father, and my father passed away late one \nevening in Vermont. The next morning, the first\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\ntwo telephone calls my mother received were condolences. One was from \nBarry Goldwater, and one was from Ted Kennedy. The two had both talked \nbefore they called. I mention that because that was the type of people \nthey both were. It had nothing to do with ideology; it was who they \nwere.\n  In 1980 I had the second closest election in America. Somebody \nsuggested to me that it must be because of my philosophy. I thought \nprobably, but I can't figure it out. So I called up the man who had the \nclosest election in 1980, the year of the Reagan sweep.\n  I said, ``Senator Goldwater, what is the message we are being sent?''\n  Barry laughed and said, ``We have to change our luck.''\n  He suggested that he move into the office of the retiring Senator Abe \nRibicoff of Connecticut, a Democratic Senator from New England. He \nsaid, ``I am going to move into his office and change my luck. You \nbetter be strong enough to move into mine.''\n  I suggested that I didn't have quite the seniority to do that. He \nsaid, ``I will arrange your move next week.'' He did.\n  When I was sworn in for my second term in January of 1981, I was in \nthat office. I have stayed in Senator Barry Goldwater's office ever \nsince. I have stayed there now for--well, I am in my 35th year in \nSenator Goldwater's office, and I consider it a matter of pride, and I \nconsider it a matter of pride to have served with him.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/11/senate-section/article/S921-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S921-S924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  AUMF\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President. I would like to touch on two topics. The \nfirst is that today the President has submitted a request for \nauthorization for use of military force with regard to ISIL, or ISIS, \nas some call it.\n  First, I think it is good news that the President has made that \nsubmission, and I think he is right when he says the country is \nstronger when both Congress and the President act together.\n  I would say there is a pretty simple authorization he could ask for, \nand it would be one sentence, and that is, ``We authorize the President \nto defeat and destroy ISIL.'' And that is what I think we need to do.\n  I look forward to reading through his submission. I understand it \ncontains a time limitation. It does not contain geographic limitations. \nIt contains some language that supposedly will make people feel more \ncomfortable about the use of ground troops.\n  An authorization to use force that has limitations built into it is \nreally quite unprecedented. We did some research, and the Congressional \nResearch Service said that there really were only two previous \nauthorizations that have limited the President in terms of the use of \nforce to be used or the duration of the conflict. One was in 1983 in \nLebanon, and one was in 1993 in Somalia. Both of those were \npeacekeeping missions, so it made sense to limit the peacekeeping \nmission to use of force. But it appears that never before in certainly \nmodern history has the Congress of the United States authorized the \nPresident to take on and defeat an enemy but has done so with \nlimitations on the time or geography or anything of that nature. That \nis an important point for us to understand because under no \ncircumstances can ISIL stay. What we need to be authorizing the \nPresident to do is to destroy them and to defeat them and allow the \nCommander in Chief--both the one we have now and the one who will \nfollow--to put in place the military tactics necessary to destroy and \ndefeat ISIS.\n  It is important to point out that circumstances on the ground might \nrapidly change. They already have. For example, when this began--if you \nlook back a year and a half ago, if I had stood on the floor and given \na speech about defeating ISIL or ISIS, no one would have known what I \nwas talking about because at the time most Americans and most Members \nof Congress had no idea what that was. That is how quickly this has \ndeveloped into a threat.\n  I would remind everyone that when they actually crossed over from \nSyria into Iraq, the President called them the JV team. Even today the \nfacts on the ground continue to evolve very rapidly. For example, we \nnow know through open source reports that ISIL has now established a \npresence in Derna, Libya, which gives them access to a port facility, \nand it is a completely uncontested space. There is no government \nshooting at them. There are no airstrikes. There is no one coming after \nthem there. They can do whatever they want in Libya, and they are doing \nit. They are using it as a place to train, a place to recruit, a place \nto resupply, a place to raise money, and they have access to a port \nthat allows them to bring all these things in.\n  There have also been open source reports of groups in Afghanistan \nbeginning to pledge allegiance to ISIS. In fact, in at least four \ndifferent countries in north Africa, there are now groups who have \npledged allegiance to ISIL. So while we continue to focus on the \nconflict with relation to Iraq and Syria, we cannot overlook the fact \nthat they are sprouting affiliates throughout the entire region.\n  I think that after the brutal murder of numerous Americans--we saw \nlast week what happened to the Jordanian pilot--I don't have to spend \nmuch time convincing people how dangerous this group is. What we don't \nhear enough about is the atrocities being committed on a daily basis on \nthe ground, what they are doing to the Sunni population, for example, \nof areas they have now conquered, the brutality, the way they enforce \nsharia law with brutal tactics, not to mention the brutal stories we \nhave heard of women being sold off or given away as brides to ISIL \nfighters, children trafficked into slavery, entire populations \nslaughtered, and fighters who were captured and killed in mass \nkillings. This is what this group envisions for the world.\n  The goals of this group are not simply to govern what we knew once as \nIraq or Syria or Libya or any other country; their ultimate goal is for \nthe entire world--including where we stand today--to one day live under \ntheir mandate, under the rules they have established, under their \nradical version of Sunni Islam. You may say that is far-fetched, and it \nmay be today, but that is their clear ambition--to spread their form of \nradical Islam everywhere and anywhere they can. They openly talk about \nthis.\n  This group needs to be defeated. I wish we had taken this group on \nearlier. I wish, in fact, that we had gotten involved in the conflict \nin Syria earlier and equipped moderate rebel elements, non-jihadist \nrebel elements on the ground so that they would have been the most \npowerful force there. The President failed to do that in a timely \nfashion, and as a result a vacuum was created, and that vacuum was \nfilled by this group who has attracted foreign fighters from all over \nthe world to join their ranks.\n  Now we are dealing with this problem, but I would argue better late \nthan never. Had we dealt with this a year and a half ago or 2 years \nago, it wouldn't have been easy, but it would have been easier. But it \nis important to deal with it decisively now. We can debate the tactics, \nbut it is the job of the Commander in Chief, in consultation with his \nmilitary officials who surround him and advise him, to come up with the \nappropriate tactics to defeat the enemy.\n  For our purposes--very straightforward--ISIL is the enemy. They need \nto be defeated, and we should authorize this President and future \nPresidents to do what they can and what they must to defeat ISIS and \nerase them from the equation.\n\n\n                               Venezuela\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to take a moment to talk a little bit \nabout what is happening in Venezuela. Tomorrow, February 12, will mark \nthe 1-year anniversary since students and others across Venezuela took \nto the streets in peaceful demonstrations and demanded a better \ngovernment and a better future than the current one, which is corrupt \nand incompetent and provides no leadership to the country.\n  Tomorrow also marks the 1-year anniversary since the Venezuelan \nGovernment, under Nicolas Maduro, responded with a violent crackdown \nthat left dozens of people dead, thousands injured, and hundreds in \njail as political prisoners. There have been at least 50 documented \ncases of torture by government\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\nforces on peaceful demonstrators, and more than 1,700 individuals await \ntrial today in Venezuela before a judiciary that is completely \ncontrolled by Maduro's government. This includes Leopoldo Lopez, who \nhas been languishing in the Ramo Verde prison for almost a year.\n  In the year since the people took to the streets demanding more \nopportunity, accountability, and more freedom, the basic necessities \nhave vanished from the shelves. It is one of the richest nations in the \nhemisphere, and its economy is in shambles.\n  Venezuela is also plagued with one of the world's highest murder \nrates, rampant corruption related to state assets, a 57-percent \ninflation rate, a junk rating on the global bond market, and \nunprecedented scarcity of goods as basic as toilet paper. Lately, \nthings have gotten so bad in Venezuela under Maduro that they are no \nlonger just kidnapping people. As the Diario las Americas, which is a \nnewspaper in Miami, reported earlier this week, people are now \nkidnapping dogs and other pets in Venezuela and holding them for \nransom. That is how bad things have gotten.\n  Why is this happening? Why has the cradle of Latin American \nindependence--a country blessed with oil and energy wealth, with \ntalented and hard-working people--become a failed state?\n  For starters, because it is modeling its economy after Cuba, which \nitself is a failed state.\n  Second, for years Venezuela has been in the grips of incompetent \nbuffoons, one after another. First it was Hugo Chavez and now Nicolas \nMaduro. They have squandered the nation's riches.\n  Third, the country is being run by corrupt individuals. Just last \nweek reports came out alleging that the speaker of the national \nassembly, Diosdado Cabello, is himself a drug kingpin.\n  Fourth, even with all the oil wealth Venezuela has squandered, it \nstill possesses some of the largest oil reserves on the planet, but oil \nprices are dropping. In a country such as Venezuela where innovation \nand entrepreneurship are stifled, where wealth and power are \nconcentrated in the government and its cronies, the entire economy is \nthe oil industry. Ninety-six percent of Venezuela's export revenues \ncome from oil.\n  So I am proud that in December the Senate and the House passed and \nthe President signed a bill that sanctions human rights violators in \nVenezuela. It mandates that their assets be frozen and visa \nrestrictions be placed upon them if they are involved in human rights \nviolations. That is going to be critical going forward. As things get \nworse, more people in Venezuela will take to the streets, and the \nnational guard in the country--which is nothing but armed thugs working \non behalf of the Maduro government--will be tempted to crack down on \npeople violently. So our legislation would impose visa sanctions and \nasset sanctions on individuals responsible for these human rights \nviolations.\n  The good news is that the President has moved forward with some of \nthese visa restrictions, and that is a very positive step. America \nshould not be and cannot be a playground for Venezuela's human rights \nviolators. But the financial sanctions part of the bill are long \noverdue. They are urgently needed because things are only going to get \nworse in Venezuela. People are only going to get more desperate. They \nare only going to speak out more. They are only going to demand freedom \nmore. And I suspect, although I hope I am wrong, that the response from \nthe Venezuelan Government will be more violence and more crackdowns on \nthe people of their own nation.\n  If, God forbid, they use lethal force against their own people--which \nis a right they have reserved for themselves, a right the government \nhas approved and has given authority to the national guard to use--we \ncannot simply stand by and watch as innocent people are killed or \ninjured because the regime believes there will be no consequences.\n  So today I wanted to come here for a few moments and urge the \nPresident to do what I asked him to do in a letter last week, and that \nis to not sit idly by on the Venezuelan sanction law he signed last \nyear but to use it--to use it immediately and decisively to make clear \nthat the United States of America will not stand for repression taking \nplace in Venezuela and that we will use the tools of our economy and \nthe power we have given the President to punish those responsible for \ncommitting human rights violations in Venezuela against the people of \nthat great nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Department of \nHomeland Security and the necessity to fund it.\n  Earlier today the President submitted a document for the \nauthorization of use of military force to the Congress. I take the \nPresident's request very seriously. I look forward to the analysis that \nwill be done by the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, and debate on the floor.\n  Why did the President send it and why did so many in the Congress \ncall for it? It is because everybody says that we have to do something \nabout ISIL. You know what. I think we do have to do something about \nISIL. What a ghoulish, barbaric terrorist group. There is no doubt \nthere has to be an international effort to strike them from the planet \nand that the United States has to be a part of it.\n  But what comes out when we talk about ISIL is the need to have a \nstrong, robust counterterrorism effort. If we are going to fight \ncounterterrorism, we must fund the agency that has the principal \nresponsibility for protecting the homeland.\n  The Department of Defense protects us against foreign invaders, but \nwe have to also protect the homeland--whether it is against cyber \nsecurity threats or other terrorist activity or other dangers that come \nto our country.\n  So why after 2 weeks do we have the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations for fiscal year 2015? We are ready to vote on it. We \nhave a clean bill. I am speaking now as the ranking or vice chair of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. During fiscal year 2014, I chaired \nthe committee. At the end of the year, when we worked on our omnibus, \nit was the will of the Congress that we would fund all government \nagencies except Homeland Security and instead put it on a continuing \nresolution until February 27 because there were those in both Houses \nwho were cranky about the fact that President Obama exercised Executive \nauthority in certain matters related to immigration.\n  So now we are holding up the entire funding for the Department of \nHomeland Security because some people are cranky with President Obama \nover him using an Executive order on immigration. These very people who \nare so cranky are criticizing him for being a weak leader. Oh, where is \nPresident Obama? Why doesn't he take strong and decisive action? When \nthe President takes strong and decisive action, they not only don't \nlike it, they are willing to hold up the entire funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security over this. What is this? Do we have a \nnew math where 1 and 1 makes 14 or 5?\n  We created the Department of Homeland Security after the horrific \nattack of 9/11, and they need to be funded.\n  I am here to urge that we pass a clean funding bill to protect the \nNation from terrorism, cyber security threats which are mounting every \nday, and so we can also help our communities respond to other threats.\n  I believe immigration does deserve a debate. I am not arguing about \nthat, nor would I ever want to stifle a Senator's ability to speak on \ntopics where they have strong beliefs and deeply held views, but let's \nmove immigration to a different forum to talk about it.\n  In the last Congress the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration \nbill. It went to the House, and it sat there. Gee, it sat there. After \na while it kind of sat there some more, and then it died as that \nsession came to an end.\n  The President, frustrated that the House of Representatives refused \nto take up a bill and debate it through its committees and on the \nfloor, acted through Executive order.\n  So my view is let's bring up immigration, let's move our \ncomprehensive bill again with a full and ample debate, full and ample \namendments. Maybe the House will finally get around to talking about \nimmigration instead of talking about President Obama, and then we can \npass the Homeland Security bill.\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\n  Three times last week the Senate rejected a procedural vote to take \nup Homeland Security. People can ask: Senator Barb, why did you do \nthat? I voted not to delay but to move on. We Senate Democrats tried to \nmove a clean Homeland Security funding bill. What does that mean? We \nfocused only on the money. We said we did not want to have the five \npoison pill immigration riders that are in the House bill. We wanted to \nbe able to take that out.\n  The President has been very clear. If we send him a bill that \nincludes funding plus five poison pill riders on immigration, he will \nveto it. What is the consequence? We become a public spectacle in the \nworld's eyes. We play parliamentary ping-pong with the President of the \nUnited States. We pass a bill because we want to have a temper tantrum. \nHe vetoes it. It comes back. We have another debate where we huff and \npuff and hope problems will go away. We then try to override a veto and \nall the while we are eating up time.\n  The world is watching us. Our treasured allies are not the only ones \nasking about what is going on with the United States and how the \ngreatest deliberative body has become the greatest delaying body. Our \nenemies say we can't get our act together internally to pass the very \nmoney to take them on, so they are going to try to bring it to us.\n  In the end, when all is said and done, more is getting said than \ndone. Before we go out for the Presidents Day recess, I urge the Senate \nto pass this bill.\n  Tomorrow we are going to vote to confirm the Secretary of Defense, \nDr. Ashton Carter. He has gone through the process and was reported out \nof committee. I look forward to voting for him.\n  Why are we going to move so fast to confirm Dr. Carter? Because we \nneed a Secretary of Defense. We have to fight for America. We have to \nstand up for America. We have to be muscular and ready to deal with \nthose bad guys. I agree with that.\n  I salute our military every day and in every way. They are out there \non the frontlines, and their families are there to lovingly support \nthem.\n  We are going to have a Secretary of Defense. Let's not forget we also \nhave a Secretary of Homeland Security, Mr. Jeh Johnson. Instead of \nAmerica having deep pockets to fight terrorism, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security will have empty pockets.\n  What is this? We are going to rush to confirm Dr. Carter, and I think \nwe ought to. There is no dispute from me on that. Shouldn't we also \nrush to complete our work and fund Homeland Security? I think we \nshould. We could do it tomorrow. We could do it tomorrow and pass this \nclean bill.\n  The Department of Homeland Security's mission is to protect America \nfrom terrorism and help communities respond to all threats, from \nterrorism to natural disasters. We are talking about the TSA, which \nprotects our airports. We are talking about the Border Patrol and ICE, \nso if we are talking about immigration, don't we want to fund the \nagents out there protecting our borders? Don't we want to continue to \nhave cyber warriors securing our networks? We need to support the \npeople who are dealing with bio and nuclear threats. We need to also \ncontinue supporting State and local first responders, firefighters, and \nEMS personnel in the different States so they can be ready--whether \nthey are responding to a local disaster or something that has been \ncaused by a despicable attack. We need to be able to pass this bill.\n  The Department of Homeland Security funding runs out on February 27, \nand my view is that instead of running the clock we should move this \nbill. I believe it could pass tomorrow and that we could get our job \ndone. But, no, we are all going to go back to our home States and tell \neverybody how they have a government on their side and how they can \ncount on us to fight for America. But the way to fight for America is \nto stop fighting with each other.\n  Let's try to find a sensible Senator and move this bill forward. I \nbelieve people on both sides of the aisle are patriots. I believe \npeople on both sides of the aisle want to defend America. Let's come \ntogether on both sides of the aisle, right down the middle, and let's \nfind a way to move this bill forward and have a debate on immigration. \nI don't want to stifle or stiff-arm it, but let's move this forward, \nand let's stand shoulder to shoulder doing our job to fund the agency \nthat has the principal responsibility for protecting the homeland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I am here to also talk about the DHS \nfunding bill. I will say from the outset that I don't think the \nPresident did the right thing by taking this unilateral action. I think \nhe has made it more difficult to pass immigration reform in this body.\n  Having said that, to attempt to use the spending bill in order to try \nto poke a finger in the President's eye, in my view, is not a good \nmove. I believe that rather than poke the President in the eye, we \nought to put legislation on his desk, and we ought to use this time--we \nhave already used up 2 weeks trying to attach measures to a funding \nbill when we could have used this time to move actual immigration \nlegislation.\n  Coming from the State of Arizona, we desperately need immigration \nreform. We desperately need to have more resources and better security \non our border. We have needed that for a long time. We have had \nsituations where part of the border gets better and then falls back. As \nsoon as the economy ramps up again, we can expect a lot more flow \nacross the border. We don't have sufficient border security in the \nState, and Arizonans pay the price in terms of the cost of health care, \neducation, criminal justice. We bear the brunt of the Federal \nGovernment's failure to have a secure border and to provide for a \nsecure border.\n  We need to pass that kind of legislation. There has been a bill that \nhas been introduced in the House and the Senate. I happen to be a \ncosponsor of the bill in the Senate which would help us to get a more \nsecure border. That is one piece of legislation we could be moving \nright now so it could be put on the President's desk.\n  Second, we all know we need better interior enforcement. We need to \nmake sure employers who employ illegal aliens are not able to do so. We \nneed to make sure employers have the tools to find out if those they \nare hiring are here legally. That has been needed for a long time. It \nhas been provided in other pieces of legislation. We could do a bill \njust on interior enforcement. We could be doing that now rather than \nsimply making a statement on a spending bill.\n  We also need legislation to expand the guest worker plans and \nprograms we have now. There has been legislation introduced in this \nbody already to deal with high-tech workers. We need to make sure those \nwho are educated in our universities and receive graduate degrees in \nthe STEM fields are encouraged to stay. They ought to be encouraged to \nstay to help create jobs in this country rather than returning to their \nhome country and competing against us. That has been needed, and that \nis recognized on a bipartisan basis. We could move legislation right \nnow with regard to high-tech visas.\n  We also need to expand other visa categories. We need an ag worker \nbill to make sure areas where we simply don't have enough labor to deal \nwith the needs we have on our farms--we need to pass legislation to do \nthat. Legislation has been introduced and could be moved through now. \nWe could be doing that.\n  We also obviously need to move legislation to deal with those who are \nhere illegally now--the so-called DREAMers. They are here through no \nfault of their own. They were brought to this country when they were 2, \n10 or 12 years, and they are now as American as you or I. They ought to \nbe given a path where they can stay and have some kind of certainty \nmoving ahead, but that needs to be done by Congress. It cannot simply \nbe done by the President in Executive action. That kind of legislation \ncould move here now as well.\n  We obviously need to deal with legislation for the broader class of \nthose here illegally. We dealt with it in S. 744, which was introduced \nand passed in the Senate in the last Congress. It provided a way for \nthose who are here illegally to get right with the law and to deport \nthose who are in a criminal class but also allow those who are here and \nwant to adjust their status to find a way to do so and to be able to \nstay.\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\nLegislation such as that could move as well but instead we are spending \nweeks trying to make a statement on a spending bill.\n  So I hope we will actually do what this Senate is prepared to do and \nis ready to do again, which is actually to legislate--to move \nlegislation through the committee process to the floor and on to the \nPresident's desk. That is how we ought to respond to the action the \nPresident has taken. I hope we will do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, over the last two weeks Republicans in \nCongress have insisted on playing political games with funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The same agency that supports States \nsuch as Massachusetts when disasters hit, the same agency that provides \ngrants for equipment to keep firefighters safe when they rush into \nburning buildings, the same agency that helps train and fund local \npolice, the same agency that tracks down weapons that terrorists can \nuse to threaten our safety here at home, the same agency that keeps our \nborders and airports safe--this is the agency the Republicans are \nwilling to shut down. Why? Why put America at such risk? Because \nRepublicans want to protest the steps President Obama has taken to try \nto address our country's immigration challenges.\n  This is not a responsible way to govern. This is a dangerous way to \ngovern. There are real threats out there, from ISIS in the Middle East \nto cyber threats, to acts of terror such as the one in Paris earlier \nthis year.\n  DHS gives funding to State and local governments to help them prevent \nterror attacks. Massachusetts received over $30 million in these grants \njust last year alone. If DHS shuts down, that funding dries up, leaving \nour firefighters, our police, and our EMTs hanging, putting the safety \nof every American at risk.\n  Think about the Customs and Border Protection agents, who screen \npeople traveling into the United States through our airports, and the \nmen and women of the Coast Guard who patrol our waters. They will still \nhave to work those tough, sometimes dangerous jobs, but if the \nRepublicans shut down the Department of Homeland Security, these people \njust won't get paid. Tens of thousands of workers nationwide could be \nworking to help keep us safe and not get a paycheck to cover their \ngroceries and rent. That is no way to treat the people who protect this \ncountry.\n  The solution is simple. Last year Democrats and Republicans agreed on \na bipartisan bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. That \nbill was ready to go until the Republicans decided they wanted to play \npolitics. They decided to hold the Department of Homeland Security \nhostage to try to force the President to reverse an Executive order on \nimmigration. That Department of Homeland Security funding bill is still \nready to go. We could vote on it today and be done with all of this. \nEveryone who works to protect our safety would keep on working and keep \non getting paid.\n  A few days ago the Boston Globe wrote an editorial about this, and \nthey said:\n\n       The game of political chicken has to end with the \n     Republicans blinking. It's one thing to disagree with a \n     President's executive actions, but it's another thing \n     altogether to hold crucial funding for a wide range of \n     security programs hostage.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 7, 2015]\n\n   GOP Should Focus on Fixing Immigration, Not Compromising Security\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       In the latest political show vote on Capitol Hill, \n     Republicans are protesting President Obama's executive orders \n     on immigration, enacted in November, by trying to attach \n     language undoing them to a bill that funds the Department of \n     Homeland Security. The attempt is going nowhere: Earlier this \n     week, Democrats in the Senate blocked the bill from reaching \n     Obama's desk. At the same time, the president has vowed to \n     veto any legislation that reverses his immigration measures.\n       This game of political chicken has to end with the \n     Republicans blinking. It's one thing to disagree with the \n     president's executive actions, but it's another thing \n     altogether to hold crucial funding for a wide range of \n     security programs hostage.\n       Republicans who believe Obama's executive orders are an \n     abuse of power should instead look for remedy in the courts. \n     If Obama overstepped, the surest way to reverse his orders \n     would be through a judicial ruling. Meanwhile, Congress \n     should pass a ``clean'' Homeland Security funding bill that \n     funds the agency without the immigration language.\n       Obama enacted the executive orders only after the House \n     refused to vote on a Senate-passed bill that would have \n     overhauled our current immigration system. In retaliation, \n     the GOP decided to attack the president's orders at the \n     funding source: DHS. The Republican bill included so-called \n     ``poison pill'' amendments that prevent the use of DHS funds \n     or fees to enforce Obama's executive actions, which will \n     benefit about 4 million undocumented immigrants by shielding \n     them from deportation while also allowing them to apply for \n     work permits. The amendments also prevent the use of any \n     funds to continue implementing a 2012 order that protected \n     some undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as \n     children.\n       Along with some Republicans who voted against the bill in \n     the House and the Senate, three former secretaries of \n     Homeland Security have also urged the GOP to stop using the \n     agency's budget as a political weapon. Republicans Tom Ridge \n     and Michael Chertoff, and Democrat Janet Napolitano, wrote to \n     Republican leadership: ``DHS's responsibilities are much \n     broader than its responsibility to oversee the federal \n     immigration agencies and to protect our borders . . . Funding \n     for the entire agency should not be put in jeopardy by the \n     debate about immigration.'' They called for a clean funding \n     bill for the rest of the year, like the one Maryland Senator \n     Barbara Mikulski and New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen \n     filed last week.\n       Obama has said he would be happy to see Congress pass a law \n     that would make his executive orders unnecessary. \n     Republicans, instead of engaging in quixotic budget tactics, \n     should get to work on a new immigration bill and stop \n     compromising national security.\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Let's be clear. If Republicans in the Senate don't change \ncourse, they will shut down the Department of Homeland Security and \ncompromise the safety of the American people, and they will have done \nit because a handful of extremists in the Republican Party are angry at \nthe President because he is trying to fix what we all know is a broken \nimmigration system. Well, if they are angry about the President's \nimmigration policy, let's debate the President's immigration policy. \nLast Congress the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to address \nimmigration. Let's debate that bill again. Or if they want to propose a \nnew bill, let's vote on that. But don't play games with the safety of \nthe American people.\n  The way forward is clear. We need to pass a bill to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/11/senate-section/article/S924-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S924-S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IRRIGATE ACT\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President. I wish to discuss legislation I \nintroduced yesterday that would help Native American irrigators, \nranchers, farmers, and families fully utilize the irrigation systems in \nIndian Country. The bill, S. 438, is entitled the Irrigation \nRehabilitation and Renovation for Indian Tribal Governments and Their \nEconomies Act, or the IRRIGATE Act.\n  I thank my colleagues who have joined me as co-sponsors of this \nlegislation, including Senators Tester, Hatch, Enzi, Daines and Bennet.\n  Careful management of water in Indian communities is essential if we \nare to ensure a reliable supply in the future. Many ranchers and \nfarmers, both Indian and non-Indian, still depend on the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, BIA, to deliver water for their needs.\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\n  The Department of the Interior initiated several Indian irrigation \nprojects in the late 1800s and early 1900s intended as a central \ncomponent of tribal economies. In most cases, the Federal Government \ndid not even complete these projects. In 2006, the Government \nAccountability Office released a report on Indian irrigation projects, \nwhich highlighted the inefficiencies of the operation, maintenance, and \nmanagement by the BIA.\n  While the BIA has indicated that the current backlog is estimated to \nbe in excess of $560 million, some Indian tribes estimate that this \nbacklog estimate may be even higher. The most recent information from \nthe BIA clearly reflects an upward trend in the costs of these systems, \ngrowing from $549 million to in excess of $560 million in only one-\nquarter year alone.\n  Deferred maintenance means inefficient water delivery and damaged \ninfrastructure. For the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, these \nissues are perpetual problems. Tribal economies depend on these water \nsystems--and the BIA has an obligation to repair those irrigation \nsystems.\n  The bill intends to bring the BIA irrigation systems into the 21st \ncentury. The bill would authorize $35 million each year from FY 2015 to \n2036, to address the deferred maintenance needs of certain BIA \nirrigation projects. This includes any structures, facilities, \nequipment, or vehicles used in connection with the projects. The bill \nwould also require a longer-term study on the operations of these \nprojects.\n  This bipartisan bill is supported by many Indian tribes. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/11/senate-section/article/S925-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING DEAN SMITH\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate and celebrate the life \nof Coach Dean Smith. Dean Smith's accomplishments as coach, mentor, and \nteacher made him a legend in our State, and far beyond Tobacco Road. \nBrooke and I were deeply saddened to hear of his passing, but he left \nhis indelible mark on our State. Under his stewardship, UNC-Chapel Hill \nbecame the formidable college basketball powerhouse that it is today. \nWhile he was a winning coach, he also encouraged his players to excel \nin the classroom and taught well beyond the locker room.\n  Coach Smith was born in Emporia, KS, in 1931. The son of public \nschool teachers, his lifelong dedication to teaching on and off the \ncourt was instilled in him from a young age. Dean was a high school \nathlete playing basketball, football, and baseball. He earned an \nacademic scholarship to the University of Kansas. While at Kansas he \nplayed basketball and was a member of the 1952 national championship \nteam. He began his coaching career there in 1953 as an assistant coach.\n  Dean Smith then served his country in the U.S. Air Force. In 1958 he \nwas asked to serve as assistant coach for the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill. Three years later he would become the head \ncoach for UNC. His first season as head coach was his only losing \nseason in his 36 year coaching career.\n  His early days as coach were not always so smooth. In 1965, the UNC \nfans hung him in effigy after a loss to my alma mater, Wake Forest \nUniversity. But, soon enough, he enjoyed tremendous success as a coach. \nHe is considered one of the greatest to ever coach the game. His \naccomplishments are too many to list. Some of his most memorable feats \ninclude 2 national championship titles, 11 final four appearances, 17 \nregular season ACC titles, 13 ACC tournament titles, 27 NCAA tournament \nappearances with 23 of those being consecutive. He was the National \nCoach of the Year four times. Dean had 879 wins in his 36-year coaching \ncareer making him one of the winningest coaches of all time. Five of \nhis players went on to be Rookies of the Year in the NBA or ABA. He \ncoached Team USA to gold in the 1976 Olympics. Legendary UCLA coach \nJohn Wooden once said ``Dean is the best teacher of basketball that I \nhave observed.'' His philosophy known as the ``Carolina Way'' still \nrings true today. Play Hard, Play Together, Play Smart.\n  Coach Smith's influence extended far beyond the basketball court. He \nwas a champion for social justice. He was the first UNC coach to offer \na scholarship to an African-American player. He encouraged many local \nbusinesses to desegregate during the 1960s. He served as a mentor to \nhis players and always taught them that education came first. During \nhis career over 95 percent of his players received their degrees. His \nformer players remember the fact that Coach Smith not only taught them \nabout basketball, he taught them about life.\n  Throughout his career, he was a fierce competitor but was always \nrespected by his opponents. There was never a hint of scandal about how \nhe recruited players or how he ran his program. He was a pioneer in the \nart of assembling a long-term winning basketball tradition. Basketball, \nUNC and all of North Carolina have lost a giant with his passing.\n  I extend my sympathy to his wife Linnea and to all of Coach Smith's \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/11/senate-section/article/S925-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO AUTHORIZE THE LIMITED USE OF THE UNITED STATES \n ARMED FORCES AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT (ISIL)--\n                                  PM 5\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses a \nthreat to the people and stability of Iraq, Syria, and the broader \nMiddle East, and to U.S. national security. It threatens American \npersonnel and facilities located in the region and is responsible for \nthe deaths of U.S. citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Abdul-Rahman \nPeter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller. If left unchecked, ISIL will pose a \nthreat beyond the Middle East, including to the United States homeland.\n  I have directed a comprehensive and sustained strategy to degrade and \ndefeat ISIL. As part of this strategy, U.S. military forces are \nconducting a systematic campaign of airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and \nSyria. Although existing statutes provide me with the authority I need \nto take these actions, I have repeatedly expressed my commitment to \nworking with the Congress to pass a bipartisan authorization for the \nuse of military force (AUMF) against ISIL. Consistent with this \ncommitment, I am submitting a draft AUMF that would authorize the \ncontinued use of military force to degrade and defeat ISIL.\n  My Administration's draft AUMF would not authorize long-term, large-\nscale ground combat operations like those our Nation conducted in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Local forces, rather than U.S. military forces, should \nbe deployed to conduct such operations. The authorization I propose \nwould provide the flexibility to conduct ground combat operations in \nother, more limited circumstances, such as rescue operations involving \nU.S. or coalition personnel or the use of special operations forces to \ntake military action against ISIL leadership. It would also authorize \nthe use of U.S. forces in situations where ground combat operations are \nnot expected or intended, such as intelligence collection and sharing, \nmissions to enable kinetic strikes, or the provision of operational \nplanning and other forms of advice and assistance to partner forces.\n  Although my proposed AUMF does not address the 2001 AUMF, I remain \ncommitted to working with the Congress and the American people to \nrefine, and ultimately repeal, the 2001 AUMF. Enacting an AUMF that is \nspecific to the threat posed by ISIL could serve as a model for how we \ncan work together to tailor the authorities granted by the 2001 AUMF.\n  I can think of no better way for the Congress to join me in \nsupporting our Nation's security than by enacting this legislation, \nwhich would show the world we are united in our resolve to counter the \nthreat posed by ISIL.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 11, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/11/senate-section/article/S925-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S925-S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 710.

Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today because \nthere is something going on that people are not as aware of as they \nshould be.\n  We don't have a better friend than King Abdullah in Jordan. I have \nbeen pleased to get to know him as a personal friend as well as a \nfriend of America. I was over there with him last October. We were on \nthe Syrian border looking at all the things that are going on right now \nwith ISIL and ISIS, and it has been a real tragedy.\n  Last week King Abdullah was in the United States for the National \nPrayer Breakfast. While he was here, there were several of us who were \nwith him when he got the news that his friend and relative, an F-16 \npilot, had been caged, soaked with gasoline, and burned alive.\n  America and the whole world saw what happened and asked: What kind of \nmonsters are these people who are doing this over there? They are \nbeheading children and pregnant women and burning people alive. Yet \nthis is going on. People have to understand this.\n  They do understand it in terms of ISIS. But what I want to share with \nyou, and introduce legislation to correct, is that it is not just \nhappening there, it is also happening in Ukraine right now.\n  I happened to be in Ukraine in late October of this year. I went over \nthere because they were having their parliamentary elections at the \ntime. Ukraine has been such a good friend to us--not just Poroshenko, \nbut the rest of the administration that went through the parliamentary \nelection has also been a friend.\n  Let's keep in mind that the Presidential elections were way back in \nMay. This last election was the parliamentary election, and we were \nthere to see what was happening in the Ukraine.\n  In the Ukraine they have a constitutional requirement that you cannot \nhave a seat in Parliament unless you have 5 percent of the vote. This \nis the first time, after the vote when we were there in October, that \nthey had a parliamentary election and not one Communist got a seat in \nParliament. This is the first time in 96 years that not one Communist \nhas a seat in the Parliament.\n  As bad as things are with ISIS, I suggest that what is going on--and \nI only preface what I am saying so I can demonstrate what a good friend \nPoroshenko and the leadership of the Ukraine is to the United States. \nWe have the Russians in there with the separatists doing horrible \nthings--things that are just as bad as what is taking place in Syria \nwith ISIS and in other places.\n  To demonstrate this--it is not a very fun thing to look at, but you \nhave to understand what is happening. These are T-72 tanks. Putin keeps \nsaying: We don't have any Russians in there with the separatists. It is \nnot us. We are not doing it.\n  Well, here they are. These are the pictures we brought back with us. \nAll those tanks are lined up within Ukraine, and that is clearly what \nthey are.\n  If you want to see how brutal Putin and everyone else is--it is not \nsomething anyone enjoys looking at, but you have to know this is going \non. The tragedies that are taking place in Syria and in other parts of \nthe world are also taking place in Ukraine.\n  This is a picture of the murders and torture that have been taking \nplace there. These people have been disembodied, their heads cut off. \nThese are Ukrainian citizens. They are legal citizens. They are the \nones whom Putin and the rest of them are fighting. For that reason, I \nhave introduced legislation to require that the United States offer the \nweaponry.\n  By the way, I was making a presentation about this issue and Senator\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\nMcCain was there. He said: If you look at all of those tanks, they \ndon't have one piece of equipment that could offer a defense against \nthose tanks. What have we been giving them? We have been giving them \nMREs and blankets.\n  When Poroshenko was here in the United States, he made a speech to \nboth Houses. He said that ``one can't win the war with blankets. . . . \nEven more, we cannot keep the peace with a blanket.'' In other words, \nwe have to share the very best defensive weapons or weapons that can be \nused offensively with them. They cannot be left naked there when facing \nthis kind of abuse. We know that shortly after the heavily armed \nRussian soldiers invaded and took control of the Crimean region in \nFebruary of 2014, the Ukrainian Government and its people faced and \nsustained a deadly force from heavily armed rebel separatists who were \nequipped, trained, and supported by the Russian Federation. We have \nseen pictures of that. This is the first time we have shown pictures \nthat document, No. 1, that the equipment came from Russia and Putin, \nand, No. 2, the type of things they are doing over there.\n  We passed a law last year that said we would give defensive weaponry \nto the Ukrainians, but it fell short because of one thing--it was \nprescriptive. It said what kind of equipment it would be.\n  The bill I am introducing today does two things. It offers the \nequipment we can give them with no restrictions whatsoever, and \nsecondly, it does something else I think is very significant, and that \nis we require the President to come up with a strategy. People always \nsay: Well, the President doesn't have a strategy against ISIS. It is \ntrue he doesn't have one, and it is deplorable that he doesn't have \none. He also doesn't have a strategy for Ukraine. Without a strategy, \nit is not going to work.\n  Last week we had a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee. It \nwas kind of funny because we had people from the past. We had George \nShultz, Madeleine Albright, and Henry Kissinger. We were talking about \nthe Ukraine at that time and talked about offering some equipment we \nthought should go there, and they said: Well, you have to do that, but \nyou can't just send them equipment. You have to specifically demand a \nstrategy. In this bill we are saying to the President of the United \nStates to not only send over equipment but we need to also provide a \nstrategy we can massage as time goes on.\n  On February 2, 2015, eight of the former senior ranking diplomatic \nand military officials testified. They included the former U.S. \nAmbassador to the Ukraine, Steven Pifer; former Under Secretary of \nDefense Michele Flournoy; former Supreme Allied Commander ADM James \nStavridis, and former Deputy Commander to the U.S. Command, Gen. \nCharles Wald. They all served under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. They released a nonpartisan report calling on \nPresident Obama to provide Ukraine with lethal weaponry, and this is \nwhat we talked about in the bill. They encouraged other NATO countries \nto do the same, particularly those that possess and used former Soviet \nequipment and weaponry.\n  On January 25, when President Obama stated at a news conference in \nNew Delhi, India that the aggression by the rebel separatists in \neastern Ukraine had Russian backing, Russian equipment, Russian \nfinancing, Russian training, and Russian troops--so he finally agreed. \nIt is not something that is debatable or might be happening; it is \nsomething that is happening. You can see the horrible things that are \ngoing on there, and you can see the reason it is necessary to get this \ndone.\n  Some time ago, back when Carl Levin was still here--he is retired, \nand he did such a great job as the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for so many years when I was the ranking Republican \non the Committee on Armed Services. At that time, a year ago in \nOctober, we wrote the following in the Washington Post:\n  We believe that the United States should begin providing defensive \nweapons that would help Ukraine defend its territory. Such weapons \ncould include anti-tank weapons to defend against Russian-provided \narmored personnel carriers, ammunition, vehicles and secure \ncommunications equipment. This would present no threat to Russia unless \nits forces launch further aggression against Ukraine. In other words, \nthese weapons are lethal, but not provocative because they are \ndefensive.\n  That came from Carl Levin and me. This is back before we knew the \nresults of the parliamentary election that was so successful and so \ncomplementary to the West.\n  This has been long overdue. There is no one who disagrees with it, \nand even the President recognizes they have the equipment and we are \nnot doing the job we should be doing.\n  So, with that, I am going to introduce S. 452, and we are going to \nask for cosponsors to come down and speak on this topic. We have quite \na long list of cosponsors.\n  It doesn't bother me if other Members want to introduce like \nresolutions because we need to get something passed. We need to raise \nthe visibility so the people of America know this is not just going on \nin Syria and some of these other countries, but it is also in the \ncountry of one of our very best friends worldwide, and that best friend \nis the Ukraine.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend Federal recognition to the Chickahominy \nIndian Tribe, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe-Eastern Division, the Upper \nMattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, Inc., the Monacan Indian \nNation, and the Nansemond Indian Tribe; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. I am pleased to reintroduce the Thomasina \nE. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2015. \nThis legislation was voted out of Committee in the previous Congress, \nand I remain hopeful that the full Senate will vote to approve this \ntribes bill this year.\n  This legislation is critically important because it strives toward \nreconciling an historic wrong for Virginia and the Nation. While the \nVirginia Tribes have received official recognition from the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, acknowledgement and officially-recognized \nstatus from the federal government has been considerably more difficult \ndue to their systematic mistreatment over the past century.\n  More specifically, Virginia's Racial Integrity Act, a state law in \neffect from 1924 to 1967, stripped the identities of the tribal members \nof Virginia's Indian Tribes. The Act changed the racial identifications \nof those who lacked white ancestry to ``colored'' on birth certificates \nduring that period. In addition, five of the six courthouses that held \nthe vast majority of the Virginia Indian Tribal records were destroyed \nin the Civil War. Those records were crucial for documenting the \nhistory of the tribes for recognition by the Bureau of\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\nIndian Affairs Office of Federal Acknowledgement.\n  Furthermore, Virginia Indians made peace when they signed the Treaty \nof Middle Plantation with England in 1677. This predated the creation \nof the United States of America by about 100 years; the founding \nfathers of the United States never recognized the treaty. Therefore, \nunlike tribes that received federal recognition upon the signing of a \ntreaty with the United States, the Virginia Tribes did not receive \nfederal recognition because they made peace with England prior to the \nfounding of our Nation.\n  I am proud of Virginia's recognized Indian Tribes and their \ncontributions to our Commonwealth. The Virginia Tribes are not only \npart of our history, but they remain ever present today. We go to \nschool and work together, and serve the Commonwealth and nation \ntogether every day. These contributions should be acknowledged, and \nthis Federal recognition for Virginia's native peoples is long overdue.\n  Virginia's Indian Tribes contributed to the successful founding of \nour country and continue to help define our national identity. Their \nmembers have attended our schools, worked next to us, and served in \nevery American war since the Revolution, all while maintaining a unique \nidentity and culture. I am hopeful the Senate will act upon my \nlegislation this year, to give these six Virginia Native American \nTribes the Federal recognition that is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) during the initial months after Virginia was settled, \n     the Rappahannock Indians had 3 encounters with Captain John \n     Smith;\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\n       (2) the first encounter occurred when the Rappahannock \n     weroance (headman)--\n       (A) traveled to Quiyocohannock (a principal town across the \n     James River from Jamestown), where he met with Smith to \n     determine whether Smith had been the ``great man'' who had \n     previously sailed into the Rappahannock River, killed a \n     Rappahannock weroance, and kidnapped Rappahannock people; and\n       (B) determined that Smith was too short to be that ``great \n     man'';\n       (3) on a second meeting, during John Smith's captivity \n     (December 16, 1607 to January 8, 1608), Smith was taken to \n     the Rappahannock principal village to show the people that \n     Smith was not the ``great man'';\n       (4) a third meeting took place during Smith's exploration \n     of the Chesapeake Bay (July to September 1608), when, after \n     the Moraughtacund Indians had stolen 3 women from the \n     Rappahannock King, Smith was prevailed upon to facilitate a \n     peaceful truce between the Rappahannock and the Moraughtacund \n     Indians;\n       (5) in the settlement, Smith had the 2 Indian tribes meet \n     on the spot of their first fight;\n       (6) when it was established that both groups wanted peace, \n     Smith told the Rappahannock King to select which of the 3 \n     stolen women he wanted;\n       (7) the Moraughtacund King was given second choice among \n     the 2 remaining women, and Mosco, a Wighcocomoco (on the \n     Potomac River) guide, was given the third woman;\n       (8) in 1645, Captain William Claiborne tried unsuccessfully \n     to establish treaty relations with the Rappahannocks, as the \n     Rappahannocks had not participated in the Pamunkey-led \n     uprising in 1644, and the English wanted to ``treat with the \n     Rappahannocks or any other Indians not in amity with \n     Opechancanough, concerning serving the county against the \n     Pamunkeys'';\n       (9) in April 1651, the Rappahannocks conveyed a tract of \n     land to an English settler, Colonel Morre Fauntleroy;\n       (10) the deed for the conveyance was signed by Accopatough, \n     weroance of the Rappahannock Indians;\n       (11) in September 1653, Lancaster County signed a treaty \n     with Rappahannock Indians, the terms of which treaty--\n       (A) gave Rappahannocks the rights of Englishmen in the \n     county court; and\n       (B) attempted to make the Rappahannocks more accountable \n     under English law;\n       (12) in September 1653, Lancaster County defined and marked \n     the bounds of its Indian settlements;\n       (13) according to the Lancaster clerk of court, ``the tribe \n     called the great Rappahannocks lived on the Rappahannock \n     Creek just across the river above Tappahannock'';\n       (14) in September 1656, (Old) Rappahannock County (which, \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act, is comprised of \n     Richmond and Essex Counties, Virginia) signed a treaty with \n     Rappahannock Indians that--\n       (A) mirrored the Lancaster County treaty from 1653; and\n       (B) stated that--\n       (i) Rappahannocks were to be rewarded, in Roanoke, for \n     returning English fugitives; and\n       (ii) the English encouraged the Rappahannocks to send their \n     children to live among the English as servants, who the \n     English promised would be well-treated;\n       (15) in 1658, the Virginia Assembly revised a 1652 Act \n     stating that ``there be no grants of land to any Englishman \n     whatsoever de futuro until the Indians be first served with \n     the proportion of 50 acres of land for each bowman'';\n       (16) in 1669, the colony conducted a census of Virginia \n     Indians;\n       (17) as of the date of that census--\n       (A) the majority of the Rappahannocks were residing at \n     their hunting village on the north side of the Mattaponi \n     River; and\n       (B) at the time of the visit, census-takers were counting \n     only the Indian tribes along the rivers, which explains why \n     only 30 Rappahannock bowmen were counted on that river;\n       (18) the Rappahannocks used the hunting village on the \n     north side of the Mattaponi River as their primary residence \n     until the Rappahannocks were removed in 1684;\n       (19) in May 1677, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was \n     signed with England;\n       (20) the Pamunkey Queen Cockacoeske signed on behalf of the \n     Rappahannocks, ``who were supposed to be her tributaries'', \n     but before the treaty could be ratified, the Queen of \n     Pamunkey complained to the Virginia Colonial Council ``that \n     she was having trouble with Rappahannocks and Chickahominies, \n     supposedly tributaries of hers'';\n       (21) in November 1682, the Virginia Colonial Council \n     established a reservation for the Rappahannock Indians of \n     3,474 acres ``about the town where they dwelt'';\n       (22) the Rappahannock ``town'' was the hunting village on \n     the north side of the Mattaponi River, where the \n     Rappahannocks had lived throughout the 1670s;\n       (23) the acreage allotment of the reservation was based on \n     the 1658 Indian land act, which translates into a bowman \n     population of 70, or an approximate total Rappahannock \n     population of 350;\n       (24) in 1683, following raids by Iroquoian warriors on both \n     Indian and English settlements, the Virginia Colonial Council \n     ordered the Rappahannocks to leave their reservation and \n     unite with the Nanzatico Indians at Nanzatico Indian Town, \n     which was located across and up the Rappahannock River some \n     30 miles;\n       (25) between 1687 and 1699, the Rappahannocks migrated out \n     of Nanzatico, returning to the south side of the Rappahannock \n     River at Portobacco Indian Town;\n       (26) in 1706, by order of Essex County, Lieutenant Richard \n     Covington ``escorted'' the Portobaccos and Rappahannocks out \n     of Portobacco Indian Town, out of Essex County, and into King \n     and Queen County where they settled along the ridgeline \n     between the Rappahannock and Mattaponi Rivers, the site of \n     their ancient hunting village and 1682 reservation;\n       (27) during the 1760s, 3 Rappahannock girls were raised on \n     Thomas Nelson's Bleak Hill Plantation in King William County;\n       (28) of those girls--\n       (A) 1 married a Saunders man;\n       (B) 1 married a Johnson man; and\n       (C) 1 had 2 children, Edmund and Carter Nelson, fathered by \n     Thomas Cary Nelson;\n       (29) in the 19th century, those Saunders, Johnson, and \n     Nelson families are among the core Rappahannock families from \n     which the modern Tribe traces its descent;\n       (30) in 1819 and 1820, Edward Bird, John Bird (and his \n     wife), Carter Nelson, Edmund Nelson, and Carter Spurlock (all \n     Rappahannock ancestors) were listed on the tax roles of King \n     and Queen County and taxed at the county poor rate;\n       (31) Edmund Bird was added to the tax roles in 1821;\n       (32) those tax records are significant documentation \n     because the great majority of pre-1864 records for King and \n     Queen County were destroyed by fire;\n       (33) beginning in 1819, and continuing through the 1880s, \n     there was a solid Rappahannock presence in the membership at \n     Upper Essex Baptist Church;\n       (34) that was the first instance of conversion to \n     Christianity by at least some Rappahannock Indians;\n       (35) while 26 identifiable and traceable Rappahannock \n     surnames appear on the pre-1863 membership list, and 28 were \n     listed on the 1863 membership roster, the number of surnames \n     listed had declined to 12 in 1878 and had risen only slightly \n     to 14 by 1888;\n       (36) a reason for the decline is that in 1870, a Methodist \n     circuit rider, Joseph Mastin, secured funds to purchase land \n     and construct St. Stephens Baptist Church for the \n     Rappahannocks living nearby in Caroline County;\n       (37) Mastin referred to the Rappahannocks during the period \n     of 1850 to 1870 as ``Indians, having a great need for moral \n     and Christian guidance'';\n       (38) St. Stephens was the dominant tribal church until the \n     Rappahannock Indian Baptist Church was established in 1964;\n       (39) at both churches, the core Rappahannock family names \n     of Bird, Clarke, Fortune, Johnson, Nelson, Parker, and \n     Richardson predominate;\n       (40) during the early 1900s, James Mooney, noted \n     anthropologist, maintained correspondence with the \n     Rappahannocks, surveying them and instructing them on how to \n     formalize their tribal government;\n       (41) in November 1920, Speck visited the Rappahannocks and \n     assisted them in organizing the fight for their sovereign \n     rights;\n       (42) in 1921, the Rappahannocks were granted a charter from \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia formalizing their tribal \n     government;\n       (43) Speck began a professional relationship with the Tribe \n     that would last more than 30 years and document Rappahannock \n     history and traditions as never before;\n       (44) in April 1921, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson asked \n     the Governor of Virginia, Westmoreland Davis, to forward a \n     proclamation to the President of the United States, along \n     with an appended list of tribal members and a handwritten \n     copy of the proclamation itself;\n       (45) the letter concerned Indian freedom of speech and \n     assembly nationwide;\n       (46) in 1922, the Rappahannocks established a formal school \n     at Lloyds, Essex County, Virginia;\n       (47) prior to establishment of the school, Rappahannock \n     children were taught by a tribal member in Central Point, \n     Caroline County, Virginia;\n       (48) in December 1923, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson \n     testified before Congress appealing for a $50,000 \n     appropriation to establish an Indian school in Virginia;\n       (49) in 1930, the Rappahannocks were engaged in an ongoing \n     dispute with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United \n     States Census Bureau about their classification in the 1930 \n     Federal census;\n       (50) in January 1930, Rappahannock Chief Otho S. Nelson \n     wrote to Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician of the United \n     States Census Bureau, asking that the 218 enrolled \n     Rappahannocks be listed as Indians;\n       (51) in February 1930, Truesdell replied to Nelson saying \n     that ``special instructions'' were being given about \n     classifying Indians;\n       (52) in April 1930, Nelson wrote to William M. Steuart at \n     the Census Bureau asking about the enumerators' failure to \n     classify his people as Indians, saying that enumerators had \n     not asked the question about race when they interviewed his \n     people;\n       (53) in a followup letter to Truesdell, Nelson reported \n     that the enumerators were ``flatly denying'' his people's \n     request to be listed as Indians and that the race question \n     was completely avoided during interviews;\n       (54) the Rappahannocks had spoken with Caroline and Essex \n     County enumerators, and\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\n     with John M.W. Green at that point, without success;\n       (55) Nelson asked Truesdell to list people as Indians if he \n     sent a list of members;\n       (56) the matter was settled by William Steuart, who \n     concluded that the Bureau's rule was that people of Indian \n     descent could be classified as ``Indian'' only if Indian \n     ``blood'' predominated and ``Indian'' identity was accepted \n     in the local community;\n       (57) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau classed all \n     nonreservation Indians as ``Negro'', and it failed to see why \n     ``an exception should be made'' for the Rappahannocks;\n       (58) therefore, in 1925, the Indian Rights Association took \n     on the Rappahannock case to assist the Rappahannocks in \n     fighting for their recognition and rights as an Indian tribe;\n       (59) during the Second World War, the Pamunkeys, \n     Mattaponis, Chickahominies, and Rappahannocks had to fight \n     the draft boards with respect to their racial identities;\n       (60) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau insisted that \n     certain Indian draftees be inducted into Negro units;\n       (61) finally, 3 Rappahannocks were convicted of violating \n     the Federal draft laws and, after spending time in a Federal \n     prison, were granted conscientious objector status and served \n     out the remainder of the war working in military hospitals;\n       (62) in 1943, Frank Speck noted that there were \n     approximately 25 communities of Indians left in the Eastern \n     United States that were entitled to Indian classification, \n     including the Rappahannocks;\n       (63) in the 1940s, Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician, of \n     the United States Census Bureau, listed 118 members in the \n     Rappahannock Tribe in the Indian population of Virginia;\n       (64) on April 25, 1940, the Office of Indian Affairs of the \n     Department of the Interior included the Rappahannocks on a \n     list of Indian tribes classified by State and by agency;\n       (65) in 1948, the Smithsonian Institution Annual Report \n     included an article by William Harlen Gilbert entitled, \n     ``Surviving Indian Groups of the Eastern United States'', \n     which included and described the Rappahannock Tribe;\n       (66) in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Rappahannocks \n     operated a school at Indian Neck;\n       (67) the State agreed to pay a tribal teacher to teach 10 \n     students bused by King and Queen County to Sharon Indian \n     School in King William County, Virginia;\n       (68) in 1965, Rappahannock students entered Marriott High \n     School (a White public school) by executive order of the \n     Governor of Virginia;\n       (69) in 1972, the Rappahannocks worked with the Coalition \n     of Eastern Native Americans to fight for Federal recognition;\n       (70) in 1979, the Coalition established a pottery and \n     artisans company, operating with other Virginia tribes;\n       (71) in 1980, the Rappahannocks received funding through \n     the Administration for Native Americans of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services to develop an economic program for \n     the Tribe; and\n       (72) in 1983, the Rappahannocks received State recognition \n     as an Indian tribe.\n\n     SEC. 402.

A bill to improve the reproductive assistance provided by the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nseverely wounded, ill, or injured members of the Armed Forces, \nveterans, and their spouses or partners, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss a \npiece of legislation I am introducing today--legislation I have written \nto improve access to health care for our Nation's veterans, because \nthere is no more solemn promise we make as a nation than our commitment \nto care for the men and women who serve in the U.S. military. These men \nand women put life and limb on the line to protect our country, to \nprotect our freedoms, and to protect our way of life. In return, we as \na country make a promise to care for them, no matter what. Just\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\nas important, we make a promise to care for their families--their \nwives, their husbands, and their children.\n  Many of the young men and women who serve in the military enter at a \nvery young age, often before they have children of their own. Like so \nmany other Americans, they have big plans for their lives after their \nservice. Many of them plan to buy a house, go back to school, and \neventually have a family.\n  But in a time when our military conflicts involve roadside bombs, \nmakeshift explosives, and life-threatening danger around every corner, \nmany of our service men and women are coming home with injuries that \nleave them unable to start their own family.\n  In fact, military data shows that over the last decade, thousands of \nservicemembers have suffered injuries that make it nearly impossible to \nhave children. We should be doing everything we can, with the best \nscience and health services available, to help our veterans and their \nloved ones have children, despite their injuries.\n  But instead, outdated policies at the Pentagon and the VA are making \nit harder, not easier, for seriously injured veterans to have children. \nThat is because when severely injured service men and women and \nveterans seek reproductive health services, such as in vitro \nfertilization, their military and VA health insurance simply doesn't \ncover this often very expensive procedure. As a result, the only option \nfor these heroes and their partners to have children is to pay out of \ntheir own pocket, often tens of thousands of dollars, to try and \nconceive.\n  So today I am introducing The Women Veterans and Families Health \nServices Act of 2015.\n  It would basically do two things: First, it would expand the \nreproductive health services available for Active-Duty servicemembers \nand their families.\n  Second, it would finally end the ban on in vitro fertilization \nservices at the VA. I have introduced similar legislation in the past, \nand, as I have done before, I am going to share the story of SSG Matt \nKeil and his wife Tracy.\n  Staff Sergeant Keil was shot in the neck while on patrol in Ramadi, \nIraq, on February 24, 2007, just 6 weeks after he married the love of \nhis life, Tracy. The bullet went through the right side of his neck, \nhit a major artery, went through his spinal cord, and exited through \nhis left shoulder blade. He instantly became a quadriplegic. Doctors \ninformed Tracy her husband would be on a ventilator for the rest of his \nlife, and would never move his arms or legs.\n  Staff Sergeant Keil eventually defied the odds and found himself off \nthe ventilator and beginning a very long journey of physical \nrehabilitation.\n  Around that same time, Tracy and her husband started exploring the \npossibilities of starting a family together. Having children was all \nthey could talk about, once they adjusted to their ``new normal.''\n  With Staff Sergeant Keil's injuries preventing him from having \nchildren naturally, Tracy turned to the VA for assistance and began to \nexplore her options for fertility treatments. Feeling defeated after \nbeing told the VA had no such programs in place for her situation, \nTracy and Staff Sergeant Keil decided to pursue IVF through the private \nsector.\n  While they were anxious to begin this chapter of their lives, they \nwere confronted with the reality that TRICARE did not cover any of the \ncosts related to Tracy's treatments, because she did not have fertility \nissues beyond her husband's injury.\n  Left with no further options, the Keils decided this was important \nenough to them that they were willing to pay out of pocket to the tune \nof almost $32,000 per round of treatment. Thankfully, on November 9, \n2010, just after their first round of IVF, Staff Sergeant Keil and \nTracy welcomed their twins Matthew and Faith into the world.\n  Tracy told me:\n\n       The day we had our children something changed in both of \n     us. This is exactly what we had always wanted, our dreams had \n     arrived.\n       The VA, Congress and the American People have said \n     countless times that they want to do everything they can to \n     support my husband or make him feel whole again and this is \n     your chance.\n       Having a family is exactly what we needed to feel whole \n     again. Please help us make these changes so that other \n     families can share in this experience.\n\n  Tracy does not want to see other servicemembers and their families go \nthrough the struggle she and Matt did because of outdated policies that \ndon't reflect modern medicine.\n  While the Keils' story may be unique, they are not alone. Thousands \nof servicemembers and veterans have returned from their service hoping \nto have children, only to find that, despite their sacrifices for our \ncountry, they are unable to obtain the kind of assistance they need. \nSome have spent tens of thousands of dollars in the private sector, \nlike Tracy and her husband did, to get the advanced reproductive \ntreatments they need to start a family. Others have, sadly, watched \ntheir marriages dissolve because of the stress of infertility, in \ncombination with the stress of readjusting to a new life after a severe \ninjury, driving their relationship to a breaking point.\n  Any servicemember who sustains this type of serious injury deserves \nso much more. They deserve our support to help them start a family, and \nour support to raise that family.\n  This bill is so important because access to childcare is one of the \nmost significant barriers to care for women veterans and younger \nveterans. This bill makes permanent the highly successful pilot program \nin VA and expands it across the country. I am very hopeful today that \nboth Republicans and Democrats can come together to support this bill.\n  Just a few years ago we were able to pass similar legislation through \nthe Senate, but, unfortunately, it didn't pass the House in time to get \nthe President's signature and become signed into law. This time has to \nbe different, because this bill is about nothing more than giving \nveterans who have sacrificed so much the option to fulfill the dream of \nstarting a family. It is a bill that shows when we tell our \nservicemembers deploying to a war zone that we have their back, we mean \nit. It is a bill that recognizes the men and women who are harmed in \nthe service of this country have bright, full lives ahead of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/11/senate-section/article/S945-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 250.
