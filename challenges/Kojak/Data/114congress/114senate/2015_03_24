Mr. President, throughout the Obama era, families \nacross the country have had to make a lot of tough decisions. Lost jobs \nor lower wages meant doing more with less and refocusing on what truly \nmattered. It wasn't easy, but families made the best of difficult \nsituations in order to position themselves for greater success in the \nbetter days to come.\n  Meanwhile, in Washington, we saw record levels of overspending, \ntrillion-dollar deficits, and historic levels of debt. Hard-working \nfamilies made tough choices while the Obama administration and its \nallies aimed to keep right on overspending. It was more than just \nwrong; many would say it was unfair.\n  But, today, Democrats can join together with Republicans to help \nrectify the inequity. Instead of having Washington play by one set of \nrules and the middle class by another, we can force Washington to start \nconfronting very big challenges, just as everyone else has to do.\n  We can force Washington to focus on serving the middle class again \ninstead of the other way around, and we can begin by passing the \nbalanced budget before the Senate today.\n  This balanced budget pivots on an essential truth--that Washington \nhas a spending problem, not a revenue problem--and strives to make \ngovernment more accountable, more efficient, and more accessible. It \nrepresents a significant step forward when it comes to solving our \ncountry's many fiscal challenges.\n  But that is just one reason this balanced budget is so important. \nHere is another: It will help promote economic growth right now and \npromote sustained opportunity well into the future.\n  It aims to do so in a variety of ways; one is promoting energy \nadvancement as an engine for growth. The energy revolution is truly \nhistoric. It is creating thousands of jobs, lowering costs for the \nmiddle class, and helping lift many into that middle class. This budget \nembraces that progress. It aims to remove needless barriers to \nenvironmentally responsible energy development. I expect other Members \nto come to the floor to discuss the energy component in greater detail \ntoday.\n  I also expect Members will come to discuss funding America's national \nsecurity needs. As we know, there are numerous threats facing our \ncountry--terrorism practiced by groups such as ISIL, Al Qaeda and its \nassociates; Iranian efforts to advance its ballistic missile program, \npursue a nuclear weapon, and sponsor terror; and Russian and Chinese \nattempts to expand their spheres of influence, which will require us to \nmodernize our force.\n  We must eventually give the Defense Department the certainty it needs \nto modernize the force. Members continue to work toward solutions for \nfunding defense in the most robust and predictable way possible.\n  I commend Chairman Enzi and Senator Lindsey Graham for providing us \nwith a path forward in the interim. Their proposal represents a good-\nfaith compromise to begin the legislative process for the Defense \nauthorization bill we will consider later this year--when the \nadditional overseas contingency funds can be prudently allocated \nagainst the actual procurement and modernization needs of our military, \nif only for the coming fiscal year.\n  Short of revising the BCA, this is the best strategy to keep faith \nwith our armed services, and this is the best option we currently have \nfor leaving President Obama's successor in a better position to face so \nmany global challenges.\n  Every budget, obviously, is a compromise. This one is surely that, \nbut it is a good compromise. It embraces growth. It reaches for a more \nprosperous energy future. It positions our Nation for a better outcome \nthan we have seen otherwise on defense. It is bold, yet balanced, and \nit aims to change Washington's focus away from the needs of big-\nspending politicians and toward the aspirations of hard-working \nAmericans who are very right to demand a government that is efficient, \naccountable, and focused on growth.\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\n  This budget is all of those things, and I urge our colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1740-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, these budgets we deal with are more than \njust a piece of paper with a lot of numbers. Each budget we put forward \nand the Republicans put forward are statements of our values, and it \ntells Americans basically whose side we are on.\n  I think, when we look at these budgets, we will find the budget we \nhave propounded--and we will see when the votes take place this week--\ncontains values that put the middle class first. Ours is a budget that \nsupports hard-working families, creates jobs, and invests in our \nfuture.\n  The Republicans, by contrast, have developed a budget that attacks \nthe middle class and serves the interests of special interests and the \nsuperwealthy. How can I say that? I say that because it is the truth.\n  For example, here are some of the priorities the Republicans are \nproposing in their budget. They want to take away health care from 16.4 \nmillion Americans now insured through ObamaCare. The Senate \nRepublicans' budget wreaks havoc on Medicare at the expense of \nAmerica's seniors. The Senate Republicans' budget makes drastic cuts to \nMedicaid and undercuts millions of families who rely on it to pay for \nnursing homes and other care. A lot of the care we have in nursing \nhomes is not for people who are indigent; it is for people who have had \nto go to Medicaid because everything they have worked for their whole \nlife is gone.\n  The budget the Republicans are pushing guts nutrition assistance for \nthose in need, slices job training and employment services for millions \nof American workers, and it cuts billions of financial aid for college \nstudents. That is the truth.\n  These items are all attacking middle-class priorities. The \nRepublicans, as usual, have gone the extra mile to protect special \ninterests and the super-rich.\n  Incredibly, even as they take money away from hard-working families, \nseniors, and students, Republicans will not close a single tax loophole \nto reduce the deficit--not one. Do they indirectly pay those super-rich \nmore money? Of course they do.\n  Forbes magazine had an article. For 2 years, between 2011 and 2013, \nthe top 14 richest people in America gained during that period of time \nalmost $200 billion. It is hard to comprehend, but it is true--14 \npeople, about $200 billion.\n  Would the budget that has been put forth by the Republicans end tax \nbreaks for companies that ship jobs overseas? No. Would they close \nloopholes for wealthy hedge fund managers? No. Would they take away \nwasteful and unneeded breaks for these huge oil and gas companies? No, \nnot a single one. Would they ask millionaires and even billionaires to \npay a penny more? No, not one.\n  Attacking the middle class while protecting the superwealthy isn't \njust irresponsible, some would say it is immoral.\n  There is more. The budget is dishonest. It claims to balance the \nbudget, but it doesn't. To talk about balancing the budget over 10 \nyears is so foolish and so untrue.\n  USA TODAY--the newspaper--said the Republicans' budget relies \n``heavily on huge and politically unlikely spending cuts and \nbewildering gimmicks that don't begin to add up.''\n  The New York Times, in one of its op-eds, said the budget is a \n``trillion dollar con job.''\n  I am not saying this. We have USA TODAY and the New York Times.\n  But who is being fooled here? In fact, there is one area where so far \nmany people have been fooled and they have been fooled a lot.\n  During the markup of the budget resolution, Senate Republicans \nclaimed to increase defense spending by adding an extra $38 billion in \nwar funding, known as overseas contingency operations or OCO as we call \nit. The Republican leader talked about that a few minutes ago, but that \nmoney isn't even close to being real. Because of what seems to be a \ndrafting error, not one extra dollar can be spent on defense above the \nsequestration caps.\n  The resolution currently on the floor puts a strict cap on OCO \nspending. For whatever reason, Republicans neglected to increase the \ncap to allow for the additional $38 billion for defense. In other \nwords, the Republicans' extra defense money is a fraud, a hoax, and \ncertainly a political gimmick.\n  We want to provide real sequestration relief, which has so bewildered \nthe country in so many different ways, not only to defense but also the \nNational Institutes of Health and virtually every program in America. \nWe are going to propose just that as we move forward to get rid of \nsequestration.\n  So we all look forward on this side to the debate. When it is over, \nAmericans will have no doubt which party stands with the middle class \nand which party stands with special interests, millionaires, and \nbillionaires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1740-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. Con. Res. 11, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 11) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2016 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2017 through 2025.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Sanders/Wyden amendment No. 323, to create millions of \n     middle class jobs by investing in our nation's infrastructure \n     paid for by raising revenue through closing loopholes in the \n     corporate and international tax system.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Colleagues, good morning. Working with Senator Sanders \nyesterday, we made good progress on opening day for the budget \nresolution. It might not have been as fun as being at opening day for \nbaseball, but getting underway on the first balanced budget resolution \nthis Senate has seen in nearly 20 years was pretty exciting for me, and \nI appreciate the good work and the full debate we have had.\n  Today, I am looking forward to more work on a variety of amendment \nideas for the resolution. Some Senators want to debate amendment ideas \nthat have to do with the budget and some Senators want to debate \namendment ideas that have nothing to do with the budget. So we will \nhear from some Senators today on issues such as our spending caps or \nthe sequester, how best to preserve and protect Social Security, and \nwhat is the best way to ensure women are treated fairly in the \nworkforce.\n  Other Senators may want to discuss items such as how to treat the \nwaterways of the United States, free from overreach from the EPA, or \nhow our communities and localities are under siege from Washington when \nit comes to ideas about taxing carbon or coal, and Senators may wish to \ndiscuss how our national security is best served by the spending levels \ncontemplated in the budget. But we will also hear about something that \nreally interests me, as it marries the numbers our budget resolution \ncarries with the work our committees and Congress can do once the \nbudget is passed.\n\n  I think one of the frustrations of the other side is this is a fairly \ngeneral budget because it sets the spending limits for the committees \nand then builds in some reserve funds for some flexibility. It doesn't \ngo into the specifics of exactly how the committees are to operate. The \nreason for that is the committees are the people who have at least an \nintense interest in that field or maybe even a lot of expertise. When \nwe try to preclude what they are doing by what we do in the budget, it \nwon't work.\n  We will also hear about something that marries the numbers our budget \nresolution carries with the work our committees and Congress can do \nonce the budget is passed. The statutory deadline for passing the \nbudget is April 15. Just prior to that, we are going to have a 2-week \nrecess, which shortens the amount of time we have to work.\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\n  I would remind everybody that Republicans have only been in charge \nfor a few weeks and are going to pass the first budget in 6 years. That \nis a pretty fast track to be on, but I am pleased with where we are at \nthe moment.\n  Later on this morning, the Senate will consider an amendment to help \nimprove care for children with medical complexity within Medicaid. \nChildren with medical complexity require intensive health care \nservices. These children often have two or more serious chronic \nconditions, and often see six or more specialists and a dozen or more \nphysicians. They also often require care that takes them across State \nlines. There are 2 million of these children on Medicaid.\n  Reflecting a bipartisan bill, Senator Portman intends to offer an \namendment to create a reserve fund in anticipation of committee action \nthat recognizes the critical importance of Medicaid to children with \nmedical complexity, and the need for greater coordination and \nintegration of care for this population within Medicaid. If Congress \ncan write a bill that fits this reserve fund, then we can benefit \nchildren with medical complexity and their families. I look forward to \na good debate and several votes in the Senate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I look forward to continuing to work with \nSenator Enzi in a thoughtful and important process, and I thank the \nSenator for his civility. I think we are going to have an interesting \nfew days.\n  To my mind, the basic issue surrounding this budget debate is whether \nwe address the enormous needs facing a declining middle class and \nwhether we come forth with ideas that create the jobs--the millions of \njobs our people need--whether we raise the wages that millions of \nworkers desperately need who today are working for $7.50 an hour, $8 an \nhour, whether we deal with the scandal of pay equity in this country \nwhere women are making 78 cents on the dollar compared to men, whether \nwe make sure we do not cut Social Security at a time when there are so \nmany vulnerable seniors out there whose entire income or almost their \nentire income is Social Security.\n  In my view, we cannot balance the budget on the most vulnerable \npeople in this country. We cannot cut the Meals on Wheels Program. We \ncannot cut Head Start. Essentially at a time when the middle class is \nshrinking, we cannot balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, \nthe children, the sick, and the poor.\n  On my side of the aisle in the Democratic Caucus, what people are \nlooking at is massive wealth and income inequality taking place in \nAmerica. Senator Reid a few minutes ago made the point that in the last \n2 years alone--the last 2 years alone--the wealthiest 14 people in this \ncountry have seen their wealth increase by over $150 billion--in 2 \nyears. That is more wealth that they have increased in 2 years than the \nbottom 40 percent of the American people own. That is pretty crazy. The \nricher are becoming phenomenally richer, and we have tens of millions \nof Americans struggling to keep their heads above water.\n  My Republican colleagues say, well, we want to deal with the deficit \nby cutting programs for the working families, lower income people, the \npeople who are struggling, but we are not going to ask the wealthy or \nlargest corporations in this country who are doing phenomenally well to \npay an additional nickel in taxes. That does not make sense to me. I do \nnot believe it makes sense to the American people.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 323, as Modified\n\n  Having said that, what I wish to do now is get to an amendment that \nis currently at the desk, and I ask that the pending amendment be \nmodified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, line 5, increase the amount by $25,001,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by

Mr. President, what this amendment deals with is \nsomething I think virtually every Member of this body understands to be \nan enormously important issue, and the American people understand it as \nwell, and that is our crumbling infrastructure and the fact we have to \nbegin the process to substantially invest in our roads, our bridges, \nour water systems and our wastewater plants, our levees and our dams \nand our airports. The needs out there are enormous. When we do that, we \ncan create millions of jobs at a time when we need to create millions \nof jobs. I heard Senator Enzi yesterday speaking on the issue. I think \nhe reflects the views of many. I don't think there is a great debate on \nwhether our infrastructure is crumbling. I don't think there is a great \ndebate--and I speak as a former mayor--that if you allow your \ninfrastructure to continue to crumble, it only becomes more expensive \nto rebuild it. I don't think there is a debate on that. The debate, of \ncourse, comes down to how you pay for it. That debate has been going on \nhere for many years.\n  If anyone had a magical solution, I suspect it would have been \nbrought forth already. But the proposal we are bringing forth calls for \na $478 billion investment over a 6-year period. That will be paid for \nby eliminating some outrageous corporate loopholes today that, among \nother things, allow large, profitable corporations to stash their \nprofits in the Cayman Islands, in Bermuda, and in other tax havens and \nnot have to pay one nickel in taxes to the U.S. Government. Our \nproposal is pretty simple. Let's eliminate some of those loopholes, \nlet's take that money, let's invest in rebuilding our crumbling \ninfrastructure, let's make our country more efficient, more productive, \nsafer, and let us create millions of jobs.\n  The need for rebuilding our infrastructure should not be in doubt. \nOne out of every nine bridges in our country is structurally deficient, \nand nearly one-quarter are functionally obsolete. Almost one-third of \nour roads are in poor or mediocre condition. And as everybody stuck in \na traffic jam at this moment knows, more than 42 percent of urban \nhighways are congested.\n  Much of our rail network is obsolete. We are competing against \ncountries which have high-speed rail, which operates much more rapidly \nthan our railroads do. America's airports are bursting at the seams and \nstill rely on antiquated 1960s radar technology. More than 4,000 of our \nNation's dams are considered deficient, and nearly 9 percent of all \nlevees are likely to fail during a major flood. That is a pretty scary \nproposition. Our drinking water systems are nearing the end of their \nuseful lives all over this country. Virtually every day there is \nanother pipe which bursts, causing flooding in downtowns and wasting \nhuge amounts of clean drinking water. Further, our wastewater plants \nroutinely fail during heavy rains, allowing all kinds of crap to go \ninto our lakes and our rivers, which should not be the case. Our aging \nelectrical grid has hundreds of avoidable power failures each year and \nis unacceptably vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n  Now $478 billion may seem like a lot of money. It is a lot of money, \nbut the American Society of Civil Engineers tells us we need to invest \nan additional $1.6 trillion to get our infrastructure into a state of \ngood repair by 2020. To be honest with you, while this amendment is a \nsignificant step forward, it does not go anywhere near as far as it \nshould go.\n  I would hope on this amendment we would have strong bipartisan \nsupport. It is not good enough for people to continue to say what \neverybody acknowledges--yes, we need to rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure, but, no, we don't know how we are going to come up with \nthe money to do it. It is too late to keep expressing that rhetoric. We \nhave heard it for too many years. Every day we don't act, it becomes \nmore expensive for us to act.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to today make an \nimportant statement that, A, we cannot continue to delay rebuilding our \ncrumbling infrastructure; that, B, when real unemployment in this \ncountry is not 5\\1/2\\ percent but 11 percent, when youth unemployment \nis 17 percent, when African-American youth unemployment is off the \ncharts, we need a major jobs program to put our people back to work at \ndecent wages. That is what work on infrastructure does. The time for \nrhetoric is gone. The time for action is now. Let's rebuild our \ncrumbling infrastructure. Let's put people to work. Let's end \noutrageous corporate tax loopholes. Let's make our country safer, more \nefficient, and more productive. I ask for support for that important \namendment which comes up for a vote I believe at around 12:00 or so.\n  I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if no one arrives, may I have 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, yes, of course.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so grateful to Senator Sanders \nbecause he explains things like no one else. He takes it down to the \naverage working family in America. That is really who we are here to \nprotect, not the super top rich people. They are doing fine.\n  Senator Sanders taught me something this morning. I am just going to \nmake sure I remember it correctly. The wealth of the top 14 richest \npeople in America in the last couple of years went up over $100 \nbillion.\n  How much was it?\n  Mr. SANDERS. It was $157 billion in a 2-year period.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In a 2-year period--the wealthiest of the wealthiest, 14 \npeople--that wealth rose $157 billion. Yet\n\n[[Page S1743]]\n\nwhen we look at this Republican budget, those people get every benefit \nwe can imagine. They are not asked to do a thing--a thing. When people \nare struggling sending their kids to college, Lord knows, when people \nare struggling trying to afford a new home, when people are struggling \nevery day to make ends meet--some even to put nutritious food on the \ntable--this budget is a blueprint of unfairness. This budget, this \nRepublican budget, is a blueprint for another recession. It is a \nterrible budget, and it makes believe it balances. It doesn't balance \none bit.\n\n  Our ranking member will explain the smoke and mirrors that have been \nused in this budget. I used to serve on the Budget Committee. Let me be \nclear to anyone within the sound of my voice. In recent times the only \ntime the budget was balanced was when President Clinton was President, \nand only Democrats voted for his budget. We balanced the budget. And \nyou know what; we created 23 million jobs because we invested in \npeople, in education, in our children.\n  Not this budget--they cut--deep cuts out of domestic spending. They \ntake $236 billion over 10 years from nondefense. That means they are \ncutting education, scientific research, food safety, law enforcement, \nand every single program the middle class and working Americans depend \non.\n  I want to thank the ranking member of the Budget Committee. He is \ntaking on such leadership in his position here and on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee by calling attention to our failing \ninfrastructure. There are 63,500 bridges that are structurally \ndeficient in America, and 50 percent of our roads are in less than good \ncondition. And what does this Republican budget do? By the way, this is \na big problem for our businesses. They cut 17 percent of overall \nspending, ignoring the fact that our roads are in disrepair and \nignoring the fact that we face the prospect of crumbling bridges. That \nis a blow to everyone who drives on our roads.\n  At a time when energy costs are weighing heavily on families and \nbusinesses, they cut 85 percent in overall energy spending, including \nweatherization funding. What are they thinking? When a middle class \nfamily weatherizes their home, the energy bill goes down. They are \nputting a tax on every middle class person who has to pay a heating \nbill. Energy efficiency grants, no--cut. Research to clean energy, cut. \nIt is a blow to our consumers and to our efforts to mitigate climate \nchange.\n  At a time when college is a necessity and priority, they want to cut \nPell grant funding by 30 percent over 10 years and to reduce overall \nspending on education and training by 15 percent--a blow to our \nstudents. Not for the students whose parents are in that top echelon--\nthere is no problem there. They can afford $40,000 a year college--\n$30,000, $60,000. It is for our middle class and for those striving to \nbe in the middle class. They are doomed with this budget.\n  Now, President Obama has turned this great recession around, but our \nranking member points out the problems that remain. The solutions \naren't that hard to come by. You make investments--not wasteful \nspending but investments in energy, investments in transportation, \ninvestments in finding cures for diseases. And what do you do? You make \nthis a greater country, and you make lives better across the board.\n  There are 45 million people who are still recovering from the \nrecession, including 16 million children who live in poverty. The \nRepublicans leave the top echelon alone, who are making billions of \ndollars, and they are cutting $660 billion from income security over 10 \nyears. That means they are cutting supplemental nutrition assistance, \nschool lunch, unemployment insurance, earned-income tax credit.\n  I don't know who they think they represent, but I will tell you who \nthey fight for--the wealthiest of the wealthiest few. That is who they \nfight for.\n  That old notion that you give billionaires money and somehow it will \ntrickle down to the rest of us doesn't work. It doesn't work to cut \neducation funding. It doesn't work to cut transportation funding. It \ndoesn't work to cut energy assistance programs.\n  I have to say that it is a shock to see this budget. If that is why \nthey think they got elected, then the people better pay attention.\n  Listen to what they do with health care. They do away with the \nAffordable Care Act, when 16 million people now have insurance who \ndidn't have it before. And guess what; do they have a replacement? They \nare working on it. Oh, good, we worked on it for 50 years. We finally \ngot it done. It is not perfect, but it is working. In my State it is \nmagnificent to see people who now know they won't lose everything if \nthey get sick. At a time when 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid and \nchildren's health coverage, they want to block grant that program and \ncut it by more than $1.2 trillion. What will it mean for maternity care \nwhen half of all births in the U.S. are financed by Medicaid? This is \nanother blow to our families, to our babies. They fight for your right \nto be born. How about after you are born? How about after you are born?\n  At a time when more than 50 million seniors and disabled Americans \nare on Medicare and the baby boomers continue to age in, they want to \ncut Medicare by $430 billion. Now, look, they are afraid to spell out \nhow they want to cut it. They kind of hide it in the documents, but we \nknow what happens. People will be suffering, paying more, getting less \ncare--a blow to our seniors.\n  They do not close one tax loophole for the wealthiest corporations--\nsome of which pay no income tax--or these billionaires. Now, I have \nnothing against being a billionaire at all, but this Congress ought to \nask everyone to pay their fair share, including billionaires--not just \nthe middle class.\n  Now, their gimmicks are unbelievable. They hide defense spending in \nan off-budget account called OCO. Oh no, OCO--they hide it, but we got \ntheir number. I think Al Sharpton says on his show: ``We gotcha.'' We \nknow what you are doing. Where is the emergency fund for our children? \nWhere is the emergency fund for education? Where is the emergency fund \nfor transportation? No, there is no OCO for that, no.\n  Then they claim they balance the budget. That is the biggest fib \never. Look at their record. When George W. Bush got elected, he had a \nsurplus. It took him 15 minutes to blow it--two wars on the credit \ncard, tax cuts for the rich on the credit card. This budget continues \nthat legacy of shame--shame--hurting our seniors, hurting our children, \nhurting our middle class, all at the expense of the wealthy few.\n  We see that President Obama has cut this deficit by more than half. \nWe are on the right track. Let's not walk away from policies that work.\n  I want to say to the ranking member, Senator Sanders, I am strongly \nsupporting your amendment on infrastructure, because to be a great \nNation we have to move people, we have to move goods. This is a global \nmarketplace. Ships are coming in to California--40 percent of the \nimports. They are transferred to trucks, and they go on roads that are \nfull of pot holes. They are a mess. They have rail crossings that are \ndangerous.\n  So I will conclude in 20 seconds, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will conclude. I want to thank our ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee because he talks from the heart, the soul, and \nfrom facts. If we follow his leadership, rather than the leadership of \nthose on the other side of the aisle who want to go back to the days of \nhigh deficits, high unemployment, and chaos--and we were here; we know \nthere was chaos--if not, then vote for this Republican budget. I hope \nwe will vote no, and I hope we will support the amendment that will \ncome forward to put us on the right track again.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, it will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to improve health \n outcomes and lower the costs of caring for medically complex children \n                              in Medicaid)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO IMPROVE HEALTH \n                   OUTCOMES AND LOWER THE COSTS OF CARING FOR \n                   MEDICALLY COMPLEX CHILDREN IN MEDICAID.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to improving the health outcomes and lowering the \n     costs of caring for medically complex children in Medicaid, \n     which may include creating or expanding integrated delivery \n     models or improving care coordination, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not increase the deficit over \n     either the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2020 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2025.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we are here talking about the budget. One \nof the issues on the budget is how we spend our money, including on \nhealth care and in this case on some of our most vulnerable young \npeople, our children, who have what are termed to be ``complex medical \nconditions.''\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Bennet is cosponsoring this \namendment with me. It is based on some bipartisan legislation we have \nbeen working on over the years that helps to ensure that these children \nhave the opportunity to get better care, and also we can save some \nfunds in what is a very inefficient Medicaid delivery system now for \nthese children.\n  It would allow, basically, health care providers to deliver health \ncare services to these medically complex kids through models that \ncoordinate care between providers, again helping to improve quality of \ncare--and much better outcomes in the cases where this has been tried--\nbut also to lower costs for Medicaid.\n  There are roughly 3 million children who fit in this category. It is \nabout 1 in every 25 children. Of these children, by the way, most of \nthem rely on Medicaid to access care, about 2 million out of the 3 \nmillion.\n  Although children with complex conditions represent only about 6 \npercent of pediatric Medicaid patients, they comprise about 40 percent \nof the cost, so 6 percent of the kids, about 40 percent of the cost of \nall Medicaid spending on children.\n  Children with these medically complex situations tend to have \nmultiple and high acuity and chronic conditions that often require the \nservice of a lot of different specialists. These circumstances call out \nfor better coordination of care, particularly because a lot of it goes \nacross State lines. Each Medicaid Program in each State has some \ndifferent rules, but specialized care often requires these children to \ngo to specialized providers outside of their State. This amendment \nwould correct that fragmented system which those kids sometimes \nencounter now when they do seek that access across State lines.\n  Not only would the amendment ensure that medically complex children \nhave access to necessary care, it would also allow the Medicaid system \nto realize savings through these increased efficiencies, including \nreducing hospitalizations and emergency room visits, while providing \nthe array of outpatient and community services and support that are \nneeded by these children. So it is a more holistic approach to their \ncare, avoiding, frankly, some of the costs associated with emergency \nroom visits and other hospitalizations and other fragmented care. It is \nbased on the experiences in the real world.\n  There are programs that are doing quite well at improving those \noutcomes and saving costs. Some of the great children's hospitals have \nestablished their track record in developing these care-coordination \nmodels for kids with medical complexity. I have seen it in action in \nOhio, where we are blessed to have a number of great children's \nhospitals. I have talked to medical professionals who are very pleased \nto have this better coordination of care. More importantly, I have \ntalked to the parents and talked to some of the children themselves who \nare ecstatic about it. You know, many of them received their care \nthrough a different process previously that was not coordinated. What \nthey tell me is they are deeply grateful for the coordination, partly \nbecause it saves them a lot of time and effort, partly because they are \ngetting much better care, and partly because they just feel as if \nsomebody cares. They are getting the love and support and care they \nneed through the coordination. They are grateful for the difference.\n  As the overall population of children with medical complexity \ncontinues to grow, thanks to some great advances in medical science and \nmedical care, including care for premature babies, we are going to see \nmore and more of this need for better coordination. I want to thank my \ncolleague Senator Bennet and many others on both sides of the aisle who \nhave been involved in this issue over the years. This is an important \namendment for us to have in the Budget Committee because it shows where \nour heart is as a Senate--to be able to take better care of these kids \nand also have more efficient care in the Medicaid system, where, again, \n6 percent of these children now comprise about 40 percent of the cost \nin Medicaid for children.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense approach \nto provide better health care outcomes for some of the most vulnerable \nof our Nation's children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 386\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO PROTECT MEDICAID \n                   BENEFICIARIES FROM BENEFIT CUTS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to Medicaid, which may include protecting children, \n     pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, low-income \n     adults, and Americans that need long-term services and \n     supports, including nursing home care, who are guaranteed \n     benefits under Medicaid, by the amounts provided in such \n     legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, Senator Portman's amendment touches \nupon a serious issue that I hope and expect will have broad bipartisan \nsupport, and that is the needs of children with serious chronic \nconditions.\n  In the United States, over 3 million children have medically complex \nhealth conditions. Of those 3 million kids, 2 million rely on Medicaid \nfor their health insurance. That is two out of three kids, which should \ntell every Member of the Senate how important Medicaid is.\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\n  Let me repeat. Two out of three children rely on Medicaid. They have \nmedically complex issues--the issues Senator Portman is speaking about.\n  Last Congress, Senator Nelson offered a similar amendment during the \nbudget process to address this important issue, and I was pleased to \nsupport it. I also plan to support this amendment today and hope that \nwe have widespread bipartisan support for it.\n  But what I must say is that given that the Republican budget \neliminates the Affordable Care Act, which throws 15 million Americans \noff of health insurance--many of whom have just, for the first time in \ntheir lives, received health insurance--and given that the Republican \nbudget cuts Medicaid by some $400 billion over a 10-year period, the \namendment Senator Portman is offering deals with only one tiny and \nsmall part of what the Republican budget is doing. What the Republican \nbudget is doing is decimating health care in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Senator Portman says: Well, we have a situation with kids who have \nmedically complex problems.\n  He is right, but we have many other issues out there that the \nRepublicans are decimating.\n  Medicaid provides 6.4 million elderly seniors who rely on Medicaid, \nmany of whom are living in nursing homes--6.4 million elderly seniors, \nsome 80 or 90 years of age, rely on Medicaid for their nursing home \ncare. In some cases, these seniors have incomes of $8,000 to $9,000 a \nyear. The Portman amendment does not address the devastating cuts that \nhappen to elderly Americans in nursing homes.\n  Pregnant women who rely on Medicaid for vital prenatal care that \nimproves the health and well-being of mothers and babies--those \nprograms are going to be cut. The Portman amendment does not protect \nthem in any way.\n  Nearly 33 million children in our country rely on Medicaid for their \nhealth insurance. These are kids of low-income, working-class families, \nand they need important medical care when they are young, such as \nimmunizations and well-child visits. The Portman amendment does not \naddress the fact that many of those people will be thrown off of health \ninsurance.\n  Some 10 million Americans with disabilities rely on Medicaid to treat \nserious, sometimes life-threatening disabilities. The Portman amendment \ndoes not address what happens to people with disabilities who are on \nMedicaid.\n  While I support this amendment, I am also concerned about the \ndevastating impact the Republican budget will have on many millions of \nAmericans by ending the Affordable Care Act--16 million Americans \nthrown off of health insurance, $400 billion in cuts in Medicaid, \nmillions more.\n  I believe we need a budget that strengthens health care in America, \nnot decimates it. I believe we need a budget that doesn't force us to \nchoose between a seriously ill child and a pregnant woman with small \nchildren at home. These are false choices which a great nation such as \nours should not be forced to make, especially at a time, as Senator \nBoxer mentioned, when we have the wealthiest 14 people in this country \nseeing their wealth increase in the last 2 years by $157 billion. Our \nRepublican friends say: No, these people should not be asked to pay \nmore in taxes, but we should balance the budget by taking millions of \npeople off of health insurance. I don't think anybody in America thinks \nthose priorities make any sense at all.\n  I am offering a side-by-side, and in doing so, I urge my colleagues \nto vote for the Portman amendment but also to vote for my amendment, \ncosponsored by Senator Wyden, which supports all Medicaid beneficiaries \nby opposing cuts to the program.\n  Let's not sit around saying: Well, we are making some progress in one \narea, but we don't care about the millions of other people who have \nbeen thrown off of Medicaid.\n  I urge support for the amendment Senator Wyden and I are offering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 12 noon today be equally divided between the managers or their \ndesignees; that at 12 noon, the Senate vote in relation to the \nfollowing amendments in the order listed, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the votes: Sanders No. 323, as modified, \nSanders No. 386, and Portman No. 349, with 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before each vote; and that following the votes, the Senate \nrecess under the previous order. I further ask that the time from 2:15 \np.m. to 3 p.m. be under the control of the minority and that the time \nfrom 3 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. be under the control of the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. For the information of all Senators, there will be three \nrollcall votes at 12 noon today, with an additional stack of votes \nexpected at 4:30 p.m. today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, despite the repeated statements and \nwarnings from our military and some of our congressional leaders, \nincluding myself, we are again staring down the barrel of \nsequestration.\n  This has been the great fear we have had, and I think we have come to \na compromise here that might be liveable--not ideal, not where we \nshould be, but where we are at this time.\n  Each service chief and each Secretary--and I have never seen this \nbefore--has testified that no service will be able to meet the wartime \nrequirements under sequestration--that is in the event we have to have \nsequestration of the military portion.\n  Let me just mention that it was done wrong from the very beginning. \nWhen you talk about sequestration, it would seem to me that we would \nwant to be sequestering or reducing in a relationship or proportion as \nto what that is of the budget. For example, our military is 16 percent \nof the budget, and yet we have had to take 50 percent of the cuts. So \nsequestration has gotten us to this point.\n  This budget we will be voting on has kind of a temporary solution or \nrelief from sequestration.\n  Secretary Carter, our new Secretary of Defense, testified that \n``readiness remains at troubling levels across the force'' and ``that \neven with the FY16 budget, the Army, Navy and Marine Corps won't reach \ntheir readiness goals until 2020 and the Air Force until 2023.''\n  This was interesting because we had a hearing where we had faces from \nthe past--Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, and Madeleine Albright. So we \nhad Democrats and Republicans, and they all agreed.\n  Madeleine Albright testified about her concerns about the deep cuts \nto the Defense Department, saying that it ``jeopardizes America's \nmilitary reach.'' This is a Democrat talking--Madeleine Albright.\n  Over the last 6 years, significant cuts to the national security \nspending have forced our men and women in uniform to endure a steep and \ndamaging drop in capabilities and readiness.\n  All of them testified that our readiness is dropping. When you are \ntalking about readiness, you are talking about risk. When you are \ntalking about risk, you are talking about American lives. Our naval \nfleet is at a historical low level of ships. The Air Force is the \nsmallest in its history. The Army is shrinking to a force not seen \nsince before World War II.\n  At a time when our security is being increasingly threatened by \nterrorism, a rising China, ISIL, ISIS, and rogue nations such as Iran \nand North Korea, the men and women charged with protecting this Nation \nare being undermined and forced to endure devastating cuts to the tools \nthey need to keep America safe.\n  What we are talking about is something that has happened up to this \npoint--not the potential of sequestration, which hopefully we can avoid \nand I think we will avoid, but what has happened up to this point.\n  The President believes the world is getting safer. He is negotiating \na bad deal with Iran. He thinks global warming is a bigger threat to \nAmericans than terrorism, but top leaders inside and out of the \nadministration disagree.\n  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper--James Clapper has \nbeen in this kind of capacity for well over 40 years--said:\n\n       When the final accounting is done, 2014 will have been the \n     most lethal year for global\n\n[[Page S1746]]\n\n     terrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled. . . . \n     Roughly half of the world's currently stable countries are at \n     some risk of instability over the next two years.\n\n  The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Vincent \nStewart, before our committee just a couple of weeks ago, stated:\n\n       A confluence of global, political, military, social, and \n     technological developments, taken in aggregate, have created \n     security challenges more diverse and complex than those we \n     have experienced in our lifetimes.\n\n  That was Lt. Gen. Vincent Stuart, the DIA Director.\n  Over the last three decades, we have built the most powerful fighting \nforce in history and filled it with the most talented men and women \never to wear our uniform. We can't break our promise to them or our \nresponsibility to protect the Nation.\n  I believe our military--our men and women in uniform--will not accept \nfailure and will do everything they can to succeed no matter how \nconstrained they are by inadequate budgets. However, there will come a \npoint when, without the training, equipment, and force size, it will \nfail because it was not given the resources to succeed. We cannot let \nour military get to this point, but that is what we are risking should \nwe have another level of sequestration.\n  Before sequestration even came into effect, the President cut some \n$500 billion from our military. We stood on this floor and talked about \nit at that time, about how we can't continue having cuts just to the \nmilitary. That is what happened from this President before \nsequestration. Because of sequestration for fiscal year 2013, the Army \nhad to cancel seven combat training center rotations, deferred \nmaintenance on aircraft and vehicles, and postponed reset of weapons \nand equipment. The Air Force stood down 17 combat squadrons, cut 40,000 \nflying hours for its remaining units, cut training, and deferred \nmaintenance activities.\n  This is a problem that we have, too, because we have to consider the \ndifference between retraining and retaining in the Air Force. The \npilots--to train a pilot to F-22 standards costs in excess of $9 \nmillion, while retentions are something like $200,000 over a 9- or 10-\nyear period.\n  Because of the sequestration in 2013, the Navy and Marine Corps \ncanceled deployments, deferred maintenance on ships, aircraft, and \nvehicles, reduced purchases of spare parts, and reduced training \nactivities. All the services had to cut or delay weapon system and \ninfrastructure modernization.\n  Modernization is one of the first things they do when they cut. They \nreally can't do the readiness, they can't cut the personnel who are out \nthere, the force strength, so modernization is what suffers because \nthat is not something people are aware of today. Yet that is where the \ncuts were. They are still attempting to recover from all of these cuts.\n  But recent budget turmoil has forced our generals and admirals to \nworry about our military's ability to fulfill its critical national \nsecurity role in, arguably, the most dangerous time in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--that is General Dempsey--\nwarned that continued national security cuts will ``severely limit our \nability to implement our defense strategy.'' He means there the defense \nstrategy to defend our country and to save lives out there. ``It will \nput the nation at greater risk of coercion, and it will break faith \nwith men and women in uniform.'' That is General Dempsey, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Our Nation relies on less than 1 percent who volunteer to risk their \nlives on its behalf. I was trying to get a comparable figure to put \nthat in perspective, but we are talking about 1 percent of our \npopulation is involved in protecting the other 99 percent. When these \nbrave men and women are ordered into harm's way, they will salute with \ncourage, they will go and do their job, their mission, and very \neffectively, but they do not have the right equipment to do it with. In \nreturn, they rightfully expect a supportive nation to provide them with \nthe best training, technology, and equipment to accomplish their \nmission and then to come home safely. Tragically, we are not doing \nthat.\n  Put simply, top military leaders are telling us that continued cuts \nto national security spending are making this country less safe. These \ncuts are making it more likely that our military men and women will not \nreturn from the battlefield alive, and this is immoral.\n  We must increase our defense budget, and I prefer to increase its \nbase budget in fiscal year 2016 and over the next 5 years to give our \nmilitary leadership the required and predictable funding they need. \nBecause of Senate rules, however, we aren't able to do this without \nchanging the law. I am committed to working to the point where we can \nreplace sequestration with cuts to mandatory spending, as was \noriginally planned with the Budget Control Act.\n  We went through the Budget Control Act assuming some of these things \nwould happen. For the purposes of a Senate budget resolution, however, \nI am proud of the Budget Committee and the hard work they have done for \nadopting an amendment during their markup to provide additional funding \nfor the Department of Defense through overseas contingency operations. \nThat is OCO. This is far from ideal. OCO money is better than no money \nat all, and until we provide the solution to sequestration we need, \nthis is the best we can do.\n  Our country is at war and will be for the foreseeable future and we \nare going to have to do something to keep America strong. I don't like \nthis alternative. We have had nothing but a series of bad alternatives \nand this is the least bad alternative. So I salute Senator Enzi and \nothers who are responsible for coming up with something that still is \ngoing to defend our Nation, particularly as we are faced with another \npotential round of sequestration. We can't let that happen to our men \nand women in uniform nor to America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that even though \nwe had an agreement for time to be equally divided--yesterday, we \npassed one that said whenever we are in a quorum call, the time would \nbe equally divided--I hope that would continue through all these quorum \ncalls, and so I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Transportation Reauthorization Bill\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, I want to thank my good \nfriend from Vermont for drawing attention to the critical importance of \npassing a long-term Transportation reauthorization bill. This is one \nthat Senator Boxer and I have been working together on for a long \nperiod of time. We have gone through these reauthorizations for many \nyears, and we know this is the way to do it.\n  The reauthorization bill is far superior to just the short-term \nefforts for extensions. I think we all realize extensions cost about 30 \npercent off the top. And while I can't support the specific proposal of \nmy good friend from Vermont, passing a bipartisan long-term fully \nfunded bill is my top priority as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  As we all know, the current Transportation reauthorization expires on \nMay 31, and EPW will be prepared to move on a reauthorization bill \nbefore that deadline. That is our goal. My staff has been working \nclosely with the staff of my good friend and partner from California, \nthe ranking member, Senator Boxer, and we are getting close to having \nour bill ready.\n  I know my colleagues on the Committees on Finance, Commerce, Science \nand Transportation, and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs are also\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\ncommitted to passing a long-term bill as soon as possible, because this \ndoes involve not just the Environment and Public Works Committee but \nthe other two committees as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague and friend \nfrom Oklahoma, and I also want to thank the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Finance for being here because he is so right, we have to \nwork together. On the EPW Committee, we know how critical this is. The \nCommittee on Finance knows how critical it is because they have to \nfigure out the pay-fors--let's be honest, the hardest part of all \nthis--and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation also \nhas to work. I am sure Senator Thune is very aware of that, and his \nranking member as well.\n  MAP 21, our transportation bill, is set to expire as the summer \nconstruction season is beginning. Several States--Arkansas, Georgia, \nWyoming, and Tennessee--have already delayed or canceled construction \nprojects due to the uncertainty in the Federal transportation funding \nsystem. Other States are considering similar actions as the \nconstruction season fast approaches.\n  I want to make this point. We are going to hear from all of our \nStates. I am fortunate, I have such a large State they can go a little \nlonger with the uncertainty, but even California, which receives quite \na bit from the highway trust fund, is going to start to hurt pretty \nsoon.\n  I am so proud that my friend, my chairman, is here, because we have \nsuch a great history of working together on infrastructure projects--\nnot so good on the environment; we go toe to toe and don't work \ntogether on that, but we work together on infrastructure. He talks \nabout it as a proud conservative and I talk about it as a proud \nliberal, and we see why it is so critical for our Nation.\n  So we do have to work carefully to craft another bipartisan MAC-21, \nand I look forward to bringing that bill to the floor.\n  I want to make sure that when we do bring that bill to the floor we \nhave no controversial riders on it to bring it to a dead stop. We have \nseen that on so many bills already. I am really looking forward to \nbringing such a bill that is a clean bill that addresses our \ntransportation funding to the floor with Chairman Inhofe, with the \nsupport of Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden and others.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me say I agree and look forward to \nthat.\n  Sometimes people forget some of the things we are supposed to be \ndoing around here. The Constitution says roads and bridges. That is \nwhat we are supposed to be doing. So I will work closely with my friend \nfrom California to achieve this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the Senate is going to spend much of this \nweek debating the contours and the details of the Federal budget. Our \ncolleagues are going to offer a variety of amendments, and we will \nundoubtedly cast a lot of votes. Those watching are going to hear \nspeeches that are peppered with numbers and statistics. So I would like \nto start out the debate by setting aside, to the extent we can, this \nflood of numbers and statistics, and focus on what this means to \nworking families in my home State of Oregon and across the country.\n  My view is the great economic challenge of our time is expanding \nopportunity for these families. It is about strengthening the middle \nclass and adding sturdier rungs to America's economic ladder so \neverybody has the chance to climb upward.\n  Seven years after a crippling economic collapse, we have seen our \nunemployment rate go down, home foreclosures have gone down, gas prices \nhave gone down. We are finally starting to see wages beginning to grow, \nand manufacturing is picking up steam. The American economy is now \nperforming better than at any recent time in memory.\n  But the fact is there are still millions of Americans who feel stuck. \nThey listen to all of the positive economic news that ricochets across \nthe news media and wonder when things are actually going to get better \nfor them and their families. I hear it firsthand in every townhall \nmeeting I hold in our State, including several this month. These are \nyoung parents who are overwhelmed by the cost of childcare. There are \nstudents practically in shock over the sticker price of a college \neducation. We have workers who are nearing retirement age, confirmed by \nthe Finance Committee, who have hardly been able to save at all.\n  What the Senate budget is all about is not just facts and figures but \nabout the hopes and aspirations of those people I have described who \nwant things to change. In my view, the budget the Congress sets should \ntake on those middle-class challenges directly. It ought to help \nworking-class families and give more Americans a chance to get ahead in \nlife.\n  This week, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are putting \nforward a different kind of budget--a budget that would poke some new \nholes in the safety net and, in my view, would worsen inequality. We \nwould see millions of Americans face cuts in programs that are a \nlifeline for them. I have to ask, How will cutting a Pell grant and \neducation tax credits help a disadvantaged student in La Grande, OR, \nwho wants to work hard, play by the rules, and get ahead? How is \ncutting food stamps going to help a single mother in Ashland who is \nwalking on an economic tightrope every month? How is it going to help \nher keep food on the table? How will slashing Medicaid help a \nstruggling family in Roseburg, OR, stay healthy and out of the \nemergency room? And, finally, how would repealing the Affordable Care \nAct help a cancer survivor in Corvallis who has finally been able to \nget health insurance for the first time in years?\n  So my bottom line is pretty direct: Our middle class declines with \nevery rung that is pulled from the ladder of opportunity. So what we \nall ought to say is the budget is about trying to help Americans climb \nupward with a budget that is designed to give all Americans the \nopportunity to get ahead.\n  To me, we start by investing in America's infrastructure. We simply \ncannot have big league economic growth with a little league \ninfrastructure. The roads and highways in Oregon and across our country \nare now pocked by ruts and potholes, making it harder to do business \nand harder to travel. Dozens of people have been killed or injured in \nbridge collapses. Without adequate roads, bridges, and transit, drivers \nspend far too much time sitting in traffic choking on exhaust.\n  This also has taken a big toll on America's ability to compete \ninternationally. We have to have big league infrastructure to draw jobs \nand investment to our country, and that depends on the quality of our \nroads and ports and airports and railways. We know investing in \ninfrastructure creates thousands of jobs in America right away and \nsupports millions more over the long term.\n  In my view, effective, targeted investments in infrastructure ought \nto be a no-brainer on both sides of the aisle.\n  Second, the Congress ought to strengthen programs that assist rural \ncommunities and brighten their economic futures. For example, homes in \nOregon and across the West are being threatened by fires that are \ngrowing bigger and hotter and more damaging each year.\n  Chairman Enzi's budget took several steps in the right direction to \nimprove the way governments budget for fires, but with a growing \nthreat, more resources are needed to fight and prevent fires. Having \njust visited Medford, OR, they told me it was going to be the driest in \n25 years, and we take out a map and California just looks dry, dry, \ndry. Passing the bipartisan legislation that Senator Crapo and I have \nauthored is urgent.\n  I also feel funding for agricultural research is another vital tool \nfor giving rural communities a chance to get ahead. Each dollar that \ngoes into agricultural research will be far outstripped by the value \ncreated in crops and croplands.\n  I was told just recently by wheat farmers in Eastern Oregon that \ninvesting in agricultural research is going to\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\ngive them and people all through Eastern Oregon a better chance to get \nahead and be more successful with their farms.\n  I want to make mention of the important low-income and middle-class \ntax challenge. We ought to make the tax cuts for middle-class and low-\nincome Americans permanent. There is a very big tax looming in 2018, \nunless the Congress moves to prevent it. Millions of families in Oregon \nand across the Nation depend on the expansion of the earned-income tax \ncredit, the child tax credit, and the American opportunity tax credit. \nThese are all set to expire, and the longer families sit in the dark \nwondering what their tax obligations will be, the harder it is for \nthese families--already struggling to get ahead--for them to predict \nhow to budget. In my view, it would be legislative malpractice to leave \nthese low-income and middle-class tax cuts teetering on a cliff while \nothers are permanently enshrined into the law. Furthermore, taking that \nuncertainty off the table is going to make comprehensive tax reform \neasier to accomplish.\n  My colleagues and I on the Finance Committee are working hard to \nbring our broken Tax Code into the 21st century. I have worked for more \nthan a decade, first with our former colleague Senator Gregg and most \nrecently with our current colleague Senator Coats, to produce the first \nbipartisan Federal income tax reform plan in more than a quarter \ncentury. So I know it is possible to make the Tax Code simpler and \nfairer. It ought to give everybody the chance to climb the economic \nladder, and making the critical low-income and middle-class tax cuts \npermanent is a big step in that direction.\n  Next, I think the question of college affordability and doing more to \nhelp students get to graduation day ought to be a focus of this budget. \nThe skyrocketing price of tuition keeps far too many young people from \nenrolling in college, and it keeps too many others from completing it. \nIn effect, the price of college can reinforce inequality. Millions of \nstudents are buried up to their eyeballs in debt before they ever put \non that cap and gown.\n  It is time to come at this challenge from every angle. For one, it is \nimportant to make student debt more manageable so graduates don't spend \ndecades weighed down by loan payments. It is absolutely essential to \nhelp students take on less debt from the start. That will get more \nstudents in the door to challenge and free graduates from a lifetime of \ndebt. That is why, in my view, cutting the Pell grant is the wrong way \nto go, and the Byzantine web of tax incentives for higher education \nneeds to be cleaned up as well. It should not take dozens of \ncalculations and hours of time for students to navigate the Byzantine \ntax rules. It should be simpler and easier so more students see a more \nmeaningful benefit. Some student loan debt may be unavoidable, but \nleaving students with less debt is possible.\n  My next concern with respect to the budget is making sure needless \ncuts are made in essential health care programs. The cuts to Medicaid, \nin my view, that have been proposed by the other side are a guaranteed \nformula to make life harder for struggling families.\n  Just contemplate--and having been to Iowa, I know of the many seniors \nin Iowa--seniors who rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of nursing home \ncare. That is, to a great extent, what the Medicaid budget is all \nabout. Medicaid for those frail seniors--whether it is Oregon or \nVermont or Iowa, Medicaid is what keeps a lot of those frail seniors \nfrom falling into absolute destitution. In another era, impoverished \nseniors might have been thrown into almshouses or poor farms. Today, \nMedicaid is a lifeline for tens of millions. But the budget proposal we \nhave seen from the other side, in my view, would inflict substantial \ncuts on Medicaid, endanger our future. I don't believe that is the \nright course for frail seniors who rely on Medicaid for nursing home \ncare.\n  The last point I would make deals with the effects of repealing the \nAffordable Care Act. If we repeal the Affordable Care Act, make no \nmistake about it, America goes back to the days when health care is for \nthe healthy and the wealthy because no longer will we have protections \nfor people with preexisting conditions. It is fine if you are healthy \nand it is fine if you are wealthy, but that is not most Americans. \nThere are plenty of ways to improve the Affordable Care Act in a \nbipartisan fashion. That is not what the budget from the other side \ndoes. I hope we will not go back to the days in America when health \ncare is for the healthy and wealthy, which is the bottom-line \nconsequence of full repeal.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 323, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, first I wish to thank Senator Wyden for \nhis remarks. I concur with what he said, and I thank him for \ncosponsoring the amendment on infrastructure that we will be voting on \nin a few minutes.\n  Senator Wyden and I understand that you cannot be a great nation if \nyour roads and bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, airports, \nlevees, dams, and railroad system are crumbling. That is not what a \ngreat nation is about.\n  Years ago, the United States used to be the envy of the world in \nterms of infrastructure. Countries all over the world looked to the \nUnited States and asked: How do you do it? How do you provide clean \nwater to your people? How do you have such an efficient transportation \nsystem? How do you have such great roads?\n  That is no longer the case. Today we are in 12th place, and I don't \nthink any of my Republican colleagues would deny that. In fact, our \ninfrastructure is crumbling. We have to address this issue. We cannot \nkick the can down the road. We can't say: Well, let's wait a few years \nuntil we come up with some magic funding formula.\n  We have to do it, and we have to do it now. The reason we have to do \nit now is that every year we delay, the problem only becomes worse. We \nare spending billions of dollars just to maintain the status quo, \npatching up a deteriorating system--whether it is transit, rails, roads \nor bridges. We have to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. There is \nno disagreement, I believe, in the Senate on that.\n  Second of all, I hope there is no disagreement that unemployment in \nthis country is much too high. Real unemployment is at 11 percent, \ncounting those who have given up looking for work and those who are \nworking part-time. Youth unemployment is 17 percent, and African-\nAmerican youth unemployment is higher than that. We need a major jobs \nprogram to put millions of people back to work at decent wages, and \nthat is what rebuilding our infrastructure does.\n  The economists tell us that if we want to create jobs, the fastest \nway to create jobs in America is to rebuild our roads, bridges, and \nrail system. That is the fastest way to do it. Many of my Republican \ncolleagues probably understand that as well. Where we disagree is how \nwe fund the front.\n  Some on the Republican side will say: Well, we are looking at tax \nreform, and we are looking at this and looking at that, and maybe it \nwill happen, but maybe it will not happen. We certainly have not had a \nlot of luck on these issues in recent years. Our Republican friends are \nnot particularly interested in investments in America. Their idea of \ndealing with the deficit is to cut, cut, cut.\n  What we are proposing here is a $478 billion infrastructure package \nfor 6 years, and it is funded by something I hope all of us can agree \nis unacceptable, and that is that at a time when corporate profits are \nat an all-time high, many corporations are stashing their profits in \nthe Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Luxembourg, tax havens around the world. \nGuess what they are paying in American income tax to the United States \nGovernment. Zero.\n  We eliminate those loopholes. We raise substantial sums of money. We \nput that money into rebuilding our infrastructure, creating jobs, and \nmaking our country more efficient, safer, and more productive. That is \nwhat happens when you have a strong infrastructure.\n  I ask that Americans try to imagine what America will look like when \nwe have some 9 million workers. This proposal would create some 9 \nmillion good-paying jobs in all of our States. People would be working \nto improve our roads and our water systems, and we can try to begin to \ncompete effectively with the rail systems of other countries throughout \nthe world. Think of what America will look like when we\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\nbecome and develop a first-rate infrastructure, not a third-rate \ninfrastructure. I know people think this is a lot of money, but it is \nnowhere near what the American Society of Civil Engineers is telling us \nthat we need.\n  If you are interested in creating a 21st century infrastructure, \nplease vote for my amendment. If you are interested in creating and \nmaintaining some 9 million jobs over a 6-year period, please vote for \nmy amendment. If you are interested in ending an outrageous corporate \nloophole, which in some cases enables large, profitable multinational \ncorporations to pay zero in Federal income tax, please vote for this \namendment. It will send a powerful message that now is the time to \nrebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put our people to work and end \nabsurd loopholes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will be very brief. My colleague has \nexpressed his thoughts on this issue well, and we have had a number of \ndiscussions on infrastructure with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  I come back to the fact that all Americans have a stake in this \namendment--whether you are a commuter, whether you are an exporter, \nwhether you are someone who lives in rural Wyoming or rural Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats' time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will be very brief. I thank my \ncolleagues for their courtesy.\n  This amendment is about more than bumpy roads, popped tires, and \nbroken axles. It is about jobs and economic growth in every nook and \ncranny in our country, and the key to that growth is infrastructure. \nAttracting investment depends on the condition of our infrastructure. \nSuffice it to say that our competitors in a tough global marketplace \nare increasing their investments in infrastructure. It is time to adopt \nthis amendment and for us to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I get a little upset when I hear one side \nsay that the other side doesn't care about infrastructure. That is not \ntrue. We even had a colloquy just a little while ago where the two \nsides said we need infrastructure. I agree that we need infrastructure, \nbut I will oppose this amendment because it is telling the tax \ncommittee exactly what to do to provide infrastructure. One committee \nis getting into another committee's jurisdiction to say exactly how to \ndo it, and that is not right. That is not the way we handle legislation \naround here.\n  Senator Wyden is on the tax committee. He is the ranking member on \nthat committee. Senator Hatch is the chairman of that committee. They \nare both concerned about infrastructure. There is already a provision \nin the bill that allows for the money to be put into place to do it, \nbut that provision does not tell the Finance Committee that it must \nplug a certain tax loophole and put it into infrastructure. The \ncommittee can do that, and the President's budget--one of the reasons \nthere is some excitement here--on money that is held overseas by \ncompanies, puts a mandatory 14 percent tax on that and expects it to be \nbrought back right away to fund these things. That is a proposal that \nhas been in the tax committee before--but not at 14 percent. It has \nbeen at a lower rate. Fourteen percent is more money than both the \nhighway committee and the defense committee are talking about. We \ncannot produce a budget in which we tell committees exactly how to do \ntheir work. We need to build in the flexibility so they can do their \njob.\n  The chairman of the committee is convinced that we can do the job of \nfixing our infrastructure. Of course, we will never fix the \ninfrastructure as well as we would like to have it fixed. I think the \nranking member on the Budget Committee mentioned that we have four \ntimes as much need as what his proposal addresses. He has a proposal \nfor $468 billion. There is a couple trillion dollars' worth of need out \nthere. Of course, we hope we can get a lot of people involved in fixing \nthese problems. It is not just a Federal problem. It is a local and \nState problem as well. We hope everybody will participate so that we \ncan improve the infrastructure. It does put people to work, just as \nKeystone would put people to work.\n  I ask that my colleagues vote against the bill because we are telling \none committee exactly where to get the money for another committee.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Madam President, I yield the balance of our time for the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, in a few minutes we will be voting, and \nwhile I sincerely appreciate the effort of my good friend Senator \nSanders, I will be opposing this approach mostly because I don't think \nwe need to go through what I consider to be a massive tax increase in \norder to do this. But just for a moment, I wish to talk about the \nseriousness of the transportation reauthorization bill. I know this \nissue has been talked about during the budget conversation and debate, \nbut I think sometimes we ought to drag up that old document that hardly \nanyone pays attention to anymore--the Constitution.\n  The Constitution specifically says in article I, section 8 that there \nare some things we are supposed to be doing here. The two major things \nthat are mentioned in the article I, section 8 are, No. 1, defending \nAmerica--that is our military--and the other is roads and bridges.\n  I think we are concentrating and working very hard. A minute ago I \nhad a colloquy with my friend from California, Senator Boxer. Senator \nBoxer observed that she is a proud liberal and recognized me as a proud \nconservative. Yet here is something we agree on, something we can do, \nsomething that is very important and that we need to take care of.\n  Now, I won't say anything about the defense problem. We have a \nserious problem in our defense system right now, but that is not the \ndiscussion for today. I do believe that while we have an amendment that \nwould address a highway reauthorization bill--and how critical that \nis--we are working on that.\n  I have to remind people that there is a reserve fund in Chairman \nEnzi's budget that serves as a placeholder for Chairman Hatch to \naddress a long-term highway bill later this year.\n  The last bill we had was a 27-month bill. Again, that was to setup \nthis idea of having a long-term bill. The last good bill we had was in \n2005, and that was a 5-year bill. It was really produced very well. The \nproblem with extensions--and I think we all know this--is that \nextensions take about 30 percent off the top because short-term \nextensions--and anyone who has been in business knows this--are things \nyou cannot do in the short term. You cannot get the streamlining. Our \n27-month bill had a lot of really good streamlining provisions in \nthere. You cannot do that on short-term extensions.\n  I look forward to having a very large bill. We have a deadline at the \nend of May to make this a reality, and I believe we are going to be \nable to do that. We are meeting on a regular basis, including a meeting \ntoday with Senator Hatch. We will be coming up with ways that we can \npay for this.\n  Again, I can remember in the very beginning we used to have a problem \nin the highway trust fund because we had too much surplus. Well, it is \nnot that way anymore. We all know how we got in the mess we are in \nright now. We will have to address that, and I look forward to doing \nthat and providing some of the leadership, right along with Senator \nBoxer and Senator Sanders, in making this a reality.\n  With that, noting that 12 noon is here, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Inhofe for his \nremarks on infrastructure. I hope we can all work together for what I \nwould suspect every Member here sees as a serious problem.\n  But this amendment says let's not kick the can down the road. Our \ninfrastructure is crumbling. We used to be the envy of the world; today \nwe are in 12th place. This impacts not just people who are driving \ncars, it impacts every business in America. We need now to start the \nprocess of rebuilding our roads and bridges and dams and levees and \nairports. When we do that, this amendment, over a 6-year period, can \ncreate and maintain 9 million jobs--9 million jobs--at a time when we \nneed decent-paying jobs.\n  I understand the difference of opinion stems from how we get the \nfunding for this. Our approach is pretty simple. It eliminates an \noutrageous loophole that allows large, profitable corporations to stash \ntheir money around the world and, in some cases, pay zero in Federal \nincome taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask for support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 1 minute in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as I said a few minutes ago, I agree with \nSenator Sanders, the author of this amendment, in terms of what is the \nproblem we have. We have to have a transportation reauthorization bill \nand we are going to have it.\n  I know Senator Sanders has characterized his bill as being paid for \nby closing tax loopholes, but I would still say that, in my opinion and \nmy analysis of this, this would equate to nearly a half a trillion \ndollar tax increase, and this is not the way I want to have a \ntransportation reauthorization bill.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that there is a reserve fund in Chairman \nEnzi's budget that serves as a placeholder for Chairman Hatch to \naddress a long-term highway bill later this year. We have a deadline of \nMay 31, and I think we can meet that deadline. We are working with \nSenator Hatch right now to come up with that plan.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the Sanders amendment and \npursue our bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nfollowing the first vote in the series be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 323, as modified, offered by the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Texas (Mr. Cruz) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nManchin) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis).

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 386, offered by \nthe Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Senator Portman's amendment touches on a \nvery serious issue that I believe has broad bipartisan support, the \nneed to deal with children who have serious, chronic conditions. In \nfact, over 3 million kids in this country have medically complex health \nconditions.\n  Senator Portman appropriately is calling attention to that issue. I \nsupport him. But when you look at the overall Republican budget, it \nthrows 16 million people off of health insurance by ending the \nAffordable Care Act and millions more through a $400 billion cut in \nMedicaid. What happens to a pregnant woman on Medicaid who needs \nprenatal care? No health insurance for her. What about a kid who was in \nan automobile accident whose family has no health insurance and is \nthrown off of Medicaid? No health insurance for that kid. What about an \nelderly person in a nursing home? There are millions of elderly people \non Medicaid in nursing homes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Please support this amendment. No cuts to Medicaid for \nall our kids.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments and support for \nthe Portman amendment. I want you to know I support the Sanders \namendment. We support pregnant women and kids who are hurt in car \naccidents or face other unfortunate circumstances.\n  So we would be happy to take this by voice vote.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I think it would be better to do a rollcall vote. We \nappreciate your support.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 349, offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It is a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to help the most vulnerable kids among us \nto have better coordinated care under Medicaid.\n  It allows health care providers to deliver health care services to \nmedically complex kids through models that coordinate care between \nproviders, resulting in better care but also lower costs, including \nhelping with regard to a problem, including across State lines.\n  These children with complex medical conditions make up about 6 \npercent of the children who get health care under Medicaid, but it is \nabout 40 percent of the cost of pediatric care under Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  This is an opportunity for us on a bipartisan basis, I know, to be \nable to help these kids to get the necessary care they need and \nactually allow the Medicaid system to realize some savings through \nefficiencies, such as reduced emergency room stays, hospitalizations, \nand other procedures.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Bennet, who will speak in a second on \nhis cosponsorship.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this commonsense measure to help \nthese vulnerable kids.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I also rise to speak in favor of the \nPortman amendment. This amendment is based on a bill I introduced \nearlier this year called the ACE Kids Act that recognizes the critical \nimportance of Medicaid to children with severe medical conditions. It \nhighlights the need for greater coordination and integration of care \nacross the country for 2 million children.\n  Earlier this month, I met with Everett Ediger at Children's Hospital \nof Colorado in Denver. Everett is 8 years old and has spina bifida, a \nneurological disorder of the spine. It took his mom Maureen 2 years to \nget him signed up under Medicaid and to establish a system to \ncoordinate all of his care.\n  While Everett was beating me at air hockey, he let his mom explain to \nme about the frustrating experience of trying to coordinate all of her \nson's specialists and the payments for his care.\n  We need to focus on children such as Everett all across this country.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Portman for his leadership in offering \nthis amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Portman amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mr. \n     Wyden, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered 362.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \namending the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to allow for punitive damages, limit \n the any factor ``other than sex'' exception, and prohibit retaliation \n            against employees who share salary information)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO EQUAL PAY \n                   FOR EQUAL WORK.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to efforts to ensure equal pay policies and \n     practices and to reform section 6(d) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)) (commonly known as \n     the ``Equal Pay Act of 1963'') to allow for punitive damages, \n     limit the exception for unequal pay described in paragraph \n     (1) of such section to business necessity rather than any \n     factor ``other than sex'', and prevent retaliation against \n     employees for sharing salary information by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not increase the deficit over \n     either the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2020 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2025.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, my amendment is about paycheck \nfairness, a topic I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nNebraska, is absolutely familiar with. I come to the floor to finish \nthe job we began with Lilly Ledbetter to end pay discrimination in the \nworkplace once and for all. That is why I am offering this amendment, \nwhich is based on the bill I have offered in the past three Congresses. \nIt is called the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  My Senate colleagues and I want to be sure women get a raise. The way \nwe want to do that is to put more money in the family checkbook by \nputting change in the Federal law book.\n  My amendment will do three things.\n  No. 1, it will stop retaliation in the workplace for sharing pay \ninformation. For years, the famous Lilly Ledbetter was harassed and \nhumiliated just for asking questions about her coworkers' salaries. In \nmany workplaces around the country, you are forbidden to discuss shared \npay information even if\n\n[[Page S1752]]\n\nyou are the same lab technician, computer operator or others. This \nwould stop retaliation simply for asking not only what do you make but \nwhat do others make doing the same work.\n  It also stops employers from using any reason to pay women less. \n``Oh, they are breadwinners.'' ``Oh, he is a family man.'' ``Oh, gee, \nthey do a harder job,'' when it is the same job. We have to make sure \nit is equal pay for equal work.\n  This bill also allows punitive damages for women who have been \ndiscriminated against. When the only deterrent against pay \ndiscrimination is the threat of paying women backpay, discrimination \ncan just be factored into the cost of doing business and treating it \nlike loose change.\n  Now, people say to me: Hey, Senator Barb. You led the fight on Lilly \nLedbetter to make sure we had equal pay for equal work. Didn't we solve \nthat problem?\n  Well, we made a good first step. That bill kept the courthouse doors \nopen for women who are discriminated against so there would not be a \nstatute of limitations as defined by the original Supreme Court \ndecision, but that was only a downpayment. What this amendment does is \nsay we need to change the law so Lilly would not have had to sue in the \nfirst place. This amendment says: Put an end to the incentives that \ncause employers to think paying women less is just loose change.\n  This amendment would close loopholes in the law which allow pay \ndiscrimination to occur in the first place. It would also put an end to \npaycheck secrecy--yes, paycheck secrecy--that makes it harder to \nuncover discrimination. It would also prohibit retaliation against \nwomen for even talking about pay differences. These are loopholes that \noften stop women who have endured discrimination from being fairly \ncompensated.\n  What are the facts? Women still earn 77 cents for every $1 a man \nmakes. It is even worse for women of color. African-American women earn \n64 cents for every $1 a man makes, Hispanic women earn 54 cents for \nevery $1 a man makes. For women closer to the age of retirement, the \nwage gap increases to more than $14,000 a year. It not only affects \ntheir pay, but it affects their retirement, and it affects their Social \nSecurity.\n  When you earn less, you get less in your Social Security benefits \nbecause you are making smaller contributions to your retirement. \nWomen's Social Security benefits are about 71 percent of men's \nbenefits, and that is not because of the mommy factor, where women have \ntaken time out of the workplace and the marketplace to be in the home \nwith their children.\n  Women earn 23 cents less for every $1 a man earns, even when she does \nthe same job and has the same education. Women do not get a 23-percent \ndiscount on their student loans. They do not get a 23-percent discount \non their utility bill. They do not get a 23-percent discount on their \nmortgage. So we end up paying the bill just for our ability to work.\n  Madam President, I could go on and tell you compelling stories about \nmy constituents who have shared them with me.\n  I have heard from Latoya Weaver. She lives in Great Mills, MD. She is \na single parent to three children. She worked in guest services at a \nhotel. She found out that her pay of $8 an hour--$8 an hour--was $2 \nless than new males in the same position. So a new guy working in the \nsame job, doing the same thing made $2 more. That makes a big \ndifference when you are making $8 an hour rather than $10 an hour. She \nfiled an EEOC lawsuit, and she prevailed. You cannot necessarily go to \nthe EEOC in every case.\n  I heard from Donna Smith, who lives on Maryland's Eastern Shore. She \nworked as a retail clerk. She was also told not to discuss her wages, \nbut she found out she was being paid less than a male clerk--not \n``mail'' as in post office mail but ``male'' as in a guy--a guy clerk \nwhom she actually trained and was doing the same exact job she did when \nshe started. Again, in all of the effort to go to the EEOC, it was \nfound that two other female workers were also discriminated against. No \none would have known had Donna not sought out that information.\n  So we can see that paycheck fairness is absolutely needed.\n  There is a lot of mythology out there about the Paycheck Fairness \nAct.\n  Myth No. 1, that the bill would require employers to cut the salaries \nof their male employees. The Equal Pay Act currently on the books \nprohibits employers from lowering the wages of men to make up for \ndiscrimination against women.\n  Another myth, that the bill is unnecessary. Well, the facts speak for \nthemselves. When American women who work full time year round are paid \nonly 77 cents for every $1 made by their male counterparts, it speaks \nfor itself.\n  The wage gap is not merely a matter of choice in their occupation; \nthey are paid less in the same occupation with the same education.\n  Here is another myth, that the bill would subject employers to \ncriminal penalties for refusing to disclose wage information. No part \nof this bill provides for criminal penalties for employers for any \nconduct. There is no criminal penalty in this bill.\n  Another myth is that the bill would require the government to set \nsalaries for Federal employees. Again, nothing in the Paycheck Fairness \nAct allows the Federal Government to set salaries for a public or \nprivate employer. So I think that speaks for itself.\n  Madam President, I have a factual document from the National Women's \nLaw Center. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the National Women's Law Center, May 2015]\n\n             What the Paycheck Fairness Act Would Really Do\n\n       For nearly 50 years, the Equal Pay Act has made it illegal \n     for employers to pay unequal wages to men and women who \n     perform substantially equal work. Although enforcement of the \n     Equal Pay Act as well as other civil rights laws has helped \n     to narrow the wage gap, significant disparities remain and \n     need to be addressed. Women today still make only 77 cents \n     for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. And for \n     women of color, the gap is even larger.\n       The Paycheck Fairness Act would strengthen current laws \n     against wage discrimination by protecting employees who \n     voluntarily share pay information with colleagues from \n     retaliation, fully compensating victims of sex-based pay \n     discrimination, empowering women and girls by strengthening \n     their negotiation skills, and holding employers more \n     accountable under the Equal Pay Act. Opponents of the \n     Paycheck Fairness Act have put forth rhetoric about the bill \n     that is misleading--this document contrasts the various myths \n     about the bill and explains what the Paycheck Fairness Act \n     would accomplish in reality.\n       Myth: The bill would require employers to cut the salaries \n     of their male employees.\n       Fact: The Equal Pay Act prohibits employers from lowering \n     the wages of men to make up for discrimination against women. \n     In fact, the first paragraph of the Act states: An ``employer \n     who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this \n     subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions \n     of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.'' \n     The bill does nothing to disturb this longstanding rule.\n       Myth: The bill is unnecessary because there is no wage gap.\n       Fact: American women who work full time, year round are \n     paid only 77 cents for every dollar paid to their male \n     counterparts. This gap in earnings translates into $10,784 \n     less per year in median earnings, leaving women and their \n     families shortchanged. The wage gap is even more substantial \n     when race and gender are considered together, with African-\n     American women making only 62 cents, and Hispanic women only \n     54 cents, for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men.\n       The wage gap is not merely a matter of choice in \n     occupation--women typically are paid less than men in the \n     same occupation. This is the case whether that occupation \n     pays high or low wages, whether they work in traditionally \n     male occupations, traditionally female occupations, or \n     occupations with an even mix of men and women.\n       Numerous studies show that even when all relevant career \n     and family attributes are taken into account, there is still \n     a significant, unexplained gap in men's and women's earnings. \n     Thus, even when women make the same career choices as men and \n     work the same hours, they earn less. For example, a study of \n     college graduates one year after graduation determined that \n     women earned only 95 percent of what men earned, even after \n     accounting for variables such as ``job and workplace, \n     employment experience and continuity, education and training, \n     and demographic and personal characteristics.''\n       Myth: The bill would subject employers to criminal \n     penalties for refusing to disclose wage information.\n       Fact: No part of the bill provides for criminal penalties \n     for employers for any conduct. But pay disparities often go \n     unnoticed because employers forbid employees from sharing \n     wage information with each other. The bill enhances \n     employees' ability to learn\n\n[[Page S1753]]\n\n     about wage discrimination by merely banning retaliation \n     against workers who inquire about their employers' wage \n     practices or disclose their own wages. It does not ban pay \n     secrecy policies altogether--in fact, employers with access \n     to colleagues' wage information in the course of their work, \n     such as human resources employees, may still be prohibited \n     from sharing that information.\n       Myth: The bill requires the government to set salaries for \n     federal employers.\n       Fact: Nothing in the Paycheck Fairness Act allows the \n     federal government to set salaries for any private employer. \n     But the tools for detecting and addressing pay disparities \n     under the Equal Pay Act have been limited by courts over \n     time. For example, courts have opened loopholes in the \n     defenses that employers are permitted to raise when seeking \n     to justify a decision to not pay workers equal wages for \n     doing substantially equal work. Some courts have said that an \n     employer may justify paying unequal wages even if there is no \n     business reason for paying men and women unequal salaries. \n     The bill also would require the Department of Labor to \n     reinstate a survey instrument that will help the Department \n     detect and remedy wage discrimination by federal contractors \n     and would serve as a critical tool in the federal \n     government's effort to enforce civil rights laws.\n       Myth: There is no need for the bill after the Lilly \n     Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n       Fact: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act restored the \n     protection against pay discrimination stripped away by the \n     Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear. But, even \n     after the Act, our existing equal pay laws remain weakened by \n     a series of other court decisions and insufficient federal \n     tools to detect and combat wage discrimination. The Act made \n     clear that each discriminatory paycheck, not just an \n     employer's original decision to engage in pay discrimination, \n     resets the period of time during which a worker may file a \n     pay discrimination claim. The steps taken in the Ledbetter \n     Act are essential, as they enable workers to bring wage \n     discrimination cases again. But the Ledbetter Act simply \n     returned the law to what it was prior to the Court's \n     decision. And wage disparities go undetected because \n     employers maintain policies that punish employees who \n     voluntarily share salary information with their coworkers. \n     The Paycheck Fairness Act would update the Equal Pay Act by \n     closing loopholes in the law and ensuring that workers will \n     no longer be punished simply for talking about their own \n     wages.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So here we are, in 2015. It has been almost 50 years \nsince the first equal pay bill was passed. For 50 years we have tried \nto have financial catchup to get equal pay for equal work, and every \ntime we make a reform, there are always other loopholes. We want to \nclose the loopholes. We want to end discrimination. We want to end \nretaliation. And, most of all, we want to end the fact that women often \nend up for their whole lifetime earning less. It affects the way they \nraise their families. It affects the way they pay into their pensions, \nthe way they pay into their Social Security. Now we need to pay our \nrespects to them and pass the paycheck fairness bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Mikulski for \noffering this really important amendment because I believe that real, \nlong-term economic growth is built from the middle out, not from the \ntop down. Our government and our economy should be working for all \nfamilies, not just the wealthiest few.\n  We in Congress need to be focused on raising wages and expanding \neconomic security and making sure our workers have the opportunity to \nwork hard and succeed. That is exactly what the amendment the Senator \nfrom Maryland has offered will do.\n  It would build on the promise of the Equal Pay Act to help close the \npay gap between men and women. Today, nearly half of our workforce is \nnot earning equal pay for equal work. In fact, women across the \ncountry, as we know, get paid just 78 cents for every $1 a man makes \nfor the same work. That is not just unfair to women, it hurts our \nfamilies and it hurts our economy and we need to fix it.\n  Last year, at a hearing in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, we heard from a woman named Kerri. For 5 years, Kerri worked \nfor an auto supplier as a supervisor. She liked her job. She did it \nwell. Her boss gave her glowing performance reviews for her work. But \nwhen that auto industry ran into trouble, her company had to file for \nbankruptcy, and it was through those bankruptcy court reports that \nKerri found out she was making significantly less than the men she \nsupervised.\n  After all those years of hard work, she found out her employer valued \nher work less just because she was a woman. She said she was \nheartbroken and embarrassed, but more than that, she told our committee \nlast year that those years of lost wages affected her family for the \nrest of her life. And she is not alone.\n  Across the country, pay discrimination hurts women and families' \nability to make ends meet and get ahead in the workplace.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland for her extraordinary leadership in \nthe fight for equal pay and for bringing this important amendment \nforward today. This amendment will help move us toward an economy where \nwomen get a fair shot at pay equity in the workplace and set us up to \ntackle pay discrimination head-on.\n  Pay discrimination, by the way, is not just unfair to women, it is \nbad for our families, and it is a real and persistent problem that \nhurts our economy.\n  It is important to remember that women's roles in our economy has \nshifted dramatically in the last few decades. Women now make up nearly \nhalf of our workforce. Today, 60 percent of families rely on earnings \nfrom both parents--up from 37 percent in 1975. More than ever, today \nwomen are likely to be the primary breadwinners in their family.\n  So we have to make sure working women can succeed in today's economy \nbecause their success is critical to families' economic security and to \nour Nation's economy as a whole.\n  According to a recent report, closing the pay gap between men and \nwomen would add $446 billion to our economy. I hope we can all agree \nthat in the 21st century workers should be paid fairly for the work \nthey do regardless of their gender, and I hope we can agree we need to \nexpand economic security for more families. That should be our mission \nto move our country forward.\n  This amendment supports the basic principle of fairness in the \nworkplace. It would help women, families, and our Nation's economy.\n  I want to make this clear: I am urging my colleagues to vote for the \nMikulski amendment--the only proposal on the table right now that would \nmove us toward a real solution to this problem.\n  Senator Mikulski has been our leader on this issue. I hope \nRepublicans will join Democrats on real solutions and work with us to \ncreate jobs, increase wages, and expand economic security that benefits \nall workers and families, not just the wealthiest few.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is an important moment in the \nSenate each year because we try to define what our values are and the \nway we spend our money.\n  If you want to know a family's values, take a look at the family \nbudget. Are they putting some money away for their young son or \ndaughter to go to college, making sure they can own a home, paying \ntheir bills on a regular basis, or are they wasting money on things \nthey can't afford? The budget tells a story about values.\n  This budget presented by the Republicans tells another story. It \ntells a story about America's future.\n  I have a friend back in Springfield, IL. He has been a friend for \nyears and years. Ten years ago, his wife was diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's. His life changed dramatically. He could no longer go to \nwork on a regular basis. He devoted every waking minute to his wife. \nShe is still alive today and struggling, but that family was different. \nTheir lives were different. Across America, families just like his \nfamily learn about the diagnosis of Alzheimer's every day. Do you know \nhow often we diagnose an American with Alzheimer's? Once every 68 \nseconds. The millions who are now afflicted by that disease--many of \nthem have a very tough future ahead of them, as do their families.\n  What does that have to do with this political debate? It has a lot to \ndo with it. It has to do with some basic things. First, should we \ncontinue to cut the money for medical research in America? The \nRepublican budget says: Yes. We can't afford medical research.\n  Really? Well, last year, we spent $200 billion in Medicare and \nMedicaid on Alzheimer's victims alone--$200 billion.\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\nWhen we asked for $3 or $4 billion more for medical research in the \nhopes we can find a way to delay the onset of Alzheimer's or, God \nwilling, even find a cure for it--we will more than pay back the money \nwe invest in research. But the Republican budget says that is something \nwe cannot afford in America today.\n  When it comes to those who are suffering from Alzheimer's, how do \nthey get by? Many of them get by with Medicare, which, of course, is \nthe insurance policy for the elderly and disabled. But this budget cuts \nMedicare. Many low-income victims of that disease and many others rely \non Medicaid, but this budget makes dramatic cuts in Medicaid.\n  That is the vision the Republicans present to us in their budget--the \nvision of an America that cannot afford to do the research to find \ncures for diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes, and the list \ngoes on. They see an America where we cannot afford to help people who \nare struggling to get by.\n  This budget proposes takes 26 million Americans off of health \ninsurance. I will repeat that--26 million Americans off of health \ninsurance. Is that the answer to America's future? Have you ever been \nthe father of a sick child and not had health insurance? I have. I will \nnever forget it as long as I live. I felt helpless and worried that my \nlittle daughter was not going to get the right care she needed. Thank \nGod the day came when I was covered with health insurance and could get \nher the best. But I think about the millions of Americans who never saw \nthat day and the fact that 26 million Americans would lose health \ninsurance because of the Republican budget. We are a better nation than \nthat. We should prepare for a better future than one where the have-\nnots are growing in number.\n  The sad reality is that the Republican budget, although it finally \nanswers its political prayer and eliminates the Affordable Care Act, \nstill collects all of the revenue from the Affordable Care Act. They \nwill never be able to explain that one to us.\n  How will they explain to the millions of seniors who are under \nMedicare that they are eliminating the program that reduces the cost of \nprescription drugs? These are seniors on fixed incomes who are trying \nto stay healthy and independent at home and who depend on drugs that \ncould be pretty expensive. The Republican budget eliminates that \nprovision in the Affordable Care Act which helps those seniors pay for \ntheir prescription drugs--the so-called doughnut hole.\n  As I go through the lengthy list of what the Republicans have done in \ntheir budget, I have to ask, is this their vision of America--fewer \npeople having health insurance, fewer seniors being able to afford the \nprescription drugs they need to get by, cutting Medicaid, where we \nprovide prenatal care for moms so the babies are healthy? For goodness' \nsake, it is not only the right thing to do, it is the economic thing to \ndo. A sick baby is a tough challenge for any family, but it is a \nchallenge for all of us. The medical bills a premature baby might incur \nfar exceeds the cost of good prenatal care so the mom and baby are \nhealthy. But that is just another area of cutbacks when it comes to \nthis Republican budget.\n  This budget is certainly not going to become the law of the land. I \nbelieve even some Republicans will have a struggle trying to vote for \nit or explain it.\n  More, importantly, though, I hope this budget is a chance for us to \nhave a conversation about what middle-income America is going to look \nlike in the future. I think that is the key to America's success.\n  We talk a lot about income inequality. To put it in a few words, it \nmeans that a lot of families are working hard every single darn day and \nthey cannot make ends meet. They are living paycheck to paycheck. What \nare we doing for them? This Republican budget cuts the available \ncollege assistance for their kids to go to school. That doesn't help \nthat middle-income family. This Republican budget doesn't invest in \nAmerica when it comes to education. This Republican budget cuts back on \nthe help to schools to make sure they are producing graduates with the \nskills to compete in the 21st century.\n  If we really want to focus on helping middle-income families, we \ncannot vote for this Republican budget. It is a set of priorities for \nthem which America really cannot accept.\n  As Senator Sanders has said--our ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee--we need to work to give middle-income families in this \ncountry a fighting chance. This bill does not do that. Sadly, this bill \nmakes too many cuts in too many critical areas.\n  I am going to offer an amendment to this bill. See if you like this \nidea. I think it is a good one. My colleagues will get to vote on it. \nHere is what it says. We have a tax code full of provisions to \nencourage businesses to do certain things. We give them deductions, \ncredits, incentives to do things, such as drilling for oil, building \nwind turbines, so many things--some good, some bad; it depends on your \npoint of view.\n  I suggest that we put a provision in our Tax Code that says we will \nprovide a tax credit to companies that stay in the United States and \ndon't bail out and head to a foreign country, companies that invest in \nAmerican jobs by maintaining or increasing the number of workers in the \nUnited States compared to the number of workers overseas.\n  Secondly, those companies will get a tax credit if their corporation \npays fair wages by paying most employees a wage so that a family of \nthree doesn't have to depend on the government for a safety net \nprogram. That is about $15 an hour.\n  If a company keeps jobs in the United States and pays about $15 an \nhour as a minimum, we will give them a tax credit.\n  Those companies should also provide quality health insurance for \ntheir employees. Who would disagree with that one? They should also \nprepare their workers for retirement by providing a pension or 401(k) \nwith fair employer contributions.\n  The last point is that those companies should support our veterans, \nour troops, and people with disabilities by giving them a chance to \nwork there.\n  How about those companies? From where I am sitting, those are \npatriotic American companies that deserve a break in the Tax Code as \nmuch, if not more, than any other company.\n  I will bring that amendment to the floor and let my colleagues vote \non it. I hope we can get a bipartisan consensus. We ought to create \nincentives for companies to stay in the United States, employ \nAmericans, pay a good wage, provide health insurance and pensions, and \ngive a break to veterans and people with disabilities who are applying \nfor jobs.\n  Let's have some priorities that reflect the future of a growing, \nsolid America--an America with a growing middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 362\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise in very strong support of \nSenator Mikulski's amendment on equal pay for equal work for the women \nof our country. Senator Mikulski has been a tireless advocate for \npolicies that bolster the American middle class and has been a champion \nfor many years for pay equity for women, and I thank the Senator from \nMaryland for all she has done. I also concur with the strong remarks \nmade by Senator Murray, who has also been a champion for pay equity.\n  To my mind, it is very hard to defend the current reality in which \nwomen continue to earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men. We want \nto end that discrimination against women workers. This is not only an \nissue of justice, it is also an issue of economics because when we \nestablish pay equity in this country--equal pay for equal work--\nmillions of women will receive higher pay and many of them and their \nfamilies will leave the ranks of the poor. This is an extraordinarily \nimportant amendment for justice, and it is an important amendment for \neconomic rights.\n  The pay gap we see in this country is found at every level of \neducation and at every stage of a career. No matter how hard women \nwork, it is next to impossible to overcome it because they move up the \nranks, but there is still pay inequity.\n  The pay equity gap has a significant bearing on the economic status \nof female-led households. Only 18 percent of families headed by single \nmoms have economic security. Female-headed\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\nhouseholds are twice as likely to live in poverty as male-headed \nhouseholds, and more than half of poor children live in female-headed \nhouseholds. It is no surprise that a lifetime of lower earnings results \nin less retirement savings and fewer Social Security benefits for \nwomen.\n  Senior women are twice as likely as senior men to live in poverty, \nand the average senior woman receives approximately $4,000 less a year \nthan a senior man.\n  Senior women are more likely than senior men to rely on Social \nSecurity as their sole source of income, especially if they are \nunmarried.\n  My State of Vermont has done better than most in terms of pay equity \nand, in fact, is first in the Nation in making sure women get equal pay \nfor equal work. But even in the State of Vermont, which leads the \nNation in this area, women are still only earning 91 cents for every \ndollar men make. We have done better than the rest of the country, and \nwe still have more to do, but the rest of the country has a whole lot \nmore to do if we are going to fulfill the promise of equal pay for \nequal work.\n  I hope very much that we will all be supporting Senator Mikulski's \nvery important amendment.\n  In terms of the overall Republican budget--and I say this with all \ndue respect--one of the reasons I suspect that the media is not \nparticularly interested in this budget is because when they look at it, \nthey find it to be so preposterous, so unbelievable, and so unrealistic \nthat nobody really takes it seriously, and certainly many of the major \nprovisions in it are not going to be turned into law.\n  I will go out on a limb, but I think I am fairly safe in saying that \nPresident Obama is not going to sign legislation that abolishes \nObamaCare. Maybe I am wrong, but I think it is fairly safe to say that. \nThe Republican budget wastes a whole lot of time and energy by \nproposing the repeal of ObamaCare.\n  I will tell everyone what the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would \nmean in this country, and I know people will think I am exaggerating. I \nam not exaggerating, and if I am not telling the truth, I want my \nRepublican friends to come down here--or when they get the floor--and \nsay: Senator Sanders was inaccurate. Please tell me that. We have read \nthe legislation, and I am not inaccurate.\n  If they repeal the Affordable Care Act, it will eliminate health \ninsurance coverage for 16 million people. Sixteen million people would \nlose the health insurance they currently have.\n\n  Today, we are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee \nhealth care to all people. Today, despite the modest gains of the \nAffordable Care Act, 35 million Americans have no health insurance. So \nthe Republicans say, 35 million without health insurance--that is not \nenough. Let's raise that number to 51 million by eliminating the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  They go further than that. The Republicans say we should cut Medicaid \nby $400 billion over the next decade. Medicaid is the program that \nprovides health insurance for lower-income Americans as well as--very \nsignificantly, older people who are in nursing homes. So if people \nthink this is just a low-income issue--if people think it is not a \nmiddle class issue--think again, because it just might be your mom who \nis 90 years of age who is in a nursing home which is being paid by \nMedicaid. It could be your dad who is dealing with Alzheimer's in a \nnursing home being paid for by Medicaid.\n  What the Republicans propose is a $400 billion cut over the next \ndecade which would deny health insurance to an additional 11 million \nAmericans, including millions of children.\n  My arithmetic might not be too good, but I think if we add 16 million \nwho lose health insurance through the ending of the Affordable Care Act \nto 11 million who lose health insurance by a $400 billion cut in \nMedicaid, that means--16 plus 11 is 27--27 million Americans would lose \nhealth insurance, almost doubling the number of people who don't have \nhealth insurance.\n  Does anybody in their right mind take this proposal seriously? It is \nbeyond comprehension. It would cause massive chaos and disruption in \nthe United States of America.\n  This means that low-income, pregnant women who need to make sure--as \nSenator Durbin mentioned a moment ago--that they get the health care \nthey need when they are pregnant would lose their health insurance. A \nkid who is in a car who has an automobile accident would lose his or \nher health insurance. A worker who feels a pain in his chest and needs \nto go to the doctor--he doesn't have any health insurance, doesn't go \nto the doctor, dies. Well, that is a result of cutting 27 million \npeople off of health insurance.\n  So in a certain sense we needn't discuss the issue terribly much \nbecause it is such an absurd proposal that I don't think there are too \nmany people who would take it seriously.\n  We should also understand that when my Republican colleagues talk \nabout ending the Affordable Care Act, what they are also doing is \ndenying over 2 million young adults the right to stay on their parents' \nhealth insurance plan until the age of 26. As a result of the \nAffordable Care Act--previously children would be dropped from their \nparents' health insurance when they reached 21. The Affordable Care Act \nkeeps them covered until they are 26. So suddenly, if one is 24 years \nof age and they have health insurance through their parents' health \nprogram, they are gone, they are out.\n  The Affordable Care Act would bring us back to a very dark age in \nAmerica's medical history. That was the time not so many years ago, \nbefore the ACA, when if a person had a preexisting condition--can we \nimagine that? Now we think it is so crazy. It is hard to believe this \nexisted 7 or 8 years ago. A woman walks into an insurance company \nlooking for health insurance and she says: Yes, I had breast cancer 10 \nyears ago, and I had an operation dealing with breast cancer.\n  The insurance company says: Oh, you had breast cancer? We can't cover \nyou. That might recur.\n  Somebody else walks in and says: Well, I had a heart attract or I had \na stroke 8 years ago.\n  Oh, that is a preexisting condition. You are discriminated against. \nWe don't want you. You might get sick again.\n  Incredibly enough, then, the people who needed insurance the most are \nthe people to whom insurance companies said: Sorry, we are not going to \nprovide insurance to you. The Republican budget brings back those dark \ndays.\n  The Republican budget will say to insurance companies again that \nbeing a woman is an illness, being pregnant is an illness. Insurance \ncompanies would be able to discriminate against women and charge them \nextra for the crime of being a woman. Does that make sense to anybody? \nI don't think so. But that is, in fact, what is in the Republican \nbudget.\n  We have worked long and hard. This is an issue that has been dear to \nmy heart for a very long time, and that is the knowledge that many of \nour seniors cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. Because of \nthe power of the pharmaceutical companies in this country, our people \nare forced into paying the highest prices in the world for prescription \ndrugs. That is just the simple reality.\n  Another very serious problem is that generic drug prices are soaring. \nWe have many seniors and many Americans who have a variety of \nillnesses. They go to the doctor, the doctor writes a prescription, and \ndo we know what happens? I remember talking to a doctor in the northern \npart of Vermont who said her guess was that one out of four of her \npatients did not fill the prescriptions they wrote because they simply \ncan't afford them. And when one is older, by definition, one is often \nsicker and one needs medicine.\n  The Republican budget resolution we are debating now would increase \nprescription drug prices for some 4 million seniors and persons with \ndisabilities who are on the Medicare Part D Program by reopening the \ndoughnut hole. For years we have tried to close that hole and make sure \nthe elderly do not have to pay for prescription drug costs out of their \nown pockets. The Republican budget would undo the progress we have \nmade.\n  The bottom line of the Republican budget suggests the huge \nphilosophical divide that exists in this Chamber. But, interestingly \nenough, I don't think it exists within the American people. I think the \nmore the American people\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\nunderstand about the Republican budget, the more they will understand \nthat something is fundamentally wrong with that budget.\n  Where many of us come from is we look at an America in which the \nwealthiest people are doing phenomenally well. I had a chart up \nyesterday which was, to me, really extraordinary. It pointed out that \nin the last 2 years, the 14 wealthiest people in this country--all \nmultibillionaires--combined, saw an increase in their wealth in a 2-\nyear period--14 people--of $157 billion. Fourteen people in a 2-year \nperiod saw a $157 billion increase in their wealth. That is literally \nbeyond comprehension. That increase in wealth in a 2-year period is \nmore wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people own in \ntheir entirety.\n  Some of us believe that when multibillionaires see a huge increase in \ntheir wealth such that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now own almost \nmore wealth than the bottom 90 percent, maybe they should be asked to \npay more in taxes. That is what we believe. Our Republican colleagues \ndisagree. They have nothing of significance to say about income and \nwealth inequality, and their view is that if we want to deal with the \ndeficit and we want to deal with the national debt, the only way to go \nforward is to make horrendous catastrophic cuts in programs that \nmiddle-income and working-class people desperately need--programs they \ndesperately need.\n  So I have spoken a little bit about the Republican cuts in health \ncare, but I also should mention that there are major cuts in education. \nI can tell my colleagues, because I have had a number of town meetings \non this issue in my State of Vermont, almost all of the young people I \ntalk to are extremely worried about the high cost of college and about \nthe debts that are wrapped around their shoulders when they graduate \nfrom college.\n  What does the Republican budget do to address the crisis of the \naffordability of college and the deep debts millions of our young \npeople face when they leave school? Well, instead of addressing the \nproblem, they make it even worse. It is hard to believe, but it is \ntrue. The Republican budget would eliminate mandatory Pell grants. Pell \ngrants are the Federal program that helps low-income and working-class \nstudents get help in going to college. So at a time when it is harder \nto afford college, the Republican proposal eliminates mandatory \nprograms, cutting this program by nearly $90 billion over the next 10 \nyears, which would increase the cost of a college education for more \nthan 8 million Americans.\n  Now, what can we say about that? People today can't afford to go to \ncollege. Students are leaving school deeply in debt. And what the \nRepublicans say is let's cut $90 billion in mandatory Pell grant \nfunding and increase the cost of a college education for more than 8 \nmillion Americans.\n  I can tell my colleagues that in Vermont--and throughout this \ncountry, I know--working-class families have a very difficult time \nfinding quality, affordable child care. The Republican budget addresses \nthis problem by making a bad situation worse and by coming forward with \na budget which would mean that 110,000 fewer young children would be \nable to enroll in Head Start over the next 10 years.\n  We need to expand Head Start. We need to expand preschool education. \nWe need to expand child care. The most important years of a human \nbeing's life are 0 to 4 years old. Those little kids need the \nintellectual and emotional nourishment that good preschool education \nand child care provides them. What is the Republican proposal? Knock \n110,000 kids off of Head Start.\n  Under the Republican budget, 1.9 million fewer students would receive \nthe academic help they need to succeed in school by cutting about $12 \nbillion in the title I education program which is focused on the needs \nof lower income kids. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nwould be cut by $10 billion.\n  So here is the point. At the end of the day, what politics is about \nis which side are people on. Are people on the side of millionaires and \nbillionaires and large campaign contributors or are people on the side \nof working families who are struggling to keep their heads above water \neconomically, who are trying to figure out how they are going to send \ntheir kids to college. They are trying to figure out how they are going \nto help take care of their parents. They are trying to figure out how \nthey are going to pay their rent or, in some cases, even pay for their \ngroceries. That is what this debate is about.\n  What the Republicans are saying loudly and clearly is the rich are \ngetting phenomenally richer; we are not going to ask them to pay a \nnickel more in taxes. Corporations are enjoying record-breaking \nprofits, and we have major corporation after major corporation paying \nzero in Federal income tax because they stash their money in tax havens \nso they can avoid paying taxes to the U.S. Government, but we are not \ngoing to ask them to pay a nickel more in taxes.\n  That is what this debate is about. Which side are you on? I think the \nvast majority of the people in this country want the Senate to stand up \nfor the middle class, for the working families of this country, and ask \nthe billionaires and the large, multinational corporations to start \npaying their fair share of taxes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last month President Obama released his \nfiscal year 2016 budget proposal. Americans could be forgiven for \nthinking it was created in a vacuum, since the proposal completely \nignores our current fiscal reality. Six years ago, when the President \ntook office, our massive debt was already a massive $10.6 trillion. For \nthe past 6 years of the President's administration, our national debt \nhas increased by more than $7.5 trillion, to a dangerously high $18.2 \ntrillion. That kind of debt slows economic growth, threatens government \nprograms such as Social Security and Medicare, and jeopardizes \nAmerica's future. But apparently the President is not concerned because \nthe President's budget proposal would increase our national debt to a \nstaggering $25 trillion-plus over the next 10 years.\n  Let me repeat that. Over the next 10 years, the President's budget \nwould increase our national debt to more than $25 trillion. Now, I \ndon't need to tell the American people that kind of debt is \nunsustainable. American families know you can't keep racking up debt \nindefinitely, and they know the solution to being in debt is not \nincreasing spending.\n  It is too bad nobody in the White House has that same kind of common \nsense. The President's budget would increase spending by 65 percent \nover the next 10 years. If a family already in debt tried increasing \nspending that way, they would very quickly end up bankrupt. They would \nlose their home, their cars, their credit. Well, the government works \nthe same way. The government may be able to keep up appearances a \nlittle longer, but sooner or later unchecked government spending \nresults in financial ruin. It has happened in other countries, and it \nwill happen here if we don't take action.\n  If we keep racking up debt the way we have been going, we are not \ngoing to be able to pay for our priorities. Social Security, Medicare, \nnational defense, national security, infrastructure--all these \npriorities could face huge cuts if we don't get our Nation on a sound \nfiscal footing.\n  Last week, Senate Republicans introduced a budget blueprint for \nfiscal year 2016 that would balance the budget in 10 years and put our \nNation on a path to fiscal health. Instead of ignoring our Nation's \nfiscal problems, it promotes spending restraint, it creates a framework \nfor Congress and the President to come together on long-term solutions. \nWhile it is not a perfect plan--it doesn't solve every one of our \nNation's problems--it gets things moving in the right direction.\n  First, the Senate Republican budget balances. The President's budget \nnever balances--not in 10 years, not in 75 years, not ever. The \nPresident may think we can keep spending more than we take in \nindefinitely, but the fact is we can't. We need to get to a place where \nbalanced budgets--not deficits--are the new normal. Under the Senate\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\nRepublicans' budget, our Nation would achieve a $3 billion surplus by \nthe year 2025, and our budget encourages honest accounting.\n  For example, our budget would provide for the Congressional Budget \nOffice to score legislation increasing the deficit by $5 billion or \nmore not just over 10 years but over 40 years. Typically, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the cost of legislation over a \n10-year period. These estimates can be misleading because many pieces \nof legislation start out by costing relatively little but end up \ncosting huge amounts in the long-term. By looking at the 40-year cost \nof legislation instead of the 10-year cost, we can get a much clearer \nview of a bill's true cost and the effect it will have on the debt.\n  Our budget also makes economic growth a priority. Almost 6 years \nafter the recession ended, millions of Americans are still struggling \nand opportunities for advancement are still few and far between. A big \nreason for that is the oppressive, big government policies and deficit \nspending of the Obama administration. Our budget would help get the \ngovernment off the back of the economy by limiting the growth of \nspending and reducing the debt.\n  On the jobs front, the Senate Republicans' budget would pave the way \nfor the removal of inefficient and ineffective government regulations \nthat are making it difficult and expensive for many businesses to hire \nnew workers and create new opportunities. Our budget also lays the \ngroundwork for an overhaul of our outdated Tax Code, which needs to be \nreformed to lessen the tax burden facing families and to encourage \nbusinesses to create American jobs.\n  Yesterday, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the President's \nbudget-busting health care law. Five years on, the President's health \ncare law has resulted in higher costs, lost health care plans, reduced \naccess to doctors, and new burdens on businesses, large and small. The \nhealth care law's latest disasters include incorrect tax forms \ndispatched to nearly 1 million Americans and surprise tax bills for \ntens of thousands of households in this country. It is no surprise that \naccording to a recent poll, over 60 percent of voters have an \nunfavorable view of the Democrats' signature law. Senate Republicans \npromised the American people we would do our best to repeal ObamaCare \nand replace it with real health care reform, and our budget provides \nthe framework for that process to move forward.\n  ObamaCare has failed to provide the health care solutions the \nPresident promised. It is time to replace this law with reforms that \nwill actually make health care more affordable and accessible and that \nwill not put government between patients and doctors.\n  Finally, our budget would start the process of putting major \nentitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare on a sounder \nfooting going forward. Right now the Social Security trust fund is \nheaded toward bankruptcy. If we do not take action, Social Security \nrecipients could be facing a 25-percent cut in benefits in 2033.\n  Medicare faces similar challenges to those faced by the Social \nSecurity Program. Under the worst-case scenario, the Medicare trust \nfund could become insolvent as early as in 2021. That is just 6 short \nyears away. The Senate Republican budget would help preserve Medicare \nby extending the trust fund solvency by an additional 5 years, which \nwould protect retiree benefits while giving policymakers additional \ntime to ensure that this program provides support to seniors for \ndecades to come.\n  Our country is not in the best fiscal shape, but it is not too late \nto do something about it. Senate Republicans have proposed and produced \na responsible budget that will fund our Nation's priorities while \nrestraining spending growth and driving down our Nation's deficit. This \nbudget will give the American people a more efficient, a more \neffective, and a more accountable government. I look forward to passing \nit this week and to getting our Nation back on the path to fiscal \nhealth, which starts with a balanced budget.\n  We cannot continue down the path we are on. The American people \ndeserve better. We should give them better. For the first time in most \nof the years I have been here, we are actually going to have a budget \non the floor of the Senate that balances in 10 years. That is something \nI think the American people who sit around their household and sit \naround their kitchen tables trying to make these hard decisions for \nthemselves and their families--that is what they deserve and that is \nwhat they expect. That is what we are going to deliver.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 409\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 409.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 409.\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \npromoting equal pay, which may include preventing discrimination on the \nbasis of sex and preventing retalition against employees for seeking or \n                      discussing wage information)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO PROMOTING \n                   EQUAL PAY.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to promoting equal pay, which may include preventing \n     discrimination on the basis of sex and preventing retaliation \n     against employees for seeking or discussing wage information, \n     by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \n     purposes, provided that such legislation would not increase \n     the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of equal pay for \nequal work, I am pleased to offer this amendment to combat pay \ndiscrimination in the workplace. Our solution provides a reasonable, \nfact-based approach to equip Americans with the knowledge and the tools \nthey need to fight discrimination. This amendment contains language \nsimilar to President Obama's April 2014 Executive order, clearly \nstating that employees cannot be punished for exercising their First \nAmendment rights by speaking with employers or coworkers about their \nwages.\n  Furthermore, this amendment does not authorize any new Federal \nregulations, nor does it compel employers to disclose salary \ninformation. It simply prevents punitive actions against employees \nseeking information.\n  Women want good-paying jobs. That means we need policies to promote \neconomic growth and opportunities for all Americans. This is a simple \namendment. This is an amendment that would create a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to promote equal pay by reinforcing a commitment to \nexisting law. Every Senator in here supports equal pay for equal work. \nThat is existing law.\n  This amendment is a chance to not just reaffirm support for the \nprinciples of equal pay for equal work, but also for free speech. This \nfree speech includes the right to discuss wage information with \ncoworkers. This amendment would prevent retaliation from employers \nagainst employees who discuss wages with other employees or seek such \ninformation from their employers. Importantly, this amendment does not \nauthorize any new Federal regulations, nor does it compel employers to \ndisclose that salary information. It simply prevents punitive action \nagainst employees who seek or share wage information.\n  I believe this amendment is something all of us in this Chamber can \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, budgets are all about priorities. It is \nabout living within your means and not mortgaging our children's future \nby overspending money we do not have that we are going to have to ask \nthem to repay. When it comes to priorities, I cannot think of a higher \npriority for the Federal Government--I am not\n\n[[Page S1758]]\n\ntalking about State or local government, I am talking about the Federal \nGovernment--I cannot think of a higher priority for the Federal \nGovernment than national security.\n  That was one of the basic reasons the United States of America was \noriginally created--for mutual defense and national security. This \nbudget, importantly, helps set the course for the future security of \nnot only this country but also of the world, by funding our military \nservices. It is no secret--because we see it in the headlines every \nday, we see it on television, we see it online--we are living in an \nincreasingly dangerous world. We would prefer that it be otherwise, but \nthe truth is different.\n  All we need to do is take a look at the stories from--well, let's \npick last week. Russia is threatening to point nuclear weapons at \nDanish military ships, trying to bully another European country into \nnot playing a role in NATO and its missile defense shield, in \nparticular.\n  In the Middle East, Yemen is on the brink of a civil war that would \nbring even more instability to an already unstable region.\n  Then there is Iran. Just this last weekend, the Supreme Leader of the \nregime that the Obama administration is so committed to working out a \nnuclear deal with called for ``death to America.''\n  The American people understand this is an increasingly dangerous \nworld and we are not safer today than we were when this administration \nstarted. In fact, things are more tenuous, less stable.\n  Last month, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \ntestified before Congress that after the final analysis is complete, \nthe year 2014 is likely to go down as ``the most lethal year for global \nterrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled.'' That is a \nquote--``the most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such \ndata has been compiled.''\n  Preliminary data for the first 9 months of 2014 shows nearly 13,000 \nterrorist attacks across the world that have taken the lives of 31,000 \npeople. That is just the first 9 months of 2014. With so many different \nthreats out there, and untold twists and turns in global security in \nthe coming months and years, we need a national defense that ensures \nour armed services are prepared not just to respond to today's threats \nbut tomorrow's threats, whenever and wherever they occur.\n  The brave men and women who serve in the Armed Forces are, without a \ndoubt, the best in the world. But they cannot fight wars and they \ncannot keep us safe, they cannot maintain the peace, without the \nbacking from Congress to ensure they have the resources they need. This \nbudget we will pass this week does just that. It keeps that sacred bond \nand commitment to our men and women in uniform, and it, in effect, says \nto them: If you are brave enough and you are patriotic enough to serve \nin the U.S. military, we will make sure you have the resources \nnecessary to do your job.\n  The budget we are debating today provides $612 billion in defense \nspending for this year. Some people may say: That is too much money. \nWell, the fact is we know that the United States is the one \nirreplaceable national security force in the world, not just for us but \nalso for our friends and allies.\n  A strong America, as Ronald Reagan demonstrated, means a more \npeaceful world. Ironically, those who want to slash our defense \nspending and say, we cannot afford it, are sending a signal that \nAmerica is retreating from the world stage. When America retreats and \nits leadership recedes, then the bullies and thugs and pirates fill \nthat gap. It is a law of nature.\n  This budget will provide certainty and stability in funding for our \narmed services, as they will not be required to make across-the-board \nspending cuts this year. In fact, under our budget, defense spending \nincreases every year after fiscal year 2016. But the truth is, we do \nnot have a crystal ball. We cannot forecast future world events that \nour armed services will need to respond to. That is why this budget \nalso includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow our military to \nreact to a changing threat situation and make additional investments as \nnecessary throughout the 10-year budget window. This fund could be used \nto further invest in world-class training for our armed services or \notherwise enhance military readiness, or even modernize critical \nmilitary platforms.\n  In other words, this fund will help Congress work together to \nincrease defense spending further and to keep our commitment, not just \nto the brave volunteers who wear the uniform of the U.S. military, but \nour commitment as Members of Congress to do our job and to make sure \nthe Federal Government does its job when it comes to national security. \nIt does so while maintaining fiscal discipline.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues to achieve both of these \ngoals. It is so important for our military to stay prepared, because \nthe problems facing our country have rarely been more significant. That \nis not just my assessment, that is the assessment of Dr. Henry \nKissinger, the former Secretary of State.\n  Earlier this year at the Senate Armed Services Committee, Dr. \nKissinger said, ``The United States has not faced a more diverse and \ncomplex array of crises since the end of the Second World War.''\n  Let me say that again. ``The United States has not faced a more \ndiverse and complex array of crises since the end of the Second World \nWar.''\n  The scale of the challenges we face is matched by the consequences of \nus handling these challenges poorly and failing to meet our \nresponsibilities as Members of Congress to make sure our men and women \nin uniform have the resources they need to do the job we have asked \nthem to do and which they have volunteered to do.\n  That is why it is so vitally important that we continue our \ncommitment to our armed services, that we fund them fully and we give \nthem the flexibility to react to changing conditions around the world. \nThis budget does all of that. As threats continue to mount, this budget \nwill ensure the U.S. military remains unrivaled and that it has the \ntools it needs to keep our country and the rest of the world peaceful \nand safe.\n  Mr. President, later on this afternoon, we are going to give all \nMembers of the Senate a chance to vote on the President's proposed \nbudget. I will vote no. That is probably no surprise to anyone, but I \nthink everyone in this Chamber deserves the opportunity to express \nthemselves by voting on the President's proposed budget.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 357\n\n  (Purpose: To raise taxes and spending by enacting President Obama's \n                        fiscal year 2016 budget)\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my amendment No. 357.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 357.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto address the Senate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from South Carolina comes to the floor, \nwhich I believe he will, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nengage in a colloquy with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on Sunday, I was in the city of Chicago. I \nhad been invited by the Ukrainian-American community to speak to a \nlarge gathering. There are many Ukrainian Americans who have chosen the \ncity of Chicago to live in and work. They have\n\n[[Page S1759]]\n\nmade an enormous contribution to the city and to the State of Illinois.\n  I spoke to several hundred, some of whom had not that long ago been \nin Ukraine. It was very moving because these people who love America \nbut also love the country of their birth or origin are now watching \ntheir country being dismembered by Vladimir Putin and the Russians and \nwatching the United States of America fail to help them, literally, at \nall.\n  In case my colleagues have forgotten, the United States of America, \nthis President, has refused to provide not only defensive weapons to \nUkraine--I would remind you what we all know; that there are literally \nhundreds, if not thousands, of Russian troops inside of eastern \nUkraine, Russian weapons. Remember, it was Russian equipment--if not \nRussians themselves--that shot down the Malaysian jetliner, and we have \nsat by and watched it on the delusionary view of the President of the \nUnited States that he doesn't want to ``provoke Vladimir Putin.''\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I predicted every single move \nVladimir Putin has taken. By the way, I am pleased to be again \nsanctioned by Vladimir Putin. I wear it as a badge of honor.\n  So we have watched as they went into Crimea, in order that Vladimir \nPutin could have the naval base at Sevastopol, then into eastern \nUkraine.\n  Then a Malaysian airliner was shot down. We all seem to have \nforgotten about that. Sanctions have been imposed on Vladimir Putin, \nnone of which have had any significant effect, and the aggression \ncontinues.\n  Now there is a pause while more Russian equipment comes into eastern \nUkraine, and his next target will be the city of Mariupol so he can \ncomplete his land bridge ambition to Crimea.\n  Right now, he is having to resupply Crimea from air and sea, which is \nvery expensive, but Mariupol will be next. Then, depending on whether \nhe gets away with it, the pressure will increase on Moldova, and \npressures are already being exerted on the Baltic countries as well.\n  Our European friends, with the leadership of the United States of \nAmerica, is conducting itself in the finest tradition of Neville \nChamberlain. It was in the 1930s when we watched Hitler go into one \narea of another, usually in the name of ``German-speaking peoples.''\n  So I must say the people--the wonderful Ukrainian-American group I \nspoke to on Saturday--is puzzled, sad, and angry that the United States \nof America will not even give them weapons with which to defend \nthemselves.\n  We have given them, my dear friends, MREs. We have gone from the West \nand democracy's arsenal to the West's linen closet.\n  So I say, again, this is a shameful chapter in American history. It \nis shameful. It is shameful we will not at least provide these people \nwith weapons to defend themselves as they watch for the first time in \n70 years a European nation being dismembered.\n  Have no doubt about Vladimir Putin's ambitions, it is the restoration \nof the Russian Empire, and no one should have any illusions about that. \nUnless a stand is taken, day after day, week after week, Vladimir \nPutin, diverting attention from his economic troubles, will continue to \ncommit aggression until he feels he has restored the old Russian \nEmpire.\n  We are writing a shameful chapter in American history, the nation \nthat used to stand up for people who were struggling for freedom and \nassist them. I remind my colleagues that the Ukrainians are not asking \nfor a single American boot on the ground, they are just asking for \nweapons to defend themselves. Isn't that shameful.\n\n\n                              Middle East\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Middle East. First, let me \nremind you of a couple of comments in recent months that the President \nof the United States has made, one concerning ISIS, which has now moved \ninto Africa, Libya, and Tunisia--recent attacks. Of course, we know \nabout their caliphate that they have set up in Iraq and Syria. Boko \nHaram has declared their allegiance. They are spreading like an \nepidemic.\n  The President of the United States said, speaking of ISIS: ``The \nanalogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a \njayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn't make them Kobe \nBryant.''\n  I say to my colleagues, I am not making that up. That is what the \nPresident of the United States said about ISIS.\n  Then, he said recently:\n\n       Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the \n     fight to terrorists who threaten our country. We have \n     targeted al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen--\n\n  In Yemen--\n\n     and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in \n     Somalia.\n\n  This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while \nsupporting partners on the front lines, is one we have successfully \npursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.\n  Is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for \nyears.\n  Again, I tell my colleagues, I am not making this up.\n  Then, of course, Iran. The White House has repeatedly slammed the \nIsraeli Prime Minister for comments made during an election campaign, \nstatements he has clarified or apologized for.\n  But the White House continues to threaten a reassessment of American \npolicy toward Israel because ``words matter.'' That is what the White \nHouse spokesman said--``words matter.''\n  But when Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei chanted ``Death to America'' in a \nrecent address, the White House dismissed the remarks as aimed at a \ndomestic, political audience.\n  General Petraeus said on March 20: ``The Islamic State isn't our \nbiggest problem in Iraq.''\n  Our biggest problem in Iraq, according to General Petraeus, is Iran. \nHe is right.\n  ISIS is a terrible and awful disease that is afflicting the Middle \nEast and may in Africa. But when you look at what the Iranians are \ndoing, they are in Sanaa in Yemen, they are in Baghdad, they are in \nBeirut, and they are in Damascus.\n  Today, as we speak, Mr. Soleimani, the head of the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard, is leading the fight in Tikrit. This is the same \nhead of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard who sent thousands of copper-\ntipped IEDs into Iraq while our troops were there fighting and killed \nhundreds--hundreds--of American soldiers and marines, while we watch \nthem retake the city of Tikrit, and then we will get the credit with \nthe Iraqi people.\n  So David Petraeus, in answer to the question, ``You have had some \ninteraction with Qasem Soleimani in the past. Could you tell us about \nthose,'' Petraeus talks about those he met with:\n\n       When I met with the senior Iraqi, he conveyed the message: \n     ``General Petraeus, you should be aware that I, Qasem \n     Soleimani, control Iran's policy for Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, \n     Gaza, and Afghanistan.''\n\n  That is what Soleimani claimed. It was probably not true at the time, \nbut there is very little doubt that Soleimani and the Iranians are on \nthe move. Our Arab friends, whether they be the Saudis, the UAE or many \nothers, are keenly aware of this movement and success of the Iranians.\n  Very frankly, they do not understand this Faustian bargain that is \nnow being attempted to be concluded by this administration and the \nIranians in the form of a nuclear agreement, somehow thinking that if \nthere is this nuclear agreement--and I am not on the floor today to \ntalk about it--that somehow there will be a whole new relationship with \nIran, the same people who recently said: ``Death to Israel.''\n  So you can understand why our friends in the Middle East and the \nSunni-Arab countries are finding their own way, developing their own \nstrategy, and have no confidence in the United States of America.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Lately, there has been a lot of pressure on Israel as a result of the \nonly free and fair election that you will see take place in that entire \npart of the world. There has been a harsh criticism of the things Prime \nMinister Netanyahu said during that campaign.\n  I point out to my colleagues sometimes things are said in campaigns \nthat maybe we say in the heat of the campaign and maybe it is OK if we \napologize.\n  Today, one of the most astute observers, in my view, Bret Stephens of \nthe Wall Street Journal, had some advice for the Israelis. From his \narticle in this morning's Wall Street Journal entitled ``The Orwellian \nObama Presidency'':\n\n       Here is my advice to the Israeli government, along with \n     every other country being\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\n     treated disdainfully by this crass administration: Repay \n     contempt with contempt. Mr. Obama plays to classic bully \n     type. He is abusive and surly only toward those he feels are \n     either too weak, or too polite, to hit back. The Saudis \n     figured that out in 2013, after Mr. Obama failed to honor \n     his promises on Syria; they turned down a seat on the \n     security council, spoke openly about acquiring nuclear \n     weapons from Pakistan, and tanked the price of oil, mainly \n     as a weapon against Iran. Now Mr. Obama is nothing if not \n     solicitous of the Saudi Highnesses.\n       The Israelis will need to chart their own path of \n     resistance. On the Iranian nuclear deal, they may have to go \n     rogue. Let's hope their warnings have not been mere bluffs. \n     Israel survived its first 19 years without meaningful U.S. \n     patronage. For now, all it has to do is get through the next \n     22, admittedly long, months.\n\n  I note the presence of my colleague from South Carolina, and I guess \nmy question to him is: How in the world do we justify this delusionary \nidea that somehow an agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons--and I am \nnot asking to go into the details of it now, because my colleague and I \nare in agreement that it is an agreement, as Henry Kissinger described, \nthat was once designed to eliminate nuclear weapons and is now designed \nto delay Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons--how do we translate \nthat into believing that people who chant ``Death to America'' are \ngoing to be our friends, particularly in light of their aggression \nthroughout the region and their successful movement in these parts of \nthe world?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could give my best answer to that, No. 1--and my \ncolleague from Arizona has been more right than wrong for the last 4 \nyears about what was going to happen in the Mideast if we made the \nchoices the President made--No. 1, my colleague said if we don't leave \nany troops behind in Iraq, all our gains will come unraveled. At the \nend of the day, the sectarian rise in violence was a direct result of, \nI think, American troops leaving Iraq. We had a good thing going after \nthe surge. It did work. After drawing the redline against Assad and \ndoing nothing about it, ISIL was able to fill in that vacuum.\n  But here is the question: Given Iran's behavior today, what would \nthey do with the extra money that would come into their coffers if \nsanctions were lifted? Let's say we got a nuclear deal tomorrow, and as \na result of that deal sanctions would be lifted. Without a nuclear \nprogram, the Ayatollahs are wreaking havoc throughout the region. The \npro-American government in Yemen has been taken down by Houthi militias \nfunded by Iran. Assad in Syria has killed 220,000 of his own people and \nhe is a puppet of Iran. John Kerry said that Assad was Iran's puppet. \nWe have Lebanon, where Hezbollah is an agent of Iran that saved Assad \nand creating discontent all over the region. We have Shia militias on \nthe ground in Iraq being led by the leader of the Revolutionary Guard \nin Iran.\n  So here is the answer to my colleague's question. How could anybody \nbelieve the money we would give them for sanction relief would go to \nhospitals and schools? Don't you think the best evidence of what they \nwould do with money is what they are doing today? The administration \nhas never tied behavior to sanctions relief. So my big fear, Senator \nMcCain, is that not only would the Arabs want a nuclear weapon of their \nown if we got a bad deal with Iran, but the money we gave the Iranians \nwould go into their missile program to hit us, would go into further \ndestabilizing the Middle East.\n  Does my colleague agree that given Iran's behavior there is not one \nounce of moderation in this regime? Does my colleague agree there are \nno moderates in charge of Iran; that when President Obama speaks to the \nIranian people, urging them to argue for this deal, they have no voice; \nthat the last time the Iranian people rose up to petition their \ngovernment they got gunned down? Does my colleague agree with me that \nPresident Obama has no idea what is going on inside Iran and no \nunderstanding what this regime is up to with the money they already \nhave?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would respond to my friend, I wish the President of the \nUnited States, who issued some comment to the Iranian people about the \nnecessity of a nuclear agreement, would have spoken up in 2009 when \nthousands and thousands of Iranians were on the streets in Tehran \nprotesting a corrupt election and wanting freedom and he refused. They \nwere chanting ``Obama, Obama, are you with us or are you with them?'' \nAnd he refused to speak out on their behalf. That is when he should \nhave spoken up to the Iranian people.\n  I would also ask my friend: Is there anyone in Iran who is free to \nspeak up? You either get killed or put in prison if you speak up. So my \nquestion is: Who was the President of the United States speaking to \nwith those remarks?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, all I can say is it would be like telling a North \nKorean to speak up. That may be a bit of an extreme example, but not \ntoo much.\n  The point we are trying to make to President Obama is that if he \nbelieves there is a moderate element in Iran, who are they? Who is in \ncharge of this government he is trying to empower at the expense of the \nhardliners?\n  The assembly of experts are the people who pick the next Ayatollah. \nOn March 10, they had an election--I think it was 46 to 24. Ayatollah \nYazdi--I don't want to mispronounce his name--won the election to be in \ncharge of the assembly of experts. Their No. 1 goal is to pick the next \nAyatollah. He is widely known to be the hardest of the hardliners.\n  So I want the administration to explain to us, the Congress, who the \nmoderates are and how do you square that circle with the election of \nthe most hardline Ayatollah to pick the next Ayatollah? What \ninformation does the President have that there is a moderate element \nthat we can empower in Iran?\n  Can my colleague name one moderate voice that has a real say in the \nIranian Government?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not any who are alive or out of prison. I am sure there \nare many moderate voices in the Ayatollah's prisons throughout Iran by \nthe tens of thousands.\n  But I would also ask my colleague: Is it not true that every \nmanifestation of Iranian behavior--whether it be in Baghdad, where they \nnow have significant control; in Beirut, where Hezbollah basically has \ncontrol of the country; in Damascus--Bashir Assad would not be alive \ntoday or in Syria today if it hadn't been for the Iranians flying in \nhundreds of tons of equipment, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and \nbringing Hezbollah out of Lebanon and into Syria. And now we see \nSoleimani, the leader liberating Tikrit, getting all the publicity. And \nthe people of Iraq, naturally, are thanking him for freeing Tikrit from \nthe forces of ISIS.\n  One other comment. I know other colleagues are on the floor, but \nDavid Petraeus, probably the most brilliant military officer I have \never had the honor of knowing, made a very interesting comment in an \ninterview the other day and I would like my colleague's comment on it. \nHe said the major threat in the Middle East and in the world today is \nnot ISIS. It is not ISIS. He said it was Iran.\n  I think when we look at a map and we see where the Iranians are now \nin control, we have to give great credence to General Petraeus's \nassessment. Would my colleague agree?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me not only say why I agree, but here is what is \nabout to happen in the Mideast. Because of our lack of leadership, the \nIranians have gone on a rampage. My colleague had a very august group \nof people today--some of the smartest people in the Mideast and the \ncountry, leading think tank folks--come before the committee today, and \nI asked the question: Do you agree with me that Iran is wreaking havoc? \nThree out of four said yes. The one lady said seriously destabilizing.\n  Whatever adjective you want to use, it is commonly viewed that the \nIranian regime is projecting power in the most disruptive manner in \nrecent memory. They are backing people who took down the pro-Yemen \nGovernment, and now we have lost the ability to follow Al Qaeda in the \nArabian Peninsula that is responsible for the attack in Paris.\n  Assad wouldn't last, as my colleague said, 5 minutes, and the Assad \nregime, which has killed 220,000 people and driven over a million \npeople out of Syria, is putting pressure on Lebanon and Jordan.\n  The Shia militia on the ground today are probably war criminals by \nany classic definition, and they are being led by Soleimani, the head \nof the Revolutionary Guard, the biggest exporter of terrorism in the \nworld.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And responsible for the deaths of hundreds and hundreds \nof\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\nAmerican marines and soldiers. What do we tell their mothers?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Exactly. So the point we are trying to make to the \nPresident and the Members of this body is that Iran is on a rampage \nwithout a nuclear weapon. Clearly they are not a moderate regime trying \nto live peacefully with their neighbors. They are trying to disrupt the \nwhole Mideast and have influence unlike at any other time.\n  Here is what is going to happen. The Arabs in the region are going to \npush back. They no longer trust us. Remember when the head of the Saudi \nArabian intelligence community said it is better to be America's enemy \nthan her friend? We heard this twice in the Mideast on our recent \ntour--that people believe Iran is getting a better deal from America \nbeing her enemy than the traditional friends of this country.\n  So here is what is going to happen. Turkey is going to align with the \nSunni Arab world and go after Iran themselves, and we are going to have \na Sunni-Shia war the likes of which we haven't seen in 1,000 years, \nbecause without American leadership the whole place is falling apart.\n  Here is the legacy of Barack Obama. He tried to change the Mideast by \ngiving speeches. And every time he was told by military leaders you \nshould do A, he did B. He has reached out to the Ayatollahs, not \nunderstanding who he is talking to. He has empowered the most brutal, \nvicious, murderers on the planet today in Iran.\n  This Ayatollah in Iran is not a good man. He has blood on his hands.\n  The President is talking to the people who killed our soldiers by the \nhundreds. He is giving them resources they wouldn't have otherwise, and \nhe is making a deal with the devil. At the end of the day, this is \nblowing up in our face.\n  If the President doesn't self-correct, we are all in trouble. And if \nthis Congress sits on the sidelines and allows this nuclear deal with \nIran to go unchecked, and we don't look at it and vote on it, then we \nown the consequences of it.\n  To every Member of this body I say: We have an independent duty, as \ndoes the President of the United States, to make sure the deal we do \nwith Iran is a good deal for America and not a nightmare for the world. \nSo we are asking our colleagues to take their independent duty \nseriously. We have a check-and-balance responsibility. Do not let this \nadministration do a deal with the Ayatollahs in Iran who go to the \nUnited Nations and bypass us. If it is a good deal, we will vote for \nit.\n  As strongly as I know how to say it, I am telling my colleagues that \nour policies in the Mideast are failing, Iran is the biggest winner of \nAmerica leading from behind, all our traditional allies are in a world \nof hurt, and they are going to take matters in their own hands.\n  I thank Senator McCain for his leadership and for telling America \nabout the right choices, even though they are the hard choices. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleague as long as I can to speak truth to \nwhat I think is the biggest foreign policy disaster in my lifetime \nunfolding before our very eyes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nWall Street Journal article entitled ``The Orwellian Obama \nPresidency,'' by Bret Stephens.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, March 23, 2015]\n\n                     The Orwellian Obama Presidency\n\n                           (By Bret Stephens)\n\n       Under Mr. Obama, friends are enemies, denial is wisdom, \n     capitulation is victory.\n       The humiliating denouement to America's involvement in \n     Yemen came over the weekend, when U.S. Special Forces were \n     forced to evacuate a base from which they had operated \n     against the local branch of al Qaeda. This is the same branch \n     that claimed responsibility for the January attack on Charlie \n     Hebdo and has long been considered to pose the most direct \n     threat to Europe and the United States.\n       So who should Barack Obama be declaring war on in the \n     Middle East other than the state of Israel?\n       There is an upside-down quality to this president's world \n     view. His administration is now on better terms with Iran--\n     whose Houthi proxies, with the slogan ``God is great, death \n     to America, death to Israel, damn the Jews, power to Islam,'' \n     just deposed Yemen's legitimate president--than it is with \n     Israel. He claims we are winning the war against Islamic \n     State even as the group continues to extend its reach into \n     Libya, Yemen and Nigeria.\n       He treats Republicans in the Senate as an enemy when it \n     comes to the Iranian nuclear negotiations, while treating the \n     Russian foreign ministry as a diplomatic partner. He favors \n     the moral legitimacy of the United Nations Security Council \n     to that of the U.S. Congress. He is facilitating Bashar \n     Assad's war on his own people by targeting ISIS so the Syrian \n     dictator can train his fire on our ostensible allies in the \n     Free Syrian Army.\n       He was prepared to embrace a Muslim Brother as president of \n     Egypt but maintains an arm's-length relationship with his \n     popular pro-American successor. He has no problem keeping \n     company with Al Sharpton and tagging an American police \n     department as comprehensively racist but is nothing if not \n     adamant that the words ``Islamic'' and ``terrorism'' must on \n     no account ever be conjoined. The deeper that Russian forces \n     advance into Ukraine, the more they violate cease-fires, the \n     weaker the Kiev government becomes, the more insistent he is \n     that his response to Russia is working.\n       To adapt George Orwell's motto for Oceania: Under Mr. \n     Obama, friends are enemies, denial is wisdom, capitulation is \n     victory.\n       The current victim of Mr. Obama's moral inversions is the \n     recently re-elected Israeli prime minister. Normally a \n     sweeping democratic mandate reflects legitimacy, but not for \n     Mr. Obama. Now we are treated to the astonishing spectacle in \n     which Benjamin Netanyahu has become persona non grata for his \n     comments doubting the current feasibility of a two-state \n     solution. This, while his Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud \n     Abbas is in the 11th year of his four-year term, without a \n     murmur of protest from the White House.\n       It is true that Mr. Netanyahu made an ugly election-day \n     remark about Israeli-Arab voters ``coming out in droves to \n     the polls,'' thereby putting ``the right-wing government in \n     danger.'' For this he has apologized, in person, to leaders \n     of the Israeli-Arab community.\n       That's more than can be said for Mr. Abbas, who last year \n     threatened Israel with a global religious war if Jews were \n     allowed to pray in the Temple Mount's Al Aqsa mosque. ``We \n     will not allow our holy places to be contaminated,'' the \n     Palestinian Authority president said. The Obama \n     administration insists that Mr. Abbas is ``the best \n     interlocutor Israel is ever going to have.''\n       Maybe that's true, but if so it only underscores the point \n     Mr. Netanyahu was making in the first place--and for which \n     Mr. Obama now threatens a fundamental reassessment of U.S. \n     relations with Israel. In 2014 Mr. Abbas agreed to a power-\n     sharing agreement with Hamas, a deal breaker for any Israeli \n     interested in peace. In 2010 he used the expiration of a 10-\n     month Israeli settlement freeze as an excuse to abandon \n     bilateral peace efforts. In 2008 he walked away from a \n     statehood offer from then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. \n     In 2000 he was with Yasser Arafat at Camp David when the \n     Palestinians turned down a deal from Israel's Ehud Barak.\n       And so on. For continuously rejecting good-faith Israeli \n     offers, Mr. Abbas may be about to get his wish: a U.S. vote \n     for Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. For tiring \n     of constant Palestinian bad faith--and noting the fact--\n     Israel will now be treated to pariah-nation status by Mr. \n     Obama.\n       Here is my advice to the Israeli government, along with \n     every other country being treated disdainfully by this crass \n     administration: Repay contempt with contempt. Mr. Obama plays \n     to classic bully type. He is abusive and surly only toward \n     those he feels are either too weak, or too polite, to hit \n     back.\n       The Saudis figured that out in 2013, after Mr. Obama failed \n     to honor his promises on Syria; they turned down a seat on \n     the Security Council, spoke openly about acquiring nuclear \n     weapons from Pakistan and tanked the price of oil, mainly as \n     a weapon against Iran. Now Mr. Obama is nothing if not \n     solicitous of the Saudi highnesses.\n       The Israelis will need to chart their own path of \n     resistance. On the Iranian nuclear deal, they may have to go \n     rogue: Let's hope their warnings have not been mere bluffs. \n     Israel survived its first 19 years without meaningful U.S. \n     patronage. For now, all it has to do is get through the next \n     22, admittedly long, months.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before the Senators from Arizona and South \nCarolina leave the floor, I want to say a couple of words about their \ncontribution to our collective efforts on the budget.\n  As I said a moment ago, the No. 1 priority for the Federal Government \nis national security. And while we are all concerned about runaway \nspending--and the chairman of the Committee on the Budget has been \nquite determined to rein that in by producing a balanced budget over \nthe next 10 years--it is due to the leadership of the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from South Carolina, along with our other \ncolleagues on the Committee on the Budget, who also happen to serve on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\nCommittee on Armed Services, who I think have led us to a much better \nplace--a place where we can all feel better that we are closer to \nmaking sure our military has the resources they need in order to meet \nthe commitments we have asked them to make.\n  We maybe have a few things we need to still talk about, and we will \nkeep talking until we get it right, but the fact is, without the \nleadership of the Senators from Arizona and South Carolina and others \non the Committee on the Budget, we wouldn't be where we are today and \nable to hold our heads up high and say we believe in our duty to our \nmen and women in uniform, we believe in America's leadership role in \nthe world, and we will not shrink from that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 471\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed on \nbehalf of Senator Wyden, Ranking Member Sanders, and myself to set \naside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 471.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse], for Mr. \n     Wyden, for himself, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms. \n     Stabenow, and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 471.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To create a point of order against legislation that would cut \n   benefits, raise the retirement age, or privatize Social Security)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, \n     amendment between the Houses, or conference report that \n     would--\n       (1) result in a reduction of benefits scheduled under title \n     II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.);\n       (2) increase either the early or full retirement age for \n     benefits described in paragraph (1); or\n       (3) privatize Social Security.\n       (b) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of \n     the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, for my colleagues, this is an \namendment which relates to protecting Social Security.\n  Social Security is a program that has been an enormous success, that \nis at the heart of the American middle class, and that represents a \nsolemn promise our seniors have earned over a lifetime of work. It \nmakes a real difference in real people's lives. It is the difference \nbetween comfort and poverty for over 20 million Americans.\n  Rhode Island is a State where we count on Social Security. We value \nSocial Security. We know how important it is. What I have heard \nfirsthand from Rhode Island seniors over and over again is they want to \nmake sure this program is solid and remains strong, not just for them \nbut for their children and their grandchildren.\n  Sadly, for decades, the history of the Republican Party has been one \nof repeated attempts to undermine this bedrock of middle-class \nretirement security, proposing over and over again various types of \nsecurity cuts and, believe it or not, even turning Social Security's \nassets over to Wall Street to manage.\n  This Democratic amendment establishes a point of order against any \nlegislation that would reduce Social Security benefits, that would \nincrease the Social Security retirement age, or that would privatize \nthe program. This would help our moderate friends protect Social \nSecurity from rightwing attacks, and it would ensure that seniors, as a \npart of their American experience, can continue to count on benefits \nthey have earned.\n  Social Security is at present projected to remain fully solvent \nthrough 2033. It does not drive our current budget deficits and should \nnot be sacrificed to the quarrels over the budget. Ultimately, I think \nwe will need to strengthen Social Security, and when we do, simply \nasking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share into the system \ncan make that difference. Simply asking the wealthiest Americans to pay \ntheir fair share into the system can extend it another 50 years, while \nalso making our tax system fairer to the middle class. So it is a true \nwin-win. And we want to make sure we do not have to watch Rhode Island \nseniors and seniors across the country pay the price for a deficit they \nhad no part in creating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island not \nonly for his important remarks but for the work he has been doing for \nyears to protect and defend Social Security.\n  Let's be clear about a number of facts. When people jump up and say \nSocial Security is going broke--not quite true. As Senator Whitehouse \nindicated, Social Security can pay out every benefit owed to every \neligible American for the next 18 years.\n  When people jump up and say Social Security is contributing to the \ndeficit--also not quite accurate. As everybody knows, Social Security \nis funded by the payroll tax, an independent source of revenue for \nSocial Security.\n  The fact is that for many, many years, in a variety of ways, my \nRepublican colleagues have been attempting to either cut Social \nSecurity or, in the extreme case, privatize Social Security and allow--\nforce--Americans to go to Wall Street for their retirement benefits.\n  While this budget does not include a provision to cut Social \nSecurity, what I will say is, if my memory is correct, in three out of \nthe four hearings held by the Budget Committee, there were Republican \nrepresentatives--people who were asked to testify--who did talk about \nvarious ways to cut Social Security.\n  So what this amendment does is it establishes a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund--it establishes a budget point of order which prevents \nbenefit cuts, a raise in the retirement age, or the privatization of \nSocial Security benefits. That is what it does.\n  Now we are going to have a lot of people coming up here and saying: \nWell, we want to preserve Social Security.\n  What they really mean is that in order to preserve Social Security, \nthey want to cut Social Security benefits--maybe not for the people on \nSocial Security today but for future beneficiaries.\n  They say: Well, that is the only way we can protect Social Security.\n  Well, that is not accurate. I introduced legislation which, in fact, \nmakes Social Security not only solvent until the year 2065--50 years \nfrom today--but also expands benefits. We do that by saying that it is \ncurrently very absurd that a multimillionaire is paying the same amount \nof money into the Social Security trust fund as somebody making \n$118,000. There are some very wealthy people who are paying all of \ntheir Social Security taxes in the first day or two of the year.\n  Right now, we have a situation where millions of people in this \ncountry depend upon Social Security, people who are getting benefits of \n$12,000, $13,000, $14,000 a year. That is how they are living. Those \nbenefits should not be cut.\n  When we talk about a so-called chained CPI, which cuts COLAs for \nseniors and disabled vets, what we are talking about is cutting Social \nSecurity benefits for an average 65-year-old by more than $658 a year \nby the time that person reaches age 75 and a cut of more than $1,100 a \nyear by the time that person reaches age 85. Those are very significant \ncuts for people who are\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\ntrying to live on $13,000 or $14,000 a year.\n  So here is the argument. Is Social Security important? Obviously, it \nis. As the middle class continues to decline, Social Security is \nenormously important for the elderly and the disabled people of this \ncountry.\n  Point No. 2: Do we have to cut benefits in order to save Social \nSecurity? The answer is, obviously, yes. But we are back to the same \nold question we debate all day here. Our Republican friends seem \nabsolutely determined not to ask the wealthiest people in this country \nwho are doing phenomenally well to contribute to the well-being of the \nAmerican people. That is this overall budget. But on the issue of \nSocial Security, what we have to do is raise the cap, which is now at \n$118,000, and start it at $250,000. Just doing that will enable us to \nexpand Social Security to the year 2065 and expand benefits for lower \nincome seniors.\n\n  This point of order is enormously important. It says there will be a \nneed for 60 votes for any effort to cut Social Security, to raise the \nretirement--I don't know what world some people are living in. There \nare some who have come forward and said we should raise the Social \nSecurity retirement age to 70. Let's have people out there working at \n68, 69, 70 years of age. Let's force them to keep working before they \nget their benefits. My God, that is a horrendous idea. They also say we \nshould cut COLAs--cost-of-living adjustments--for disabled vets. What a \nterrible idea.\n  There is a way to extend Social Security for many decades and to \nexpand benefits. This amendment says: Do not cut Social Security.\n  I think a number of my Republican friends will say: Well, we are not \ngoing to cut Social Security for anybody on Social Security today. That \nis not good enough. There are people out there who are 50, 55, 60, 63, \n64, and they want to know that the benefits they will get are the \nbenefits they will be able to live on. Don't cut benefits for working \npeople, and that is what this very important amendment is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n4:40 p.m. today be equally divided between the managers or their \ndesignees and that at 4:40 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the \nfollowing amendments in the order listed, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the votes: Sanders amendment No. 474, a \nside-by-side to the Ayotte amendment; Ayotte amendment No. 400 on vets; \nFischer amendment No. 409, a side-by-side to the Mikulski amendment; \nMikulski amendment No. 362 on equal pay; a Hatch amendment, the text of \nwhich is at the desk; Wyden amendment No. 471 on Social Security; and \nCornyn amendment No. 357, the President's budget.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided between the managers or their designees prior to each \nvote, and that all votes after the first in this series be 10 minutes \nin length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be up to four rollcall votes at 4:40 p.m.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 471\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I \nwish to add my support to our ranking member's remarks.\n  At present, somebody making $110 million a year--and there are people \nwho make $110 million a year in this country--will make the same \ncontribution or less to Social Security as somebody making $110,000 a \nyear in salary. At best, they will pay the same despite the fact that \nthey are making 1,000 times more. At worst, they will pay even less \ninto it because they have treated their income as capital gains and \nthey have dodged the payroll tax on it. To me, that makes no sense, \nparticularly when more and more of our national income is moving up \ninto the top 1 percent, the top 2 percent, the top one-tenth of 1 \npercent.\n  In fact, there has been a pronounced effect on Social Security's \nbalances just from the increased income inequality. More and more of \nthe income generated in the United States of America is moving to the \nwealthiest people, and that means the amount of income under $110,000 \nthat is subject to taxation for Social Security is a smaller fraction \nof the total income package than it was before, which means there will \nbe less income to support Social Security, and that is a significant \npart of why Social Security is underfunded and why it may only last for \nthe next 18 years instead of longer.\n  First of all, I think Social Security is so important that even if \nthere were not this fairness discrepancy, it is worth it to our country \nto have people know that they and their aunts and their uncles and \ntheir grandparents have the security of Social Security, and we should \nprotect it at virtually all costs.\n  But even if that alone were not sufficient, the fact that everybody \nmaking under $110,000 supports Social Security and the billionaires \nmake no greater contribution and perhaps less of a contribution than \nregular working folks is completely backward and completely wrong, but, \nunfortunately, that is the principle of primacy in this Republican \nbudget. The principle of primacy in this Republican budget is that \nevery tax loophole is sacred. Every tax loophole is nonnegotiable. \nEvery tax loophole is to be defended at all costs. It doesn't matter \nwhat you have to cut, it doesn't matter what harm you have to do to \nSocial Security or to other programs, nothing matters as much to this \nRepublican budget as protecting every tax loophole.\n  When we consider who has the clout around here in this country to get \ntax loopholes, guess what--it is the corporations and it is the \nwealthy. Those are the guys who really do the mischief.\n  There are other tax protections for the middle class, and nobody \nwants to change those. But these tax loopholes that move jobs overseas \nand pay for that and allow companies to pretend their intellectual \nproperty is in another country when they only have half-a-dozen \nemployees there and they are running big time across our country \nbecause they locate themselves for tax purposes in a tax haven--there \nis no benefit to that. We should fix that. But in this budget, all of \nthat is kept sacred. It is the highest primary principle of this budget \nto defend every corporate tax loophole and every loophole that helps \nmillionaires and billionaires, and I happen to think that is wrong.\n  We brought this up over and over again in the hearings in the Budget \nCommittee. We have heard from experts--not only experts brought in by \nthe Democrats, we even heard from experts brought in by the Republicans \nwho said that revenue has to be part of the solution to our deficit and \nthat many of these tax loopholes are--there is no justification for \nthem. Even with this testimony and that support in the record, this \nbudget still stands by its principle of Republican primacy, and that is \nthat every tax loophole is sacred.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. How much time remains on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is a very important amendment, and I \nhope the American people are listening.\n  Social Security is probably the most important Federal program ever \ndeveloped in the modern history of this country. It is an enormously \npopular program, and it has been an enormously effective program. The \ntruth is that it has significantly reduced poverty among seniors. \nBefore Social Security, about 50 percent of seniors lived in poverty. \nToday, while the number is too high, it is somewhere around 10 percent.\n  The extraordinary beauty of Social Security is that in good times and \nin bad times--in an economic boom, depression, or recession--Social \nSecurity has paid out every check owed to every eligible American \nwithout fail. No one has ever received a letter that said: You know, we \nare in the middle of a recession, so we have to cut your benefits in \nhalf. That has never been the case. We take it for granted, but that is \nan extraordinary record.\n  Because we have a number of Republicans who simply do not like \ngovernment programs, there has been for\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\nmany years an effort to either cut or privatize Social Security and \ngive it over to Wall Street. What we hear are a lot of misleading \narguments. The argument is, well, Social Security is unsustainable, and \nit is not going to be there. And they throw out all of these reasons. \nBut the answer is that Social Security is absolutely sustainable, but, \nas Senator Whitehouse just indicated, we have to deal with issues such \nas income and wealth inequality, which has resulted in a significant \nreduction in the solvency of Social Security because people's incomes \nhave not risen, and therefore they contribute less to the Social \nSecurity trust fund, or many other people have gone way above the cap \nand are still paying less than they should.\n  The Republicans' solution seems to be--and I think there will be a \nside-by-side amendment that will say: Well, we are not going to cut \nSocial Security benefits for those who are in the program right now. \nBut essentially their language says that they will cut benefits for \nfuture retirees, people who are 55, 60, and 63 years of age. When we \nhave so many seniors and elderly people who are struggling right now to \nmake ends meet, I think the last thing in the world we should do is cut \nSocial Security.\n  Over half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in savings, and \nthese people, when they reach Social Security age, do not want to see \ntheir benefits cut. Two-thirds of seniors depend on Social Security for \nmore than half of their income, and one-third depend on Social Security \nfor almost all of their income. These people do not want to see their \nbenefits cut.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, Senator Whitehouse and I accepted petitions from 2 \nmillion people which said loudly and clearly: Do not cut Social \nSecurity. And in the polling I have seen in these tough economic times, \nRepublicans say do not cut Social Security, Democrats say do not cut \nSocial Security, and Independents say do not cut Social Security. Yet \nwhat our Republican friends are saying is that if you are 55, 60, or 63 \nand are not yet on Social Security, beware because we are prepared to \ncut your Social Security. Maybe we will raise the retirement age or \nmaybe we will cut your COLAs through a so-called chained CPI.\n  I will say as the former chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee that virtually every veterans organization has been loud and \nclear in opposition to the chained CPI because they understand that \nchained CPI does not just cut benefits for seniors, it cuts benefits \nfor disabled veterans. Do we really want to be cutting benefits for \ndisabled veterans? I hope we will not.\n  This is a very important amendment. It is an amendment that says: If \nyou stand with the overwhelming majority of the American people who say \nwe should not cut Social Security--yes, let's move forward to make it \nsolvent beyond the 18 years that it is solvent, but do not cut \nbenefits, do not cut COLAs, and do not raise the retirement age.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 400\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 400.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Ms. Ayotte] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 400.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to maintain and \nenhance access, choice, and accountability in veterans care through the \nVeterans Choice Card program under section 101 of the Veterans Access, \n                Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO MAINTAIN AND \n                   ENHANCE ACCESS, CHOICE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN \n                   VETERANS CARE THROUGH THE VETERANS CHOICE CARD \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to maintaining and enhancing access, choice, and \n     accountability in veterans care through the Veterans Choice \n     Card program, by the amounts provided in such legislation for \n     those purposes, provided that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit over either the period of the total of \n     fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total of \n     fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, last year in this body, we heard and saw \nevidence about what was happening at some of our VA facilities--the \nmanipulated wait lists, the delays our veterans had to endure--and, \nunfortunately, some of our veterans died waiting for care.\n  We passed a bipartisan bill, one on which we all worked together, and \nI appreciate that Senator Sanders worked very hard on that bill. The \nVeterans Choice Program was part of that bipartisan bill, but this \nprogram has yet to be implemented in the way this body intended. The \ngoal was to expedite care for veterans who had been waiting longer than \n30 days or who live farther than 40 miles away from the VA hospital. In \nmy home State of New Hampshire, we don't have a full-service veterans \nhospital, so too often our veterans are driving long distances--to \nMassachusetts or to other locations--to get the care they earned for \nhaving served and sacrificed so much for our country.\n  Recently, a study conducted by the VFW found that 92 percent of \nprogram-eligible veterans were interested in non-VA or private care \noptions that they could go to. Yet that same survey found that 80 \npercent of eligible veterans were unable to access the Veterans Choice \nProgram.\n  Barely 2 months after the program started--and we worked on it on a \nbipartisan basis in this Congress--the administration announced plans \nto divert money from this important program by saying it was \nunderutilized. Let's be clear. It is underutilized because the VA is \nnot implementing it properly. Veterans are not being told their rights, \nand we owe it to them to get this Veterans Choice Program right and \ngive veterans the choice they want for private care options so they are \nnot driving or waiting in line, given what they have done for our \ncountry.\n  Our veterans chose to fight on our behalf. We should honor the work \nwe did together and ensure that this program is properly implemented by \nthe VA, which is not happening right now. Our veterans want this \nchoice. Let's get this veterans program right.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which, again, is an \namendment designed to support what we intended in this body--to ensure \nthat veterans don't have to wait in line, that they can exercise \nprivate care options when they want to, thereby giving them the choice \nfor the sacrifices they have made for this country. They deserve \nnothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since its founding in 1948, Israel has \nbeen a strong and steadfast ally to the United States in the Middle \nEast, a region characterized by instability and violence.\n  The U.S.-Israel relationship is built on mutual respect for common \nvalues, including a commitment to democracy, the rule of law, \nindividual liberty, and ethnic and religious diversity.\n  Last week, President Obama and other administration officials \nsuggested a fundamental rethinking of this alliance, citing Prime \nMinister Netanyahu's simple restatement of fact that there can be no \nPalestinian State until conditions change. The Palestinian Authority \nmust, at a minimum, eject Hamas from its governing coalition, reclaim \ncontrol of the Gaza Strip, accept a demilitarized eastern border, and \nrecognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish State.\n  Further, Prime Minister Netanyahu recently reiterated these points \nand his support for a two-state solution in principle. In this light, \nany suggestion that the United States may reconsider our support for \nIsrael--especially our support at the United Nations--is wrongheaded \nand shortsighted, because the United Nations, regrettably, has \nconsistently employed a double standard in its treatment of Israel, \nmaking false allegations against Israel while, even worse, ignoring \neven worse behavior by other countries.\n\n  The U.N. has often questioned Israel's legitimacy----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COTTON. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. The U.N. Human Rights Council has focused obsessively on \nIsrael. The U.N. General Assembly has adopted 21 resolutions singling \nout Israel.\n  Because of this regrettable history, my amendment lays the groundwork \nfor a restriction of funding to the United Nations should it take \nunfair and discriminatory action against Israel or attempt to impose a \nfinal settlement on Israel and the P.A.\n  My hope is this will not be necessary, but this Congress should be \nprepared to take actions to defend the U.S.-Israel alliance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This side-by-side is a simple and noncontroversial \namendment. It creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund so the VA can have \nthe health care professionals--the doctors and nurses--it needs to make \nsure the VA is providing quality care to all of our veterans in a \ntimely manner. That is about it.\n  From what I heard--I will speak with Senator Ayotte a little bit \nlater--her amendment is simply making sure the VA implements the law we \npassed. I don't have any objection to that and I don't know that anyone \nshould.\n  Our amendment simply says we want the VA to have the medical \npersonnel--doctors, nurses, and staff--it needs to provide quality and \ntimely health care to our veterans. I hope it will receive unanimous \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 474, offered by the Senator from Vermont.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, this is a pretty simple and \nstraightforward amendment. Senator Ayotte mentioned a moment ago we \nhave had problems at the VA. No question about it; veterans have waited \ntoo long to get the timely and quality care they need. What this \namendment does is establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect \nand strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs, to hire more health \ncare professionals for the Department, and ensure quality and timely \naccess to health care for all veterans.\n  If we talk to veterans organizations, they think the care within the \nVA is good once people get in there. I want to make sure we have the \ndoctors and nurses to provide the quality and timely care our veterans \ndeserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I don't think we have a problem with this \namendment. Again, I ask the Senator if he would be willing to voice-\nvote it.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 474.\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 474) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 400\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 400.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Does the Chair wish to change places at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Thank you.\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the Chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote on amendment No. \n400.\n  Unfortunately, the bipartisan work we have done on the Veterans \nChoice Card has not been properly implemented by the VA. Our veterans \nwant this choice of private care. The Senator from Vermont has worked \nvery hard on this issue, which enjoys bipartisan support.\n  I urge my colleagues to make sure we get this right for our veterans. \nThat is what my amendment does.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Would the Senator agree to a voice vote?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from New \nHampshire for her work on this amendment with my office. We have \nsuccessfully completed language that I think moves us forward in the \nright direction.\n  I also wish to thank my colleague Senator Sanders for his tireless \nefforts on behalf of veterans, indicated most recently by this \namendment, which is fully compatible with the Ayotte amendment.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 400) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 409\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 409, offered by the Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this amendment I think satisfies the \ndesire for all of us to reassert and reaffirm our support for equal pay \nfor equal work.\n  Senator Mikulski spoke earlier about an amendment that I questioned \nbecause it ends merit pay, which I think hurts workplace flexibility \nand truly limits career opportunities for women.\n  My amendment again reaffirms that support, equal pay for equal work. \nBut it also affirms the course of free speech, because free speech \nincludes the right to discuss wage information with fellow coworkers, \nand that reflects the President's action that he took in 2014 to \nprevent retaliation from employers against employees who discuss wages \nwith other employees or seek such information from their employers.\n  This is an amendment I believe all of us can support. It again \nreaffirms equal pay for equal work and the nonretaliation clause.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Fischer offering \nher side-by-side on equal pay. I am glad to see that this is, in fact, \na stronger amendment than what my Republican colleagues have offered in \nthe past. However, this amendment still does not go far enough.\n  In my view, Senator Mikulski's amendment is a far better alternative. \nIt is not enough to ban retaliation about discussing salary \ninformation. This amendment would not allow women to act on any \ninformation they discovered. It would not give women their day in court \nand the opportunity to get money owed to them after sometimes months--\nsometimes years--of discrimination.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 362, offered by the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to urge the Senate to agree to \nthe Mikulski amendment on paycheck fairness. This finishes the job we \nstarted with Lilly Ledbetter. What it does is not wishful thinking, but \nthe real deal, where employers would be prohibited from retaliation for \nsharing pay information. Punitive damages would be allowed. So it would \nbe a real deterrent for discriminating on pay. It stops employers from \nusing any reason to pay women less, where they fabricate: ``Oh, he is \nthe head of the household,'' or whatever.\n  I also then remind my colleagues that in addition to what it does, I \nwill tell you what it does not do. This bill would not require an \nemployer to cut the salaries of male employees. This bill would not \nhave any criminal penalties in it for refusing to disclose wage \ninformation. This bill does not require the government to set salaries \nfor Federal employees or anybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the \nMikulski amendment. The specificity of it makes it corrosive to the \nprivilege of the budget. The budget resolution is focused on expanding \neconomic growth, and that growth comes from new jobs--over 1 million \njobs, according to the CBO, if our budget takes full effect.\n  As the economy grows, putting more people to work is our best \nstrategy to increase pay for women and men. We all want women and men \nto earn equivalent pay for the same job at the same firm. That is why \nCongress enacted the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibits \ndiscrimination in pay on the basis of gender for substantially similar \nwork. Congress also passed Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act to prohibit \nbusinesses from discriminating on the basis of sex. These laws empower \nwomen to demand equal pay, and they have. The gap has been narrowing.\n\n  I ask Senators to vote no on this amendment because of its \nspecificity. It is corrosive to the privilege of the budget.\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 498, \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, for Mr. Hatch.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, saving Social Security will require \nCongress to work in a bipartisan fashion, but most of all it will \nrequire Presidential leadership.\n  In 2009, President Obama held a fiscal responsibility summit to talk \nabout the need for entitlement reform. During the summit the President \nsaid:\n\n       What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are \n     now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick \n     it any further. We have to signal seriousness in this by \n     making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my \n     watch, not someone else's.\n\n  I agree with what the President said then, even if he hasn't exactly \nfollowed his own advice. It is time to roll up our sleeves and get to \nwork.\n  Every year we delay makes it more difficult to implement gradual \nreforms to Social Security that will allow us to avoid abrupt changes \nfor future beneficiaries. Delay makes it more difficult for hard-\nworking Americans to gradually adjust their plans and makes it more \nlikely they will be hit with an uncertain blow to benefits or more \ntaxes.\n  My amendment calls for a reserve fund to allow Congress to consider \nlegislation submitted by President Obama to protect current \nbeneficiaries and save Social Security for future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Wyden amendment, which does not \nseem directed at bipartisan discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, this is a very important amendment, and \nI hope the American people listen carefully to what is in it. As \nSenator Hatch indicated, it protects current beneficiaries. In other \nwords, they are not going to cut benefits for those currently on Social \nSecurity. But if you are 63 years of age, 64 years of age, 65 years of \nage, watch out. They are going after you.\n  I would suggest there is a way to extend the solvency of Social \nSecurity, and it deals with raising the cap and asking wealthy people \nto contribute more. We can make Social Security solvent for the next 50 \nyears without cutting benefits for anybody. I urge a ``no'' vote on the \nHatch amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, colleagues, Social Security is a promise \nbetween workers and seniors that should never be broken, and Social \nSecurity benefits ought to be protected and should not be cut.\n  The Congress needs to take steps to ensure that Social Security can \npay full benefits for future generations and must avoid creating \nartificial roadblocks to the proper use of Social Security trust funds.\n  The House of Representatives has refused to do that even though \nSocial Security trust funds today have a balance of $2.8 trillion, and \nshould be able to pay all earned benefits until 2033.\n  Support this amendment. Don't privatize Social Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I know all my colleagues are committed to \npreserving Social Security. We all want Social Security to be there for \ntoday's and tomorrow's seniors. However, the Wyden amendment is not \ngermane to the budget resolution.\n  The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over the Social Security \nprogram, both its benefits and finance structure. The Budget Committee \nhas no purview over the Social Security program.\n  Moreover, the Wyden amendment instructs the Finance Committee how to \nwrite the legislation--language that is inappropriate for a budget \nresolution. In fact, it is corrosive. It damages the privilege of the \nbudget.\n  For this reason, I am compelled, as chairman of the Budget Committee, \nto raise a point of order against the Wyden amendment. I make a point \nof order that this amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is very clear, unlike the\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nHatch amendment.

Mr. President, President Obama's budget has gotten some \npretty rough coverage in the media recently. For example, the Los \nAngeles Times called the President's annual budget ``. . . a strange, \nalmost fictional document.''\n  An article in Politico said, ``As he prepares to deliver his budget \non Monday, President Barack Obama is lurching to the left.''\n  Another Politico article said, ``It's a progressive's dream version \nof Obama, untethered from earlier centrist leanings. . . .''\n  The President's budget has not had a great voting history in the \nSenate. Since 2011, there were only 2 votes for the President's \nproposed budget and 1,023 votes against it. This is an opportunity for \nall Members of the Senate to express their views on President Obama's \nproposed budget.\n  I recommend and ask that my colleagues vote no on this budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I don't know whose budget Senator Cornyn \nis presenting, but it is certainly not the President's budget. The \nPresident's budget recommends raising the minimum wage, and that is not \nin Senator Cornyn's proposal.\n  The President's budget includes 2 years of free community college. \nThat is what the American people want, and it is not in Senator \nCornyn's proposal.\n  The President's budget talks about a fair tax proposal, not more tax \nbreaks for billionaires, and that is not in Senator Cornyn's proposal.\n  I will vote no because I am not quite sure what is in Senator \nCornyn's proposal, but it is certainly not what President Obama \npresented to the American people.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to my friend that this is the \nPresident's proposed budget. Senators can vote yes or no. I am glad to \nhear the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Sanders, is \ngoing to vote no. I will vote no, and I encourage all Senators to vote \nno.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, if Senator Cornyn wishes to bring a \nproposal that has 2 years of free community college to the floor, which \nis in the President's budget, I invite my friend to do that.\n  Is the Senator from Texas up for that?\n  If Senator Cornyn wants to bring a proposal to raise the minimum wage \nto $10.10 an hour, which is in the President's budget, I invite my \nfriend to do that.\n  Will the Senator from Texas introduce that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, my amendment aims to prevent the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nfrom entering into settlement agreements without seeking approval from \nState, county, and local governments that would be affected by the \nsettlement.\n  All too often, rather than writing and implementing environmental \nregulations in an open, transparent process, environmental regulations \nare implemented as the result of citizen suits that establish arbitrary \ntimelines that force the agency to rush through the regulatory process. \nAs a result, regulations that affect all sectors of the economy are \nimplemented without following the proper administrative procedures.\n  It is unfortunate, but legislating by lawsuit has become commonplace \nas agencies repeatedly miss deadlines and are challenged by citizen \nsuits alleging improper agency action.\n  A 2014 report by the Government Accountability Office found that \nlegal mandates do influence an agency's selection of regulatory \noptions. These lawsuits leave inadequate time for agencies to analyze \nthe options available to them. As a result of this shortened timeline, \nagencies cannot do a proper analysis of proposed regulations. This \nleads to inadequate time for notice and comment. It keeps the citizens \nin the dark about economic impacts of significant regulations and does \nnot allow for State and local governments to provide input regarding \nhow these regulations will affect them.\n  For example, in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service entered into \na settlement agreement with environmental groups that will lead to the \npotential listing of more than 250 species. Millions of acres across \nthe United States will be impacted. Yet no State or local government \nwas allowed to give input into the process.\n  Similarly, the Environmental Protection Agency has entered into \nsettlement agreements on issues such as regional haze, which have no \nimpact on public health but cost billions of dollars in impacted \nStates. While the EPA is willing to talk to radical environmental \ngroups in the settlement process, they did not consult with the \nimpacted States or communities.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote to say that we should fix this \nproblem and that we make certain that our State and local governments \nare given a say in settlement agreements that will have impacts within \ntheir borders. A vote against this amendment is a vote against \ntransparency and a vote to give radical environmental groups more say \nin the process than the States or local governments where the impacts \nactually occur.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak about our budget and how the choices we will make over the next \nfew days will reflect our values and priorities.\n  As someone who has acted as a countywide elected official writing \nbalanced budgets, I have long viewed them as not just a collection of \nnumbers and programs but also really a statement about our basic values \nand a reflection of what we hold dear. We can say we believe in this or \nthat, but at the end of the day, our budgets tell the true story. Over \nthe last 2 years in this body, following the hard work and leadership \nof Democratic Senators Patty Murray and Barbara Mikulski, the previous \nchairs of Budget and Appropriations Committees, we have taken important \nstrides to stabilize our government's finances, invest in our middle \nclass, and protect the most vulnerable among us.\n  After a few really hard years, our economy has begun to heal and grow \nagain. We are now in the longest period of uninterrupted private sector \njob growth in our Nation's history--a period in which our businesses \nhave created 12 million new jobs. Today, our national unemployment rate \nstands at 5.5 percent, and the deficit has fallen nearly two-thirds \nsince the depths of the great recession. At a time when the economies \naround the world are slowing down, ours remains, relatively speaking, a \nglobal bright spot.\n  We need to continue on this path. We need to invest in this growth. \nAnd in my view, it is the wrong time to hit the brakes on our economy's \nresurgence.\n  Unfortunately, the budget proposed by Senate Republicans misses the \nmark and would, I fear, reverse these gains. It denies our basic values \nby balancing the budget on the backs of the poor and middle class while \ncutting investments essential for our Nation's competitiveness and \nfuture.\n  It relies on some budget gimmicks to actually increase defense \nspending while making broad cuts elsewhere, and it uses overly rosy \npredictions about growth and our debt that has time and again proven \nfalse. It does all this while protecting tax breaks for the very \nwealthiest and corporations at the expense of working families.\n  It is my hope that we can reach a budget that is responsible, \nbalanced, and fair, that takes stock of our needs today and what the \nfuture will demand of us. So I would like to take a few minutes and \noutline broadly what I think our budget priorities should be.\n  First, we need a budget that preserves our social safety net by \nbuilding a circle of protection around the most vulnerable among us and \nprotecting the promises we have made to our seniors. Part of the basic \nbargain we make in this country is that when one of our neighbors falls \non truly hard times,\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\ntheir country offers a hand up. We need to ensure these basic \nprotections to health care, food, and a home are there for those of our \nneighbors in deepest need. It is also part of that same bargain that \nafter a lifetime of work, you will be able to retire with dignity and \nsome security. As workers, we all pay in to Medicare and Social \nSecurity, and we need to ensure that as future generations of Americans \ngrow up, raise their families, and contribute to our economy, the \nbenefits they have spent their lives paying into will be there for \nthem, just as they were for previous generations.\n  Yes, we should have a conversation about how to responsibly bring our \nlong-term health care costs under control, but we can't do it the way \nthis budget does, by irresponsibly shifting costs to seniors and the \npoor.\n  For retired Delawareans, for instance, the Republican budget would \nreverse an important reform in the Affordable Care Act and would raise \nprescription drug costs by an average of $1,100 a year.\n  Second, just as we are there for each other when times are hard, we \nmust rebound and grow together by making specific and thoughtful \ninvestments in our future. We need a budget that understands that \nwithout critical investments in infrastructure, research, and science, \nour economy will struggle to grow and support a strong middle class. We \nneed a budget that invests in our middle class and gives working \nfamilies a fair shot--an economy that is built on growth and \nopportunity. These investments in growth are the basic building blocks \nof our economy. They make up our economic backbone and help create an \nenvironment for our Nation's drive and dynamism to flourish.\n  Growth, however, requires infrastructure. We have a roughly $3.6 \ntrillion infrastructure debt--investments in infrastructure that are \ndue by 2020. Every year we put off investing in our roads, bridges, \ntunnels, and ports. Every year we fall behind our competitors, and we \nmake it harder for our businesses to grow and create jobs. Growth also \nrequires investing in research and development. Our long-term \ncompetitiveness depends on our ability to innovate faster than our \ncompetitors. Although businesses already invest a huge amount in R, \nthe Federal Government plays a critical role through our national labs, \nthrough the manufacturing extension partnership, and other grant \nprograms that either directly invest in or incentivize the research \nthat leads to innovation.\n\n  Finally, growth in our country requires ensuring that every child has \naccess to a quality education. It requires making it easier for \nfamilies to send their kids to college and easier for young people to \nmanage the costs of their college through managing student loans after \nschool, and it requires strengthening the real connection between the \nclassroom and workplace so education can be a sturdier rung to a longer \nladder of opportunity.\n  Throughout our history our middle class has thrived and our economy \nhas been strong when we made these sorts of investments in our economy \nand middle class. We need a budget that continues those investments.\n  Finally, we need a budget that lowers our deficit responsibly, in a \nway that is fair and forward-looking--not on the backs of the middle \nclass and poor and not done in a way that kills jobs and stifles \ngrowth. Over the last few years we have done a lot to get our deficit \nunder control, using about three-quarters of spending cuts and about a \nquarter of increased revenue. We have also benefitted from a steadily \ngrowing economy which has lowered our deficit.\n  As we move forward, we need balanced deficit reduction that preserves \nour investments in our future and our promises to each other. That will \nmean raising some revenues by asking the wealthy and corporations to \npay a bit more, just as it will mean making hard choices over the long \nrun about the true causes of our deficits and debt.\n  But let's be clear. We can do this while investing in our future and \nkeeping our promises to our seniors, to our veterans, and to each \nother. The best way to lower our deficit is to grow our economy. So we \nneed to invest in that growth. After all, an airplane needs an engine \nto take off, even in strong headwinds.\n  Over the coming days we will be voting on a wide series of amendments \nthat will say a lot about our values and priorities. I would urge my \ncolleagues to keep in mind that which has always powered our economy \nand will continue to into the future--an economy that gives families a \nfair shot and invests in the strength and opportunity of the middle \nclass and those fighting to get into the middle class. That is how we \nbuild an economy. I hope we will dedicate ourselves to a budget that \nwill help us do so, far into the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO.

Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I believe \ndefense spending is the most important obligation of the Federal \nGovernment. That doesn't mean we throw money away or we put money in \nplaces where it doesn't belong or we fund projects that have no \nutility. But it does mean the most important thing the Federal \nGovernment does for America is to defend it.\n  We have benefitted from the fact that for the last 100 years, America \nhas had the most powerful military force on the planet. This is \nespecially true since the end of the Second World War. There have been \ntimes in our history when we tried to save money by cutting back on \ndefense spending, and each and every time, it has forced us to come \nback later and spend even more to make up for it.\n  It is interesting to point out that in times in the past when we have \ntaken a peace dividend--this idea that the world is no longer unstable \nor unsafe and we can now spend less on defense--each and every time, we \nhave had to come back and make up for it later as a new threat emerged. \nI don't think we can make the argument that this is a time when the \nworld is stable or peaceful. Yet this is a time of dramatic reductions \nin defense spending.\n  During this administration, first came the defense cuts of $480 \nbillion over 10 years. Adding insult to injury, by the way, was that \nthe savings found in the defense budget were redirected to already \nbloated domestic programs.\n  Secretary Gates wrote in his memoirs about the extent to which he was \nforced to cut costs, saying: ``[N]o other department had done anything \ncomparable--even proportionally.''\n  This was then followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each \nyear through sequestration, which will add up to a total of a trillion \ndollars over the next decade, despite the warnings of three secretaries \nof defense and our entire military leadership.\n  All in all, inflation-adjusted defense spending has declined 21 \npercent since\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\n2010. Even if we discount the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has \nstill declined by a dangerous 12 percent. This is happening at the same \ntime that China is undergoing the most expansive, most aggressive \ndefense increase in modern history; at a time when Russia, despite \nbeing eviscerated by economic sanctions, has held their defense \nspending largely harmless; at a time when radical Islam around the \nworld--both the rise of ISIS and the existence of Al Qaeda and other \ngroups such as al-Nusra and the Khorasan group and others--poses an \nongoing threat to the United States. This at a time when many of our \npotential adversaries and adversaries, such as North Korea and Iran, \nare developing long-range rocket capabilities that could reach the \ncontinental United States. This is the worst possible time to be \nreducing our defense spending, and yet that is what we are doing. We \nare setting ourselves up for danger.\n\n  I would recognize that people who have worked hard on this budget \nhave tried to find new ways to address this through contingency \nfunding. I respect the work they have done, and ultimately that may be \nwhere we end up. But before we do, it is important for this body to \nhave a serious debate about how we are underfunding defense spending in \nthis country and the dangers it poses for our future.\n  That is the purpose of this amendment. The purpose of this amendment \nis to replace the defense numbers in this budget with the projected \nfiscal year 2016 number from the fiscal 2012 Gates budget. This was the \nlast defense budget, the Gates budget, that was put together solely on \nthe assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs \nto deal with it. It is the budget that the bipartisan congressionally \nmandated National Defense Panel stated was the minimum required to \nreverse course and set the military on more stable footing.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Cotton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I would ask Senator Cotton, who has extensive experience \nboth serving in uniform and here in the Senate as well as in the House, \nhis views on the dangers this poses, the rates that we are reducing \nmilitary spending, and what it means to the long-term security of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida. I am \npleased to offer this amendment with him. I do agree that it is \ncritical we have this debate on what we should be spending on our \nmilitary. While I respect the work of the Budget Committee, I also call \nattention to the views of the chairman and the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee on which I sit, that they would spend $577 \nbillion on defense next year, which would eliminate sequestration.\n  I suggest, as the Senator from Florida did, that we need to look to \nthe views of the National Defense Panel, which did draw from Secretary \nGates' fiscal year 2012 budget, projecting into fiscal year 2016. While \nSecretary Gates had a reputation as a reformer, he had already found \n$450 billion of savings in the Department of Defense at that time. It \nis hard to say there is much fat left.\n  Second, as the Senator from Florida pointed out, that was the last \ntime the Department of Defense engaged in what we should do in this \nbody, which is the budgeting for the military based on the threats we \nface and the strategy we need, not having a strategy that is driven by \nthe budget.\n  But that is not enough. As the National Defense Panel said itself, at \n$611 billion, that projection is not enough. Why is it not enough? Some \nof the threats the Senator from Florida identified. In the last 4 \nyears, what have we seen? The Islamic State on the rise, rampaging \nacross Iraq and Syria. Iran racing toward a nuclear weapon even as it \nasserts greater control and dominance over Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, \nand now Sanaa.\n  We have seen Russian revisionism, invading a sovereign country in the \nheart of Europe, shooting a civilian airliner out of the sky in the \nheart of Europe, and China on the rise, developing military \ncapabilities that are quite clearly directed against the United States \nand our allies in the first island chain. That is why we need this \ndebate. That is why we need the military budget the Senator from \nFlorida and I are proposing, because the eyes of the world are upon us, \nnot just our enemies, but our allies as well, wondering if America will \nnot only have the resolve to stand by its commitment but if it will \nhave the capabilities to stand by those commitments, whoever the \nCommander in Chief may be.\n  But there is one final important group whose eyes are on this \ninstitution this week. It is our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, and \nour marines, who are wondering if the elected representatives of the \npeople will stand with them, will provide them the resources they need \nto be ready, to be trained, equipped, and ready to fight our Nation's \nwars so they do not have to fight them in the first place.\n  Earlier today, I had the great benefit of being able to meet with a \ngroup of Army majors and captains, the mid-career officers, just like \nthe mid-career noncommissioned officers who are the backbone of our \nmilitary. Two of those men I started officer candidate school with at \nFort Benning 10 years ago this coming Friday, one of whom has been \nseriously injured.\n  To a person, they all said that training is down, families are \nstrained, operations are stressed, equipment is overused, and they \nwanted to know, will the Congress of the United States give them the \ntools they need to fight and win our country's wars? That is why I am \nproud to stand here with the Senator from Florida to offer this \namendment and say that, yes, we will stand by them. Yes, we will make \nsure they are ready to fight and win our wars so they do not have to \nfight them in the first place.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I would say there is not much to add to what the Senator \nfrom Arkansas has pointed out. As he well knows, the importance that we \nhave made to the men and women of our armed services, that is, that we \nwill never put them in a fair fight. It will always be an unfair fight \nto their advantage. They will be the best trained, best equipped, and \nbest-taken-care of fighting men and women on the planet.\n  We cannot keep that commitment if we continue to reduce spending on \nthe military and on defense at the rate we are going today.\n  I would add one more point, that is, that much of the world security \ntoday is based upon American military alliances that are built upon \nAmerican military assurances, so, for example, in the Asia-Pacific \nregion, where the Japanese, the South Koreans, and other allies in the \nregion look to an American umbrella of defense to provide them \ncertainty in the face of real risk, whether it is territorial claims \nmade by China that are illegitimate, or the nuclear threat of North \nKorea.\n  Why haven't the South Koreans developed their own nuclear weapons? \nBecause they believe the United States will be there to help them \ndefend themselves. Why have the Japanese never felt compelled to use \ntheir technological know-how to build a nuclear program? Because they \nbelieve the United States is their ally and will come to their \ncollective self-defense.\n\n  These countries do their own spending. The Japanese have a very \ncapable military force and a great force multiplier in the region, \ndespite not being called a military force.\n  The South Koreans are a very impressive fighting force and have a \nvery courageous history. But that American security alliance in the \nregion is critical to the long-term stability and security of that \nregion, a region where a lot of global growth is happening on the \neconomic front, where 50, 60, 70 percent of global trade and commerce \ntransits through the South and East China Seas.\n  The U.S. Navy's presence in the region, along with our other \nbranches, is critical for the defense of the region. The same is true \nwith the NATO Alliance in Europe. It relies on American security \nguarantees. The same is true--if a terrible deal, God forbid, is \narrived at by this administration with Iran, our partners and allies in \nthe region, particularly Saudi Arabia and others, are going to look to \nthe United States and say: Well, what are you going to do to help us be \nprotected from an Iranian nuclear weapon, with the missiles they are \nable to acquire?\n  So what is going to happen when they turn and we say to them: We are\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nwith you; we are going to be there; We are going to continue to work \nwith you; we are going to continue to live up to our defense \ncapabilities, but we do not have the capabilities to meet our \nobligations? In essence, you can talk pivoting to Asia, but you have to \nhave something to pivot with. If we have eviscerated our military, we \nhave eviscerated our naval capacity, if we are on pace, as we are now, \nto have the smallest Air Force and the smallest Navy we have had in a \nvery long time, we can say whatever we want, but our allies will not \nbelieve us because we will not have the capabilities to meet it.\n  The other challenge we have is when we talk about modernization, we \nare not talking about the Commander in Chief today. When we decide how \nmuch money we are going to spend on modernizing our military \ncapabilities, what we are deciding is what are the technologies and \ntools that are going to be available to a future Commander in Chief in \n5, 10, or 15 years.\n  These innovative systems that we use today that have cut down on \ncivilian casualties, that allow us to improve our targeting, our \nintelligence-gathering capabilities, that have made the United States \nthe premier fighting force in all of human history--all of those things \nwere developed a decade ago or longer, through years of experimentation \nand testing, through innovation.\n  So if we cut back on that now, in 10 years a future Commander in \nChief will be faced with a threat to our national security, and will \nnot have the latest, greatest technology on the planet to address it.\n  What about the asymmetrical capabilities that China and others are \ndeveloping? Instead of trying to out-aircraft-carrier us, they build \nweapons to destroy aircraft carriers. As we try to adjust to that \nthreat, what is going to happen in a few years if we do not keep pace?\n  The absence of a long-range bomber, the need to replace an aging \nsubmarine fleet, a Navy that is headed for a catastrophic low number of \nships, all of these things need to be confronted, not to mention the \nfact that we are not modernizing at an efficient and effective rate our \nnuclear arsenal, which is a key part of our deterrence, in a world \nwhere China, Russia, and others have significant stockpiles of weapons, \nparticularly the Russians.\n  All of those things are important. These are long-range, long-term \ndecisions that will have an impact on a future Congress, on a future \nCommander in Chief, and on our children and grandchildren, who will be \nthe ones who have to live in that world. I promise you that a world \nwhere America is no longer the most capable fighting force on the \nplanet is a world that is more chaotic and less safe.\n  I look forward to having a debate on this. I encourage my colleagues \nto rally around these numbers. This is what we should be funding \ndefense at. As my colleague, the Senator from Arkansas, accurately \npointed out, and I am honored to work with him on this, strategy should \nnot be driven by defense spending, the defense spending should be \ndriving the strategy. In essence, to put it succinctly, we should not \nhave a strategy that is based on limited resources. We are going to \nhave to do the best we can with limited resources. We should first \noutline a strategy. This is what the strategy should be for the future \nof our country to keep us safe. Then we should fund that strategy, not \nthe other way around. That is not what we are doing now. We are setting \na dangerous precedent. More importantly, we are putting at risk the \nnational security of this country. Once you have made that decision, it \nis very difficult to reverse it in a timely way. We have learned this \nlesson the hard way multiple times in our history. I hope we do not \nhave to it learn it again.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Arkansas on this \namendment, and with my colleagues. There is great respect for the work \nthat has gone into this budget, and the work of many others who are \nequally committed to the national defense of our country. I acknowledge \nthe hard work they have put into finding a solution to get more money \ninto defense, but it is not enough. Everyone knows that. The sooner we \ndeal with this, the safer our country is going to be.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, in response to the colloquy that just \ntranspired, I would simply say that for all of the earnest and I am \nsure sincere spirit behind it, there is no willingness to even close \none corporate tax loophole to support our Nation's defense, which I \nthink puts into some context the priority in which that is held as a \npractical matter, as opposed to a theoretical matter.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to urge this Chamber to \nwake up to the urgent threat of climate change. I have done this every \nweek the Senate has been in session for nearly 3 years. Today is my \n94th time. I have asked my colleagues to heed the warnings from our \nscientists, from our military and national security professionals, from \nmany of our leading American corporations and executives, from their \nown home-State universities, and from so many of our faith leaders.\n  Since it is budget week, we would do well to also consider that for \nyears the Government Accountability Office has placed climate change on \nits biannual high-risk list of the greatest fiscal challenges facing \nthe Federal Government. But even so, there is no attention from the \nother side.\n  This risk is particularly great in coastal areas, such as in my home \nState of Rhode Island, where sea levels rise ever closer to \ninfrastructure and property, and extreme weather exacts an ever heavier \ntoll. Secretary of the Treasury Lew put it pretty plainly: If the \nfiscal burden from climate change continues to rise, it will create \nbudgetary pressures that will force hard tradeoffs--larger deficits or \nhigher taxes. And these tradeoffs would make it more challenging to \ninvest in growth, to meet the needs of an aging population, and to \nprovide for our national defense.\n  My Republican colleagues want to slash spending. Indeed, they have \nalmost a fixation on slashing spending. They say they do not want to \nleave a financial mess for future generations to bear, but they ignore \nthe need to slash our carbon emissions and don't care a bit about \nleaving an environmental mess for future generations to bear. They \nrefuse because the polluters and their allies have built a fearsome \npolitical machine in Citizens United, and the polluters demand that the \nRepublicans follow their denier script.\n  Well, unfortunately, nature won't wait for our politics to sort \nthemselves out, and nowhere are these changes occurring more clearly \nthan in our oceans. The changes in our oceans are real, and they are \nmeasurable. They follow the laws of biology, of chemistry, and of \nphysics. Our steady flood of carbon pollution has real consequences.\n  Scientists from the University of California, Stanford, and Rutgers \nrecently published a peer-reviewed paper in Science magazine on marine \ndefaunation. ``Defaunation'' is a big word for the widespread loss of \nanimal life in the ocean. Human activities, they argue, including \noverfishing, pollution, and carbon emissions, are wiping out sea life. \nPopulations of marine vertebrates, including sea birds, mammals, and \nturtles, have decreased by an average of 22 percent over the last 40 \nyears. Fish have declined by nearly 40 percent. Major fish species have \ncrashed 90 percent. Coral is having massive bleaching and die-off. We \nare living, the authors say, in a time of ``empty reefs,'' ``empty \nestuaries,'' and ``empty bays.''\n  How is it that carbon pollution changes the ocean environment? Pretty \nsimply, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat. That is not news. \nWe have known that since Abraham Lincoln was President. Much of that \nheat goes right into the ocean. Globally, oceans absorb 90 percent of \nthe heat captured by greenhouse gases.\n  Well, all that heat disrupts marine life. Corals, for example, will \nexpel the algae living in their tissues when water is too warm, causing \nthe coral to turn completely white and die in what is known as coral \nbleaching.\n  Other species that aren't stuck in one place like coral are literally \nswimming away. We have seen fish, accustomed to specific temperatures, \nmigrating to cooler waters. Along the entire Northeast seaboard, the \nmovement\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\nof fish farther north and into deeper waters is well documented. NOAA \nhas even developed tools to allow fisheries managers and scientists to \ngo online and track the movement of different species through time.\n  I have had fishermen back home tell me they are catching fish their \nfathers and grandfathers never saw come up in their nets. One Rhode \nIsland fisherman told me: ``Sheldon, it's getting weird out there.'' \nForty percent of fishermen in the Northeast reported catching new fish \nspecies in places where they wouldn't expect to find them.\n  In a recent Center for American Progress survey, those who believe \nclimate change is happening outnumber deniers four to one.\n  Just last week, the Providence Journal, my own home State paper, \nreported on the continuing loss of ice smelt from the waters of the \nNortheast. The smelt live in estuaries and bays in the wintertime, once \nmaking it a favorite for ice fishermen. But now where the ice-fishing \ncottages used to cover the ice, there are very few. That fishery has \ncrashed. In Narragansett Bay, the winter flounder fishery has crashed.\n  From Maine comes a recent news article from our former Republican \ncolleague, Olympia Snowe. It is titled, rather bluntly, ``Lack of \nAction on Climate Change is Costing Fishing Jobs.'' Senator Snowe \nreports that the shrimp fishery in the Gulf of Maine was closed this \nwinter for the second year in a row because the shrimp are nowhere to \nbe found.\n  The shrimp fishery has crashed, and the crash has been precipitous. \nAs recently as 2010, shrimpers in the Gulf of Maine hauled in 12 \nmillion pounds of northern shrimp. By the time they had to close the \nfishery, the catch was down to less than 600,000 pounds. One likely \nculprit is warming seas. The Gulf of Maine is at the southern end of \nthe shrimp's range, and the Gulf of Maine is warming exceptionally \nfast. An estimate from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute shows that \nwater temperatures in the gulf rose eight times faster than the global \naverage in recent years.\n  The rapid changes in the Gulf of Maine are causing things to get \nstrange for the other fisheries as well. Our colleague Angus King has \ncome to the floor repeatedly to describe the northward march of the \niconic Maine lobster.\n  Cod populations in the Gulf of Maine suffered for years from \noverfishing. Now the cod are struggling to recover as temperatures in \nthe gulf increase. The cod might not return, instead seeking out cooler \nwater elsewhere.\n  Another scientific fact: Warmer temperatures make oxygen less soluble \nin water. When oxygen is too low for marine life to flourish, that \ncreates dead zones, which are growing around our oceans in size and in \nnumber. If carbon pollution continues at pace, global oxygen levels in \nthe ocean are predicted to drop by more than 3 percent over the \ncentury. Do we tell the fish to hold their breath while we wait to wake \nup?\n  Carbon pollution also makes the oceans more acidic--another \nscientific fact. Ocean water has absorbed roughly a quarter of all \nhistoric carbon dioxide emissions, driving up the pH level of the \noceans at rates not seen in perhaps the last 300 million years. To put \n300 million years in context, that is more than 1,000 times as long as \nour species has been on this planet. We are gambling with very big \nchanges that we have never seen in human time and that are a long way \nback in geologic time.\n  Acidifying waters make it harder for animals such as oysters or even \nthe humble pteropod--a main component of the salmon diet--and a lot of \nother creatures at the base of the oceanic food chain to make their \nshells and develop properly from juveniles to adults.\n  Increasingly, those acidic oceans are hurting U.S. shellfish, and \nshellfish are a $1 billion American industry. More acidic waters have \nalready cost the oyster industry in the Pacific Northwest nearly $110 \nmillion, putting 3,200 jobs at risk. The Pacific Northwest is being hit \nfirst by ocean acidification, but the effects are expected to be felt \nhardest in the Northeast--my home--according to a recent article in the \njournal Nature Climate Change. Conditions in the Northeast will \njeopardize the $14 million annual mollusk harvest in my State of Rhode \nIsland, putting my home State's coastal communities at real risk of \neconomic harm.\n  Bill Mook, president of Mook Sea Farm in Maine, testified before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee last summer about the decline in \noyster larva that he has linked to more acidic water. As he said, \ndelicate shellfish hatcheries are ``canaries in the coal mine,'' the \nfirst victims of a growing menace.\n  Yet we still don't listen. From coast to coast and pole to pole, the \noceans are warning us, and we still do not listen. The authors of the \nScience magazine paper warned that we are headed into ``an era of \nglobal chemical warfare'' on the oceans--and we don't listen.\n  We must wake up to the warnings that are coming from our oceans. The \nevidence is there for everyone to see. It is a matter of measurement, \nbasic measurements of temperature, of pH, of sea level--real high \nschool science class stuff--that are showing us these changes. Yet we \nwon't listen.\n  Fishermen in Rhode Island and across the country are already feeling \nthese changes. They see them around them.\n  Colleagues, if you are not a scientist, go ask the coastal and ocean \nscientists at your home State university. They will give you the \nanswer.\n  I conclude by going back to what Senator Snowe wrote:\n\n       The loss of Maine's $5 million shrimp fishery should serve \n     as a warning. A similar blow to our $300 million lobster \n     fishery must be avoided at all costs. That will require \n     honest, fact-based discussion and a genuine bipartisan \n     commitment to solutions.\n\n  Well, we have had neither around here for a long time. There has been \nno honest, fact-based discussion, and there has been no bipartisan \ncommitment to solutions. That has to change.\n  I hope Senator Snowe's fellow Republicans in the Senate will join \nwith us Democrats in that honest, fact-based discussion and in a \ngenuine bipartisan commitment to solutions. I hope our colleagues will \nunshackle themselves from the fossil fuel industry--which is an \nindustry riddled with appalling conflicts of interest on this subject--\nand wake the heck up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito).

Madam President, as a fifth-generation Montanan and avid \nsportsman, I know firsthand how important Montana's lands and resources \nare to our economy and our way of life. I also know how important it is \nfor Montanans to play a strong role in the management of these precious \nparts of our State. In Montana, we understand that our resource use \nmust be done responsibly. We understand the importance of protecting \nour State's treasures so that future generations may continue to have \nthe same experiences and job opportunities we have today.\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\nWe also know that the Montanans who use and live on the land every day \nbest understand how to best protect those resources. But, \nunfortunately, the Obama administration's persistent efforts to stretch \nthe true intent of the Antiquities Act threatens Montana's ability to \nmanage our State's resources, and it is a trend we are seeing across \nother States as well.\n\n  Too often these unilateral designations completely ignore the needs \nof the local community--the farmers and ranchers, the sportsmen and \nsmall business owners directly impacted by these new designations. My \namendment will establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation \nto ensure States and local governments support national monument \ndesignations.\n  This amendment in no way precludes the President from proposing a \nnational monument. However, any bill or designation that has a \npotential to impact land management must be locally driven, not \nspearheaded in Washington, and must have local government and State \nsupport as well. This amendment ensures the people affected most by \nthese designations have a seat at the table and their voices are heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 389\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my amendment No. 389.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Daines] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 389.\n\n  Mr. DAINES.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO HOLDING \n                   MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF \n                   REPRESENTATIVES ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILING TO PASS \n                   A BALANCED BUDGET.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to holding Members of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives accountable for failing to pass a balanced \n     budget by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \n     purposes, provided that such legislation would not increase \n     the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I offer amendment No. 389 to the budget \nresolution to establish a deficit-neutral reserve to hold Members of \nCongress accountable for failing to pass a balanced budget.\n  Washington has balanced its budget only five times in the last five \ndecades. Let me say that again. Washington has only balanced its budget \nfive times in the last 50 years. This is completely unacceptable, and \nit threatens the prosperity of future generations. By strengthening \naccountability and demanding results, my amendment will help restore \nfiscal responsibility--I would call it fiscal sanity--in Washington.\n  I have introduced related legislation--the Balanced Budget \nAccountability Act--which would terminate the salaries of Members of \nthe House and Senate if their respective Chamber does not pass a \nbalanced budget. Simply put, no balanced budget, no pay. It is time to \nhold Congress accountable to the taxpayer. It is time to hit the \nMembers of Congress in their pocketbooks if they can't pass a balanced \nbudget.\n  Chairman Enzi's budget meets this commonsense principle, and by \npassing my amendment to the budget resolution we will reinforce our \ncommitment to passing similar balanced budgets in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).

Mr. President, turning to the budget, I rise in strong \nsupport of this resolution that delivers on the promise to balance our \nbudget without increasing taxes. West Virginia families and families \nacross our country understand they cannot continually spend more money \nthan they take in. Each month families have to balance their budgets \nand decide how to spend their limited resources, make tough choices, \nset priorities, and account for unexpected expenses.\n  Unfortunately, annual deficits are routine for the Federal \nGovernment, but we have recently endured 4 straight years with an \nannual deficit of at least $1 trillion. Despite recent drops, our \nnational debt now stands at $18 trillion. That totals more than $56,000 \nfor every American.\n  American families cannot withstand spending more than they earn from \nmonth to month and neither should the Federal Government.\n  The debate on this budget resolution brings the Senate to an \nimportant crossroads. We can choose the President's path, which \nincreases taxes and adds another $6 trillion to our national debt, or \nwe can choose to support the responsible budget on the Senate floor \nthis week. If we fail to make the tough decisions to reduce our Federal \nspending, we will leave mountains of debt to our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Our first responsibility as leaders should be to leave our country \nbetter and stronger for the next generation of Americans. That starts \nby taking steps to balance our budget, and this budget balances in 10 \nyears.\n  This budget provides us with the flexibility to address many of the \nimportant issues confronting our Nation, including evolving threats \nfrom terrorists. When West Virginians hear about ISIS, instability in \nYemen, the failing state of Iraq, the first thing we think about is the \nsafety and security of our own families. Terrorism hits close to home, \nand we must ensure we have the flexibility to fund a strong national \ndefense. Like American families, we must have flexibility to account \nfor unexpected expenses and unexpected threats as they arise.\n\n  This budget resolution gives us the ability to pass a long-term \nhighway bill that is paid for. We must invest in our Nation's roads and \nbridges and do so in a fiscally responsible way.\n  This budget resolution paves the way for an extension of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program--a bipartisan initiative which \nwill, hopefully, be considered by the Senate in short order. This \nbudget facilitates changes that help our rural hospitals continue to \nprovide critical medical services in their communities.\n  Our Nation's priorities are reflected in this Nation's budget. I want \nto draw special attention to the energy provisions in this budget. I \nhave said many times an energy economy is a jobs economy. Energy is at \nthe forefront of many West Virginians' minds, whether we are paying for \nour monthly energy bill or checking the gas prices.\n  The production of coal and natural gas accounts for tens of thousands \nof\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\njobs in West Virginia. In recent years, we have seen what advances in \nenergy technology can do to broaden energy production and benefit the \nbroader economy. The shale boom has made the United States a leading \nproducer of both oil and natural gas. The benefits are felt by \nAmericans every time they fill their tank and balance their budgets at \nthe end of the month.\n  In my State of West Virginia, Marcellus shale natural gas production \nis creating jobs and providing the opportunity to expand downstream \nmanufacturing, but Federal Government policies can hamstring our energy \neconomy by slowing the production and the use of our resources.\n  West Virginia, unfortunately, has seen that firsthand in our State's \ncoal mining industry, where thousands of jobs have been lost. Just last \nweek, AEP issued layoff notices to employees at three West Virginia \npowerplants. These closures are years ahead of schedule and the early \nclosures are solely because of the Federal Government's MATS rule.\n  Yesterday, Patriot Coal announced it was temporarily idling the Paint \nCreek Complex, which employs 400 workers in West Virginia. Coal-fired \nplant closures driven by EPA emission regulations were cited as part of \nthe problem.\n  The upcoming EPA regulations for carbon emissions from powerplants \nwill have an even more devastating impact. Findings from reports by \nwell-respected economic analysis firms show costs could get up to $479 \nbillion over a 15-year period while causing double-digit electricity \nprice increases in 43 States.\n  Over half of the country's power comes from coal. Yet EPA is \npredicting that by effectively eliminating one-half of our energy \nproduction we will reduce average electricity prices by 8 percent. \nWell, somehow that just doesn't add up. How does this impact our \nFederal budget?\n  An energy economy that works will provide the low-cost, reliable \nelectricity to power our broader economy. By contrast, excessive \nregulation means fewer people working in my State's energy sector. \nHigher cost, less-reliable energy is a tax against manufacturing and \njob growth across the country. That means fewer individuals working, \nfewer businesses providing jobs, and, ultimately, fewer government \nrevenues.\n  The budget resolution before us this week recognizes the importance \nof American energy production. The reserve funds in this budget will \nimprove our energy infrastructure, reform environmental regulations and \npromote job growth. To supplement the strong energy provisions already \nin the budget, I have filed several amendments to strengthen our energy \nsecurity.\n  Last year, the administration reached a climate agreement with China. \nThat agreement requires short-term carbon emission reductions in the \nUnited States, but China is allowed to continue increasing its carbon \nemissions until 2030. That disparity could place the United States at a \nsignificant economic disadvantage.\n  My amendment would block any international environmental agreement \nthat would result in serious harm to the U.S. economy.\n  I have also filed an amendment that would block EPA from finalizing, \nproposing or issuing any regulation that would reduce the reliability \nof the electricity grid. Our economy relies on electricity being \navailable. Families expect the lights will come on when they flip the \nswitch. They expect to have heat in the winter and air-conditioning in \nthe summer. This simple amendment says no regulation from EPA can \nimperil access to reliable electricity. That makes sense to me.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the balanced budget that is before \nthe Senate this week, including these amendments, and to support \npolicies that will allow our economy to benefit from America's vast \nenergy resources. The jobs and the revenues that come from energy \nproduction can play a significant role in a responsible Federal budget.\n  The American people elected us to make government more efficient, \neffective, and accountable. American families must live within a \nbudget, States must adhere to a budget, and it is time for the Federal \nGovernment to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1775-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1775-S1777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE BUDGET AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk tonight about one issue: the \nissue of children. But I wish to speak about that one issue in two \nseparate contexts: One is the budget we are debating now and will \ncontinue to vote on all week and the second is with regard to the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  Let me start with the premise that I believe those of us who were \nelected to both Houses of the Congress and in both parties are charged \nwith a basic responsibility to our children. It doesn't matter where we \nlive or what State we represent or what district, in the case of the \nHouse, I believe we are charged with that responsibility.\n  A long time ago, Hubert Humphrey, who served in this Chamber for many \nyears and was well known across the country, set forth a moral test for \ngovernment. He talked about the moral test being how government treats \nthose in the dawn of life, those in the shadow of life, and those in \nthe twilight of life. Of course, in speaking of the dawn of life, we \nare talking about children. That test is still appropriate and we \nshould try our best to adhere to it in terms of public policy, \nespecially when it comes to the budget.\n  The budget, of course, is a reflection of who we are as a country and \nwhat our values are. It is in a sense a mirror into which we look or \nshould be looking to see who we are. And if we are not setting forth \npolicy and being strong advocates for our children, we may as well not \nbe here. So I think there is a test that each one of us must face when \nit comes to what we are doing on behalf of children.\n\n  I also believe in a very real sense that the programs, the \nstrategies, the expenditures we make on behalf of children are in fact \nan investment--an investment in the long-term economy of the United \nStates. This isn't just the right thing to do; it is also the best \nthing we could do for a growing economy and for our fiscal situation \nyears from now. If kids are healthier, they will get better jobs. If \nthey learn more when they are younger, they are going to earn more when \nthey are older. That is not just a rhyme, it is true, and all the \nstudies show it. So I believe this budget debate is a time to reflect \nupon what will happen to our children. I have real concerns about the \nbudget as it relates to children.\n  Again, these are in our society the folks who are powerless and in \nmany cases voiceless. They are not voting, they don't have a lobbyist, \nthey don't have a high-paid strategist or voice for their needs. \nBecause they are powerless and because they are in a sense voiceless, \nit is up to us to speak on their behalf--and we speak with our votes, \nwe speak with our work.\n  So what is the proposal in this budget? Let me work through some of \nthe numbers.\n  According to one of the leading advocacy organizations in the United \nStates, First Focus, discretionary investments make up nearly one-third \nof all Federal investments that go to children. So what we do on the \ndiscretionary part of the budget--which, by definition, because it is \ndiscretionary, we have decisions to make about it year after year. \nBecause of that, we have to be very careful when it comes to these \ndecisions--whether it is the budget resolution, whether it is the \nauthorization process, or whether it is in fact the appropriations \nprocess. This funding, this so-called discretionary, nonmandatory--if I \ncan call it that--part of the budget includes programs such as Head \nStart, childcare assistance, housing support, special education, to \nname a few examples that have a direct and substantial impact upon our \nchildren.\n  The Republican budget we are debating this week cuts $236 billion \nover 10 years in the nondefense discretionary part of the budget. \nNondefense discretionary is a long way of saying the part of the budget \nthat we vote on and we will have votes on that relate to the \nappropriations. So $236 billion over 10 years is the cut. That cut, I \nwould argue, falls disproportionately in a substantial way upon \nchildren.\n  What do these cuts mean for children and for families? Of course, we \ncannot separate one from the other. We will\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nlook at Head Start, and 35,000 children will be cut from Head Start--\nsome 1,250 fewer children in a State like Pennsylvania, just by example \nfor one State. What are we going to gain? How better off would the \ncountry be with 35,000 fewer kids in Head Start? I don't think we are \ngoing to be better off. I think we are worse off if we do that. It \nmakes no sense. This is a program that has been in existence for 50 \nyears. It has helped a lot of children succeed.\n  The State director from my office in Pennsylvania, who just left our \nstaff recently and served with distinction, Ed Williams, was a Head \nStart kid. I meet people all the time in our State who are leading very \nsuccessful lives in the private sector or public sector. Ed is just one \nexample of having had the benefit of Head Start to get a head start in \nlife because of disadvantages that certain children face.\n  How about students with disabilities, a $347 million cut to funding \nfor students with disabilities, which means a little more than $12 \nmillion less for Pennsylvania children with disabilities.\n  How about housing, 133,000 nationwide fewer housing vouchers. In \nPennsylvania, that adds up to 620 families who, if they had those \nvouchers, would be able to afford decent and safe housing. What are we \ngetting for fewer families who have access to housing vouchers? Again, \nit is not an experimental program. It is a program that we know works, \na program that has been in existence for a long time to help folks.\n  We know when we invest early in a child's life, we see a great return \non investment. All the studies show this. It is irrefutable: If you \nspend a buck, you get a lot more than a buck back. By some estimates, \nthe bang for the buck is in the double figures. In one study on early \nlearning, we get $17 back for the $1 spent.\n  I mentioned before that if we make investments in children in terms \nof their early learning, they will in fact learn more now and earn more \nlater. That is what we should be focused on when it comes to our \nchildren, when it comes to their ability to succeed in school and, of \ncourse, when it comes to their ability to get a good job and be part of \na growing economy.\n  The budget proposal makes deep cuts in many other investments to \nprotect our most vulnerable children, including the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, the so-called SNAP program that we used \nto call food stamps. That, of course, provides nutrition aid. If we \nwere doing the right thing as a nation--and we are not there yet, even \nthough we have made some progress on some fronts--we would make sure \nchildren have enough to eat. That would be one pillar of our protection \nfor children. We are not there yet, but the SNAP program helps \nsubstantially on that. We would make sure they have early learning \nopportunities. I talked about that and will talk about it more. We \nwould make sure they have access to health care. That is why we have \nMedicaid for poor children, that is why we have the Children's Health \nInsurance Program for others, and that is why so many private sector \ncompanies provide health care that, of course, covers children of their \nemployees. But if we are doing at least those three things--early \nlearning, food security or food and nutrition, as well as health care--\nwe are going to be doing what is right for our children.\n  I would argue we have to examine this budget and apply a kids' test--\nnot a special interest test, not a lobbyist test, not a who-is-powerful \ntest, not a test about who has the most to gain from this budget, but \nwho might have to most to lose, and one of those groups, I would argue, \nis our children.\n  When it comes to the SNAP program, according to Feeding America--\nanother great advocacy group--nearly half of all SNAP participants are \nchildren. And according to another organization we rely upon for \nanalysis, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, investments in \nSNAP lifted 2.1 million children out of poverty in 2013.\n  So why would we cut a program like that, that would \ndisproportionately and adversely impact our children? What do we gain \nfrom that as a country? What do we gain when fewer and fewer children \nare helped with a nutrition program that will make sure they have \nenough to eat?\n  In addition to SNAP, the Republican budget would roll back \nsignificant progress we have made for children who qualify for the \nchild tax credit or the earned-income tax credit. If the improvements \nto these credits are allowed to lapse, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities estimates that 1 million children will fall back into \npoverty. I think people in both parties would argue that these two--and \nmaybe especially the earned-income tax credit--are one of the best, \nsome would argue the best--the best--poverty reduction strategies we \nhave ever had in place in our policy.\n  I think if the earned-income tax credit is keeping children out of \npoverty, we should make sure it remains in place and remains a tax \nstrategy that can help prevent 1 million children from falling back \ninto poverty.\n  We should also be using the Tax Code to help working families rise \ninto the middle class, those families who may not be there yet but can \nrise into the middle class. But instead, the Republican budget does \nnothing to prevent tax increases, averaging $1,100 for 12 million \nfamilies and students paying for college, and $9,000 for 16 million \nworking families with children. That makes no sense for those families \nor for those children.\n  As many as 486,000 Pennsylvania families could benefit from the \nearned-income tax credit, the child tax credit and the opportunity tax \ncredit of 2015--all good ideas, all impacted adversely by the budget.\n  Finally, I will conclude with Medicaid. Medicaid for some people is \nsome program far away that they don't think affects their lives. A lot \nof families--lower income families, middle-class families, even--\nbenefit from the long-term care part of Medicaid. A lot of families may \nnot know that Medicaid is the reason that their mother, father, or \nloved one could be in a nursing home.\n  What does it mean for kids? Medicaid for so many children, millions \nof them, is the only health care they have. The good news is that it is \nvery good health care for a lot of children. They get access to early \nperiodic screening and diagnostic testing. So they get the screening \nand the testing they need so we can provide the kind of health care \nthat child needs, but we cannot provide unless we do that screening for \nthose children. It provides quality health care for millions of \nchildren in the country. We should remember that when people make \nproposals around here to slash Medicaid, some by hundreds of billions \nof dollars over the next decade, that it is a direct hit--a direct hit \non children.\n  Based on calculations from the White House, the Republican budget \nproposal would block-grant Medicaid funding to Pennsylvania by more \nthan $41 billion over 10 years. I don't know how the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania or any State is going is to be better off when Medicaid is \nblock-granted, sent back to the States, hoping--just hoping--that maybe \nthe States can pick up the cost. That makes no sense. Our State is \ngoing to be worse off if we lose $40 billion, or even a number lower \nthan that, over the next 10 years on Medicaid.\n  By one estimate last fall, 47 percent of children who live in rural \nareas are the beneficiaries of either Medicaid or the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. So when those folks talk about cutting Medicaid or \nnot doing what I hope we can do--which is to extend the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program for the next 4 years, not only 2--they should \nremember that 47 percent of rural children benefit from those programs.\n  When it comes to Medicaid, children may only make up 20 percent of \nthe cost of Medicaid, but half of the enrollees in Medicaid are \nchildren. So they might only be 20 percent of the cost, but they are \nhalf of the enrollees.\n  We know that Medicaid was created 50 years ago. The government put \nforth a promise, which is somewhat of the test I started with about \nchildren in the dawn of their life. The promise was to ensure that the \nmost vulnerable members of society had access to health care, a pretty \nsimple promise and pretty easy to understand our obligation when we \nrecite that promise.\n  So whether it is our kids, whether it is older Americans who need to \nget nursing home care, or whether it is Americans and many of them \nchildren with disabilities, Medicaid ensures that access to health \ncare. Medicaid is the promise we must keep to folks who need nursing \nhome care, to children\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\nwho are poor and may not have health insurance without Medicaid, and of \ncourse to individuals with disabilities. So we have a long way to go to \nprove that we are keeping that promise.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with some thoughts about the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. We all know this is not only a \nbipartisan program but a very successful program. From 1997, when it \nwas enacted, to the year 2012, the uninsured rate for children fell by \nhalf--from 14 percent to 7 percent--across the country, a remarkable \nachievement. It means we are not there yet because we still have 7 \npercent who are uninsured, but that is a substantial step forward and a \nsubstantial measure of progress for the country.\n  This program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, along with \nMedicaid, is helping to reduce disparity in health coverage affecting \nlow-income children across the country. Without legislative action to \nextend funding beyond September 30 of this year, over 10 million \nchildren across America are at risk of losing their comprehensive, \naffordable--I will say that again, comprehensive and affordable quality \ncare, including, by one estimate, 270,000 children in Pennsylvania. \nAbout 2 million of the children currently enrolled in CHIP would likely \nend up uninsured while the others would face higher premiums and higher \nout-of-pocket costs. We should do the right thing and make sure we have \nfunding in place for 4 years for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, not just 2 years.\n  Unfortunately, what we are hearing from the proposal sent to us from \nthe House is that the 4-year commitment is only 2 years. So we have a \nlot of work to do. I believe the right thing to do on CHIP is to enact \nwhat Senate Democrats have proposed--a 4-year so-called clean extension \nof the Children's Health Insurance Program as soon as possible, and \nthat is S. 522. That would be the right thing to do.\n  We can give speeches and talk a lot about how we all support kids, \nand it is nice to say that and it is nice to vote once in a while for \nprograms and strategies that help kids, but I believe the test is a lot \ntougher than that. The test will come on this budget vote--a test on \nwhether we support children. If we are cutting Medicaid by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over the next 10 years, if we are cutting the SNAP \nprogram by tens of billions of dollars or more, maybe even higher than \nthat over the next 10 years, and if we are not doing the right thing on \nchildren's health insurance--and I could go down a longer list--then we \nare not doing what we need to do for children. They don't have \nlobbyists, they don't give campaign contributions, they don't have \npower, and they may be voiceless, but we have an obligation in both \nparties and in both Houses to be their voice. But I am afraid we are \nheaded down a road with a budget that harms children substantially, and \nI hope that over the next couple of days we will make the right \ndecisions for our children.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. I \nbelieve this is a critical defense acquisition program which will \ngreatly strengthen not only our national security, but that of our \nclosest allies and partners.\n  The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program began more than 20 years ago. \nIn an age where emerging technologies are introduced daily and where we \nhave become accustomed to instant gratification, we sometimes grow \nimpatient with how long it takes to achieve war-winning capabilities--\nand we should. Yet today, the F-35 stands on the threshold of being \nused effectively and decisively in operational missions.\n  During its journey, the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office has \nencountered its fair share of setbacks, and--at times--faulty \nleadership decisions by those in government as well as those in the \nprivate sector. From the Pentagon itself, we heard the accusation of \n``acquisition malpractice.''\n  The senior Senator from Arizona, John McCain, has repeatedly pointed \nout these shortfalls and missteps. I echo his frustrations.\n  In response to the accusations and grievances about the F-35 program, \none could have just thrown one's hands up in frustration. Yet through \nthe renewed determination of the F-35's Joint Strike Program Office \nunder the leadership of Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, what once was the \nposter child for acquisition reform has reached vital milestones and \nwill soon be used by our combat forces.\n  During his tenure, General Bogdan has demanded and achieved greater \nperformance and accountability among his own staff and his industry \npartners. He has established and is executing a corrective plan. With \nthat said, there is still much more to do. The problems General Bogdan \nand the collective F-35 team are overcoming did not occur in an \ninstant, nor will they be fixed in an instant.\n  Accordingly, today, I call on my colleagues to support the F-35 and \nprovide the F-35 Program Office with the backing it needs to achieve \ncritical future milestones.\n  In addition, the Congress must continue to challenge the Department, \nthe F-35 Program Office, and the program's industrial partners to \nreduce not only each aircraft's initial purchase price, but the cost of \nusing and maintaining this strike fighter in the decades that follow. \nAs history teaches us, upwards of 80 percent of the total ownership \ncosts of a weapon system resides not in the purchase price, but in its \nuse and resulting maintenance. This means the Department must pay \ncritical attention now to the development and execution of a robust F-\n35 sustainment strategy to ensure long term costs are reduced.\n  We must also not forget the current purchase price of the F-35 \nexceeds $110 million per aircraft. It is inevitable that the price of \nthe F-35 will come down as the numbers of aircraft produced goes up. \nBut the quest for price reduction must be central to our current and \nfuture efforts if we are to be able to procure the number of aircraft \nrequired to properly execute our deterrent strategies and, if \nnecessary, war plans. Indeed, price will have a dramatic effect on the \nability of our allies to purchase the F-35. Therefore, I challenge both \nthe Department and our defense contractors to work toward achieving \nwhat many experts agree is an obtainable goal: a procurement price of \nless than $80 million per aircraft, and as close to $60 million per \naircraft as possible. If we do this, the current program of record for \nmore than 3,000 aircraft will naturally increase. My personal desire \nwould be to see over 6,000 of these aircraft safeguarding our precious \nliberties and those of our allies.\n  This is an ambitious objective, but it is based upon achieving what \nis best for America and its allies. And I believe everyone in the \nDepartment of Defense, the F-35 Program Office, and, yes, the employees \nof our Nation's defense contractors have this as their central goal.\n  Therefore, I am reminded of a story from our history about the \nindustrialist Collis Potter Huntington. He was one of the so-called \n``Big Four'' of the western railroads during the late 1800s and built \nthe Central Pacific Railroad as part of the first transcontinental \nrailroad. He also led and developed other interstate lines such as the \nSouthern Pacific Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, known \nsimply as the C As Huntington furthered the C's extension through \nthe Virginia peninsula, he opened the pathway for West Virginia's coal \nindustry to reach the coal piers in the harbor of Hampton Roads. Seeing \na need for export shipping, he started the Newport News Shipbuilding \nand Drydock Company in 1886.\n  Huntington started a long tradition of superb shipbuilding, and he is \nalso credited with giving the shipyard its motto. The motto simply \nstates: ``We will build good ships here. At a profit if we can. At a \nloss if we must. But always good ships.'' This motto is emblazoned on a \nplaque and fixed to a granite monument at one of the entrances to the \nyard. This motto defined the mindset of generations of ship builders at \nthe yard.\n  In 1968, the privately held Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock \nCompany merged with another company. Thereafter, the ``Good Ship'' \nmonument was removed due to its misalignment with the ``new'' company's \ngoals.\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\nAs a testament to the character of the workers who built many of our \nNation's great warships, the shipyard almost came to a standstill, \nleading to the monument's eventual return.\n  The ``Good Ship'' motto is a lesson for us all, but especially for \nthe F-35 Program Office and its industry partners. We should all rally \naround a ``Good Strike Fighter'' motto. After all, these jets are being \nbuilt for our men and women in uniform, to protect our rights and \nliberties as well as those of our allies.\n  The fighting spirit of the United States and her allies can enable \nthe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to emerge from its challenges like the \nmythical phoenix: reborn, regenerated and renewed. But for this to \nsucceed, we must commit ourselves to excellence--in essence, the ``Good \nStrike Fighter'' motto. The war fighter, the American people, our \nallies and partners, and the whole free world are depending on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1778-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and \nWater Development be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                National Nuclear Security Administration\n\n       We're here today to review the president's fiscal year 2016 \n     budget request for the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration, which is a semi-autonomous agency within the \n     Department of Energy that is responsible for managing our \n     nuclear weapons stockpile, reducing global dangers posed by \n     weapons of mass destruction, and providing the Navy with safe \n     and effective nuclear propulsion.\n       This is the subcommittee's third hearing this year on the \n     president's budget request, and I look forward to hearing our \n     witnesses' testimony.\n       The NNSA, has an important national security mission, but \n     faces many challenges. That's why we need to do what we were \n     sent here to do--to govern.\n       Governing is about setting priorities, and we are going to \n     have to make some hard decisions this year to make sure the \n     highest priorities are funded.\n       The president's 2016 budget request for defense spending is \n     about $38 billion higher than what is allowed under the \n     spending caps in the Budget Control Act.\n       In fact, if spending this year is consistent with the \n     Budget Control Act, fully funding NNSA's budget request alone \n     would require almost the entire increase in defense spending \n     for all defense programs--including the Department of \n     Defense.\n       We will work with Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski to \n     increase the subcommittee's defense spending allocation, but \n     we're going to need your help to understand the NNSA's most \n     urgent priorities, and that is why we are holding this \n     hearing.\n       I'd like to focus my questions on three main areas, all \n     with an eye toward setting priorities:\n       Keeping large construction projects on time and on budget; \n     Senator Feinstein and I have worked pretty hard on that.\n       Effectively maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile; and\n       Supporting our nuclear Navy.\n       The NNSA is responsible for three of the largest \n     construction projects in the federal government: the Uranium \n     Processing Facility in Tennessee; the MOX Fuel Fabrication \n     Facility in South Carolina; and the Plutonium Facility in New \n     Mexico.\n       Combined, these projects could cost as much as $20 billion \n     dollars to build, and over the past four years, Senator \n     Feinstein and I have worked hard with the NNSA to keep costs \n     from skyrocketing and to make sure hard-earned taxpayer \n     dollars are spent wisely. We need to make sure these projects \n     are on time and on budget.\n       Senator Feinstein and I have focused much of our oversight \n     on the Uranium Processing Facility, because costs had \n     increased every time we would get a status update.\n       Three years ago, we began holding regular meetings with the \n     NNSA administrator and his team.\n       We said we wanted 90 percent design completed before we \n     began construction and urged the NNSA to take aggressive \n     steps to get costs under control.\n       The administrator asked Thom Mason, the laboratory director \n     for Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee to head a Red \n     Team to review the project. The result of that review may be \n     a model for how to keep these kinds of projects on time and \n     on budget.\n       The Red Team's report included 17 recommendations, nearly \n     all of which the NNSA has now adopted, to keep the uranium \n     facility within a $6.5 billion budget with completion by \n     2025.\n       Based on these recommendations, the Uranium Facility will \n     now consist of at least two buildings--one with high security \n     and one with less security--with construction of these \n     buildings to begin once their design is at 90 percent.\n       As I understand it, NNSA recently completed a portion of \n     the site preparation for this project under budget by $10 \n     million. That's a good start, but there's a lot more work to \n     be done.\n       I'm going to ask you more today about the uranium facility, \n     particularly about your schedule for completing the design \n     and when you anticipate construction can begin.\n       I also want to ask you about how you are applying the \n     lessons we learned from the Red Team Review Team and to the \n     other big construction projects, and look forward to any \n     updates you can provide.\n       General Klotz, I know you plan to go to Tennessee tomorrow \n     to see the progress on this project. I appreciate your hands-\n     on approach to making sure this important project is \n     delivered on time and on budget.\n       Another large portion of the budget request is the work \n     NNSA is doing to maintain our nuclear weapons stockpile, and \n     I want to make sure we are spending taxpayer dollars \n     effectively.\n       The budget request includes $1.3 billion to continue the \n     four ongoing life extension programs, which fix or replace \n     components in weapons systems to make sure they're safe and \n     reliable.\n       These life extension programs are needed but they are very \n     expensive, and I will ask you today whether you will be able \n     to meet your production deadlines on time and on budget.\n       Naval Reactors is responsible for all aspects of the \n     nuclear reactors that power submarines and aircraft carriers. \n     Naval Reactors is currently designing a new reactor core that \n     will not need to be refueled during the life of the ship.\n       This work will save taxpayers billions of dollars because \n     we won't have to build two extra submarines to make up for \n     those that are not in service when they are being refueled.\n       The small nuclear reactors that Naval Reactors designs have \n     had an impeccable safety record for more than 60 years; there \n     has never been a reactor accident.\n       I also want to hear more about your plans for storing the \n     Navy's used nuclear fuel.\n       We talked a lot in our hearing last week with the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission about Yucca Mountain and storing used \n     nuclear fuel from commercial reactors, and I'd like to hear \n     from you how this issue impacts your operations.\n       With that, I would recognize Senator Feinstein to make her \n     opening statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1778-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1778-S1779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LINDA HODGDON\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I congratulate New Hampshire \ncommissioner of administrative services Linda Hodgdon on her retirement \nand to recognize her nearly 30 years of dedicated public service to New \nHampshire and our Nation.\n  Commissioner Hodgdon has distinguished herself as an extraordinary \npublic servant. Linda's administrative and analytic talent, commitment \nto the prudent use of tax dollars, and her exceptional work ethic \nresulted in her holding increasingly challenging and responsible \npositions throughout New Hampshire's State government. She started her \nservice in 1985 as a financial analyst in the Governor's office, and \nhas since served in various positions with the Department of \nTransportation, Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the \nDepartment of Justice. In 2008 she was appointed to serve as the \ncommissioner of the Department of Administrative Services. Throughout \nher career serving the people of New Hampshire, Linda has earned a \nreputation for her exemplary commitment to fulfilling the fiduciary \nduty we all have to spend tax dollars wisely, and she has worked to \nboost efficiency and increase accountability.\n  On a personal note, I had the opportunity to work with Linda when she \nserved as the director of administration for the New Hampshire \nDepartment of Justice from 2004 to 2006. During my tenure as attorney \ngeneral I came to value and greatly appreciate Linda's work managing \nour budget and many other administrative functions within the office. \nHer skill, dedication, and hard work played an integral role in the \nsuccess the office enjoyed. When Linda took on a task you knew it would \nbe done thoroughly, professionally, and on time. Linda was a trusted \nmember of my leadership team, who was greatly appreciated by all of the \nmembers of the office.\n  As Commissioner Hodgdon retires from public service, I commend her on \na job well done. The government of the State of New Hampshire and the \nlives of the people of our State are better off because of her \nexemplary service. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nLinda for her service and wishing Linda, her husband Mark, and their \ndaughter well in all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1779-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN ANDY BLOMME, COMMANDER DANIEL WALSH, AND LIEUTENANT \n                        COMMANDER ROBERT POTTER\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to establish a new organization to manage nuclear \nwaste, provide a consensual process for siting nuclear waste \nfacilities, ensure adequate funding for managing nuclear waste, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Nuclear Waste Administration Act, a bill to establish a \nnational nuclear waste policy.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which has been years in the making, is \nalso cosponsored by Senators Maria Cantwell, Lisa Murkowski, and Lamar \nAlexander.\n  This legislation represents our best attempt to establish a workable, \nlong term nuclear waste policy for the United States, something our \nNation lacks today. It does so by implementing the unanimous \nrecommendations of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear \nFuture.\n  First, the bill would create a new independent entity, the Nuclear \nWaste Administration, with the sole purpose of managing nuclear waste.\n  Second, the bill would authorize the siting and construction of two \ntypes of waste facilities: permanent repositories for disposal and \ninterim facilities for storage, including a pilot facility prioritizing \nwaste from shut down reactors.\n  Third, the bill creates a consent-based siting process for both \nstorage facilities and repositories, based on other countries' \nsuccessful efforts.\n  The legislation requires that local, tribal, and State governments \nmust consent to host waste facilities by signing incentive agreements, \nassuring that waste is only stored in the States and communities that \nwant and welcome it.\n  Fourth, the bill would resume collection of the nuclear waste \nmanagement fees from nuclear power ratepayers at a rate of \\1/10\\ of a \ncent per kilowatt-hour, or about $750 million annually, and would \nrededicate these revenues to the Nuclear Waste Administration to fund \nconstruction of waste facilities.\n  Finally, the legislation ensures the Nuclear Waste Administration \nwill be held accountable for meeting Federal responsibilities and \nstewarding Federal dollars.\n  The Nuclear Waste Administrator will be appointed by the president \nand confirmed by the Senate. The administration will be overseen by a \nfive-member Nuclear Waste Oversight Board, modeled on the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board and will have an Inspector General. The \nadministration will collect fees from nuclear utilities to pay for the \ndevelopment of storage and disposal facilities; those fees will be \nimmediately available without appropriation, unless otherwise limited \nin an appropriations or authorization act. The current balance of the \nNuclear Waste Fund, now valued at $32 billion, will be available by \nappropriation only. Finally, if the agency fails to open a nuclear \nwaste facility by 2025, fees paid by utilities will cease to be \ncollected.\n  The United States has 99 operating commercial nuclear power reactors \nthat supply \\1/5\\ of our electricity and \\3/5\\ of our emissions-free \npower.\n  However, production of this nuclear power has a significant downside: \nit produces nuclear waste that will take hundreds of thousands of years \nto decay. Unlike most nuclear nations, the United States has no program \nto consolidate waste in centralized facilities.\n  Instead, we leave the waste next to operating and shut down reactors \nsitting in pools of water or in cement and steel dry casks. Today, \nnearly 74,000 metric tons of nuclear waste is stored at commercial \nreactor sites. This total grows by about 2,000 metric tons each year.\n  In addition to commercial nuclear waste, we must also address waste \ngenerated from having created our nuclear weapons stockpile and from \npowering our Navy.\n  The byproducts of nuclear energy represent some of the nation's most \nhazardous materials, but for decades we have failed to find a solution \nfor their safe storage and permanent disposal. Most experts agree that \nthis failure is not a scientific problem or an engineering \nimpossibility; it is a failure of government.\n  Although the Federal Government signed contracts committing to pick \nup commercial waste beginning in 1998, this waste program has failed to \ntake possession of a single fuel assembly.\n  Our government has not honored its contractual obligations. We are \nroutinely sued, and we routinely lose. So today, the taxpayer is paying \npower plants to store the waste at reactor sites all over the Nation. \nThis has cost us $4.5 billion so far, and our liability continues to \ngrow each day. The lack of action is estimated to cost taxpayers \nanother $22.6 billion between now and 2065 if the government can start \ntaking possession of waste in 2021. Further delays will only increase \nthese costs.\n  We simply cannot tolerate continued inaction.\n  In January 2012, the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear \nFuture completed a 2-year comprehensive study and published unanimous \nrecommendations for fixing our Nation's broken nuclear waste management \nprogram.\n  The commission found that the only long-term, technically feasible \nsolution for this waste is to dispose of it in a permanent underground \nrepository. Until such a facility is opened, which will take many \ndecades, spent nuclear fuel will continue to be an expensive, dangerous \nburden.\n  That is why the commission also recommended that we establish an \ninterim storage facility program to begin consolidating this dangerous \nwaste, in addition to working on a permanent repository.\n  Finally, after studying the experience of all nuclear nations, the \ncommission found that siting these facilities is most likely to succeed \nif the host States and communities are welcome and willing partners, \nnot adversaries. The commission recommended that we adopt a consent \nbased nuclear facility siting process.\n  Senators Alexander, Murkowski, Cantwell, and I introduce this \nlegislation in order to begin implementing those recommendations, \nputting us on a dual track toward interim and permanent storage \nfacilities. The bipartisan bill is the product of thoughtful \ncollaboration, building on our work last Congress with Senator Wyden \nand before that with former Senator Bingaman in the 112th Congress.\n  In my view, one of the most important provisions in this legislation \nis the pilot program to immediately begin consolidating nuclear waste \nat safer, more cost-efficient centralized facilities on an interim \nbasis. The legislation will facilitate interim storage of nuclear waste \nin above-ground canisters called dry casks. These facilities would be \nlocated in willing communities, away from population centers, and on \nthoroughly assessed sites.\n  Some members of Congress argue that we should ignore the need for \ninterim storage sites and instead push forward with a plan to open \nYucca Mountain as a permanent storage site.\n  Others argue that we should push forward only with repository plans \nin new locations.\n  But the debate over Yucca Mountain, a controversial waste repository \nproposed in the Nevada desert, which lacks State approval, is unlikely \nto be settled any time soon.\n  I believe the debate over a permanent repository does not need to be \nsettled in order to recognize the need for interim storage. Even if \nCongress and a future president reverse course and move forward with \nYucca Mountain, interim storage facilities would still be an essential \ncomponent of a badly needed national nuclear waste strategy.\n  By creating interim storage sites, a top recommendation of the Blue \nRibbon Commission, we would begin reducing the federal liability while \nproviding\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nbreathing room to site and build a permanent repository.\n  Interim storage facilities are of particular importance for the sites \nof decommissioned power plants that are maintained solely to store the \nspent nuclear fuel. In the last fourteen months alone, four nuclear \npower plants have been taken out of service: the Crystal River plant in \nFlorida, the Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin, the San Onofre plant in \nCalifornia, and the Vermont Yankee plant in Vermont.\n  Until there is an interim storage facility for this waste, these \nsites will join the likes of Rancho Seco and Humboldt Bay, which \nstopped operating in the 1980s but continue to store spent nuclear \nfuel. All told, there are more than 6,500 metric tons of nuclear waste \nstored at sites that no longer have operating reactors.\n  Interim storage facilities could also provide alternative storage \nlocations in emergency situations, if spent nuclear fuel ever needs to \nbe moved quickly from a reactor site.\n  Both short- and long-term storage programs are vital.\n  Because of the long timeline for permanent facilities, interim \nstorage facilities allow us to achieve significant cost savings for \ntaxpayers and utility ratepayers and finally start the process of \nsecuring waste from decommissioned plants by finally removing waste \nfrom the sites of decommissioned power plants.\n  One thing is certain: inaction is the most costly and least safe \noption.\n  Our longstanding stalemate is costly to taxpayers, utility ratepayers \nand communities that are involuntarily saddled with waste after local \nnuclear power plants have shut down.\n  It leaves nuclear waste all over the country, stored in all different \nways.\n  It is long overdue for the government to honor its obligation to \nsafely dispose of the nation's nuclear waste--and this bipartisan bill \nis the way to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1784-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 108--COMMEMORATING THE DISCOVERY OF THE POLIO VACCINE \n            AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO ERADICATE THE DISEASE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. \nMurray, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Coons, Mr. Markey, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Ayotte, and \nMr. Reed) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Res. 109\n\n       Whereas in the mid-19th century, the Guano Islands Act (48 \n     U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) enabled companies from the United States \n     to mine guano from a number of islands in the Equatorial \n     Pacific;\n       Whereas after several decades, when the guano was depleted, \n     the companies abandoned mining activities, and the control of \n     the islands by the United States diminished and left the \n     islands vulnerable to exploitation by other nations;\n       Whereas the Far East during the late 19th century and early \n     20th century was characterized by colonial conflicts and \n     Japanese expansionism;\n       Whereas the 1930s marked the apex of the sphere of \n     influence of Imperial Japan in the Far East;\n       Whereas military and commercial interest in Central Pacific \n     air routes between Australia and California led to a desire \n     by the United States to claim the islands of Howland, Baker, \n     and Jarvis, although the ownership of the islands was \n     unclear;\n       Whereas in 1935, a secret Department of Commerce \n     colonization plan was instituted, aimed at placing citizens \n     of the United States as colonists on the remote islands of \n     Howland, Baker, and Jarvis;\n       Whereas to avoid conflicts with international law, which \n     prevented colonization by active military personnel, the \n     United States sought the participation of furloughed military \n     personnel and Native Hawaiian civilians in the colonization \n     project;\n       Whereas William T. Miller, Superintendent of Airways at the \n     Department of Commerce, was appointed to lead the \n     colonization project, traveled to Hawaii in February 1935, \n     met with Albert F. Judd, Trustee of Kamehameha Schools and \n     the Bishop Museum, and agreed that recent graduates and \n     students of the Kamehameha School for Boys would make ideal \n     colonists for the project;\n       Whereas the ideal Hawaiian candidates were candidates who \n     could ``fish in the native manner, swim excellently, handle a \n     boat, be disciplined, friendly, and unattached'';\n       Whereas on March 30, 1935, the United States Coast Guard \n     Cutter Itasca departed from Honolulu Harbor in great secrecy \n     with 6 young Hawaiian men aboard, all recent graduates of \n     Kamehameha Schools, and 12 furloughed Army personnel, whose \n     purpose\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\n     was to occupy the barren islands of Howland, Baker, and \n     Jarvis in teams of 5 for 3 months;\n       Whereas in June 1935, after a successful first tour, the \n     furloughed Army personnel were ordered off the islands and \n     replaced with additional Kamehameha Schools alumni, thus \n     leaving the islands under the exclusive occupation of the 4 \n     Native Hawaiians on each island;\n       Whereas the duties of the colonists while on the island \n     were to record weather conditions, cultivate plants, maintain \n     a daily log, record the types of fish that were caught, \n     observe bird life, and collect specimens for the Bishop \n     Museum;\n       Whereas the successful year-long occupation by the \n     colonists directly enabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt to \n     issue Executive Order 7368 on May 13, 1936, which proclaimed \n     that the islands of Howland, Baker, and Jarvis were under the \n     jurisdiction of the United States;\n       Whereas multiple Federal agencies vied for the right to \n     administer the colonization project, including the Department \n     of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and the Navy \n     Department, but jurisdiction was ultimately granted to the \n     Department of the Interior;\n       Whereas under the Department of the Interior, the \n     colonization project emphasized weather data and radio \n     communication, which brought about the recruitment of a \n     number of Asian radiomen and aerologists;\n       Whereas under the Department of the Interior, the \n     colonization project also expanded beyond the Kamehameha \n     Schools to include Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians from other \n     schools in Hawaii;\n       Whereas in March of 1938 the United States also claimed and \n     colonized the islands of Canton and Enderbury, maintaining \n     that the colonization was in furtherance of commercial \n     aviation and not for military purposes;\n       Whereas the risk of living on the remote islands meant that \n     emergency medical care was not less than 5 days away, and the \n     distance proved fatal for Carl Kahalewai, who died on October \n     8, 1938, en route to Honolulu after his appendix ruptured on \n     Jarvis island;\n       Whereas other life-threatening injuries occurred, including \n     in 1939, when Manuel Pires had appendicitis, and in 1941, \n     when an explosion severely burned Henry Knell and Dominic \n     Zagara;\n       Whereas in 1940, when the issue of discontinuing the \n     colonization project was raised, the Navy acknowledged that \n     the islands were ``probably worthless to commercial \n     aviation'' but advocated for ``continued occupation'' because \n     the islands could serve as ``bases from a military \n     standpoint'';\n       Whereas although military interests justified continued \n     occupation of the islands, the colonists were never informed \n     of the true nature of the project, nor were the colonists \n     provided with weapons or any other means of self-defense;\n       Whereas in June of 1941, when much of Europe was engaged in \n     World War II and Imperial Japan was establishing itself in \n     the Pacific, the Commandant of the 14th Naval District \n     recognized the ``tension in the Western Pacific'' and \n     recommended the evacuation of the colonists, but his request \n     was denied;\n       Whereas on December 8, 1941, Howland Island was attacked by \n     a fleet of Japanese twin-engine bombers, and the attack \n     killed Hawaiian colonists Joseph Keliihananui and Richard \n     Whaley;\n       Whereas in the ensuing weeks, Japanese submarine and \n     military aircraft continued to target the islands of Howland, \n     Baker, and Jarvis, jeopardizing the lives of the remaining \n     colonists;\n       Whereas the United States Government was unaware of the \n     attacks on the islands, and was distracted by the entry of \n     the United States into World War II;\n       Whereas the colonists demonstrated great valor while \n     awaiting retrieval;\n       Whereas the 4 colonists from Baker and the 2 remaining \n     colonists from Howland were rescued on January 31, 1942, and \n     the 8 colonists from Jarvis and Enderbury were rescued on \n     February 9, 1942, 2 months after the initial attacks on \n     Howland Island;\n       Whereas on March 20, 1942, Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of \n     the Interior, sent letters of condolence to the Keliihananui \n     and Whaley families stating that ``[i]n your bereavement it \n     must be considerable satisfaction to know that your brother \n     died in the service of his country'';\n       Whereas during the 7 years of colonization, more than 130 \n     young men participated in the project, the majority of whom \n     were Hawaiian, and all of whom made numerous sacrifices, \n     endured hardships, and risked their lives to secure and \n     maintain the islands of Howland, Baker, Jarvis, Canton, and \n     Enderbury on behalf of the United States, and 3 young \n     Hawaiian men made the ultimate sacrifice;\n       Whereas none of the islands, except for Canton, were ever \n     used for commercial aviation, but the islands were used for \n     military purposes;\n       Whereas in July 1943, a military base was established on \n     Baker Island, and its forces, which numbered over 2,000 \n     members, participated in the Tarawa-Makin operation;\n       Whereas in 1956, participants of the colonization project \n     established an organization called ``Hui Panala'au'', which \n     was established to preserve the fellowship of the group, to \n     provide scholarship assistance, and ``to honor and esteem \n     those who died as colonists of the Equatorial Islands'';\n       Whereas in 1979, Canton and Enderbury became part of the \n     republic of Kiribati, but the islands of Jarvis, Howland, and \n     Baker remain possessions of the United States, having been \n     designated as National Wildlife Refuges in 1974;\n       Whereas the islands of Jarvis, Howland, and Baker are now \n     part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument;\n       Whereas May 13, 2015, marks the 79th anniversary of the \n     issuance of the Executive Order of President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt proclaiming United States jurisdiction over the \n     islands of Howland, Baker, and Jarvis, islands that remain \n     possessions of the United States; and\n       Whereas the Federal Government has never fully recognized \n     the contributions and sacrifices of the colonists, less than \n     a handful of whom are still alive today: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the accomplishments and commends the \n     service of the Hui Panala'au colonists;\n       (2) acknowledges the local, national, and international \n     significance of the 7-year colonization project, which \n     resulted in the United States extending sovereignty into the \n     Equatorial Pacific;\n       (3) recognizes the dedication to the United States and \n     self-reliance demonstrated by the young men, the majority of \n     whom were Native Hawaiian, who left their homes and families \n     in Hawaii to participate in the Equatorial Pacific \n     colonization project;\n       (4) extends condolences on behalf of the United States to \n     the families of Carl Kahalewai, Joseph Keliihananui, and \n     Richard Whaley for the loss of their loved ones in the \n     service of the United States;\n       (5) honors the young men whose actions, sacrifices, and \n     valor helped secure and maintain the jurisdiction of the \n     United States over equatorial islands in the Pacific Ocean \n     during the years leading up to and the months immediately \n     following the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the entry of the \n     United States into World War II; and\n       (6) extends to all of the colonists, and to the families of \n     these exceptional young men, the deep appreciation of the \n     people of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1785-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1785-S1786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 110--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ABOUT A \n  STRATEGY FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND \n                          CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER (for herself, Mr. Booker, Ms. Ayotte, and Mr. Schatz) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 110\n\n       Whereas the Internet of Things currently connects tens of \n     billions of devices worldwide and has the potential to \n     generate trillions of dollars in economic opportunity;\n       Whereas increased connectivity can empower consumers in \n     nearly every aspect of their daily lives, including in the \n     fields of agriculture, education, energy, healthcare, public \n     safety, security, and transportation, to name just a few;\n       Whereas businesses across our economy can simplify \n     logistics, cut costs in supply chains, and pass savings on to \n     consumers because of the Internet of Things and innovations \n     derived from it;\n       Whereas the United States should strive to be a world \n     leader in smart cities and smart infrastructure to ensure its \n     citizens and businesses, in both rural and urban parts of the \n     country, have access to the safest and most resilient \n     communities in the world;\n       Whereas the United States is the world leader in developing \n     the Internet of Things technology, and with a strategy \n     guiding both public and private entities, the United States \n     will continue to produce breakthrough technologies and lead \n     the world in innovation;\n       Whereas the evolution of the Internet of Things is a \n     nascent market, the future direction of which holds much \n     promise;\n       Whereas the Internet of Things represents a wide range of \n     technologies that are governed by various laws, policies, and \n     governmental entities; and\n       Whereas coordination between all stakeholders of the \n     Internet of Things on relevant developments, impediments, and \n     achievements is a vital ingredient to the continued \n     advancement of pioneering technology: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should develop a strategy to \n     incentivize the development of the Internet of Things in a \n     way that maximizes the promise connected technologies hold to \n     empower consumers, foster future economic growth, and improve \n     our collective social well-being;\n       (2) the United States should prioritize accelerating the \n     development and deployment of the Internet of Things in a way \n     that recognizes its benefits, allows for future innovation, \n     and responsibly protects against misuse;\n       (3) the United States should recognize the importance of \n     consensus-based best practices and communication among \n     stakeholders, with the understanding that businesses can play \n     an important role in the future development of the Internet \n     of Things;\n       (4) the United States Government should commit itself to \n     using the Internet of Things to improve its efficiency and \n     effectiveness\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\n     and cut waste, fraud, and abuse whenever possible; and\n       (5) using the Internet of Things, innovators in the United \n     States should commit to improving the quality of life for \n     future generations by developing safe, new technologies aimed \n     at tackling the most challenging societal issues facing the \n     world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/24/senate-section/article/S1786-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1786-S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 349.

SPENDING-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO \n                   UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES OF THE NATIONAL \n                   AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR \n                   POTENTIAL USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     (NASA) is the ninth largest real property holder of the \n     Federal Government, with more than 123,000 acres and 4,819 \n     buildings and other structures with a replacement value of \n     more than $32,700,000,000.\n       (2) The annual operation and maintenance costs of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration have increased \n     steadily, and, as of November 2014, the Administration had \n     more than $3,350,000,000 in deferred annual maintenance \n     costs.\n       (3) According to Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the \n     Administration continues to retain real property that is \n     underutilized, does not have identified future mission uses, \n     or is duplicative of other assets in its real property \n     inventory.\n       (4) The Office of Inspector General, the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress have identified the \n     aging and duplicative infrastructure of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration as a high priority and \n     longstanding management challenge.\n       (5) In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, Congress \n     directed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to \n     examine its real property assets and downsize to fit current \n     and future missions and expected funding levels, paying \n     particular attention to identifying and removing unneeded or \n     duplicative infrastructure.\n       (6) The Office of Inspector General found at least 33 \n     facilities, including wind tunnels, test stands, airfields, \n     and launch infrastructure, that were underutilized or for \n     which National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers \n     could not identify a future mission use and that the need for \n     these facilities have declined in recent years as a result of \n     changes in the mission focus of the Administration, the \n     condition and obsolescence of some facilities, and the advent \n     of alternative testing methods.\n       (7) The Office of Inspector General found that the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration has taken steps to \n     minimize the costs of continuing to maintain some of these \n     facilities by placing them in an inactive state or leasing \n     them to other parties.\n       (8) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a \n     series of initiatives underway that, in the judgment of the \n     Office of\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\n     Inspector General, are ``positive steps towards `rightsizing' \n     its real property footprint'', and the Office of Inspector \n     General has concluded that ``it is imperative that NASA move \n     forward aggressively with its infrastructure reduction \n     efforts''.\n       (9) Existing and emerging United States commercial launch \n     and exploration capabilities are providing cargo \n     transportation to the International Space Station and offer \n     the potential for providing crew support, access to the \n     International Space Station, and missions to low Earth orbit \n     while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     focuses its efforts on heavy-lift capabilities and deep space \n     missions.\n       (10) National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     facilities and property that are underutilized, duplicative, \n     or no longer needed for Administration requirements could be \n     utilized by commercial users and State and local entities, \n     resulting in savings for the Administration and a reduction \n     in the burden of the Federal Government to fund space \n     operations.\n       (b) Spending-neutral Reserve Fund.--The Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may revise the \n     allocations of a committee or committees, aggregates, and \n     other appropriate levels in this resolution for one or more \n     bills, joint resolutions, amendments, amendments between the \n     Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to \n     underutilized facilities of the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration and their potential use, which may \n     include actions described in subsection (c), by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not raise new revenue and would \n     not increase the deficit over either the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n       (c) Actions.--The actions referred to in this subsection \n     are--\n       (1) reduction of National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration infrastructure and, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, making Administration property available for \n     lease to a government or private tenant;\n       (2) pursuit of opportunities for streamlined sale or lease \n     of National Aeronautics and Space Administration property and \n     facilities, including for exclusive use, to a private entity, \n     or expedited conveyance or transfer to a State or political \n     subdivision, municipality, instrumentality of a State, or \n     Department of Transportation-licensed launch site operators \n     for the promotion of commercial or scientific space activity \n     and for developing and operating space launch facilities; and\n       (3) lease or transfer of underutilized National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration facilities and properties to \n     commercial space entities or State or local governments to \n     reduce operation and maintenance costs for the \n     Administration, save money for the Federal Government, and \n     promote commercial space and the exploration goals of the \n     Administration and the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 562.

Russian \n     troops in eastern Ukraine are supporting these offensive \n     operations with command and control systems, air defense \n     systems with advanced surface-to-air missiles, unmanned \n     aerial systems, advanced multiple rocket launcher systems, \n     and electronic warfare systems.'';\n       Whereas, on January 25, 2015, after Russian-backed rebels \n     attacked Mariupol, European Council President Donald Tusk \n     wrote, ``Once again appeasement encourages the aggressor to \n     greater acts of violence; time to step up our policy based on \n     cold facts, not illusions.'';\n       Whereas, on November 19, 2014, at a Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate confirmation hearing, Deputy National \n     Security Adviser Anthony Blinken stated that the provision of \n     defensive lethal assistance to the Government of Ukraine \n     ``remains on the table.
