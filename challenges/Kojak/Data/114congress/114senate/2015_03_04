Mr. President, construction of the Keystone Pipeline \nwould pump billions into our economy, it would support thousands of \njobs, and a bipartisan majority in both the House and Senate voted to \nsupport it.\n  Today the Senate will vote to support American jobs and \ninfrastructure one more time. It should be a no-brainer. For a long \ntime, projects like Keystone basically were no-brainers. They were \noften approved without much controversy at all. But that was before \npowerful special interests and ideological extremists decided to embark \non a quixotic crusade.\n  The implication that building Keystone would result in some sort of \napocalyptic cataclysm has always flown in the face of science. Even the \nassertion that Keystone would have significant impact on global climate \nignores the scientific findings of President Obama's own State \nDepartment; it said the environmental impact would be minimal.\n  The reality is that the energy resources in question are almost \ncertainly going to come out of the ground whether or not Keystone is \nbuilt. The real question here is whether we are going to allow \nKeystone's energy to help support middle-class jobs in America or \nwhether we will allow those jobs and energy to potentially be sent to \nhigh-polluting countries such as China. Deep-pocketed leftists and \nextremists appear to prefer the latter option.\n  By vetoing the bipartisan Keystone jobs bill, President Obama sided \nwith those moneyed special interests over the middle class, and it is \nstill unclear why. It can't be about protecting the climate because \nvetoing the bipartisan bill would hardly have an effect. It can't be \nabout protecting a broken review process the President himself broke \nlong ago because this bipartisan bill seeks to fix the review process. \nAnd it can't be about giving the President more time because he has \ndelayed this decision for years on end. Here is the only serious \nexplanation I can think of: President Obama is signaling to extreme \nspecial interests that his party is turning away from workers and \ntoward them.\n  We have seen how the President's veto has outraged some in the labor \nunion community. I know it makes some of our Democratic colleagues \npretty uncomfortable as well. I suspect that includes Democrats who \ndidn't support the Senate's initial passage of Keystone. I suspect it \nalso includes\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\nDemocrats who might otherwise support their leadership's unprecedented \nfilibuster of a veto-override motion.\n  I am urging every Democrat who still believes their party should be \nabout workers, not deep-pocketed special interests and extremists, to \njoin us. Vote for cloture. Vote to override. Keystone's bipartisan \ncoalition in the Senate is only a few votes shy of the two-thirds \nmajority we would need to override this partisan veto and bring \nKeystone's jobs here to America. And it is not too late to stop your \nparty from venturing down a path even further afield from the interests \nof American workers and the middle class. So join us. Together, let's \nsupport Keystone's American jobs and infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1264-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KING V. BURWELL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, across the street the Supreme Court \nwill hear arguments today in an important case. King v. Burwell is the \nlatest reminder of a law that is as unwieldy as it is unworkable--\nObamaCare.\n  ObamaCare has been one rolling disaster after another for middle-\nclass Americans. First, it attacked seniors by raiding Medicare to \nfinance more government spending. Then it canceled health plans for \nmany who had been told they would be able to keep the plans they liked. \nAnd who could forget the Web site debacle? The hits have kept on coming \never since--fewer choices, higher costs, increased tax burdens borne by \nthe middle class, and even more headaches at tax time. In fact, we now \nknow that the Obama administration sent inaccurate ObamaCare tax \ninformation to nearly 1 million people. America's middle class deserves \na lot better than the hurt of ObamaCare.\n  We have heard a lot of predictions about what might happen if the \nCourt finds for the plaintiffs in this case, but we have also seen \nRepublican ideas about how to help Americans who may be harmed again by \nObamaCare's broken promises. For instance, Republicans think it is \nbetter to give Americans and States the freedom to choose what is right \nfor them rather than trying to impose costly mandates from Washington \nsuch as ObamaCare.\n  Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my Republican colleagues because while \nObamaCare is a law that is all about higher costs and broken promises, \nRepublicans think health care should be about helping middle-class \nAmericans instead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1264-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, most of the issues that come before this \nbody are complex and nuanced. Rarely are we faced with simple issues. \nBut today we have a very simple, clear-cut issue before us. It is as \nstraightforward and clear-cut as any one question could be. Do you \nsupport American workers or do you not support American workers?\n  Under our law, workers have the right to unionize and have their \nvoices heard in the workplace. Through elections, workers choose for \nthemselves whether to form a union.\n  Last year the National Labor Relations Board took important steps to \nmodernize and streamline union election procedures--commonsense, simple \nadvancements. Rule changes are good for workers and good for \nbusinesses.\n  This whole fight isn't about business versus workers. We would have \nto search long and hard to find a business that opposes what the NLRB \ndid. It is all the anti-union rhetoric of the Republicans here in the \nSenate.\n  The reform that the NLRB pushed forward allows employers and unions \nto file forms electronically--kind of the modern world in which we all \nlive. It also allows communications with workers by email and cell \nphone--pretty reasonable, it sounds like to me. Yet today Senate \nRepublicans are trying to roll back rule changes instituted by the \nNLRB.\n  Later this afternoon we will vote on a resolution of disapproval to \nundo these commonsense reforms. Republicans think they are striking a \nblow against labor unions with votes like today's, but what they are \nreally doing is undermining American families.\n  American workers and their families have come to rely on many of the \nbenefits provided by collective bargaining: higher wages, safe working \nconditions, decent health care. It is no surprise that some of the most \nprosperous times in American history--namely, the middle 20th century--\ncame about in times of record union membership. Even today in my home \nState of Nevada, unions protect wages for casino employees on the Las \nVegas Strip, up at Lake Tahoe, and all over the State. We ensure \nthrough the unions safe working conditions--certainly for miners in \nElko and around the State--and also, with rare exception, quality \nhealth coverage for educators statewide.\n  So I want to be very clear. This is about whom the Republicans really \nare attacking, and it is the middle class. Each time Republicans throw \nroadblocks for workers to organize, they are weakening the middle \nclass.\n  I support American families. I support American workers. I support \nthe middle class. Senate Democrats support the middle class. We do not \nsupport this Republican attack on unions. We will vigorously fight any \nattempt to weaken worker protections, including today's resolution \nvote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1264-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will briefly comment on my friend the \nRepublican leader further trying to come to the floor once again to try \nto minimize the disastrous attacks on ObamaCare.\n  The House has voted 57 times to repeal that law. Each time, the \nresult is the same. As Albert Einstein said, the definition of insanity \nis someone who does something over and over again and gets the same \nresults. So it is insane what they have done in the House, and it is \nreally insane what they are trying to do here in the Senate.\n  There is no question about the case before the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe language is clear. Almost 10 million people will lose health \ninsurance. And we have seen in the press the last few days that very \nterrible things would happen to families if they lost their health \ncare. What my friend the Republican leader is talking about doing is \nturning it back to the insurance industry. If you had a preexisting \ndisability, no insurance. They set arbitrary limits as to how much they \nwould pay. It was a time of dread for families who were trying to \ninsure their boys and girls, mothers and fathers.\n  So I hope the Supreme Court will listen to the will of the American \npeople and the will of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives \nwhich passed this law. We all knew the intent of Congress. We still do. \nThe law is very clear, and the Supreme Court should follow the law.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1264-5", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 hours of debate remaining, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided between the minority \nand the majority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the median time today between when a union \nfiles an organizing petition and when employees vote on whether to \nunionize is 38 days, or just slightly over one month. Some 95 percent \nof all organizing elections take place less than 2 months after the \ndate an organizing petition is filed, and approximately 70 percent of \nthese elections are won by unions. All in all, I think anyone would \nagree that unions are doing pretty well and that this is a pretty fair \nprocess.\n  In fact, the current median time between union organizing petitions \nand union elections surpasses the goal set by the National Labor \nRelations Board itself. One would think it would be a classic case of \n``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.''\n  Apparently the Obama nominees on the National Labor Relations Board \ndon't agree. They proposed a new rule which will go into effect next \nmonth and that will drastically shorten the time between the initial \norganizing union petition and the union elections to anywhere from 11 \nto 22 days.\n  While the current situation, if anything, gives an advantage to \nunions, it also provides adequate time for employers to express any \nconcerns and for employees to hear the pros and cons of the union \nproposal. The new NLRB rule would remove these protections.\n  Businesses would have to respond to the union organizing petition \nwithin 7 days of its being filed, which would leave employers \nscrambling to research any arguments they want to bring up at the union \norganizing hearing. Small businesses, which frequently lack experience \ndealing with unions or in-house counsel to provide advice, would be hit \nparticularly hard by this rule.\n  But it is not just businesses that would suffer. Under the new rule \nemployees would have very little chance to research and consider the \nbenefits and drawbacks of joining a union. They would be forced into a \nhasty decision with little opportunity to change their minds later on.\n  In addition, the rule also presents substantial privacy concerns for \nemployees. Under the current system, employers already have to give \nunions employees' names and home addresses. The new rule would expand \nthat disclosure requirement to include employees' cell phone numbers, \nemail addresses, work schedules, and shift locations. Worse, the rule \ncontains no additional requirements for safeguarding that information \nor disposing of it appropriately. Given the ever-growing concerns about \nprivacy, it is astonishing that any employer would be forced to give up \nso much sensitive information without the explicit permission of his \nemployees.\n  This new rule is unfair to employers and it is unfair to workers. \nThere is a reason it is called the ambush elections rule. It would \nambush employers and employees alike. Unions would have unlimited time \nto organize, while employers would be given almost no time to present \ntheir concerns and exercise their free speech and due process \nrights. Employees would be pushed into making the long-term decision \nabout whether to join a union without all the facts.\n\n  Government should not be in the business of tilting the playing field \nin favor of unions at the expense of workers and businesses. The NLRB'S \nambush elections rule is unfair and undemocratic. I hope Congress will \npass the joint resolution of disapproval we are considering today, and \nI hope the President will sign it. The rights of American workers and \nbusinesses should not be sacrificed to the demands of unions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support S.J. Res. \n8. I thank my friend and colleague from Tennessee for bringing the \nresolution to the floor to disapprove the rule that the National Labor \nRelations Board has proposed that basically creates what are commonly \nreferred to as ambush elections for votes to create labor unions in \nworkplaces.\n  The concerns I have with this NLRB mandate is that it is another \ndraconian example of what I consider to be the hyperpartisan business \nand labor environment the National Labor Relations Board has created \nover the last several years. The NLRB is advancing a pro-union agenda \nnationwide in the guise of government policy. The NLRB's proposed \npolicy is simply not necessary, particularly in light of the fact that \nsome 70 percent of union organizing elections already succeed under the \nNLRB's current policy. Clearly the pro-union majority of the National \nLabor Relations Board is not satisfied with unions winning 70 percent \nof the time. They now want to run up the score so the unions win 100 \npercent of the time.\n  Many people, when they think about labor unions and organizing, think \nabout big business, but I am here to talk about the negative effect \nthis proposal will have on small businesses. A 50-employee operation or \na 250-employee operation, is a business that does not have the legal, \nfinancial, or administrative resources that a big business has to be \nable to react in the short timeframe the NLRB wants to mandate.\n  Today the median time for holding elections on labor union organizing \npetitions is about 38 days. This rule would bring that down to just 8 \ndays before an election would be required to be held. This would make \nit virtually impossible for the vast majority of America's small \nbusinesses to respond to the unionization effort and many of the \nemployees themselves who may not want to be unionized would be swept \naside by the compressed timeframe as well.\n  We have several examples of this in North Carolina, but rather than \nget into a lot of details, I will just explain why this new ambush \nelection rule is not needed.\n  The petitions to unionize workplaces are already handled \nexpeditiously. As I said, the average or median time for holding a vote \nis now 38 days. And again, the success rate for the unions is 70 \npercent. Let me say that again, 70 percent of the elections that are \nheld under the NLRB's current rules result in employees being \nunionized.\n  By turning elections into this sort of ambush will put small \nbusinesses at a severe disadvantage against the powerful unions \ntargeting them. For instance, take one small trucking company down in \nGreensboro, NC, that would suffer serious economic consequences if this \nrule goes into effect. Guy M. Turner, Inc. was founded by two brothers \nin 1924 and 90 years later it is still a family owned business \nemploying less than 250 people, clearly it is not a mega-corporation. \nYet, if the NLRB imposes this new rule, this family business will have: \nlittle time to obtain competent counsel to counter union targeting of \nthe company, little time to answer questions, marshal facts, or prepare \narguments to share with their employees regarding the potential \nconsequences and effects of unionization.\n  And if that were not bad enough, under the NLRB's new proposal, \nemployers would also be prohibited from expressing any views regarding \nthe unionization effort--thus essentially eliminating the employer's \nright to free speech regarding the potential adverse effects of \nunionization on the workplace and the company's future viability. \nHowever, the NLRB's new rule would impose no such restrictions on a big \nunion's right to speak in favor of unionization or the future benefits \nthey promise it will deliver.\n  A little common sense and a hard look at reality clearly demonstrates \nthat the regulations enforced today are working not only effectively, \nbut in favor of large unions most of the time. I hope Senators will \nsupport Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee chairman Lamar \nAlexander, and the thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of \nemployees, who oppose this regulation because it is an unnecessary and \nill-advised effort to tilt the playing field in the workplace totally \nin favor of the large labor unions and their efforts to unionize the \nAmerican workplace.\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time for the quorum call be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

My colleagues will see Republican and Democratic \nwomen coming to the floor.\n  As the senior woman and senior Democratic woman, I have convened over \nthe years a dinner among the women of the Senate. The purpose of the \ndinner was to create a zone of civility, to create camaraderie, as well \nas to see where we could work across the aisle to focus on a particular \nissue.\n  The women of the Senate do not have a caucus. There is no lockstep. \nWe discuss our different views on budgets and bottom lines and other \nissues. We discuss questions such as, What is the best way to approach \nthe deficit? What are all of the deficits in our country we are facing, \nnot only the fiscal deficit, but the deficit in research and \ndevelopment, and other deficits?\n  At one of our dinners we said, What is it that we want to work on \ntogether in this particular Congress? What is the issue that brings us \nall together across party lines that would have an impact on what we do \nat home, what would have an impact in our global community, and what \nwould have an impact particularly on women and children, girls and \nboys, around the world? That is what we decided we wanted to work on--\nthe despicable, vile issue of human trafficking. Human trafficking. \nThat means a whole organized network and networks to buy and sell human \nbeings as if they are a commodity, to buy and sell girls and to buy and \nsell little boys for the whole purpose of sexual exploitation.\n  This is an enormous issue. Many of our colleagues in the Senate have \nbeen working on authorizing legislation, and a great deal of it is \npending in the Judiciary Committee. We have joined together and asked \nthe Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on the major trafficking \nbills, and we thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for \nholding the hearing, as well as for joining with us in moving \nlegislation.\n  This is not just a woman's issue; this is a human rights issue. So we \nhave a Klobuchar-Cornyn bill. We have a Collins-Leahy effort. We are \nall working on this together. But it is we, the women of the Senate, \nwho continue to be a force to make sure we will focus on it within our \nown government and around the world. We will be looking at what are the \nmost significant efforts we can take.\n  The numbers are startling and discouraging. Twenty-one million people \nare trafficked globally every year--21 million people. It is the third \nlargest global crime--right up there with the selling of weapons of \nmass destruction, and right up there with selling drugs, and drug \ncartels. In fact, in many instances, it is the same organized crime \nnetwork. If someone is willing to sell a person and treat them as a \ncommodity, they are willing to sell drugs, they are willing to sell \nguns, they are willing to sell nuclear fissionable material. They are \nwilling to do anything.\n  This isn't just about recruiting girls in Asia or girls and women in \nCentral Europe; this is in our own country, where 800,000 people are \ntrafficked each year.\n  When I met with my FBI agents in Maryland and the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice to discuss this issue, they told me that the I-95 corridor is a \ncorridor for violence and trafficking and that we are a hotspot for \ntrafficking activities, because we have a seaport, we have a major \ninterstate highway, and we have big sporting events. Can my colleagues \nimagine such activity at sporting events such as the big games? The \nplayoffs that we so enjoy in Baltimore are also part of trafficking.\n  But we know our local law enforcement and our FBI are on the job. We \nhave programs such as Operation Cross Country. Last year, the FBI \nhelped recover close to 170 children who had been forced into \nprostitution, with simultaneous raids, and they put 281 pimps in jail.\n  We are going to take the first step. There are many bills pending \nwhere the women of the Senate have really thought about this, worked on \nthis, taken leadership on this, and they will talk about their various \nlegislative initiatives.\n  As the chair of the Appropriations Committee, I wanted to look at not \nonly the great work my colleagues were doing in authorizing, but what \nwe could do now for the money. Last year, in the 2015 omnibus, with the \nfull concurrence of then-Vice Chairman Shelby--a really strong advocate \non this issue--and then across the aisle with Hal Rogers in the House, \nwe put $42 million in the Justice Department to make sure we were \nfighting trafficking. We included a $28 million increase for programs \nthat provide grants that are lifesaving, as well as life-rescuing \nservices to victims. These funds were to ensure that law enforcement \ncould enforce the law and make sure victims had emergency shelters and \ncounseling, supporting a true rescue mission.\n  We also made sure the FBI had additional resources to find those \ncriminals and bring them to justice, and to focus on efforts such as a \nprogram called ``Innocence Lost'' that focuses on the trafficking of \nchildren. We funded human trafficking prosecution by adding more money \nfor civil rights attorneys to identify the large trafficking rings to \ndo it.\n  I don't want to sound like an accountant; I want to sound like one of \nthe women of the Senate who thinks about these women who have been \nrecruited around the world and the children who are being nabbed and \ngrabbed, and the exploitation of lost children, sometimes runaway \nyouths.\n  We want to say to them that our Federal dollars are working hard, and \nwe are going to look at how authorizers and appropriators really work \ntogether. We want to pass some of this new, fresh thinking on how to \nattack and deal with this problem. We are going to look at the \nAppropriations Committee across all subcommittees to see what we can \ndo.\n  The women of the Senate are going to be a voice and a vote on this, \nand we know we have good men of the Senate who also work with us and \nsupport us. So working shoulder to shoulder, we can do something to \nmake it safer for our communities and have a big impact around the \nworld. We will do it because we took the time to listen to each other \nand figure out ways we can work together. Let's get it done, and let's \nget it done now.\n  I would now like to yield time for someone who has been a real leader \non this issue, and a member of the Committee on the Judiciary, who has \nbrought some new, fresh thinking and fresh approaches but also has been \nwise and prudent for her taxpayers and, I might also add, a former \nattorney general in the State of Minnesota. She is a great warrior, and \nshe has made sure that she has some new ideas. Senator Klobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge Senator Mikulski \nand her leadership. Anyone who wondered how hard she was going to keep \nworking after she announced she wasn't running again for the next \nyear--I think we just saw the answer right here. She hasn't slowed down \none bit. She is already here advocating for some incredibly important \nbills, and I am also glad to see that Senator Shaheen and Senator \nHirono are here. They are going to speak shortly.\n  Given I have been able to talk about this at length on the Committee \non the Judiciary, I will be brief and say this:\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\nI have an important bill with Senator Cornyn, and it is a bill, a \nversion of which has already passed the House, a bipartisan bill, the \nStop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act. Also, Senator Cornyn has a \nbill with me and a number of other people called the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act. My bill passed through the Committee on the \nJudiciary last week after the hearing that Senator Mikulski referred \nto, 20-0, on a vote. And Senator Cornyn's bill, which I have also \ncosponsored, passed on a near-unanimous vote. Senator Leahy and Senator \nCollins, as was mentioned by Senator Mikulski, have an important bill--\nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act. We are \nhopeful we can get these done, along with what Senator Feinstein is \ndoing, and many others, in the coming days on the Senate floor.\n  I think the first message here is this is bipartisan. I don't think \nany sex trafficker wants to hear we are doing some tougher stuff to go \nafter them, but we are. It is very important that this be bipartisan.\n  I give you one example of a case charged last week out of Minnesota. \nA 12-year-old girl--not even old enough to get a driver's license, not \neven old enough to go to her first prom--gets a text. She goes to a \nparking lot at McDonald's. She thinks there is a party. A guy puts her \nin a car and drives her to Rochester, MN--the Twin Cities--rapes her \nand then takes pictures of her and puts it on Craigslist. The next day \ntwo other men buy her off of Craigslist and rape her.\n  That happened in Minnesota. That is happening all over the country, \nwhere 83 percent of the victims are not from other countries, 83 \npercent of the victims are from our own country. This is the third \nbiggest criminal enterprise--international criminal enterprise--in the \nworld. Only after illegal drugs and illegal guns comes selling young \ngirls and young boys for sex. This is going on in the oil patch in \nNorth Dakota. It is going on in the city streets in Baltimore. It is \ngoing on in small towns in Minnesota. That is what we are seeing \nhappening across our country.\n  I appreciate all the support of my Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues. What this bill does that we passed 20-0 out of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary--the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking \nAct--is it takes this model that has been really successful in \nMinnesota. We just got a 40-year sentence last year against someone \nrunning a ring who basically says, are you going to prosecute the 12-\nyear-old? No. That 12-year-old is a victim.\n  When you start thinking like that and you start thinking of these \nvictims as actual victims, then you give them services. Then they turn \ntheir lives around, and then they testify against the guys who are \nrunning these rings. That is how you make the cases. If you prosecute \nthem, my guess is they are going to go right back to that pimp who \nbrought them into this world in the first place.\n  That is why this has been adopted already in 15 States, and 12 States \nare looking at it. What our bill does is simply takes an existing grant \nprogram and creates incentives so that other States will adopt this as \nwell.\n  We also have the ability for these victims to access programs that \nhelp people get jobs.\n  Finally, the national sex trafficking strategy. We do not have one in \nthis country. That is in this bill as well. You can see why it got \nwidespread support.\n  I am excited about these bills because finally we are working on \nsomething together. I would like to get them done as soon as possible. \nThere are a lot of bills that have passed in the House. We are going to \nhave to coordinate all these efforts, as Senator Mikulski said. But \nthis is the moment in time where we can finally say not just to the \nrest of the world but to girls in our own country that we are going to \nstand up for them and we are going to stand up against these people \nrunning the rings.\n  Why has this gotten worse in the last few years? We love the \nInternet, but people are advertising on the Internet. They are getting \naway with it, and we have to make sure we are sophisticated, more \nsophisticated than the perpetrators who are committing these crimes.\n  I see that our great Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, is \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from New Hampshire yield for 1 minute?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to say this is not a Democratic \nwomen's issue. We are in this on a bipartisan basis. I want to note \nthat the Democratic women are here because the Republican women are \nchairing committees and subcommittees. I know the Senator from New \nHampshire, Ms. Ayotte, will be on the floor shortly. The distinguished \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, is at a very important Navy \nappropriations committee hearing. So when my colleagues see us, don't \nassume it is just Democratic women. It is all of us together. But their \nresponsibility has them at another duty station right this minute. I \nwanted to explain where we are.\n  I yield the floor back to Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to echo what my colleagues \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Klobuchar have said about this being a \nbipartisan issue. This is an issue that affects everybody in this \ncountry--Republicans, Democrats, Independents. It is a critical issue \nfor the Senate. It is a critical issue for the House. It is a critical \nissue for State legislatures across the country.\n  I am so pleased to be able to join my colleagues and thank Senator \nMikulski for her leadership for such a long time on this issue and so \nmany others, and commend Senator Klobuchar for everything she is doing \nto address this issue. I am so pleased to join Senator Hirono as well \nthis morning, and look forward to seeing my colleague from New \nHampshire coming to the floor shortly.\n  This Sunday, March 8, nations across the globe will observe \nInternational Women's Day. It is an annual occasion to celebrate the \nachievements of women across the globe. But it also recognizes the \nobstacles that still stand in the way of equal rights and opportunities \nfor women. Over the last century, women have fought for equal rights \nand opportunities, and we made enormous advances in much of the world. \nHumanity has learned that women's rights are human rights, and those \nrights include being respected as full and equal partners in all \naspects of the economy and society. We have learned that when women \nsucceed, families succeed, communities succeed, and nations succeed.\n  However, as my colleagues have pointed out so eloquently, across the \nglobe countless millions of women continue to face not only the denial \nof basic human and civil rights, but outright violence and bondage. We \nwould like to think of slavery as a thing of the past, particularly \nhere in America. But the tragic reality is that this scourge continues \nto thrive in the 21st century. We are here this morning to shine a \nspotlight on the modern slave trade and to encourage all of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate to work with us to end it.\n  An estimated 27 million people are trapped in the multibillion dollar \nmarketplace that trafficks in slaves. Victims include forced migrant \nlaborers, bonded laborers, and sex slaves, including women forced into \nmarriages as de facto slaves. Tragically, as we have heard, children \naccount for the majority of modern slaves, many of them trafficked and \nsexually exploited.\n  Let's be clear. As Senators Klobuchar and Mikulski pointed out, \nmodern-day slavery is not confined to impoverished and backward \ncountries. I was recently briefed on a human trafficking case \ninvestigated in my home State of New Hampshire. This case involved \nforced prostitution. Fortunately, three arrests have already been made. \nThe investigation is still ongoing, so I can't talk about the specifics \nof the case, but fortunately several of the victims have been rescued.\n  I want to state the obvious and point out what Senator Klobuchar also \npointed out: If modern slavery can exist in communities in New \nHampshire, in Minnesota, in Maryland, it can exist anywhere in the \nworld.\n  I am proud the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led by Chairman \nCorker and our Ranking Member Menendez, is spearheading new legislation \nwhich I have cosponsored to fight the modern slave trade on a global\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\nscale. Our bill is titled the Ending Modern Slavery Initiative Act of \n2015, and it was unanimously reported out of committee last week.\n  It would authorize the creation of a nonprofit foundation to be known \nas the End Modern Slavery Initiative Foundation. This new foundation \nwould fund projects to rescue victims of modern slavery and to prevent \nindividuals from being victimized by slavery. In addition, it would \npursue the strict enforcement of laws to punish individual and \ncorporate perpetrators of modern slavery.\n  I want to again commend the work of the Senate Committee on the \nJudiciary under the leadership of Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member \nLeahy, as well as the work that Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar \nare doing. The Committee on the Judiciary advanced three bipartisan \nbills to crack down on criminals involved in human trafficking and to \nassist victims with the rehabilitation.\n  As we are talking about the prevalence of human trafficking, I think \nthis picture of the areas of human trafficking shows while it is \nstronger in particular regions of the country--up the I-95 corridor--it \nis all over the country. The Presiding Officer's home State of \nArkansas--a small state like New Hampshire--is one of those States \nwhere we see a big red hotspot for human trafficking. We see it all \nacross the country. It is why we need to do everything we can \nnationally to respond to this scourge.\n  As we look forward this week to celebrating International Women's Day \non Sunday, let us also remember the millions of women who have been \nleft behind, who are being exploited by traffickers and trapped in \nmodern slavery, who are desperate to have their humanity recognized and \nrescued. I urge all of our colleagues here in the Senate to join us in \nsupporting legislation that will combat and hopefully ultimately end \nmodern slavery, the scourge of human trafficking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we also are joined today by Senator \nHirono, who for many years served with me on the Committee on the \nJudiciary. She is now on the Intelligence Committee, but has been very \nactive in this issue as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary, and \nwe thank her for being here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking Senator \nMikulski for her leadership on this issue as well as on so many other \nimportant issues.\n  I rise today with many of my fellow women Senators from both parties \nin drawing awareness to the terrible crime of human trafficking, and \nnot just drawing awareness, but to call upon all of us to take action \nto stop this crime.\n  According to the International Labour Organization, there are an \nestimated 21 million victims of trafficking globally, something that \nSenator Mikulski has already mentioned. That is 21 million people. That \nis more than the total population of 48 States, including Hawaii, who \nare trafficked every single year. Only Texas and California have more \nthan 21 million people.\n  The most recent estimates available show that between 14,500 and \n17,500 people were trafficked into the United States in 2005. That is \nwhy I am working to enhance our ability to protect human trafficking \nvictims seeking refuge in our country. Right now, many families are \ntorn apart at the border because current law requires adult men to be \ntransferred to a border location hundreds of miles away from where they \nwere intercepted.\n  Meanwhile, their families, who are often with them, are sent back \nacross the border at the place where they were intercepted with no \nmoney and no idea of where their husbands or fathers were taken. The \nsituation leaves women and children vulnerable to trafficking, sexual \nviolence, and other dangers.\n  I have also sought to place independent child welfare professionals \nat Border Patrol stations to provide basic humanitarian assistance to \nunaccompanied children held in our border stations. This would ensure \nappropriate screening of children to identify victims of persecution or \ntrafficking. It also would ensure that children are not held for longer \nthan necessary in U.S. Custom and Border Protection facilities.\n  At the peak of our attention to the crisis of unaccompanied minors \nlast year, nearly 50,000 children arrived at our Nation's southern \nborder. Much of our attention in this body was paid to dealing with \nthese children once they reached our border. These children from \nnoncontiguous border countries not only deserve protection but are \nrequired by U.S. law to receive certain protections.\n  But what about the children who might not have reached the relative \nsafety of our border stations? Who knows how many fell victim to \ntraffickers? How many were diverted to other places with even less \nprotection than what they might have received in the United States? \nThroughout the past year, we have heard stories about children and \nyoung women who never made it to the Texas border. We know that \ncriminals have taken advantage of this crisis in Central America by \nenticing families and children who are looking for a way to escape \nextreme violence.\n  When I visited the Rio Grande Valley last year, I heard heartbreaking \nstories from advocates who all too often saw children and young women \nfall victim to trafficking. Advocates even saw instances where \nvulnerable girls were preyed upon by criminal traffickers even after \nthey were released from U.S. Government custody. We must continue \nworking together to protect these young people who are seeking a better \nlife away from the violence of their country.\n  Domestic trafficking is also an issue. Last year I met with the \nHawaii Juvenile Justice State Advisory Council and learned of their \nimportant work with police, prosecutors, and other personnel to better \nidentify minors who have been trafficked into prostitution rings. These \nminors are victims. They are not criminals. Like Hawaii, other States \nare turning their attention to stopping domestic trafficking.\n  There are a number of Senate bipartisan bills on domestic \ntrafficking, as mentioned. For example, I joined Senator Klobuchar on \nher bill, the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act. I also joined \nSenator Leahy in his Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking \nPrevention Act to better assist these vulnerable youth in receiving the \nservices they need to return to some sense of normalcy in their lives.\n  We are working in both the international and domestic arenas to \nbetter address, combat, and eliminate human trafficking. This is an \nissue that crosses country borders. It is certainly an issue that \ncrosses partisan lines. We can find common ground to get something \nmeaningful done in Congress.\n  I see that I am joined by my colleague from North Dakota. I also saw \nmy colleague from New Hampshire.\n  I yield my time for the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nHawaii. This is such an incredibly important issue. It is an honor to \nsee my colleague from North Dakota as well. This is a great example of \nan incredibly important issue that is a bipartisan issue. \nUnfortunately, human trafficking, sex trafficking--this is something \nthat impacts everyone. This is something that the women of the Senate \nhave been very focused on, but it crosses all party lines. We want to \nwork together to end this modern day slavery. Unfortunately, the \nfunding for this is really supporting criminal syndicates and so many \nother crimes. It is also supporting terrorism.\n  So working together, we hope to make meaningful progress to end this \nslavery that is happening for too many young people in this country who \nare vulnerable. But let's make no mistake. This happens in every single \ncommunity in this country. I had the opportunity to testify before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last week, along with Senators Mikulski, \nCollins, and Gillibrand, regarding the importance of legislation to \nfight sex trafficking and ensure, most of all, that we understand that \nthe victims of these horrific, horrific crimes need our support.\n  We need to ensure that we can get them back on their feet, help them \nget\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\nthe support they need and make sure they can lead productive lives--and \nhold the traffickers accountable. Those who are participating in \ntrafficking need to understand that we are going to work together to \nensure they are held fully accountable and the victims do not get \nblamed for these crimes.\n  The Judiciary Committee heard from experts who are dedicated to \nchanging lives and helping victims. Their work is incredibly important. \nIn my State of New Hampshire, the Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual \nViolence, which I had the privilege of working with as attorney \ngeneral, has done some tremendous work in supporting victims and also \nin bringing attention to the trafficking in New Hampshire and across \nthis country.\n  What we know is that sex trafficking is something that is \ndevastating. This is something where we need to work with local, State, \nand Federal agencies, working together to prevent trafficking, to \nprovide support for those who are vulnerable in the community and are \noften targeted, whether they are runaways or people who are homeless. \nBut also there are people who come from communities where it is not the \nhomeless who are targeted. Children and women and also boys are \ntargeted for trafficking.\n  Last week I was encouraged to see that the Senate Judiciary Committee \npassed two bipartisan pieces of legislation of which I was honored to \nbe a cosponsor: Senator Cornyn's Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \nand Senator Klobuchar's Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor. I cannot wait for these bills to come to the \nfloor. I hope our leadership makes this a priority because this is such \na strong bipartisan issue.\n  Also last week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed Senator \nCorker's End Modern Slavery Initiative Act, which aims to eliminate \nmodern slavery throughout the world. It is totally unacceptable in this \nday and age that people are trafficked the way they are. But to mention \nit again, modern slavery is being used to support terrorism. It is \nbeing used to endanger the world as well. So we have to work to end it.\n  I also recently helped reintroduce the bipartisan Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, which helps prevent sex \ntrafficking. This has been a very useful program in the State of New \nHampshire. I see my colleague here from North Dakota. I know she shares \nwith me--having been an attorney general of her State--that we \nunderstand that these are horrible crimes that happen in every single \ncommunity, from my home State of New Hampshire to her home State of \nNorth Dakota. We are going to work together to make sure that we can \nend human trafficking, that we can hold those accountable who are \ntraffickers, and, most of all, that we can support the victims of these \nhorrible crimes.\n  So with that I would like to turn the floor over for the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from New \nHampshire. I think as we begin to have this broader discussion and as \nwe begin to explore the kind of path for other projects such as this \none--whether it is domestic violence, whether it is sexual assault and \nchanging outcomes--we know the first obstacle is awareness.\n  The first thing we need to do is to take these horrible issues, these \ndark blotches in our society out of the shadows and put them into the \nlight and develop a plan and a strategy that will not only deal \nappropriately with the law enforcement component of prosecuting and \nfinding appropriate penalties for people who engage in modern day \nslavery, but also it is important that we look to prevention.\n  So I want to first take this opportunity to thank the senior Senator \nfrom Maryland, Barbara Mikulski, for not only bringing together several \nof the Senate women today who are coming to the floor to call for \naction, to stop the scourge of human trafficking but also for her long-\nterm commitment to women and children and society's most vulnerable.\n  I think we all know that Senator Mikulski has stood tall, which for a \nwoman of her stature is always a little tough. She has stood tall for \nthose who have no voice in society and for those who are engaged in \nsome of the most horrible victimizations that we can imagine, which \ntoday is the victimization of sexual human trafficking. So as the \nSenator from New Hampshire has talked about and as a former attorney \ngeneral of North Dakota, I think I know how difficult it is to shine a \nlight on a problem that most people do not recognize or are, \nunfortunately, unwilling to admit is a problem.\n  When we began in the 1990s to talk about a different strategy to \ncombat violence against women and domestic violence, which was an issue \nthat had lurked in the shadows. In fact, for many States that was an \nissue that was considered a public health issue, not a criminal justice \nissue. I, along with a number of my women colleagues who were elected \nattorneys general, along with this body, and most noticeably now, Vice \nPresident Joe Biden, began to have an ongoing discussion about the \nViolence Against Women Act and what we needed to do not only to protect \nvictims but to change the dynamic.\n  I think that as we began to take that problem out of the shadows, as \nwe began to address the concerns of so many women who for years--\nliterally years--had been victimized in their home, in a place that \nshould be the safest place for human beings, we were able to build \nawareness and change outcomes. There is still a lot of work to do in \ndomestic violence. But we believe that great strides were made simply \nbecause we were willing to point the finger and shine the light and say \nthat this is not acceptable in our society.\n  I see a lot of similarities in this fight that we are waging today \nagainst human trafficking. With the right strategy, the right partners, \nthe right policies and persistence, we are going to turn the tide on \nhuman trafficking.\n  While there continues to be much time and attention focused on \nintervention and recovery--I think that is rightfully so--and on \ncriminal prosecution, I would like to take my time today to talk about \npreventing human trafficking in the first place. As the Senator from \nthe State of New Hampshire discussed, the bills that are addressing \nthis--the homeless youth bill--are absolutely critical to being a point \nof intervention, to prevent children from being on the streets, from \nbeing extremely vulnerable to victimization, from being extremely \nvulnerable to traffickers, and by helping those children off the \nstreet, by beginning to address the issues in their home that led them \nto flee in the first place. I think that is a very important first step \nto preventing human trafficking and human sex trafficking among minors.\n  I also think it is important that we learn from the experiences of \nother places.\n  Last year I traveled to Mexico City with Senator Klobuchar, who, as \nwe know, has been a fierce advocate and a wonderful partner on this \nissue, beginning not only with her work in the Senate but her work as \nthe Hennepin County attorney.\n  I also traveled there with Cindy McCain. I think we would be remiss \nif we did not raise her voice and her name in this body today. She has \nbeen a global leader and a tireless leader, working not only in her \nState of Arizona but all across the globe. She has stood up to people \nwho say this is not a problem. She has stood up to people who would \njust as soon sweep this under the rug and forget it is happening. She \nhas been a leader and a champion of not only the people in her State \nand the women and children of this country but the women and children \nof the world. I am proud of our association, and I am proud of our \nfriendship and the work we have been able to do together.\n  When we went to Mexico, we heard from countless government officials \nand NGOs about the difficulties they face stopping this unspeakable \ncrime.\n  What I was particularly struck by were the stories of women and \nchildren coerced into this life--not forcefully, not being grabbed off \nthe street against their will, but forced and coerced through promises \nof a better life, promises of someone to love and care for them. \nUnfortunately, for many of these young girls, these promises are short-\nlived because these girls and women are quickly pushed into a world of\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\nphysical abuse, drug use, and forced sex with hundreds, if not \nthousands of men. What was once a promise of a better life is a \nnightmare relived countless times a day as these victims are sold time \nand time again, their value now strictly as a commodity to be \nconstantly traded over and over again. Imagine the horror of their \nlives. Imagine the horror of their existence.\n  How do we prevent this from happening? We must make sure to work with \nsurvivors. We must ask survivors to go to communities, to go to \nvulnerable populations, and tell their stories. The women and children \nwho are most vulnerable and most susceptible need to hear firsthand the \ntactics used and, most importantly, the reality of following these \nfalse promises.\n  Shortly after returning from Mexico City, I met with Madai Morales \nAlbino from Mexico. She is an amazing survivor of human trafficking. \nShe was sexually exploited for 2 years, and she successfully escaped \nwhile being transported from Mexico to New York City. She is now an \nactivist, and she talks about her experience and helps to teach and \nprevent this crime among the youth. She has become a role model for the \nyounger girls at the shelter where she was cared for in Mexico. She \nattends national and international forums and workshops as a speaker to \ntalk about her experience and the horror of human trafficking. She is \ncurrently studying to become a lawyer so she can continue to help girls \nwho are now trapped in human trafficking.\n  The strength and courage of this young woman is awe-inspiring, and \nshe is changing outcomes. We need more people like her in the world. We \nneed more of her courage in the world, the courage to tell a story and \nthen the courage to reach out and relive that horror through telling a \nstory every day, the horror that was her existence.\n  We must also bring hope to the hopeless and love to those who do not \nfeel loved. We can do this through increased educational opportunities, \nincreased job opportunities, providing the necessary social services \ninfrastructure, and working to build a safer, stronger community \noverall for women and children around the world.\n  Most importantly, what we should not bring to this is judgment; \ninstead, bring a helping hand, bring an opportunity for a new life. \nWhether we are talking about the streets of Mexico City, Baltimore, or \nIndian Country in North Dakota, we can and we must do better. We can \nstart taking action immediately in the Senate. We can directly impact \nefforts to prevent human trafficking in the United States by providing \nthe resources necessary to work with some of our most vulnerable and \nmost susceptible--our runaway and homeless youth.\n  I urge the majority leader to bring forward S. 262, the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, a bill championed by my \ngreat friend Senator Leahy. We all recognize that homeless youth are \nsome of if not the most vulnerable and susceptible to trafficking. This \nis certainly true in North Dakota. It is certainly true in Mexico City. \nI am certain it is true in every community where runaway and homeless \nyouth exist. This bill would provide much needed resources to this \npopulation and would complement other antitrafficking legislation being \naddressed in the Senate that addresses prevention, intervention, and \nrecovery services to victims.\n  I also call on the majority leader to act by urging him to also bring \nS. 166, the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, and S. 178, the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, to the floor for a vote. I have \nworked tirelessly to push both of those bills since the last Congress. \nThe Judiciary Committee reported two bills out of committee last week \nwith unanimous support, and it is time to bring those bills to the \nfloor for a vote. I believe all three bills should be part of a \ncomprehensive approach to preventing trafficking and supporting \nvictims.\n  We must do everything we can in our power to stamp out human sex \ntrafficking in our backyard, across the country, and across the world.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my great friend from the great State \nof New York, Senator Gillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I also rise to speak about human trafficking, and I \nassociate myself with the comments of Senator Heitkamp.\n  Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery that is alive, \nactive, and must be stopped. Many of the stories we hear from traffic \nsurvivors sound more like plots in a horror movie than real life in the \nUnited States of America, but these stories are not fiction. Over and \nover we hear stories about young Americans forced into captivity, about \nyoung Americans forced into sexual exploitation, about young Americans \nwho have no freedom to say no to a violent pimp but are still tagged \nwith prostitution charges before they even turn 18. Human trafficking \nis a crime that rips families apart, breaks down the trust in our \ncommunities, and shatters young American lives.\n  It is long overdue for Congress to pay close attention to this issue, \nand I commend my fellow female Senators for bringing this issue so \nboldly to the floor of the Senate.\n  Today I will talk about what Senator Heitkamp talked about--the \nvulnerabilities that led to these young boys and girls becoming \ntrafficked and how vulnerable they remain even after they have managed \nto escape from their pimps and their captivity.\n  In small towns and big cities, thousands of Americans are trafficked \neach year. Every single institution these boys and girls ever relied on \nsimply failed them, failed to protect them. Their families failed to \nprotect them. Their schools failed to protect them. The foster system \nthey were given to failed to protect them. Our laws are failing to \nprotect them.\n  Last month alone, in Rochester, NY, the U.S. attorney announced the \narrest of seven people on trafficking charges. Their victims were as \nyoung as 14 years old. The U.S. attorney said: ``The victims in many \ncases were singled out because they were identified as being \nvulnerable.''\n  We have the responsibility in Congress to end these crimes against \nthe most vulnerable among us. We should pass Senator Leahy's Runaway \nand Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, which would provide \nreal help to runaway youth, who are especially vulnerable to this \nexploitation. We should support Senator Klobuchar's Stop Exploitation \nThrough Trafficking Act, which would stop the prosecution of minors who \nhave engaged in commercial sex acts. We should pass Senator Cornyn's \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which would support programs \nfor survivors of human trafficking and child pornography and ensure \nthat the johns who are buying trafficking victims are actually \nprosecuted in Federal court.\n  We need a law that would vacate the criminal convictions of \ntrafficking victims because these girls and boys are not criminals; \nthey are not prostitutes; they are victims who deserve a chance to lead \na fulfilling life. I will be introducing an amendment to Senator \nKlobuchar's bill that would vacate the criminal convictions of \ntrafficked victims who were forced to break the law while they were \ntrafficked. No victim of human trafficking should have to go through \nlife--even after gaining their freedom from their trafficker--with \nprostitution charges on their record. We have an obligation to protect \nthe most vulnerable Americans, and this vacatur amendment would help us \ndo just that.\n  I know that if Congress does its job and does everything it can to \nhelp victims of human trafficking, thousands of young women and men in \nthis country will have a chance to live a fulfilling life.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, today is a make-or-break day for millions \nof Americans who are better off because of the Affordable Care Act. As \nwe speak, the Supreme Court is hearing\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\noral arguments on a case known as King v. Burwell to decide whether \nAmericans have access to health insurance subsidies through their State \nexchanges or whether opponents of the law--the very same people who \ncontinued to push for over 40 votes in the House of Representatives to \nrepeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act, the same people who shut \ndown this government last year because of their obsession with \nrepealing the law--will win out with a paper-thin legal argument. It \nwould not only be a devastating blow to millions of Americans who are \ncurrently receiving subsidies for their insurance, but it would destroy \nthe individual health insurance markets in those States and would \nrepresent an incredible power grab by the Supreme Court that would \nundercut the impartiality of that Court.\n  At the heart of this case is the Affordable Care Act, both the text \nand congressional intent. The question is, Did Congress intend to allow \nall Americans to benefit from affordable quality coverage across this \ncountry, whether they are in a State exchange or a Federal exchange?\n  To answer that question, you don't have to leaf through many pages of \nthe Affordable Care Act; you can stop at the very first title, which is \non the very first page. The first section reads: ``Title I. Quality, \nAffordable Health Care for All Americans.'' All Americans--not some \nAmericans who live in a State that set up an insurance exchange like \nAccessHealthCT, but all Americans.\n  Before I go into a little bit of detail on this case, I wish to speak \nabout this little boy. His name is Devin, and I was fortunate to meet \nwith him just this last week. He is 8 years old. This picture is from \nmaybe 1 or 2 years ago during one of his first trips to Washington. He \nlives with his parents and younger sister in western Connecticut.\n  Devin is one of about 20,000 people with hemophilia in this country. \nTo stay healthy and to support his active life, which includes \nbaseball, karate, and snowboarding, Devin has to take an injection \nevery other day. The injections cost about $4,000 per dose, about \n$50,000 per month. Despite the challenges his disease presents, Devin \nwas all smiles when we talked about what he liked to do, about school, \nand about how much you need to walk when you come to the Capitol to \nlobby, as Devin has the past couple of years.\n  The benefits of the Affordable Care Act are very clear for Devin and \nhis family. His family will never have to worry about annual or \nlifetime limits on his health care. He won't have to worry, nor will \nhis parents have to worry about him being denied insurance over the \ncourse of his life just because of his condition.\n  It isn't hyperbole to say that an adverse decision by the Court would \nbe life-threatening for Americans like Devin who rely on these new \ninsurance protections.\n  Obviously, Devin and his family aren't the only ones to benefit from \nthis law. Just last week HHS released the final report on enrollment \nand showed that 8.84 million people have signed up for coverage in \nhealthcare.gov States--Federal exchange States. An additional 2.8 \nmillion signed up through State-based marketplaces, such as in \nConnecticut, for a total of 11.6 million people who have private health \ncare insurance because of the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies \nwhich are being spread across the country. By the way, add another 10 \nmillion people who are on Medicare because of the Affordable Care Act \nand we see why the uninsurance rate in this country is spiraling \ndownward.\n  The tax credits the law provided for people making less than 400 \npercent of poverty are critical to the success of this law because they \nmake coverage affordable. According to an HHS report from earlier this \nmonth, nearly 8 in 10 consumers are getting coverage for $100 or less \nafter these tax credits.\n  In my home State, we had a goal to enroll 70,000 new individuals \nthrough private insurance and Medicaid, and we hit over 200,000. But \nthe good news doesn't stop there. According to a new report since the \nACA was passed, 9.4 million people with Medicare saved $15 billion on \nprescription drugs, an average of about $1,600 per beneficiary. For \npreventive care, there are 39 million people with Medicare and Medicare \nAdvantage who took advantage of at least one preventive service with no \ncost sharing in 2014. That is why the Times, USA TODAY, the Washington \nPost, the Wall Street Journal, and Politico are saying the simple \nmessage that now, more than ever, Americans understand the Affordable \nCare Act is working.\n  Yet despite the fact it is working, opponents of the law are \ncontinuing to try to tear it down. So let us be clear about what a \nnegative decision from the Supreme Court would mean. It would mean that \nanywhere from 8 to 10 million Americans would lose their health care \ncoverage and another 5 million children could lose their coverage as \nwell.\n  Subsidies are important because the law envisions three interlocking \nsets of provisions: insurance protections to fix the abuses within our \nold system, the individual coverage provision to ensure we have a \nviable risk pool inside insurance, and, finally, tax credits to help \npeople purchase insurance. Subsidies are the glue that holds all of \nthat together.\n  That is why a victory for the plaintiffs would be devastating for \neveryone, not just those who receive subsidies in healthcare.gov. The \nindividual markets in these States would fall into a death spiral if \nthis law was overturned. If subsidies disappear, then people can't buy \ncoverage. If they can't buy coverage, then the law says the individual \nmandate in those States has to disappear. If the individual mandate \ndisappears, then healthy people don't buy coverage and the insurance \nprotections, such as the ban on discrimination against people with \npreexisting conditions, simply cannot work. The insurance reforms \neither vanish or rates spike to catastrophic levels for people who \ndecide to get coverage.\n  Don't take my word for it. The American Hospital Association warns \nthat ``many more people will get sick, go bankrupt or die''--or die--if \nthe Court finds for the challengers. The health insurance industry says \ntaking away the tax credits would ``create severely dysfunctional \ninsurance markets'' in nearly three dozen States.\n  Frankly, we don't even need to talk about the detrimental effects in \nthese States because this is about congressional intent, and the intent \nis clear. Sometimes when we try to figure out intent we have trouble \nbecause the people who wrote the law aren't here any longer or they \nhave passed away. Well, there are hundreds of people who voted for this \nlaw who are still in Congress. All we have to do is ask them. There is \nnot a single person who voted for this law who will tell us they wrote \nthe law in a way that would result in the denial of subsidies to people \nwho are getting health care through the State exchanges.\n  The plaintiffs say this is a carrot-and-stick approach; that the \nintention was to deny subsidies to people in States that didn't set up \ntheir own exchange as a way to force them to set up their own exchange. \nWell, there is not a single Member of Congress who voted for the law \nwho says that is how it was designed.\n  Frankly, we don't even need to get to intent. We don't even need to \nsurvey all the people who voted for it. We just have to look at the law \nitself. The plaintiffs focus on one line that says that subsidies shall \ngo to State exchanges, but they ignore another line in the law that \nsays if States don't establish their own exchange, then the Federal \nexchange becomes the State exchange. That is just as plainly written as \nthe one line that is the foundation of the case.\n  But the entire structure of the law relies on States that don't set \nup their own exchanges getting Federal subsidies. Why would we even set \nup a Federal exchange if there weren't going to be subsidies associated \nwith it? There would be no customers in the exchange if the intent of \nthe law was to deny subsidies to people who bought into Federal \nexchanges. We wouldn't even have a Federal exchange.\n  Second, we would have established the insurance protections in a \nfundamentally different way. We would have said insurance protections \napply to States that set up State exchanges and they do not apply to \nStates that don't establish State exchanges, because again, as I said \nbefore, without those subsidies, the insurance protections simply don't \nwork from an actuarial basis.\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\n  But that is not how the Affordable Care Act is written. The act says \nthe insurance protections apply nationally, regardless of whether it is \na State or Federal exchange. Why is that? Because subsidies were going \nto flow to a State no matter what kind of exchange they established.\n  Lastly, when Congress has historically engaged in this kind of \ncarrot-and-stick endeavor with States, we make it totally transparent. \nWe lay out in the statute here is what we expect you to do, and if you \ndon't do it, here are the consequences. We don't hide the consequences \nto be derived at through a Supreme Court case, as is the stated belief \nof the petitioners in this case.\n  Lastly, the plaintiffs say: Well, don't worry about it. If the \nSupreme Court overturns this, we will just fix it. Congress can just \ncome back and fix that line. Well, Congress isn't fixing anything these \ndays. We can't even keep the Department of Homeland Security open and \noperating. Republicans have had 6 years to provide an alternative to \nthe Affordable Care Act. We haven't seen anything more than a memo or a \npress release. If the subsidies disappear, they are not coming back. \nCongress is not fixing this problem, and 10 million Americans will lose \ntheir coverage.\n  I want to finish by talking about one more story, and this is the \nstory of a woman who lives in Westport, CT. She works as a massage \ntherapist, but since she is self-employed she was uninsured and \ncouldn't provide insurance for herself. Last year, when the Affordable \nCare Act was implemented, she found out she qualified for coverage in \nConnecticut and that coverage finally gave her the opportunity to see a \ndoctor. She wrote the President and said:\n\n       The cancer has been detected at a very early stage, which, \n     with a 98 percent survival rate, has saved my life. Moreover, \n     the cost of this screening and minor procedure will be far \n     less than the cost of treating a more developed cancer. Thank \n     you, Mr. President, for assuring the passage of this critical \n     legislation. You have profoundly improved the quality of my \n     life.\n\n  The facts are clear. The Affordable Care Act is working. The intent \nof Congress is clear: to provide subsidies to all Americans, no matter \ntheir ZIP Code. The language of the bill is clear. That leaves us with \none conclusion. If the Supreme Court overturns this portion of the law, \nit will be a plain and simple political power play. It will usher in a \nnew era in which the Supreme Court becomes just another legislative \nbody. They will be calling the authors of this bill liars and replacing \nthe authors' stated intent with their own political judgment.\n  For the sake of Devin and Ann and millions of others who would \nbenefit from the Affordable Care Act and for the sake of American \ndemocracy, I hope they uphold the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I first wish to say to the Senator from \nConnecticut that this Senator agrees with him. It should never come \ndown to this. The whole purpose of that section of the Affordable Care \nAct is in fact to provide insurance to as many people as we can, \nespecially the 40 million people who for years and years have been \ngoing without insurance, and it is doing a pretty good job.\n  In the second year of expanding the State exchanges or the Federal \nexchange, as the Senator has described, lo and behold, of the 8 to 9 \nmillion nationwide, over 1 million of those 8 to 9 million are in my \nState of Florida. So I thank the Senator for his courage, his insight, \nand his clarity and his statement.\n\n\n                         Iran's Nuclear Program\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about S. 615. It is legislation filed \nlast Friday, and this Senator was 1 of 11 Senators who filed it \noriginally. There were five Republicans and six Democrats, and it was \nfiled by the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  This is legislation giving Congress a say with regard to a potential \nagreement that would be enacted in the negotiations between the United \nStates, which includes the P5 plus Iran--over preventing Iran from \nhaving a nuclear weapon.\n  This Senator was assured by the Republican sponsors of this bill that \nthe bill would not come up until after the negotiations had concluded \non March 24. Obviously, this Senator would not have sponsored \nlegislation that would try to predetermine or nix the negotiations \nbefore they had a chance to succeed.\n  Yesterday or the day before the majority leader filed a rule XIV to \nbring the process directly to the floor. It is my understanding he is \nintending to go to that legislation next week, but that still is almost \n2 weeks before the negotiations are to conclude.\n  I want the negotiations to be successful. It is very important to the \nnational security of the United States that Iran not have a nuclear \nweapon. That is obvious to the national security of Israel as well. Yet \nwe are about to take up legislation that would start talking about the \nlifting of sanctions before an agreement has even been reached.\n  Well, this Senator is not going to have any part of that. Therefore, \nif this legislation is brought up before the negotiations conclude on \nMarch 24, this Senator will not support the efforts to proceed to the \nconsideration of the legislation in the Senate.\n  It is one thing to enter into these matters of considerable national \nsecurity and try to disrupt them, it is another thing looking at the \nconsequences if these negotiations don't succeed and we can stop Iran \nfrom having a nuclear weapon, that one alternative, a very serious \nalternative, is war, but it is another thing to make representations to \na Senator that are not fulfilled, and this Senator doesn't like it one \nbit.\n  I conclude by saying there has been a lot of commentary about the \nPrime Minister's speech yesterday. This Senator feels like where the \nPrime Minister was arguing against negotiations that are ongoing before \nthe negotiations are concluded--I don't think that is in the interest \nof the United States. I don't like that one bit.\n\n  This Senator also feels that when a foreign leader comes in front of \nthe Congress--the representatives of the American people--for what to \nthis Senator is obvious political advantage in an election that is to \ntake place in just 2 weeks, I don't think that is right either.\n  This Senator is one of the strongest supporters of Israel, and this \nSenator has had the privilege not only of the perspective of Armed \nServices but also my past service for 6 years on the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I have visited with all of the intelligence apparatus of Israel, and \nit has been a seamless effort in trying to protect the interests of the \nUnited States and Israel with our intelligence apparatus. When partisan \npolitics is injected into this, it is not good, and it is not good for \nthe relationship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, sadly, today the Republicans are again \ncoming to the Senate floor--not to help the working people who work \nevery day to make our country great--but to silence their voices.\n  They aren't here to reward the hard-working families that work from \npaycheck to paycheck just to give their children a better life and the \neducation that they deserve. They aren't here to pass a highway bill \nthat would support millions of jobs.\n  Instead, they want to hold the highway bill hostage to big polluting \nCanadian special interests and build the Keystone pipeline which will \nonly create 35 permanent jobs.\n  They aren't here to raise the minimum wage. They aren't here to \nexpand the child care tax credit. They aren't here to ensure equal pay \nfor equal work. They aren't here to try to make college more affordable \nfor middle-class families. They aren't here to help workers get health \ncare--we know that because right now Republicans are suing to take away \nhealth care from more than 8 million Americans.\n  They certainly aren't here to fix our Nation's broken immigration \nsystem. If Republicans were interested in that, they would be \nsupporting the reasonable, commonsense immigration measures proposed by \nPresident Obama that will result in indisputable economic gains for our \ncountry--raising the Nation's GDP by up to $90 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  No, the majority in the House and Senate don't have time for any of \nthese measures to help working families--they are too busy pursuing \ntheir latest attack on the middle class.\n  I oppose this resolution because it would impede one of the basic \nrights of America's workers: to form a union.\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\n  If enacted, this resolution would prohibit the National Labor \nRelations Board from implementing rules to streamline and modernize \nunion election procedures that will ensure union elections are \nconducted in a more fair and efficient manner.\n  These employees who work so hard deserve a union elections process \nthat is free from unnecessary delays and wasteful stall tactics.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about those tactics. This comes from the \ntestimony of someone who represents unions in California.\n  In 2010 a petition for representation was filed for approximately 45 \nautomobile mechanics. Even though there were well-established NLRB \nrules that governed the proceedings on a petition for a unit of \nautomobile mechanics, management asked for hearings, extensions, filed \nobjection after objection, until finally, 427 days after the petition \nwas filed, the union was certified.\n  Corporations are getting the benefits of increased profits and \nproductivity. Why should they be allowed to stall these proceedings? \nWhy do they oppose giving these workers a voice so that they can \nimprove their working conditions and wages?\n  First, let me tell you what these rules do not do: They do not \nmandate timetables for elections to occur. Rather, the new rules simply \neliminate existing barriers that get in the way of providing both \nemployees and employers with access to a fair election process.\n  These rules do not prevent employers from discussing their views on \nunions with workers. What these modest changes will accomplish: The new \nrules, which will go into effect on April 14, will reduce unnecessary \nlitigation on issues that are not relevant to the outcome of the \nelection. The new rules will modernize the current outdated process. In \nthe past, employers had to send out mail through the post office, which \ncost time and money. The new rule will allow employers and unions to \nfile forms electronically. It will also allow the use of more modern \nforms of communication to employees through cell phones and email.\n  Instead of standing up for workers across the country who are \nstruggling with stagnant wages, Republicans have chosen to challenge \nthese common-sense reforms.\n  The right to form a union is a right guaranteed by the National Labor \nRelations Act and by the First Amendment of our Constitution.\n  These modest changes will merely allow workers to exercise that right \nin a fair and efficient process in order to protect their rights, \nincrease wages, and grow our Nation's middle class.\n  What is so sad is that this is just the latest attack on the middle \nclass and their economic security. Instead of taking up more floor time \ngoing after the rights of workers, let's fight to help working \nfamilies. Instead of trying to undo measures that help the middle \nclass, let's fight to do more for them.\n  At a time when wages are stagnating, instead of trying to silence the \nvoices of hard-working men and women, let's fight to empower them \nthrough collective bargaining.\n  I urge my colleagues to support modernization and oppose this \nresolution. Let's let our workers know that we hear them, that we \nsupport them, and that we will fight to make life better for our middle \nclass families.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the NLRB's current election process has \nsome glaring problems, contrary to what some of my Republican \ncolleagues have claimed.\n  For one, the process is inefficient. In many cases across the United \nStates, frivolous litigation and needless delays threaten the rights of \nworkers who want to vote on union representation. Federal appellate \ncourts have called union election delays ``inexcusable,'' \n``deplorable,'' and ``egregious.'' The new reforms specifically target \nthose systemic inefficiencies and excessive delays.\n  Secondly, the current system is outdated. Right now, the NLRB, \nemployers, and unions are barred from filing forms electronically \nduring the election process. And it does not allow for the use of \nmodern forms of communication to employees through cell phones and \nemails. The updates will adapt the election procedures to few forms of \ntechnology.\n  Another problem is the current system is unpredictable. Right now, \nthe election process for one region of the country could be \nsubstantially different in another region. That adds to inefficiencies \nand confusion. The new reforms will provide uniformity and certainty in \nelections across the country.\n  There is a clear problem here. The NLRB made modest, but important, \nchanges to modernize and streamline the process.\n  Mr. President, today, we have heard a lot about the National Labor \nRelations Board. We have heard about employers delaying workers their \nright to decide on union representation. We have heard about current \nelection process that is outdated and inefficient. But, really, this \ndebate is about what kind of economy we envision for our country.\n  I believe that real, long-term economic growth is built from the \nmiddle out, not the top down. Our government has a role to play in \ninvesting in working families, making sure they have the opportunity to \nwork hard and succeed and offering a hand to those who want to climb \nthe economic ladder and provide a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  Our government and our economy should be working for all families, \nnot only the wealthiest few. Thankfully, we have had the opportunity to \nput some policies into place over the past few years that have pulled \nour economy back from the brink and have started moving it in the right \ndirection.\n  But we have a whole lot more to do. Over the past few decades, for \nmost workers wages have stayed flat or have fallen over the past five \ndecades. That means that across our country today, too many families \nare struggling to make ends meet on rock-bottom wages and poor working \nconditions on the job.\n  While the middle class's share of America's prosperity is at an all-\ntime low, the biggest corporations have posted record profits. In \nCongress, we should be working on ways to build an economy that works \nfor all families, not just the wealthiest few.\n  Unfortunately, once again, instead of sticking up for workers, my \nRepublican colleagues are rushing to the defense of the biggest \ncorporations that have an interest in keeping wages low and denying \nworkers a voice to improve their workplace.\n  Workers have the right to decide whether they want union \nrepresentation. To ensure they are able to exercise that right, the \nNational Labor Relations Board helps make sure workers have a free and \nfair up-or-down vote.\n  So the NLRB was absolutely right to carry out its mission to review \nand streamline its election process to bring down these barriers that \nprevent workers from getting a fair vote. After a rigorous review \nprocess, in December of last year the NLRB made reforms to their \nelection process.\n  These updates will make modest, but important, changes to modernize \nand streamline the process. They will reduce unnecessary litigation on \nissues that won't affect the outcome of the election. The new reforms \nwill bring the election process into the 21st century by letting \nemployers and unions file forms electronically. They also will allow \nthe use of more modern forms of communication to employees through cell \nphones and email. These reforms will simply standardize the election \nprocess across regions, which will help all sides know what to expect \nduring the process.\n  But some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle take great \noffense to these modest changes. Instead of standing for workers across \nthe country who are struggling with stagnant wages and poor working \nconditions, Republicans have chosen to challenge these common sense \nreforms with a resolution of disapproval. Instead of talking about how \nto create jobs and help working families who are struggling with \nstagnant wages, Republicans would rather roll back workers' rights to \ngain a voice at the bargaining table.\n  Let's be clear. This rule is about reducing unnecessary litigation. \nAnd using cell phones and email to transmit information in 2015 is just \ncommon sense.\n  By law, workers have the right to join a union so they can have a \nvoice in the workplace. That is not an ambush.\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\nIt is their right, as guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act \nand by the First Amendment of our Constitution. So when workers want to \nvote on whether to form a union, they are not looking for special \ntreatment. They are simply trying to exercise their basic rights. We as \na nation should not turn our backs on empowering workers through \ncollective bargaining, especially because that is the very thing that \nhelped so many workers climb into the middle class.\n  In Congress, we need to continue to work to expand economic security \nfor more families. That should be our mission to move our country \nforward. This resolution would simply be a step backward.\n  Instead of attacking workers who just want a voice in the workplace, \nI hope my colleagues will reject this resolution. I hope Republicans \nwill join Democrats and work with us to protect workers' rights, \nincrease wages, and grow our Nation's middle class.\n  I truly hope we can break through the gridlock and work together on \npolicies that create jobs, expand economic security, and generate \nbroad-based economic growth for workers and families--not just the \nwealthiest few.\n  Mr. NELSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the veto message on S.1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Veto message to accompany S. 1, a bill to approve the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:20 \np.m. will be equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be divided equally.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary order at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the veto message to accompany \nS. 1.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if we could have order in the Senate, I \nwish to open debate on S. 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Senator Cantwell will be comanaging this bill, and I thank her very \nmuch for her strong leadership.\n  The vote that is going to occur at 2:20 p.m. is a very important \nvote.\n  I rise today to oppose the attempt to override President Obama's veto \nmessage of S. 1, the very first bill the Senate majority brought to the \nfloor.\n  As I look at this bill, it says to me that the only people who are \nhelped by this bill are the big Canadian special oil interests.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Keystone Pipeline is presented as \nsomething that is going really to help this economy and help oil \nprices. I think the only thing it helps, frankly, are the special \ninterests in Canada--the special big oil interests--which, by the way, \nwill carry the filthiest, dirtiest, tar sands oil into our great \nNation.\n  If we look at the history of the tar sands, we will find that misery \nfollows the tar sands. We still have terrible problems in Michigan and \nArkansas because there was a spill of this dirty, filthy oil, and they \ncannot clean it up because it is so, so difficult to clean.\n  This is a picture of a tar sands spill in 2013 in Mayflower, AR. That \nhas not been cleaned up because this is tar sands oil. We had a spill \nin Michigan, and we know that since 2011 they have not been able to \nclean up that spill. So why would we build a pipeline to bring dirty, \nfilthy oil into our great Nation and our great communities when we know \nthe dangers?\n  Mr. President, I ask again that there be order in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know Senators have an opportunity to \ntalk to one another, and I appreciate that, but it is hard to make our \nthoughts come out right when there is so much talking in the Senate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer very much.\n  Here is the deal. Why on Earth would the Republicans make the first \nbill a bill to help Canadian special oil interests that will bring in \ntar sands oil and has caused terrible problems for our communities? It \nis the hardest oil to clean up. Why would they do it, and why would \nthey go against public opinion?\n  A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that 61 percent of \nAmericans support the President's position on this pipeline, which is: \nDon't stop the process. Keep it going. Let's see what this does to our \npeople and to our communities.\n  I spend a lot of time on environmental issues, and I am saying to you \nthat as you look at the environmental laws of our great Nation, we find \nthat they brought such a better quality of life to people. We can turn \nthat around if we decide at this point--there are all of the challenges \nwe face in our communities, such as, the challenges of lung disease, \nthe challenges of heart disease, and the challenges of stroke. That is \nwhat happens from the pollution we get from the tar sands oil.\n  Earlier I said that misery follows tar sands. I met with the Canadian \npeople who live near the tar sands excavation site. They have terrible \nrates of cancer.\n  The bottom line is that because of climate change--and we see it all \naround us. Just the other day we learned a remote Alaskan village has \nto be relocated due to climate. We know the impact of this dirty tar \nsands oil on that, and we know what happens when the tar sands pipeline \nspills. We know all of these things.\n  I think the President is right by allowing the process to continue. \nHe was very right to veto this bill, and I hope we will have enough \nvotes to sustain his veto.\n  I yield the floor for my friend Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues not to \noverride the President's veto of this special-interest piece of \nlegislation.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from California for her leadership on \nthis issue and for her constant involvement in making sure that \nnational environmental and safety standards are adhered to. She has \nbeen a great advocate throughout this process and I very much \nappreciate her voice as we close the debate about the Keystone Pipeline \nlegislation.\n  This bill to approve the Keystone Pipeline undermines a well-\nestablished process for determining what is in the national interests. \nIf we overrode the President's veto, we would be subverting safety and \nenvironmental standards that are important to the American people.\n  I am glad the President vetoed this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues not to override the decision. I think the President's veto \nmessage said it best:\n\n       Through this bill, the United States Congress attempts to \n     circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining \n     whether or not building and operating a cross-border pipeline \n     serves the national interest.\n       . . . And because this act of Congress conflicts with \n     established executive branch procedures and cuts short \n     thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our \n     national interest--including our security, safety, and \n     environment--it has earned my veto.\n\n  So the President sums it up pretty much, I think. Why circumvent the \nprocess? The people who have been advocates for the pipeline have been \ncircumventing the process all the way through. They circumvented the \nprocess by not going through the utility commission in their State, the \npublic utility commission, and instead wrote legislation around that. \nThat legislation has been challenged in court. The rest of it has been \nan enormous process here in Washington, DC. While the company was \nnegotiating with the State Department, it was also supporting efforts \nto circumvent that process at the State Department and just get a \nrubberstamp on their permit, saying ``project approved.'' I think this \nproject, as does every other project in the United States of America, \nshould follow the rules.\n  While we spent the better part of January considering this \nlegislation, there were other events that transpired. We heard a lot \nabout the routing and that it was a settled matter. Since January, it \nis worth noting that Nebraska landowners have taken new steps to defend \ntheir rights as private property owners. On January 9, 2015, the \nNebraska Supreme Court upheld a special carveout of TransCanada to site \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. They did this even though four judges who \naddressed the question said this carveout was unconstitutional.\n  After the setback, several landowners whose property would be seized \nalong the proposed route filed a new suit and hopefully stopped the \nseizure of their land. Last month--just this past February--two \nNebraska district courts have issued temporary injunctions enjoining \nTransCanada's effort to acquire rights of way to support the Keystone \nPipeline by eminent domain. So at this moment here in the Senate, with \nthe vote imminent, the pipeline's route through Nebraska is still in \ndoubt because the new lawsuit challenges the Governor's ability to \napprove it.\n  It is also worth noting that South Dakota will hold a new hearing on \nthe proposed route of the pipeline through their State in May. At this \ntime we simply don't know whether South Dakota will make the same \ndecision it did when it first approved the route 3 years ago. The \nsituation in Nebraska and South Dakota makes it clear that even if this \nbill were to become law, the Keystone Pipeline will not get built any \ntime soon.\n  I know my colleagues would like to rush the process, and they will \ntalk about all of the various steps in the process where this project \ngot delayed. But who said building a pipeline through the United States \nof America by a foreign interest should get ``expedited approval'' \nstamped on it from the very beginning? That is what they have done. \nThey have circumvented what is the process in the State, which should \nhave been through the utilities commission, and they have tried to \ncircumvent the process here in the Senate.\n  So I hope we will not override the President's veto, but give the \nPresident of the United States the ability to still consider these \nnational interests of the environment and security.\n  We had a pretty robust debate here on the Senate floor, and many of \nthe issues that would have been important my colleagues voted to say we \nshouldn't consider--environmental issues. So I get that on the other \nside of the aisle, there are people who want to give a pass-go, a \nspeedy permit to this process. I urge my colleagues to not override the \nPresident, but allow him to do the homework that is needed on security, \non the environment, and on making sure that due process is followed.\n  I ask my colleagues to not override the President's veto.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came here to speak on another topic, but \nlet me interject in light of the comments from our colleagues from \nacross the aisle on the Keystone XL Pipeline. Everybody says, on a \nbipartisan basis, We want job-creating legislation. We want to \nfacilitate the creation of new jobs here in America. When it comes to \nvoting, our friends across the aisle seem to be stuck on voting against \njob-creating legislation, because our State Department has estimated \nthat as many as 42,000 jobs would be created by the construction of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  The thing that mystifies me the most about this debate is at last \ncount, we had roughly 2.5 million miles of pipelines crisscrossing \nAmerica. I have come to the floor before and I have suggested that \npeople might want to do a search on their laptop or on their tablet for \noil and gas pipelines, and they will see a map of those pipelines, and \nit looks like a spaghetti bowl, because they are everywhere. Indeed, we \nalso know this is the most efficient and the safest way to transport \nnatural gas and crude as well.\n  So I remain mystified by the fact that the President and many in his \nparty seem determined to try to kill what is clearly job-creating, \nenergy-\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\nproviding legislation that would be from a friendly source.\n\n\n            The Israeli Prime Minister's Speech To Congress\n\n  Mr. President, turning to the Middle East, yesterday, as we all know, \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered what can only be \ncharacterized as a powerful and important message about the common \nthreats to the national security of Israel and the United States. \nAgain, only in Washington would a speech such as this be controversial. \nI think most people would be concerned enough about the subject matter \nof what he talked about that they would want to hear the insights and \ninformation he delivered in that speech. It was a powerful and \nimportant message, and really a call to arms for the United States and \nour allies in Israel against the threat of radical Islam, particularly \nin the form of Iranian terrorism.\n\n  His words reminded me why--as I know many on both sides of the aisle \nagree--we have no closer Middle Eastern ally than Israel. \nUnfortunately, his speech also reinforced the belief I have held for \nmany years that we have no bigger adversary in the Middle East than \nIran.\n  The cold, hard truth is that today, more than ever, Iran is a terror-\nsponsoring theocracy that is actively pursuing a nuclear weapons \ncapability and trying to establish an Iranian axis of power from Tehran \nto Damascus to Beirut to Gaza. Iran claims a right to enrich uranium \nfor peaceful purposes, but its leaders have routinely lied and \nattempted to deceive inspectors in the past as a matter of standard \npractice.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu also reminded all of us whose memories might \nhave dimmed that over the last 30 years, Iran has engaged in a war by \nproxy against the United States and our allies. I was reminded by a \nmember of my staff of an article that came out in 2011 in the National \nJournal. The heading of it is: ``Record Number of U.S. Troops Killed by \nIranian Weapons.'' It tells the tragic story that June of 2011 was the \ndeadliest month in 2 years for U.S. troops, with 14 killed. These were \nprimarily by Iranian-backed militias using very deadly weapons called \nexplosively formed penetrators that could literally cut through the \nsteel in our humvees and other armored vehicles like a hot knife \nthrough butter.\n  So given this track record that we were reminded of by the Prime \nMinister yesterday, and just the remainder that I have tried to provide \nhere with this article, do we really believe that Iran would use its \nnuclear weapons in a way that would not make the world more unstable \nand less safe? Do we really believe that Iran, were they to get a \nnuclear weapon, won't give it to the same proxies that have been \nkilling Americans and our allies in the Middle East and around the \nworld, including the Shia militia, Hezbollah, Hamas, or the dictator in \nSyria, Bashar al-Assad, who has now killed roughly 200,000 of his own \ncivilians in a civil war, and with almost 13 million people displaced \nnot only internally, within Syria, but in neighboring countries and the \nlike?\n  So as the P5+1 negotiations involving the United States continue, \nthere remain serious questions about Iran's true nuclear intentions and \nabout whether the deal the Obama administration is eagerly finalizing--\nwhether it will cement Iran's status as a nuclear threshold nation. \nBased on some of the details we know so far, many of which are being \nheld very close to the vest by the administration and not being made \nknown to Congress, much less the American people, the President's deal \nwould abandon longstanding U.S. policy of preventing a nuclear-armed \nIran, period.\n  I remember when the former Secretary of Defense, Senator Hagel at the \ntime--he became the Secretary of the Department of Defense--when asked \nabout our policy toward Iran, stumbled a little bit in his answer but \nultimately said that containment was not our policy. Our policy was to \nprevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. But it appears now that the \ndeal that is being negotiated on the President's behalf by Secretary \nKerry would abandon that longstanding U.S. policy of preventing Iran \nfrom getting a nuclear weapon. Instead, it would opt for a feeble 10-\nyear containment plan. Such an outcome would be both dangerous and \nunacceptable.\n  So while I was glad to hear Leader McConnell announce yesterday that \nthe Senate will soon consider bipartisan legislation that would give \nCongress the authority to approve any agreement that is reached by the \nadministration, that was quickly replaced by confusion when I read that \nsome of my Democratic colleagues, who have shown great courage in \nurging that Congress have a role in approving any negotiated agreement \nbetween Tehran and the White House--now they are suggesting they might \nfilibuster their own bill and the vote we are going to have at 5:30 on \nMonday.\n  Yesterday, for example, one of our colleagues who had been a key \nsponsor of this bipartisan legislation said that he was outraged--\noutraged--that the Senate would vote on the very bill that bears his \nname. He indicated his outrage with the Senate not for voting on the \nsubstance of the bill, but basically because of the timing. He thought \nthe timing was wrong. In other words, he opposes voting on his own bill \nbecause of the Senate procedures and the process. I don't know how we \nexplain that back home. I couldn't sell that to my constituents in \nTexas, saying, I am a sponsor of this legislation; I think it is \nimportant and the right thing to do, but I am going to vote against it \nbecause I disagree with the majority leader's timing, or the procedure \nby which the majority leader is bringing this to a vote and debate in \nthe U.S. Senate. Good luck explaining that to our constituents.\n  I suspect who is also not concerned with the process are the Israeli \nGovernment and the millions of innocent civilians who stared down an \nIranian regime bent upon their annihilation every day. I suspect they \ncould care less about the process. What they want to do is to stop Iran \nfrom getting the bomb.\n  So I sincerely hope everyone here who has supported Israel and \nembraced a policy of blocking Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon will \ncalm down and work together and consider this important piece of \nlegislation. Because as we heard yesterday, again, from Prime Minister \nNetanyahu, it has profound implications for both our national security \nas well as the security of our best ally in the Middle East.\n  Before the Obama administration initiated these misguided \nnegotiations, Congress had created incredible economic pressure on the \nregime in Tehran through sanctions backed by the threat of military \naction. It also has helped, frankly, that America is now producing more \noil, and the price of oil is now down around $50 a barrel, more or \nless. That has put incredible financial pressure on Tehran itself, \nbecause they have basically had to finance their terrorist ambitions \naround the world through these various proxies by use of high oil \nprices. But we had imposed tremendous sanctions on Tehran, which, of \ncourse, the administration is now in the process of rolling back.\n  I believe an approach of tough sanctions is one we must return to as \nquickly as possible. The President and some of his friends have \nsuggested it is either this deal or war. That is a false choice. That \nis not true. It is either this deal or tougher sanctions, sanctions \ndesigned along with the credible threat of military action if Tehran \ncontinues on its path to get a nuclear weapon that I believe will \nultimately have the best chance of success and deter them from getting \nit.\n  The concept of good-faith negotiation, though, strikes me as a little \nimplausible when you are dealing with the rogue regime and state-\nsponsored terrorism. We simply cannot trust the Iranian leadership with \nnuclear weapons. Yet, sadly, the President seems to be traveling down a \npath to secure what he views as a legacy foreign policy accomplishment \nwhen he should be implementing an Iran policy that would best safeguard \nAmerica and our allies for years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, protecting the President's veto of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline Approval Act is about protecting the review \nprocess for this project. The President deserves to have all of the \ninput from the different agencies delivered to him so he can make his \ndecision.\n  Today in the vote that we will be having shortly, we are saying the\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\nPresident should be able to exercise his prerogative to review the \npipeline and to decide whether it is in the national interest to have \nthis pipeline constructed through the United States of America. But we \nare also protecting his prerogative to decide in the end, because this \nis a pipeline that should be rejected on its merits.\n  The pipeline fails the test on job creation. After it is built, it \nwill only have 35 to 40 permanent jobs that the United States will have \non its soil. Meanwhile, we should be having a debate about the wind \nproduction tax credit because if we extended that, we would keep 30,000 \npeople working permanently here in the United States, as this wind \nrevolution continues to explode. Last year, there were 5,000 megawatts \nof solar energy installed in the United States. That is like five huge \npowerplants. This year 7,500 megawatts, at least, of solar are going to \nbe installed in the United States. And next year 10,000 megawatts, at \nleast, in solar are going to be installed. But that tax break is \nexpiring at the end of 2016. You would think there would be an urgency \nhere on the floor of the Senate to debate the wind tax break and the \nsolar tax break which will create upwards of 250,000 jobs in the United \nStates.\n  We already have 175,000 people working in the solar industry, but \nthere is no urgency to take up wind and solar. But a pipeline from \nCanada taking the dirtiest oil in the world, tar sands--tar. Think \nabout that, tar. The tar has to be actually melted down so it can be \nput into a pipeline. It is tar, the dirtiest oil in the world, and then \na pipeline like a straw through the United States of America, built \nright down to Port Arthur, TX\n  What is so unique about Port Arthur, TX? I will tell you right now. \nIt is a tax-free export zone, and so there is the plan for the \nCanadians--build a pipeline like a straw through the United States, \nright down to a tax-free export zone, and then get that oil out of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Why is that? I will tell you right now that the price for oil in the \nUnited States is now $12 less than it is if you can get it out onto the \nglobal market. Per barrel, $12 less. You don't have to go to Harvard \nBusiness School to get a degree to put that business plan on a 3-by-5 \ncard. Get it out of the United States, and you will make $12 a barrel \nmore.\n  The advocates for the pipeline say that is not going to happen. That \nis why I made the amendment on the Senate floor. The oil will not be \nexported. If we are going to take all of the environmental risks, then \nwe should receive the benefits of the oil being here in the United \nStates.\n  Why is that important? It is important for this reason: We are--the \nUnited States is--the largest importer of oil in the world. China does \nnot import as much oil as we do. We are the leader. You might see these \nads on television where the American Petroleum Institute and other oil \ncompanies advertise that with regard to what a great job we are doing \nin producing more oil in the United States. And we are producing more \noil in the United States. Let's take note of that. The truth is we are \nstill 5 million barrels a day short. This pipeline will be moving maybe \n800,000 barrels of oil from Canada right through the United States, \nwhich could reduce our dependence upon imported oil, but it is going \nthrough a tax-free export zone. So we know what is going to happen.\n  Why is that important? It is important because we export young men \nand women in uniform every single day to the Middle East to protect the \nships with oil coming into the United States that we import from \nKuwait, from Saudi Arabia, from the other countries around the world. \nSo why would we be exporting oil out of the United States while we are \nexporting young men and women in uniform out of America who then \nprotect oil coming back in from countries in the Middle East? That \nmakes no sense.\n  That is what this pipeline is all about. It is all about getting some \nbenefit for the United States. Climate change, big loser. It is the \ndirtiest oil in the world. The Canadians actually escape paying the tax \nin the event that there is an oilspill. They don't have to pay into \nthat fund, either, that American oil companies do. And then \nnotwithstanding their ads on television that say they are going to keep \nthe oil in the United States, they bitterly object to any provision \nbeing voted here that keeps it in the United States while they run ads \non television saying North American energy independence, that is their \ngreatest goal.\n  You can't have it both ways. Life is not like that. Either your ads \nare saying what your goal is, North American energy independence, or \nyou are going to export it. But you can't have it both ways, do one \nthing on television and then another thing in real life and say to the \nSenate, please don't put any restrictions on our ability to export this \noil. That is the challenge for us here.\n  By the way, one other thing. If we keep the oil here in the United \nStates, that is going to keep a pressure to keep the price of gasoline \nlower, because the more oil we have here in the United States, the \nlower the price of gasoline. Every time there is a 1-penny reduction in \nthe price of gasoline, it is $1 billion that goes into the pocket of \nconsumers in America. One penny equals a billion. So when the price of \noil, gasoline, drops 10 cents, that is $10 billion. When it drops $1, \nthat is $100 billion. It is down by $1. It is down by more than $1 over \nwhere it was this time last year. That is a lot of money that goes as a \nstimulus into the pockets of Americans who can spend it on other \nthings. But this oil is going out of the country, so the pressure it \nwould keep to help our manufacturers, to help our drivers, is not going \nto exist. It fails on each one of these items: One, it gets exported. \nTwo, they don't pay their full taxes, or any at all, to the Oilspill \nLiability Fund. We don't keep it here to keep the price lower for \nAmerican drivers. I understand the Canadians want to make the most \nmoney by getting out of the open market. That hurts you. That hurts us. \nThat hurts our drivers. That is the challenge.\n  It fails each one of these tests. It fails on the climate change. It \nfails on the export test because it goes overseas. It fails on the tax \nissue. It fails on the process issue of trying to short-circuit the \nPresident's prerogative to be able to consider this in a comprehensive \nsense.\n  The President has correctly vetoed this bill. The President is \nstanding up for the American taxpayer, for the American consumer, for \nthe environment of the United States. He is asking the right questions. \nHe is doing the right things.\n  I urge my colleagues here on the Senate floor, within the next hour, \nto vote to sustain the veto of President Obama on this policy which \ndoes not advance the best interests of the United States of America.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask unanimous consent that all time within the quorum \ncall be divided equally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Human Trafficking\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about human sex \ntrafficking--an issue that plagues the world and our Nation. Today I \njoin my colleagues, Senators Cornyn, Wyden, Klobuchar, and King, in \nsupporting legislation to help fight this evil and to stop it from \nspreading. Sex trafficking is real. It is affecting millions of people \naround the world. We should not tolerate it, and we cannot turn a blind \neye. This modern-day form of slavery has continued to grow in the \nshadows all around us. It is time to take action.\n  The scale of this problem is difficult to calculate; yet many \nestimates, including those from the United Nations and various human \nrights organizations, show that millions of human\n\n[[Page S1278]]\n\nbeings are being trafficked every year. Meanwhile, the criminals who \nforce these victims into slavery profit to the tune of $32 billion \nannually.\n  Mr. President, 300,000 children right here in the United States are \nat risk of becoming victims of this vile practice. Teenagers are the \nprimary targets. These kids are being sold into a life of physical and \nemotional abuse. Often they are runaways who flee violent households \nlooking for a way out. Women and girls represent a disproportionate \namount of those trafficked around the world, but this does affect all \nof us. The pain and suffering victims experience is hard to describe in \nwords. Simply put, it is evil. We must do more to stop this plague, and \nour work begins by setting a clear example.\n  This Sunday we will commemorate International Women's Day. As we \ncelebrate the progress women have made here in the United States and \naround the world, we must also use this moment to remind ourselves of \nthe work that still needs to be done.\n  As I mentioned, Senator Cornyn and I, along with several of our \ncolleagues, introduced a new bill to address this issue. This \nlegislation would set up a deficit-neutral fund to support people \nabused by sex trafficking. Through enhanced reporting and mechanisms \nthat would reduce demand, this bill can serve as the next step in \nproviding care for victims of trafficking and child pornography. \nFurthermore, Senator Cornyn's bill protects victims in courts by \ntreating the traffickers as violent criminals. By labeling traffickers \nin this way, convicts can now be detained while they await their \njudicial proceeding. Funding for the bill comes from increased fines \nplaced on those convicted of trafficking.\n  While nothing can erase the pain inflicted on these victims, we must \ndo what we can to make a difference. I encourage all of my colleagues \nto join in this effort and stand against this vile practice.\n  A number of my colleagues have other bills as well. We should take \nthe time to consider solutions that are offered by all of them. Our \ngovernment has a responsibility to stand up and to act for those whose \nvoices grow weak in the shadows of this imperfect world. This is our \nmoment to do something. These victims do not have time to wait. We must \nact now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time spent in quorum calls before \nthe 2:20 vote this afternoon be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n 150th Anniversary of the Second Inaugural Address of President Lincoln\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is the 150th anniversary of the \nsecond inaugural address of President Abraham Lincoln. Later on this \nevening there will be an observance in the Rotunda sponsored by the \nIllinois State Society and the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation \nto observe this anniversary. My colleague Senator Kirk is scheduled to \nbe there; former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood; Stephen Lang; and \nsome of the most distinguished Lincoln scholars in America: Dr. Edna \nGreene Medford, Chief Justice Frank Williams of Rhode Island, and the \nmost prolific Lincoln writer I know, Harold Holzer from New York.\n  There have been 15,000 books written about Abraham Lincoln. I think \nMr. Holzer has written about half of them. He is not only prolific, but \nhe is profound in his observations about this great man's life. He was \njoined by Edith Holzer, his wife, who stood by him through his Lincoln \ntravails.\n  Historians disagree on whether the second inaugural address of \nAbraham Lincoln was his greatest speech or his second greatest. I am in \nthe latter camp. I accord that highest honor to the Gettysburg Address \nfor its brevity as well as its inspiration, but both speeches are \nimmortal.\n  I am not a Lincoln scholar, but my life as a Springfield attorney, \nelected Congressman, and Senator from Illinois has taken me to some of \nthe same streets and same buildings that were part of Abraham Lincoln's \nlife.\n  Although he tried mightily to be elected to the Senate in 1858, \nAbraham Lincoln fell short. It was in that campaign of 1858 that he \ndebated Stephen Douglas. At the end of the debates and when the votes \nwere cast, Stephen Douglas was the victor in that senatorial contest in \nIllinois. Of course, the same two men faced off again 2 years later for \nthe Presidency. But that Senate seat, the Douglas seat that was \ncontested in the 1858 election, is the same seat I am honored to hold \ntoday in the State of Illinois.\n  We can feel Abraham Lincoln's presence in this building, particularly \nnear the Senate Chamber. There is a magnificent room off the Senate \nChamber known as the President's Room. It is one of the historic rooms \nin the Capitol.\n  It was in this room in April of 1862 that President Lincoln signed \nthe bill outlawing slavery in the District of Columbia. It was in this \nroom in 1965 that Dr. Martin Luther King and other leaders watched \nLyndon Baines Johnson sign the Voting Rights Act, prohibiting \ndiscrimination at the polls--100 years after Lincoln's death. It was in \nthe same room on January 20, 2009, that a newly inaugurated President \nBarack Obama signed his first official documents as President of the \nUnited States. And it was in this room that Abraham Lincoln worked long \ninto the night before his second inauguration, signing and vetoing \nbills passed in the final hours of one Congress, before the next \nCongress was sworn in. Imagine that, Congress leaving important \nbusiness until the last minute.\n  President Lincoln was working in the President's Room on March 3, \n1865, when he received an urgent message from GEN Ulysses Grant. GEN \nRobert E. Lee was seeking a peace conference to negotiate an end to the \nwar. Grant asked the President, his Commander in Chief: What should I \nreply?\n  After conferring with Secretary of War Stanton and Secretary of State \nSeward, Lincoln sent word back to General Grant that he was not to meet \nwith Lee ``unless it be for the capitulation of General Lee's army.''\n  The following day, in his second inaugural address, March 4, 1865, \nLincoln explained more fully why he had refused Lee's request for a \nnegotiated settlement. He said: ``With firmness in the right as God \ngives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are \nin.''\n  Less than 5 weeks later, General Lee surrendered unconditionally at \nAppomattox. The cannons would fall silent. After 4 years of horrific \ndeath and destruction, the worst war and the most costly war in the \nhistory of the United States was over. But the work was not.\n  President Lincoln told us in his second inaugural address the urgent \nchallenge is not only to win the war, but to win the peace by achieving \ntrue reconciliation. Another President could certainly have been \nvindictive toward the South--that had been the practice of the day and \nit is what many people wanted in the North--but Lincoln understood that \nif America remained divided after the hostilities ceased, then the \nterrible sacrifices of war would have been in vain. So he counseled in \nthat immortal inaugural address: ``With malice toward none, charity for \nall.'' Let us bind up the wounds here, and not inflict new injuries. \nThat was how the Union would be reunited and persevere.\n  Six weeks later after this speech, Abraham Lincoln was cut down by an \nassassin's bullet. He was, in fact, the last casualty of America's war \nwithin its own boundaries.\n  That address, that second inaugural address, remains the second \nshortest in the Nation's history, only 703 words. Lincoln spoke so \nbriefly that many people were still arriving after he finished. As at \nGettysburg, some listeners were mystified by the President's brevity. \nFew understood the genius of the speech at that moment. Frederick \nDouglass was an exception. He said to Mr. Lincoln afterwards, ``Mr. \nLincoln, that was a sacred effort.''\n  In the century and a half since his death, we have made uneven \nprogress in achieving the kind of America Abraham Lincoln believed we \ncould be. A\n\n[[Page S1279]]\n\nfull century passed before African Americans in the South were \nguaranteed the most basic right of citizenship, the right to vote.\n  If President Lincoln were here today, I think he would be happy to \nsee how our Union has survived. I think he would be pleased and \nastonished to see that America had elected and reelected another lanky \nlawyer from Illinois, and an African American, to be our President.\n  I also think he would challenge us. When our government ``of the \npeople, by the people, for the people'' is under threat from a cabal of \nsecret, special interest money that can buy elections, I think \nPresident Lincoln would tell us we have unfinished work to do.\n  When we neglect to bind up the wounds of war of even one soldier \nreturning from war, and neglect to care for widows and orphans, Lincoln \nwould have reminded us that we have unfinished work to do.\n  And when the right to vote is under systematic attack in so many \nStates for obvious political reasons, there is still work to do.\n  When Americans who work long and hard can't earn enough to provide \nfor their families, I think Lincoln would tell us to put our shoulder \nto the plough and finish the work of creating a genuine opportunity for \nall Americans.\n  We can see in the second inaugural and in the Gettysburg Address one \nreason that Abraham Lincoln remains our greatest President. He shows us \nthat America is capable of constant progress toward our professed \ncreed. We can love our country and be determined to make it better.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Bill Bartholomay\n\n  Mr. President, even by Chicago standards, this has been some winter. \nFrom Boston to Birmingham, AL, tens of millions of Americans have been \nclobbered this winter by record snowfalls. In fact, we are heading for \nthe exits in Washington this afternoon with the threat of another \nwinter storm.\n  That may be why so many of us are so happy this week is finally here \nand we can literally count the days until spring training of baseball \nbegins. In cities throughout the Sun Belt, mighty Casey is smiling \nagain. More than Punxsutawney Phil or the sighting of the first robin, \nspring training for many of us marks the unofficial arrival of spring.\n  Few people on Earth are happier about the start of the baseball \nseason than Bill Bartholomay, a man who has done so much for the cities \nof Chicago and Atlanta, for the sport of baseball, and for our Nation.\n  Bill Bartholomay has achieved more in his one life than many talented \npeople in five. He is phenomenally successful as an entrepreneur, and \nhe has built some of the most successful insurance brokerage firms in \nthe world. Bill has owned a restaurant, a candy company, and a chain of \ntoy stores.\n  He helped a friend and business partner by the name of Ted Turner \ntransform CNN from an upstart news station to one of the most powerful \nnews organizations in the world.\n  Bill Bartholomay is more than a successful businessman, he is a \nprincipled civic leader and a true philanthropist. On top of all that, \nhe is chairman emeritus of the Atlanta Braves. He is a man who half a \ncentury ago, with support from leaders, including the father of the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr., brought Major League Baseball to \nAmerica's Deep South. What a life.\n  In 1962, Bill Bartholomay and a group of investors bought the \nMilwaukee Braves. The Braves roster then included a lot of great \nlegendary ballplayers. Among them was a young catcher with a rocket for \nan arm whose mother had to sign his first major league contract because \nhe hadn't reached the age of 21. His name was Joe Torre. But the Braves \ngreatest player then and ever was a man named Henry Aaron, ``Hammerin' \nHank.''\n  In 1966, Bill Bartholomay and his partners moved the Braves from \nMilwaukee to Atlanta. Here is something that will do your heart good. \nGo to YouTube and watch the video of that magic night, April 8, 1974, \nwhen Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record to become baseball's all-time \nhome-run champ, a record he would hold for 33 years. For anyone under \nthe age of 50, it may be impossible now to fully appreciate what that \nmoment meant.\n  It was 6 years almost to the day after Dr. King's assassination. For \nmore than a year, as Hank Aaron had closed in on Babe Ruth's fabled \nrecord of 714 home runs, he had been cheered by many, but also \nsubjected to ugly racist threats and taunts. There were people who just \nseethed at the idea that Babe Ruth's immortal record would be broken by \na Black baseball player.\n  Years later, Hank Aaron would acknowledge that the anger and the \njeers wore on him. They worried Bill Bartholomay too.\n  So watch that clip on YouTube, April 8, 1974. It was the Braves home \nopener against the Los Angeles Dodgers. More than 53,000 fans were \nstanding for that great moment--a record crowd.\n  It is the fourth inning. Henry ``Hank'' Aaron is up at bat. The count \nis 1 and 0. And then it happens: Aaron swings and smashes the ball over \nthe center field fence.\n  The fans roar. Fireworks fill the sky over the stadium. As Aaron \nrounds the bases, the Dodgers infielders reach out to shake his hand.\n  He crosses homeplate, surrounded by teammates, his beaming wife, and \nparents. And standing right next to him was Bill Bartholomay.\n  It had been a dozen years since Bill and his partners had bought the \nBraves and 8 years since they moved to Atlanta. Part of their reason \nfor moving the Braves to Atlanta was because Atlanta was working hard \nin the 1960s to become the leading city of the new South, a city that \nwould move beyond the old legacy of Jim Crow to a new era.\n  Leaders, including Dr. King, believed that Major League Baseball \ncould help to create that new Atlanta, and Bill Bartholomay and his \npartners wanted to be part of that dream. Eight years after he moved \nthe team to Atlanta, there he stood with baseball's new home-run king, \na man who had started his career in the old Negro League, who had just \nbroken the most revered record in Major League Baseball and who would \nbecome a symbol of immense pride for Atlanta and all of America. That \nwas one of the many great moments for the Braves under Bill \nBartholomay.\n  Since he moved the team to Atlanta in 1966, Bill has witnessed the \nBraves winning 16 division championships, including a record-setting 14 \nin a row, 5 National League pennants. And in 1995 the Braves went all \nthe way, winning the World Series.\n  Bill no longer owns the Braves, but he is still closely connected to \nthe team and has served as the chairman emeritus since 2003. He is an \nactive member of the MLB owners group.\n  Bill Bartholomay grew up in Illinois in a family where his father and \ngrandfather had made good money in the insurance brokerage business. He \nwas the second of two boys, and he grew up in Winnetka, IL, just \noutside of Chicago, in a big house. The Bartholomay family were friends \nwith both the Wrigley family, who owned the Chicago Cubs, and the \nComiskey family, who owned the White Sox.\n  As far back as he can remember, Bill loved baseball and so did his \nmom. They used to go to Cubs games together.\n  At North Shore Country Day School, his eighth grade phys ed \ninstructor thought Bill loved baseball a little too much. He sent home \na report card that said:\n\n       Billy is very cooperative in play activities. While his \n     ability is not great, he makes up to a large degree by his \n     enthusiasm and interest. My greatest concern with him is that \n     he seems to borrow much of his ideas of conduct from \n     professional baseball.\n\n  That teacher needn't have worried. The lessons of baseball have \nserved Bill Bartholomay very well. They have inspired and shaped his \nentire amazing life.\n  One of Bill's favorite sayings is: ``Start strong, finish strong and \nplay all nine innings.'' Translation: Give it everything you have got--\nno half measures.\n  That attitude has enabled Bill to build or even help build a number \nof powerful insurance brokerage firms, along with other diverse \nbusinesses.\n  In 2003, he became vice chairman of Willis Group Holdings, one of the \nlargest insurance brokers in the world. He increased their presence in \nChicago to the point where they became the regional headquarters of \nwhat was formerly known as Sears Tower, now\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\nknown as the Willis Tower. Today that office anchors Chicago's place as \na first-rate place to operate a global company.\n  Bill is more than a businessman, more than a man of baseball; he is a \ncivic leader as well. In the early 1980s, then-Chicago mayor, the late \nJames Byrne, asked Bill to serve on the park commission, overseeing \nChicago's 400 parks. Bill never said no to public service. So even \nthough he had five teenaged kids and a number of businesses, he said he \nwould serve for 1 year. He ended up serving for 23 years, including \nmany as commission chairman.\n  All told, three of Chicago's mayors recognized Bill's talents as a \nbridge builder in Chicago. He made sure the commission focused not only \non the wealthy parts of the city but all of the city.\n  Bill created a charitable foundation and he has helped to make it \nwork and helped millions of others. He is a generous man and he is \ngenerous in praise of others.\n  I wish to give a short story that I read when I was reading a book \none day and stumbled on this little episode in Bill's life that really \ntells a story. It is a story about another baseball legend, a man by \nthe name of Satchel Paige, who may have been the best baseball pitcher \never. He was an American treasure.\n  He was a star in the Negro Leagues during the Jim Crow era. He later \nbecame the first African-American pitcher in the American League and \nthe first Negro League player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  He played for an astonishing 250 teams in his 40-year career. He used \nto pitch year around, often on back-to-back days. He hurled exhibition \ngames on his day off. He spent the winter months playing in Cuba, the \nDominican Republic, and Mexico.\n  In 1968 Satchel Paige was 62 years old, and despite all the time he \nhad played in baseball, he hadn't played long enough to qualify for a \npension. He fell 6 months short. So Satchel Paige sent a letter to \nevery Major League Baseball team asking them if they would consider \nhiring him as a coach, and if they would for 6 months, he would qualify \nfor a pension.\n  Well, you can guess who replied. It was Bill Bartholomay. Bill \nBartholomay, in a real true act of kindness, said: ``Baseball would \nhave been guilty of negligence should it not assure this legendary \nfigure a place in the pension plan.''\n  Bill made sure Satchel Paige got his pension. He hired him to be the \nBraves' pitcher-coach-trainer just long enough for him to meet his \npension needs. In case there was any doubt about what he was doing, he \nassigned Satchel Paige the number 65, the age at which his retirement \nsalary would kick in.\n  But there was another reason the Braves hired Satchel Paige. That \nsummer--the summer of 1968--riots were raging and cities were burning \nacross America in the wake of Dr. King's assassination. Bill \nBartholomay believed that having a bridge builder such as Satchel Paige \nmight help diffuse tensions in Atlanta, and he was right.\n  Satchel did that partly by signing autographs and spending time with \nfans and serving as a good will ambassador. Even though his title was \ntrainer, what Satchel Paige really wanted to do, even at age 62, was \npitch. The club didn't care for the idea. They were afraid his eyesight \nwasn't good enough and a line drive might knock him off the mound, but \nSatchel insisted. He said he could tell by the crack of the bat where \nthe ball was headed.\n  In 1969, Satchel Paige pitched a couple of innings in an exhibition \ngame for the Braves' highest level minor league team, the Triple-A \nRichmond team. So picture this: Satchel Paige on the mound beaming, and \nwho steps up to the plate? Hank Aaron. The best pitcher in baseball \nhistory against the best hitter.\n  Strike one, strike two, and finally Hank Aaron swings hard, gets a \npiece of the ball and pops out to third. Old Satchel still had it.\n  In his 1966 Hall of Fame induction speech, Ted Williams urged the \ninclusion of Negro League players to the Hall of Fame. Satchel Paige \nwas elected as the first Negro League player to be inducted.\n  Satchel Paige once said: ``Ain't no man can avoid being born average, \nbut there ain't no man got to be common.''\n  Bill Bartholomay has led an uncommonly good life as a business \nleader, as a pioneer in baseball, as a civic leader, as a \nphilanthropist, and as a man who sensed in his lifetime an opportunity \nto build bridges in America and make us a better nation through the \ngame of baseball and through the integration of that sport. He served \nthe cities of Chicago and Atlanta in an extraordinary way, but he \nserved America as well. He proved his old phys ed instructor from grade \nschool wrong by showing that the rules of baseball are pretty good \nrules for life after all.\n  On this day, as we start spring training and a new baseball season, I \nwish the very best to the very best--Bill Bartholomay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address the motion to \noverride the President's veto of S. 1, which would force approval of \nthe construction of the Keystone Pipeline to transport tar sands heavy \noil from Canada to the gulf coast. We will be having that vote in just \na while from now.\n  My key consideration today is this. What would the impact of this \nbill be on global warming? The reason that is the core question I am \nraising is that already we are seeing extensive damage to our rural \nresources around the world from our warming planet. We are seeing this \nin Oregon, and we are seeing, therefore, an impact on our future \neconomic prospects.\n  To put it very simply, the burning of fossil fuels is damaging our \nforests, our farming, and our fishing. By many estimates, to contain 2 \ndegrees Celsius, which is almost 4 degrees Fahrenheit, we must \ntransition aggressively and rapidly from burning conventional fossil \nfuels for energy toward the use of nonfossil renewable energy.\n  Now, this shift is well within our power. It is well within our \ntechnology. But do we have the political will to make this happen? And \nthat test is before us in the vote we are taking today.\n  Building the Keystone Pipeline opens the faucet to rapid exploitation \nof massive, new, unconventional reserves called tar sands, and it takes \nus in exactly the opposite direction from where we need to go. Indeed, \nthe pipeline locks us into utilizing the dirtiest fossil fuels on the \nplanet for a generation, and it accelerates human civilization down the \nroad towards catastrophic climate change. Thus, building this pipeline \nis a mistake, and there is a lot to be concerned about.\n  Now, global warming isn't some imaginary scenario 50 years from now \nabout some computer model predicting something bad will happen. No, it \nis about facts on the ground right now.\n  The warmest 10 years on record for global average surface temperature \nhave occurred in the last 12 years. And 2014, the calendar year we just \npassed, was the single warmest year on record. While some Senators may \ncome to this floor and say that it is just an anomaly here or an \nanomaly there, it is not. The facts are in. When we have 10 of the \nwarmest years on record within the last 12 years, we know something \ndramatically is happening to the globe.\n  The average forest fire season is getting longer. Since the 1980s the \nseason has grown 60 to 80 days longer than it was before. That means \nthat with each year passing the fire season is growing by an average of \nabout 2 days, and the number of acres consumed annually by wildfires \nhas doubled to more than 7 million acres. This is an enormous impact, \nand those fires themselves put additional carbon dioxide into the \natmosphere. So we start to see a feedback mechanism that is \naccelerating us down this road to catastrophic change.\n  The snowpack is decreasing in our Oregon mountains, the Cascade \nMountains, which means smaller and warmer streams, which are certainly \nnot good for trout. But it also means less water for irrigation. We \nhave right now virtually no snow in the Cascades. At this point we \nshould have a substantial snowpack. So the possibility of yet another \nmajor drought faces us this coming summer.\n  We had the worst-ever drought in the Klamath Basin, a large \nagricultural\n\n[[Page S1281]]\n\nbasin in southern Oregon, in 2001. We had another devastating drought \nin 2010--a near worst-ever drought--and another devastating drought in \n2013. And here we are this year, with virtually no snowpack to provide \nirrigation water during the summer. That is a very big deal.\n  It isn't just farming and forestry. It is also fishing. The carbon \ndioxide that we are pumping into the air is absorbed through wave \naction. It becomes carbonic acid. We can envision mankind pouring vast \nvats of carbonic acids into the ocean, because that is essentially the \neffect of what we are doing. If you think putting all that acid into \nthe ocean wouldn't be a good idea and would have bad effects, you are \nright. The ocean has become 30 percent more acidic than it was before \nthe industrial revolution--before we started burning coal and other \nfossil fuels as a major source of energy--and we can start to see the \nimpact.\n  At the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery on the Oregon coast, we have \na big problem. The big problem is that the baby oysters are having \ntrouble pulling enough carbon out of the water in order to create their \nshells because the water is too acidic. That is a little bit like the \ncanary in the coal mine. If the oysters are having trouble, what other \nshellfish are being affected by the increasing level of acidity?\n  As humans on our planet, we have the moral responsibility to exercise \nwise stewardship of our resources--a responsibility to this generation \nbut a profound responsibility to the generations to come.\n  Now, our youth tend to have a better understanding of this than do \nthe lawmakers who come to the floor of the Senate. Our youth widely \nrank global warming as a major concern, a major issue they want to see \nus take on. They will face the challenges that we will leave behind. \nBut here is the problem: If we wait to tackle global warming until--we \nhave pages on the floor--our 15- and 16-year-old pages are in office, \nwhen they are in their forties and their fifties, then it will be \nalmost impossible to address this issue because of the feedback loops \nthat are occurring.\n\n  I was watching yesterday a time-lapsed series of ice in the Arctic, \nand I can tell you that essentially, as viewed from North America, \nthere was a swirling mass of ice--and this was over several decades--\nand that swirling mass became less with every passing year, to where we \nare halfway to starting to be ice-free in the summer. That is a massive \nchange happening within a single human lifetime which is but a blink in \ntime when you think about the age and course of this planet.\n  So big changes are occurring, and when those changes occur, we do \nhave additional problems arise. All of that open water in the Arctic \nabsorbs more sunlight. That is what makes the water blue and it becomes \nwarmer; whereas, the ice reflects the sunlight and keeps the water \ncooler. Therefore, we have a magnification of the effect of global \nwarming at the poles. This is not a good thing.\n  So whether we are looking at the impact on our farming or the impact \non our forests which are burning or the impact on our oceans and our \nfisheries which are becoming too acidic, we have a responsibility to \naddress those issues. That means we are going to have to not burn all \nthe fossil fuel that we have been clever enough to find in the crust of \nthe Earth.\n  It is estimated that we would have to leave four-fifths of the fossil \nfuels we already have identified that are in the ground. We have to \nleave it in the ground rather than burn it if we are not going to \nexceed 2 degrees centigrade in global warming. That is a huge \nchallenge.\n  That means we cannot proceed to build infrastructure designed to \naccelerate the extraction of these fossil fuels. The pipeline is \nexactly that kind of infrastructure.\n  Now, have no doubt, I love the idea of jobs and construction. That is \nwhy I am a huge supporter of the Partnership to Build America Act. The \nPartnership to Build America Act would create hundreds of thousands of \nconstruction jobs over the course of a number of years in America. That \nis the type of investment in jobs and construction and infrastructure \nwe should make, but we shouldn't be investing infrastructure that is \ngoing to do profound damage to our planet. That does not honor the \nmoral responsibility we have to the stewardship of this beautiful blue-\ngreen orb that we live on known as this planet Earth.\n  Let's honor our responsibility and let's not override the veto the \nPresident has put on this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent for up to 30 minutes to engage in \na colloquy on the Keystone Pipeline approval legislation which was \nvetoed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am here to discuss the Keystone Pipeline approval legislation and \nthe President's recent veto as well as our efforts today to override \nthat veto.\n  I will be joined in the colloquy with my distinguished colleague from \nSouth Dakota. Also our colleague on the other side of the aisle from \nWest Virginia will be joining us shortly, as well as the chairman of \nthe energy committee, our colleague from Alaska. I want to make a \ncouple points upfront and then turn to my colleague from South Dakota.\n  What I have here and have shown before on the Senate floor is the \nroute the Keystone XL Pipeline would take from the oil sands in \nHardisty, Alberta, coming down through Montana where we pick up \ndomestic crude. Often people think of it as moving Canadian crude, but \nit also picks up domestic crude in the Bakken region. Our country likes \nsweet Bakken crude oil from Montana, and then it takes it on to \nrefineries throughout the country. So that is the project we are \ntalking about.\n  This chart shows the project itself, and it shows what is going to \nhappen if we don't approve it. You have to understand, this has been \ngoing on now for over 6 years. The President has delayed this project \nfor more than 6 years, but if we don't build the pipeline to move our \ndomestic crude in the United States, then Canada will build pipelines \nto the west coast and that oil will go to China by tanker ship and be \nrefined in China.\n  Again, we go through all these different discussions, but the reality \nis the oil will be produced. The question is, Do we want to have that \noil here in our country or would we rather see it go to China?\n  Of course, if it goes to China, then not only does that affect our \nability to use the oil in our country because we don't have the \ninfrastructure to move it around safely and cost-effectively, but we \nalso then continue to import oil from the Middle East.\n  I will run through a couple more of these charts and bring us up-to-\ndate. It is not like we don't have pipelines. When the President takes \nmore than 6 years to make a decision--having such a hard time with this \npipeline--it is not that we don't have a few pipelines in the country. \nWe have millions of miles of pipeline. Of course, this is going to be \nthe latest, greatest state of the art with all the safety features--\nsomething like 53 different safety features that are required as part \nof the approval process that, as we say, has been going on for more \nthan 6 years.\n  The other point I want to make before we go into the latest status is \nthis is the finding of not one, not two, not three, not four, not five \nreports by the administration, but in fact the Obama administration's \nState Department has done five environmental impact statements, three \ndraft statements, two final statements--three draft statements and two \nfinal environmental impact statements.\n  Here is what President Obama's report states after studying the \nenvironmental impact: ``No significant environmental impact'' according \nto the U.S. State Department environmental impact statements as a \nresult of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  So here we are today, after more than 6 years in the ``approval \nprocess'' by the administration.\n  We passed this legislation with 62 votes in the Senate. It passed \nthrough the House with about 270 votes in the\n\n[[Page S1282]]\n\nHouse, a big bipartisan vote for this legislation.\n  Last Tuesday--last Tuesday we sent it to the President. We sent it to \nhim in the morning and he vetoed it the same day and had it back to us \nthat afternoon. So that was pretty efficient. We send it to him in the \nmorning and--bang--he has it back here in the afternoon.\n  His rationale for vetoing the project is he said it cut short his \nreview process. That is right out of his veto message. It cut short his \nreview process. So for somebody who figured out how to veto it in one \nday who has been studying it for over 6 years--over 6 years--and he \nvetoed it because we cut his review process short after more than 6 \nyears.\n  Subsequent to that, the President was asked by the press: Mr. \nPresident, if Congress is somehow cutting your process short, when are \nyou going to make a decision? His response to the press--I believe it \nwas last week or earlier this week--he said he is going to make a \ndecision either in a couple weeks or maybe in a couple months but \ncertainly by the end of his term.\n  My question is this, How can there be any process there? Where is the \nprocess? What process are you talking about?\n  If he delays it for more than 6 years--a situation where TransCanada, \na company that has met every single requirement of the law and \nregulations--they have met all the requirements for more than 6 years. \nThe six States on the route have all approved the project. All six \nStates on the route have approved the project. It wasn't tough; they \nhad 6 years to do it. The American people overwhelmingly support this \nproject in poll after poll, from 65 to 70 percent.\n  What process is he talking about that was cut short? There is no \nprocess there. If you go on for 6 years, where a company has spent \nmillions of dollars, taking 6 years to try to build an $8 billion \nproject that would help us create energy security in this country, \nworking with our closest friend and ally, Canada, what process is he \ntalking about? When asked: When are you going to make a decision as to \nyour process, he said: I don't know, maybe a few weeks, maybe a few \nmonths, by the end of my term, anyway. That is 8 years.\n  Isn't this a country of laws? How would you or anyone else feel--any \ncompany, large or small, anybody who feels if they comply with the law \nand they do everything they are supposed to do and they do it over and \nover again and somebody who is elected to office says, yes, you know, I \njust don't feel like it.\n  When did we cease to become a country of laws? When did we cease to \nhave a situation where we can rely on the laws and the regulations of \nthis State, whether it is an individual, a family, a community, a \ncompany or anything else?\n  So when we look at a project such as this one, that is a question we \nhave to ask ourselves, because if it can happen in this situation, \ncan't it happen in any situation? When do we as a Congress step up and \nsay: We pass the laws. We pass the laws and those laws have to be \nrespected and enforced. Isn't that our job? Isn't that our obligation? \nIsn't that why the people of this country sent us? I believe it is.\n  It is one thing to say: Well, it is that TransCanada company. They do \nbusiness in Canada. They do business here. What if it was you? What if \nit was your company? What if it was 6-plus years of your life? What if \nit was millions of your dollars? How would you feel about it?\n  Remember, America is the place people throughout history have come to \ndo business. This is where they come to do business because they can \ncount on our laws and they can count on our regulations and they can \ncount on the fact that if they made the investment, they would be able \nto do business on a certain, dependable basis. What happened to that? \nWhen we lose that, what happens to our economy?\n  With that, I would like to turn to my good friend from South Dakota. \nThis pipeline will run through his State, creating jobs and millions of \ntax dollars for his State.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from North \nDakota on this issue. He has been a fierce advocate for many months in \nthe Senate for the jobs and economic activity, the energy independence, \nand the positive benefits to our national security in building this \npipeline. The most recent development is the frustration with having \nthe President veto a bill that has more than 60 cosponsors in the \nSenate. This is a broad bipartisan bill. The Senator from North Dakota \nworked very hard to make it that way. A lot of Members on both sides of \nthe aisle support this pipeline.\n  What is striking to me about it is some of the misstatements and \nthings that have been said here recently--the President in his veto \nmessage and some of the things he said. The Washington Post Fact \nChecker, as recently as a couple days ago, pointed out that when the \nPresident said that this is going to bypass the United States and we \nare not going to get any benefit from this, not only did they give him \none, two, three--he got four Pinocchios from the Washington Post. What \nthat means, folks, is that is a really big whopper to suggest that \nthere is not going to be any benefit to the United States from this.\n  In fact, they went on to point out in that story that their estimate \nis that 70 percent of the oil to be refined would be used in this \ncountry.\n  Furthermore, as the Senator from North Dakota pointed out, this is a \nsignificant investment, obviously, by people who want to do business in \nthe United States because of our rule of law or rules and certainty \nthat come with that. The production, the oil sands up there in North \nDakota is 30 percent owned by Americans. There is a lot of American \nownership in this, and Canada is our friend and ally. Instead of \ngetting the same type or quality of oil from a country where we don't \nhave a favorable relationship--Venezuela, for instance--we can get it \nfrom Canada, and it can come through this country. The suggestion that \nit is not going to benefit anybody in this country is completely wrong.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out before that up \nto 100,000 barrels of oil a day would be put in here from his State of \nNorth Dakota and from Montana--a lot of the light, sweet crude that is \nso valued--and it would take pressure off the railroads.\n  Interestingly enough, the Senator from North Dakota pointed out that \nthe administration found no significant environmental impact. Well, \nthink about this. You are now putting this oil on a railcar or a truck, \nand the studies show that creates 28 to 42 percent more emissions than \nshipping it in a pipeline. It is going to go some way. It is going to \ngo on a truck, a railcar or a pipeline. If it goes on a railcar or a \ntruck, it will create 28 to 42 percent more emissions than transporting \nit through a pipeline. From an environmental standpoint, it makes all \nthe sense in the world.\n  As somebody who represents a border State to North Dakota, we have \nhad our own issues these last couple of years with the rail service and \ntrying to get our agriculture commodities to the marketplace. There is \nan awful lot of pressure to move oil on rail. If you can move some of \nthat in the pipeline--100,000 barrels a day--it takes a lot of pressure \noff of the rails and frees up that infrastructure and capacity to move \nagricultural commodities that are so important to both of our States.\n  There is a lot of misinformation that has been put out on this \nparticular subject. I hope we can at least have discussions based upon \na common set of facts, and most of the facts we are talking about are \nthings that have been put out by the administration.\n  My State of South Dakota--as the Senator from North Dakota \nmentioned--would be crossed by this. The estimate by the State \nDepartment was that it would create $100 million in earnings in South \nDakota, create 3,000 to 4,000 construction jobs, and generate about $20 \nmillion in property tax revenue.\n  There is an awful lot of interest in my State in what happens with \nthe economic activity, the jobs, the property tax revenue, and what \nthat could do to support local governments, law enforcement, schools, \nand those sorts of things--not to mention getting us away from the \ndependence we have on foreign sources of energy.\n  Let's be factual in this discussion. This doesn't bypass the United \nStates. This has tremendous economic and positive economic impacts on \nour country, and we should not forget that. As we debate this here and \nhave an opportunity now to vote on this veto, we\n\n[[Page S1283]]\n\nshould at least have a set of facts that is consistent with reality.\n  The Senator from Alaska has been very involved and has been a great \nleader on this issue.\n  My colleague from West Virginia is here as well. He has been working \nvery hard to move this project along. It is unfortunate we are where we \nare. Perhaps we will be a couple of votes short today, but who knows. \nMaybe some people will come to the right conclusion and help us advance \nthis important project.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota pointed out the number of pipelines that already \nexist in this country. I know the Senator has also pointed out the \npositive impact--when we get this down and it gets refined in other \nparts of this country--that a lot of this energy will be used here in \nthe United States. I appreciate the fact that the Senator has made all \nof those facts abundantly clear on the floor. It is unfortunate that we \nhave not been able to persuade the President, but I still have hope.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from South \nDakota, and turn to my colleague from West Virginia who has been a \nchampion on this project and other energy projects. As a Governor, he \nhas worked on energy. He understands job creation, and he understands \nthat we can make this country much stronger if we produce energy here \nat home versus getting it abroad.\n  I turn to my colleague from the State of West Virginia and thank him \nfor his leadership on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Senator. I very much appreciate this \ncolloquy, which is basically just common sense.\n  I became a Senator on November 15, 2010, so I have been here a little \nover 4 years. That is when I was first brought to understand the \nKeystone project, which was underway at the time and trying to be \nbuilt. I was asked the question: What do you think? I looked at it very \nquickly, and I looked at how much oil we buy from other countries \naround the world. We buy the same type of oil--750,000 barrels of oil a \nday--from Venezuela. I was thinking that I would rather buy from my \nfriends rather than from my enemies--the people who take the proceeds \nand the profits from our buying their product and use it against us. I \nwas very clear on that, and I think most West Virginians feel the way I \ndo.\n  Let's look at the facts. Forty percent of this pipeline has already \nbeen built. This is the part we are talking about, which has not been \nbuilt and which we are producing and would like to build. The capacity \nfrom the Bakken--we talked about how 12 percent of the volume from this \nwill be Bakken oil from North America.\n  We are saying that we are moving and producing our oil, buying from \nour best, friendliest neighbor and ally, Canada, and it makes us more \nsecure as a nation. I have heard all of the arguments against it. \nPeople have said that we can't do this because basically this oil will \ncome straight down and go out. They make you believe it is going to \ncome down here, get loaded on a tanker, and taken to another country, \nso that we get no benefit at all. That is what they are telling me.\n  We had a press conference 2 or 3 weeks ago. We had the Prime Minister \nof Canada and the Premier of Alberta. Everybody who was there agreed \nthat will not happen, and it can't happen because they need this to \nrefine it. They will be subjected to the same rules and regulations \nthat our Commerce Department puts on oil in America. No crude will be \nexported unless we change the law. So that prevents that from \nhappening. That is a misnomer.\n  Next, they said they don't pay 8 percent into the Oilspill Liability \nTrust Fund in case there is a spill. They agreed to do that. They said: \nWait a minute; this will not be built with American steel. Yes, it will \nbe. They agreed to that. Everything we have asked for, they have agreed \nto.\n  We can't even get our side of the aisle to agree basically to put it \nin a piece of legislation to make sure that it will happen. I trust the \nCanadians. They will do exactly what they said. I would like to codify \nit by putting it in the bill, and I am working on that.\n  The politics of what we are dealing with is this. If we can't get \nfour more Democrats on my side to vote with me to repeal and beat the \nveto the President has, this is coming back. Everybody in this \nunderstands the reality of politics. This legislation is coming back in \nthe form of an infrastructure bill or a road bill. It will come back on \na bill that we will all vote for, and we will have to spend a lot of \ntime and energy again on this same subject. I have said to do it now. \nLet's do it now and move on to something that we need to move on to, \nwhich will be something of great interest.\n  I have a hard time reasoning with those who say that this pipeline is \nnot going to make us more secure. We buy 7 million barrels of oil a \nday. We buy that oil from other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, \nVenezuela, and even Russia.\n  If you want to make this country more secure, let's not depend on the \nforeign oil where they will use resources that will be used against us. \nThe last time I checked, I don't believe Venezuela uses any of the \nmoney we give them for their oil to benefit America. I am not convinced \nthat Saudi Arabia uses any of their money to benefit our country or any \nof these other foreign countries that we buy from.\n  This is a perfect, commonsense solution. I also think that our good \nfriend from South Dakota talked about the amount of trains. My State \njust had a tragedy. Thank God there was no loss of life, and by the \ngrace of God, no one was injured. I can tell you that the amount of \ntransportation on the rail has increased 3,300 percent since 2009. So \n3,300 percent more oil is being transported in America by rail. If we \ncan relieve some of that and be safer--as well as environmentally \nsafer--we should do it.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this legislation because if we don't \ndo it now, it is going to come back. We have a chance to put it to bed. \nIt makes a lot of common sense as far as jobs.\n  I will say one more thing about jobs. They talked about jobs. When I \nwas Governor and when the Senator from North Dakota was Governor, we \nbuilt an awful lot of infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. I \nnever remember creating one permanent job after I built a bridge. There \nwere a lot of good jobs that paid good money during the construction, \nand all of my contractors were happy. All of my affiliated trades \npeople were happy that they had jobs, but we never expected to create \npermanent jobs. They were construction jobs. That is what it is.\n  Why are people saying that we are not creating jobs? This is \nconstruction. When it is done, it is done. I don't know why we can't \ncome to grips with that. We do it all day long. We will talk about an \ninfrastructure bill and be tickled to death that we are getting jobs. \nBut when we talk about 20,000 to 40,000 jobs to build this pipeline, I \ndon't understand why it is not something we can all embrace.\n  I say to all of my colleagues on my side of the aisle, as well as on \nthe other side of the aisle, that we should all support something that \nmakes so much sense to the American people and the working people of \nAmerica and also for the security of our Nation.\n  I applaud and support my friend. I cosponsored this bill. I feel very \nstrongly about it, and I will continue to speak out about it as long as \nwe have to. I hope today is the last time we have to speak about this \nlegislation. I hope we get this veto repealed and move on.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from West Virginia \nfor his tremendous leadership. I know that will continue. He is right. \nIf we don't win the battle today, we will win the war because we will \nfind another bill to attach this legislation to. But the thing is that \nwe ought to pass it on its merits, as the Senator so eloquently \nexplained.\n  I will now turn to the head of the energy committee, somebody who is \ntruly committed to an ``all of the above'' energy approach and \ndemonstrates that leadership on the ``all of the above'' approach every \nday in this body and certainly in her leadership of our energy \ncommittee. That is why she speaks on this issue in a way that should \nhave everyone listening to her. Whether she is speaking about fossil \nfuels, traditional energy or renewables, this is a Senator who has \nsupported all of these and has great creditability on this issue.\n  I turn to my colleague from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota for his leadership. He has been dogged not only as we have \nadvanced this measure through the floor and process but truly over the \nyears.\n  It has been 6-plus years, or 2,350 days, since the company seeking to \nbuild the Keystone XL Pipeline first submitted its cross-border permit \napplication. Even with all this time, the President is incapable of \nmaking a final decision.\n  I thank my colleague from West Virginia, who just spoke. He \narticulated some of the myths and misconceptions that are out there, \nand the Senator from South Dakota annunciated them as well.\n  When you think about where we are today, with this veto override here \nin front of us--you have to think about that fact that this is \nbipartisan energy legislation. The first bill we sent to the President \nthis year is bipartisan and has strong support around the country from \nan environmental perspective, from an energy security perspective, and \nfrom a national security perspective. The Keystone XL Pipeline is what \nwe should endorse. It is wrong and shortsighted that this President has \nchosen to veto this bipartisan energy initiative.\n  We have heard on the floor all of the reasons why this proposal is \ngood and sound and rational. It focuses on the energy infrastructure. I \nthink it is also important to remind colleagues that when we had this \nbill on the floor in January, we had something that we have not had in \na long period of time, and that was an open amendment process. We moved \n41 different amendments forward to the floor, and some of those \namendments actually passed. They became part of this Keystone XL \nPipeline legislation.\n  So in addition to vetoing the infrastructure aspects of this \nlegislation, the President has vetoed a time-sensitive provision that \nwill provide regulatory relief to our water heater manufacturers. He \nalso vetoed multiple provisions to increase the efficiencies of our \ncommercial buildings. He has also vetoed a provision that would improve \nthe energy retrofitting assistance that would be available for our \nschools. He also vetoed what I believe many of us viewed as a very \nresponsible path forward on the Oilspill Liability Trust Fund and our \nstatement asserting that climate change is real.\n  We made some good progress with this bill. If this vote is not \nsuccessful, all of that is now off the table. We are not just talking \nabout permitting a piece of pipe, the infrastructure that goes across \nthe border. Keep in mind, folks, we also included some things that this \nbody felt were important to advance, and that has all been vetoed by \nthis President. It was wrong to veto this legislation.\n  I think it is also important to highlight some of the irony we see \nwith the veto of this legislation coming from this administration. In \neffect, the President is making a mockery of the Executive order meant \nto expedite decisions, as it has been more than 2,350 days since this \napplication was submitted for permit. But there is other irony here, \nand I wish to take a brief moment to point this out.\n  Last month the White House released the National Security Strategy \nfor this country. I will quote from this strategy:\n\n       The challenges faced by Ukrainian and European dependence \n     on Russian energy supplies puts a spotlight on the need for \n     an expanded view of energy security that recognizes the \n     collective needs of the United States, our allies, and \n     trading partners as well as the importance of competitive \n     energy markets. Therefore, we must promote diversification of \n     energy sources, fuels, and routes, as well as encourage \n     indigenous sources of energy supply. Greater energy security \n     and independence within the Americas is central to these \n     efforts.\n\n  Well, Canada is within the Americas.\n  The President's veto of the Keystone XL Pipeline contradicts his own \nnational security policy. It contradicts his own energy policy that is \noutlined by the Council of Economic Advisers in their economic report \nwhen they say ``the extent to which a country's economy is exposed to \nenergy supply risks--specifically, international energy supply \ndisruptions that lead to product unavailability, price shocks, or both.\n  The President is contradicting himself at every turn, whether it is \nhis Climate Action Plan that he has introduced, vetoing his own--this \nveto contradicts his own climate policy.\n  We have an opportunity to boost our economy, to help our allies, to \nincrease our energy security, to be an environmental leader, and to \nlead on energy. This President's veto denies us that. It is a failure \nof leadership.\n  I recommend that all of us on both sides of the aisle come together \nto override this veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, President Obama had advocated reducing \nour reliance on Middle Eastern oil. The President has advocated \nreaffirming the commitment of the United States to its close allies. \nThe President has led us to believe he would work to create American \njobs, not veto them. Of course, signing the bipartisan Keystone jobs \nbill would have advanced all of those priorities, but President Obama \nchose deep-pocketed special interests over the middle class with his \npartisan veto of the Keystone jobs bill. It is the kind of thing that \nputs union workers on edge. I suspect it makes some of our Democratic \ncolleagues uncomfortable too.\n  But here is the good news: Our Democratic friends don't have to make \nthe same choice the President made. There is a bipartisan jobs \ncoalition right here in the Senate that would love to have their \nsupport. We are pro-Keystone jobs, we are pro-Keystone infrastructure, \nand we are pro-middle class.\n  If you are interested in jobs and infrastructure and saving your \nparty from an extreme mistake, then join us. Vote with us to override a \npartisan veto and help the President pursue priorities he has advocated \nin the past. There is no reason to allow powerful special interests to \nblock the billions this infrastructure project would pour into our \neconomy or the thousands of American jobs Keystone would support. Your \nvote for common sense can release this special interest stranglehold. \nIt can return a little more sanity to Washington.\n  There is a lot we can accomplish by working together with serious \njobs ideas and commonsense reform as our guiding principle. So I hope \nyou will join the new majority in that effort because no matter what \nhappens today, this new Congress is not going to stop working for good \nideas, and we are not going to protect the President from them either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, nearly 4 months ago--not 4 weeks ago but 4 \nmonths ago--President Obama announced his intention to nominate Loretta \nLynch to be our country's next Attorney General. I had the privilege of \nattending that White House ceremony. In fact, I took this photograph at \nthe ceremony.\n  But as I took it, I was mostly moved by what Ms. Lynch explained. She \nsaid she was excited about the challenge of becoming our Nation's chief \nlaw enforcement officer. She noted with obvious admiration that the \nDepartment of Justice is the only Cabinet Department named for an \nideal. Think of that. The Department of Justice. It is named for the \nideal of justice.\n  We know from Loretta Lynch's long public service career that she \naspires to make that ideal a reality. She will when she becomes \nAttorney General of the United States. As U.S. Attorney for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York, she brought countless terrorists and cyber \ncriminals to justice. She obtained convictions against corrupt public \nofficials from both political parties. She fought tirelessly against \nviolent crime and financial fraud. Her record shows as Attorney General \nshe will effectively, fairly, and independently enforce the law.\n  As many people have said, she is a prosecutor's prosecutor. Her \nrecord of accomplishment goes beyond just that. It goes to who she is \nas a person. It is bolstered by the faith and values instilled in her \nby her family. The Judiciary Committee was honored to have her proud \nfather, the Reverend Lorenzo Lynch, with us not only at both days of \nthe historic hearings in January, but also last Thursday as the \ncommittee considered his daughter's historic nomination.\n  When Loretta Lynch was a young child, Reverend Lynch bravely opened \nhis church to students and others to organize lunch counter sit-ins in \nNorth Carolina. He taught his only daughter that ``ideals are wonderful \nthings, but unless you can share them with others and make this world a \nbetter place, they are just words.'' Every one of us who has ever been \nin public service ought to listen to that. The fact that she has \ndedicated the majority of her career to public service reaffirms that \nshe has lived those ideals of justice in the service of others.\n  Last week, the committee reported her nomination favorably with a \nbipartisan vote. I wish the vote had been unanimous. I suspect that if \nthe President who nominated her had been a Republican, she would have \nbeen confirmed by now. But in the sixth year of this administration, \nperhaps there is no one who can be confirmed unanimously, because those \nRepublicans who are opposing Ms. Lynch are not doing so based on her \nrecord. They are opposing her because they disagree with a decision \nthat President Obama made and that she played no part in. That is not \ntreating her fairly.\n  One need only look at her supporters to know how nonpartisan her \nnomination really is. Louis Freeh, the former Director of the FBI and a \nFederal judge, has written:\n\n       [I]n in my twenty-five years of public service--23 in the \n     Department of Justice--I cannot think of a more qualified \n     nominee to be America's chief law enforcement officer.\n\n  I know Judge Freeh very well. He is a man of total integrity. He \nwould not say this unless he strongly believed it.\n  The current New York Police Commissioner, who was appointed by a \nDemocrat, and a former New York Police Commissioner, appointed by a \nRepublican, both strongly support her nomination.\n  Even prominent Fox News hosts have praised Loretta Lynch's work as a \nprosecutor. Bill O'Reilly has called her a hero for her prosecution of \na child rapist. Megyn Kelly, of Fox, has described Ms. Lynch as a \n``straight shooter'' for her service as a Federal prosecutor, \nespecially for her crackdown on gang crime and terrorism.\n  Ms. Lynch also has broad support from law enforcement, fellow \nprosecutors, civil rights groups, and numerous other prominent \nindividuals.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a list of letters in support of her \nnomination printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  Nobody else is seeking the floor. I ask unanimous consent to go \nbeyond the 10 minutes allotted, up to 3 extra minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In January, Ms. Lynch testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for nearly 8 hours. She has now responded to nearly \n900 questions for the record. I have been here 40 years and I have a \nhard time remembering somebody who has answered so many questions. The \nwitnesses invited by Republicans to speak on this, not a single one of \nthem actually opposed her nomination. In fact, I asked all of the \noutside witnesses: If anybody here opposes her nomination, would you \nplease raise your hand. Nobody did.\n  Despite this, some voted no--some Republican Senators voted no on her \nnomination in committee. Some of these Senators opposed her because she \nwould not renounce the President's Executive action to keep immigrant \nfamilies together. They are attacking her for this. They blame this on \nher. But they fail to acknowledge that if the Republican leadership in \nthe House had just allowed a vote on the immigration reform that passed \nthe Senate, then the President would not have been compelled to act.\n  Very hard-working Republicans and Democrats came together in this \nbody to pass by a 2-to-1 margin an immigration bill. Most people felt \nit would pass the House of Representatives had it been allowed to come \nto a vote. But the Speaker determined not to let it come to a vote. You \ncannot then say: We are not going to vote on anything, but, oh, by the \nway, we are not going to let the President do what Presidents have \nalways done in the absence of legislation, take executive action.\n  Now we all agree that we have problems in our immigration system. We \nall agree that we need legislation to fix it. The President is not \ngoing to do that. Congress has to do it. We have to stand up and vote \nfor or against changes. But to blame the Attorney General nominee for \nthis is simply unfair. To blame her because the House of \nRepresentatives will not vote on immigration is not fair. Ms. Lynch \nplayed no part in the President's decision to set the prosecutorial \npriorities of the administration.\n  As a Federal prosecutor in New York, no one has claimed that Ms. \nLynch has failed to enforce the law. There is no legitimate reason to \ndelay her vote any longer. In fact, there are a whole lot of people in \nprison today who wish that she had not enforced the law. But if they \nwere guilty of crimes, she enforced it, whether Republicans, \nDemocrats--no matter who they were--and with quite a few terrorists--\nshe enforced the law. She put them in prison.\n  So we should examine Loretta Lynch's nomination based on her\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\nrecord, her accomplishments, her extraordinary character. I call on the \nRepublican Leader to schedule an immediate vote on Loretta Lynch's \nconfirmation. Vote yes or vote no. But this confirmation has been \npending for 116 days--116 days. We have had several breaks--some of our \nconstituents call them vacations--during that time. Let's take a day or \nso and vote on her.\n  Let's not deprive the American people of even one more day of having \nLoretta Lynch as their Attorney General. Let's vote to confirm this \nsuperb woman, this superb nominee for Attorney General, this nominee \nwho believes that justice is an ideal, that all of us, no matter what \nour political party, should ascribe to.\n  I told her father how moved I was to watch his pride as she was \nbefore our committee for confirmation, I said, the pride was well \nearned because of the example he set to her as a child, to face up to \nall obstacles and overcome them. Well, let's not have the Senate set an \nobstacle that she cannot overcome. Let's have a vote. Let's put her in \nthere as Attorney General, for the good of the country, not of any \npolitical party, but for the good of the country.\n  This is not the Attorney General of the President. This is not the \nAttorney General of the Members of this body. This is the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. It is the Attorney General for 300 \nmillion Americans. Let's give 300 million Americans the Attorney \nGeneral they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Letters Received in Support of Loretta Lynch's Attorney General \n                               Nomination\n\n\n                   CURRENT & FORMER ELECTED OFFICIALS\n\n       The Honorable John Lewis (GA-5); The Honorable Kathleen \n     Rice (NY-4), former District Attorney for Nassau County; \n     Durham County, NC, Board of Commissioners; Martin County, NC, \n     Board of Commissioners; John Sexton, President of New York \n     University, Former Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve; \n     The Honorable Marcia Fudge (OH-11)\n       Two letters from the 46 members of the Congressional Black \n     Caucus: The Honorable Alma Adams (NC-12); The Honorable Karen \n     Bass (CA-37); The Honorable Joyce Beatty (OH-03); The \n     Honorable Sanford D.

BURWELL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a tremendously \nimportant case that was heard this morning in the Supreme Court. The \ncase is King v. Burwell, and it involves the administration of \nObamaCare. I was privileged to attend the argument.\n  The King case is important for a number of reasons. It is important \nbecause it involves a fundamental component of ObamaCare, and it is \nimportant because of its significant implications for the rule of law.\n  From the early days of the Republic, a core component of our \nconstitutional character has been the idea that the government is a \ngovernment of laws and not of men. That means our leaders are \nconstrained by the words of the laws in our statutes and in our \nConstitution. Government officials must follow the law even when their \npersonal preferences would lead them in a different direction.\n  The current administration, however, is engaged in a sustained \nassault on the rule of law. I have spoken many times on the Senate \nfloor about the President's disturbing disregard for the separation of \npowers and other limits on his authority. His offenses run the gamut of \nreleasing Guantanamo detainees without first notifying Congress, to \nclaiming that congressional inaction somehow clothes him with \nlegislative-like authority to suspend immigration laws, to arrogating \nto himself the power to determine when Congress is in session. \nPresident Obama's actions in the King case are of a piece with the \nother Executive overreaches.\n  First some background. ObamaCare requires every person in America to \nbuy health insurance. This is the so-called individual mandate the \nSupreme Court controversially upheld 3 years ago.\n  Most Americans receive health insurance through their employer, which \npays a large part of the premium, but not all do. Many must purchase \ninsurance on their own. And to ensure that such individuals are able to \ncomply with the individual mandate, ObamaCare directs States to create \nhealth care exchanges--government-operated Web sites where consumers \ncan go to compare and choose insurance plans. ObamaCare also provides \nsubsidies for individuals who purchase insurance through these State-\nrun exchanges.\n  Remember that most people receive health insurance through their \nemployer and that their employer pays part of the premium. Individuals \nwho purchase insurance on their own through exchanges, however, don't \nreceive this employer subsidy, so they themselves must contribute more \ntoward the premium. ObamaCare provides subsidies to these individuals \nto help offset the cost of insurance.\n  With that background, let me turn now to the legal issue in King. As \nI have described, ObamaCare directs States to establish health care \nexchanges. To be precise, the law says that ``each State shall, not \nlater than January 1, 2014, establish an [exchange]'' that meets \ncertain conditions set forth in the law. But there is a wrinkle: The \nConstitution does not permit the Federal Government to order States to \ndo things. This is called the anticommandeering principle and is well \nestablished in Supreme Court case law. What the Federal Government can \ndo, however, is incentivize States to act, and that is precisely what \nCongress attempted to do with ObamaCare.\n  Here is how the incentive works. Another provision of ObamaCare--the \none at the heart of King--conditions the aforementioned subsidies on an \nindividual's enrollment in a State-run exchange. According to this \nprovision, a subscriber is eligible for a subsidy for each month she is \ncovered by a plan that she ``enrolled in through an Exchange \nestablished by the State.'' The text of this provision could not be \nmore clear. If an individual enrolls in a plan through an exchange \nestablished by the State, she gets a subsidy; if she enrolls in any \nother plan, no subsidy.\n  The incentive for States to act also could not be more clear. If a \nState fails to establish an exchange, its citizens lose out on millions \nof dollars. ObamaCare's proponents quite reasonably thought this would \nlead States to set up exchanges and would thus accomplish the same \nresult--the creation of State-run exchanges--that Congress could not \nachieve through a direct command. In fact, I actually heard arguments \nby administration people that if they put enough pressure on the \nStates, the States would do this.\n  Congress also recognized, however, that some States might not take \nthe deal; thus, it provided a backstop. In yet another provision of \nObamaCare, Congress instructed that if a State does not set up an \nexchange by the January 2014 deadline, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services shall ``establish and operate such Exchange within the \nState.''\n  Crucially, however, Congress did not similarly provide that subsidies \nwould be available to subscribers enrolling through a federally \nestablished exchange, and the reason is obvious: If subsidies were \navailable under both State and Federal exchanges, States would not have \nany incentive to create their own exchanges because the subsidies would \ncome either way. Fewer States would create exchanges, meaning the \nFederal Government would have to step in and create more exchanges of \nits own.\n  The restriction of subsidies to State-established exchanges was thus \na key element of ObamaCare's entire cooperative federalism scheme. \nWithout this restriction, the end result would have been a federally \nrun health care market--a result unacceptable to several key ObamaCare \nsupporters whose votes were essential to passage of the bill.\n  Now we come to President Obama's act of overreach. Notwithstanding \nthe unmistakably clear text of the statute, which limits subsidies to \nplans purchased through State-established exchanges, and \nnotwithstanding that this limitation was absolutely fundamental to \naccomplishing Congress's purpose of incentivizing States to establish \nexchanges, the President decided he would also offer subsidies for \nplans purchased through federally established exchanges.\n\n[[Page S1288]]\n\n  President Obama's open defiance of clear statutory text and utter \ndisregard for the balance Congress struck is an affront to the \nseparation of powers and to the rule of law. The President and his \nenablers argue that subsidies for federally enrolled plans are \nnecessary to accomplish ObamaCare's overall purpose of reducing costs \nand improving health care access. Without subsidies to individuals in \nthe 34 States without State-run exchanges, the President argues that \nresidents of those States will be hit with higher costs and \nunaffordable health care. The law must be rewritten, he says, to avoid \nthe consequences the law itself imposes.\n  Laying aside the fact that the Constitution gives Congress, not the \nPresident, the power to amend laws, the President's argument is \ncompletely circuitous. The reason 34 States could afford not to \nestablish exchanges is because the President said he was going to pay \nsubsidies regardless of whether a State establishes an exchange. Why \nwould a State go to the trouble and expense of creating an exchange if \nthe end result is the same?\n  The President also grasps at exceedingly thin straws. Because the \nbackstop provision instructs that if a State does not establish an \nexchange, HHS shall step in and establish such exchange itself, the \nPresident says this means Federal exchanges are State exchanges. Right \nis left and up is down.\n  But let's return to the real provision in dispute in King, the one \nthat defines eligibility for subsidies. This provision says, again, \nthat an individual is eligible for each month that she is covered by a \nplan that she ``enrolled in through an Exchange established by the \nState.'' An exchange established by the Federal Government is by \ndefinition not an exchange established by the State, regardless of \nwhether the Federal exchange is a backstop or not.\n  It gets even worse for the President because the provision \nadditionally specifies that the State exchange must have been \nestablished ``under section 1311 of the [statute].'' That section sets \nforth the requirements for creating State-run exchanges. Nowhere does \nit mention Federal exchanges. Rather, the conditions for creation of \nFederal exchanges appear in a different section--section 1321. Under no \nplausible reading of the text does a State exchange established under \nsection 1311 mean a Federal exchange established under section 1321.\n  Advocates of the President's position would have us believe that \nstatutes are infinitely malleable--up can mean down, right can mean \nleft, established by a State can mean not established by a State. What \nmatters to them is advancing some vague notion of statutory purpose \nthat coheres with the President's leftwing agenda, regardless of what \nthe statute actually says.\n  Those of us on the other side, however, insist that text matters, \nwords matter. What the statute says is what matters, because at the end \nof the day the words in our statutes and in our Constitution are what \nbind our leaders and what prevent them from doing whatever they want.\n  The administration's actions in King have undermined the rule of law \nand contravened important constitutional checks on the President's \nauthority. As has increasingly become the case under President Obama, \nit is now up to the Supreme Court to rein in the President's overreach \nand to reaffirm the fundamental obligation of all government officials \nto follow the law. I surely hope the Court will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1288-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1288-S1289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to address today's vote to override \nPresident Obama's veto of the bipartisan Hoeven-Manchin bill to \nauthorize the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Our economy and North America's energy security would greatly benefit \nfrom building this pipeline. It would increase our GDP by approximately \n$3.4 billion annually. The State Department, which has provided clear-\nheaded analysis of the benefits of this project, has found that \nKeystone would support roughly 42,000 jobs during the construction \nphase alone. It would provide refineries with up to 830,000 barrels a \nday of North American oil.\n  Moreover, the Keystone XL Pipeline would be an environmentally sound \nway to transport this oil. The State Department's extensive \nenvironmental impact statement concluded that building the pipeline \nwould actually be better for the environment than not building it.\n  We have to be clear here. This oil is going to go to market no matter \nwhat. Building Keystone would take oil off the tracks and off the \nroads, transporting it in a way that is safer, more efficient, more \nenvironmentally sound, and better for creating good-paying American \njobs.\n  In his veto message, President Obama suggested that an issue such as \nthis is somehow too important to be left to the legislative process and \nthat we should trust in the integrity of the regulatory process.\n  This is exactly the sort of debate we should be having in the Senate. \nThis is the body that is supposed to debate the important issues of the \nday. When a project as important as this is stalled without meaningful \njustification for so long, our involvement is even more important.\n  In our consideration of this bill, we legislated according to the \nbest traditions of this body, including robust debate, an open \namendment process, and regular order. After years of mismanagement, our \nconsideration of this bill showed how the Senate is back at work on \nbehalf of the American people under our new leadership.\n  While I certainly hope we will find another means of approving the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, I am naturally disappointed that we came just a \nfew votes short of overriding the President's veto and enacting this \nbill into law. Furthermore, I can certainly understand why many \nAmericans will view this occasion as yet another example of how \nWashington is broken.\n  In many respects, I share this same frustration. Nevertheless, we \ncannot allow ourselves to slouch toward pessimism and disillusionment \nabout every institution. Indeed, I think my fellow colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle merit praise for their responsible handling of this \nbill. Instead, we should shine a light on where exactly the problem is \nand offer real solutions to make Washington work on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  At the end of the day, the Keystone XL Pipeline and so many other \nbureaucratic failures just demonstrate that our regulatory bureaucracy \nis broken. After all, this project is now in its sixth year of limbo, \nwaiting for a single permit to be issued. This debate has gone on \nlonger than an entire term of a U.S. Senator.\n  It should not take years and years of navigating the Federal \nbureaucracy only to have the government decide not to make a decision. \nThis new Congress is focused on helping to create jobs and getting our \neconomy back on the right track, which is why regulatory reform must be \na key part of our agenda over the next 2 years. We must strive not only \nto approve this particularly important project but also to prevent \nsimilar abuses from occurring in the future.\n  Perhaps the two most troublesome features of the modern \nadministrative state are, first, the size of the regulatory burden on \nthe economy and, second, the lack of accountability in the regulatory \nbureaucracy. Both problems have been illustrated by the Keystone XL \nproject, but they manifest themselves across the board throughout the \nregulatory process.\n  The growing Federal regulatory burden has been a concern for decades, \nbut the problem is now worse than ever. Both the number of regulations \nand their combined cost have exploded in recent years. The American \npeople are now bound by more than 1 million individual restrictions in \nthe Federal Register, with a total cost of around $1.86 trillion each \nyear. To put that in perspective, that is about 11 percent of our total \nGDP, it amounts to about $15,000 per household, and it totals over $300 \nbillion more than annual individual and corporate taxes combined. In \nshort, our regulatory burden is enormous.\n  Even as we resist President Obama's mad dash to add new rules, our \nNation simply cannot afford to ignore the crushing burden of existing \nregulations. They weigh down our efforts to boost economic growth and \nmake it impossible to get our country back on track.\n  Every President, from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama, has embraced the\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\nnotion that outdated, unsuccessful or otherwise ineffective regulations \nshould be repealed. Nevertheless, the cumulative regulatory burden \ncontinues to expand year after year.\n  To address this growing problem, I will be partnering with \nCongressman Jason Smith to sponsor the Senate version of the SCRUB \nAct--Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily \nBurdensome. This legislation creates a bipartisan commission to examine \nthe entire administrative corpus in search of regulations that are \nobsolete, outdated, ineffective, overlapping, duplicative or \nunjustified. Its goal is to achieve a 15-percent cost reduction in our \nNation's total regulatory burden. The Commission can recommend either \nimmediate repeal or incremental reform through a flexible procedure \nthat puts the agencies and stakeholders in the driver's seat.\n  The SCRUB Act transforms a longstanding bipartisan commitment to \nretrospective regulatory review from mere rhetoric into meaningful \nreality. It would result in lower prices, higher wages, and more job \nopportunities for hard-working Americans. All the while, such \ncommonsense regulatory review poses no risk to our health, our safety \nor our environment. It is the kind of legislation that can earn support \nfrom both sides of the aisle and for which there is a realistic path to \nhaving it enacted into law.\n  A second critical flaw in the current administrative state is a \nfundamental lack of accountability in how the Federal Government makes \nand enforces regulations. Far too often the agencies and interest \ngroups manipulate the rules and stack the decks against innovators, \nentrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens.\n  Thankfully, there are a number of potential avenues for meaningful \nreform, but the one area that has thus far escaped much legislative \nattention is the role the Federal judiciary plays in the regulatory \nprocess. Given the broad authorities Congress has ceded to \nadministrative agencies, the courts often stand as the only truth \nindependent check on increasingly out-of-control regulators. But recent \nabuses by the political branches have created serious challenges for \neffective and appropriate judicial review on the regulatory process.\n  By writing vague laws, Congress has created extraordinary flexible \ngrants of authority that are both unwise and constitutionally \ntroublesome. Judicial deference to agency interpretations of the law \nhas magnified this power to an extreme degree. Although originally \nintended as a means of curtailing judicial activism, Chevron deference \nand its associated doctrines have resulted in a gross misallocation of \nlawmaking authority. Such doctrines have consigned courts to be \nrubberstamps, rather than effective checks on administrative overreach.\n  The threat of toothless judicial oversight of increasingly \nproblematic regulatory action was only heightened when President Obama \nand his allies packed the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with compliant \njudges even less inclined to engage in meaningful administrative \nreview, and Congress's creation of broadly available private rights of \naction to challenge administrative decisions and regulatory activities \nhas opened another avenue for abuse of the courts.\n  While these provisions provide important opportunities for regulated \nparties to defend their liberties, too often they have allowed groups \nwith no concrete stake in the process to use the courts as a means to \ndrive their own ideological agendas.\n  Worse yet, inconsistent efforts by the judiciary to define the \nconstitutional limits on standing have inadvertently created a perverse \nenvironment where businesses with real skin in the game are often shut \nout of court, while special interest groups with no meaningful injury \nin fact are allowed to litigate.\n  Restoring the constitutionally proper judicial role is vital to \nreturning accountability to the regulatory process. In reviewing agency \nactions, courts should hear only real cases and controversies, where \nlitigants have concrete interests at stake. But when they do, they \nshould state firmly what the law is and not simply ratify what the \nregulatory agencies argue that the law should be.\n  Legislation to ensure meaningful reform on each front and thereby \nbringing the administrative state more in line with the Constitution \nwill be one of my top priorities in this Congress.\n  It is disappointing that we could not override the President's veto \nof this important legislation. The failure to authorize Keystone \ndemonstrates how broken our regulatory process is. I hope we can use \nthis occasion of bipartisan consensus to move forward in ways that can \nfix our out-of-control bureaucracy and get Washington back to work for \nthe American people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is quiet around here today, this \nafternoon. We have been notified that we are not going to be having any \nfurther votes this week because Washington, DC, is anticipating a \nwinter storm. It is March 4. I think most people here in Washington had \nhoped that winter had already come and gone, but that is not the case.\n  In my home State of Alaska, this is the time of year that we welcome \nwinter. We embrace winter. In fact, I am going to be going up to the \nState this Friday to attend the kickoff of our biggest sporting event, \nwhich is the Iditarod sled dog race, 1,100 miles, where about 70 teams \nof dogs and intrepid mushers make the trek typically between the \nAnchorage area and 1,100 miles up to Nome.\n  This winter has been a little bit different. It is warmer back home \nthan most of us Alaskans would like, and we have actually had to \nreroute the Iditarod for the second time in the race's history. It is \ngoing to be starting out of my hometown in Fairbanks, and rerouting the \nrace so that it is still a thousand-mile race. But it does speak to the \nfact that we are seeing some changes up there, at least for this \nwinter, in terms of our temperatures and our climate.\n  We have a lot of folks around here anticipating what we are going to \nsee tomorrow who are wondering what is going on with climate? What are \nwe seeing? Is this temporary in nature, or are we going to start seeing \nmore arctic conditions here on the eastern seaboard?\n  I want to talk about the Arctic today. I want to talk about the value \nof an amazing part of the globe and the opportunities we have in the \nArctic, the opportunities we have as an Arctic nation.\n  We have a map here. This is the bathymetric chart of the Arctic \nOcean. It is a view that perhaps most Americans are not intimately \nfamiliar with. You look at it and say, where on planet Earth is this?\n  To locate everybody a little bit, here you have Russia, Greenland, \nCanada over here, and the United States. This is the State of Alaska \nwith all of the interior arctic areas there, but an amazing mass \nlocated at the top of the globe, an area where, quite honestly, most \nAmericans put it out of sight, out of mind. The only time they really \nthink about the Arctic is when there are temperatures that make it feel \nlike the Arctic.\n  There are probably going to be a lot of folks here in Washington, DC, \ntomorrow who are thinking, yes, maybe we do live in an Arctic nation \nbecause I am feeling it here. It doesn't make any difference whether we \nhave a storm coming at us or whether it is the\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\nheat of the summer in Washington, DC, or the fall in New England, or \nthe warm winter temperatures in a place such as Arizona. Wherever you \nreside in this country, you are part of an Arctic nation. I am willing \nto bet that when the Presiding Officer was elected to represent the \nState of Colorado, he didn't think at that time that he was also \nelected to be a Senator for the Arctic. But, in fact, he is because we \nare an arctic nation. In Colorado--I suppose the Presiding Officer is \nprobably thinking, tell me why the Arctic is relevant to Colorado, \nother than the fact that we also share some good winters and have an \nappreciation for the snow and colder climates. But in the State of \nColorado, 30 percent--30.5 percent of the total exports that go out of \nColorado are exported to arctic nations.\n  Now think about that. Thirty percent of what goes out of Colorado is \nexported to an Arctic nation, one of the eight Arctic nations--Canada, \nFinland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden. These are your \ntrading partners.\n  Our colleague from Wyoming was just on the floor. Let's see what \nWyoming exports. They are about in the same category as Colorado, about \n28.3 percent of the total exports from Wyoming are exported to the \nArctic nations. When we think about the dollars that are coming to \nColorado or Wyoming or Maryland as a result of exports from your \nStates, it causes us to maybe perhaps look at the Arctic a little bit \ndifferently.\n  We have an opportunity to build upon a dynamic relationship, an \nevolving part of the globe, as we prepare as a nation to assume the \nchair of the Arctic Council. This event will take place on April 25, \njust a couple of months from now. But the Arctic Council is the \nintergovernmental forum for the eight nations that have territory \ninside the Arctic Circle. Again, this is pretty much this map here: \nCanada, Russia, Denmark through Greenland, Finland, Iceland, Norway, \nSweden, and then, of course, by virtue of the State of Alaska, the \nUnited States.\n  The Arctic Council also includes six nonvoting permanent participant \ngroups that represent the indigenous people of the Arctic. There are \nalso 32 observer entities. The interesting thing with these observer \nparticipants, 12 of the 32 are non-Arctic nations, so areas that are \nnot countries that we would think of that would have a keen interest in \nwhat is going on with Arctic policy. This is France, Germany, the \nUnited Kingdom, China, Japan.\n  What is really impressive to me is that we are seeing the growth in \nthe number of non-Arctic nations that are seeking observer status. Back \nin the 2013 Arctic Council ministerial meeting we had in Sweden, six \nnations were admitted as observers. Many others have indicated their \ninterest as well.\n  It is also interesting to note that with the admission of China, all \nfive permanent members of the United Nations Security Council are now \nmembers or observers of the Arctic Council. Also represented are 8 of \nthe world's 10 largest economies based on GDP, which is an indicator of \nthe level of importance the world ascribes to the Arctic.\n  What has happened with the Arctic is, again, a keen interest from all \nover the globe in what is happening. Why is that? What is going on that \nis capturing the interests, the imagination, the opportunity for \nnations all over the globe? So much of it is because this area, an area \nthat for most has always been locked up in a world of ice and \npermanently frozen in time. So to even imagine the possibilities of \nwhat could unfold in the Arctic was so foreign that only the most \nadventurous of the explorers ever pushed out.\n  It is changing up North, whether it is the northern sea route coming \nacross on the Russian side, whether it is the Northwest Passage, \nwhether it is nations that are looking to explore for resources, \nwhether it is those involved in maritime traffic and engaging in a \nlevel of commerce that are looking for that shorter route that will cut \ndays, weeks, off of a journey and, therefore, costs off of the expense \nof shipping. Whether it is the tourists--cruise ships are coming across \nthe top. Up in Point Barrow, right up here at the top of the world, you \nhave cruise ships that are moving through those waters--the ultimate \necotourists and those who are seeking something different.\n\n  The Arctic is notable within the international community from an \neconomic perspective. As its shipping lanes open up, we have additional \nareas that become accessible for resource development. Again, the rise \nof tourism is an example of the increased accessibility of the Arctic.\n  It is also notable from a political perspective as the region that is \nnot bogged down by the inertia of longstanding disputes. Think about so \nmany parts of the world where there have been decades, if not centuries \nof conflict. This is a part of the world that does not have that \noverlay, if you will. It does not have the entrenched views that make \ninternational cooperation in other areas difficult.\n  Instead, it is an area that seeks to promote collaboration and remain \na zone of peace. Think about the conversations I am able to have with \nSecretary Kerry, as I did just a few weeks back, talking about the \nArctic and being able to speak to the Secretary of State about how we \ncan work more collaboratively, how we can keep an area as a zone of \npeace as he deals with hot spots all over the globe--to know that there \nis a cool place, not only from a physical perspective but perhaps from \nan emotional and a political perspective, where perhaps we can be \nworking together to advance goals and initiatives rather than \nconstantly being at issue with one another.\n  It also is a region that is writing its history as we speak. This has \nbeen around for a long time. But what is happening at the top of the \nglobe is like a clean sheet. It is an opportunity for us to write \nhistory. It is even more important for the United States to take a lead \nin guiding international policy decisions within this area. This is why \nI am calling on colleagues in the Senate to join me, to step up, to \nhelp us not only to build out policy initiatives but really to take \nthat leadership role, as we should be doing as an Arctic nation.\n  So I have joined together with the Senator from Maine, Mr. King, to \nform a new caucus. I know we have plenty of caucuses around here, but I \nam asking colleagues to consider joining this caucus, the Senate Arctic \nCaucus. This caucus has a mission to convene conversations among \nMembers on issues relating to defense, science, energy, environment, \ncommerce, trade, maritime affairs, the well-being of the indigenous \npeoples of the Arctic, to raise awareness about the importance of the \nArctic, and to advance a coordinated effort toward investment in \ninfrastructure that will benefit all Americans, including those who \nlive in the Arctic.\n  I should let colleagues know that when I am offering this opportunity \nto join a caucus, it is not just to say that I am paying attention to \nArctic issues in name only. We really want to try to educate because, \nagain, I think the awareness of what is happening in the Arctic has \ncaptivated the imagination and the attention of people around the \nworld, of nations around the world. It should captivate the imagination \nand the attention of every Member in this body. So each Member will be \nreceiving an invitation to join this caucus, along with a breakdown of \neach State's exports to the Arctic region, to help demonstrate why the \nArctic matters to all 50 of the States.\n  So as I have outlined to the Presiding Officer, about the benefits \nthat Colorado receives and the benefits that Wyoming receives, all \nMembers will be getting similar figures. It was 10 years ago when I \nstarted an Arctic awareness campaign. That was a long time ago. It was \nan effort to get folks--not only within the legislative body but within \nthe administration--to pay attention to what was going on within the \nregion.\n  It started out pretty simply. I can remember that I was on the \nForeign Relations Committee, and we had the nomination hearing for \nCondoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State. I asked her a question: So \nwhat are we doing in the Arctic to ensure that the Arctic remains a \nzone of peace? Or I asked something to that effect.\n  I think I caught her flatfooted. The next time I saw her before the \nForeign Relations Committee, she was up to speed and engaged. But I can \nstate with some certainty here that in 2005 the State Department was \njust not prepared to have a discussion on these issues.\n  Now, I am not going to claim full credit here. But move forward a \nlittle\n\n[[Page S1291]]\n\nbit with the clock. It was good to see the movement within the \nadministration. When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, she was \nthe first Secretary of State to participate in an Arctic Council \nministerial meeting. I think that was probably prompted by some visits \nshe had made to view the Arctic, including the U.S. Arctic in Barrow, \nwhen she was a Member of this body. But as Secretary of State she \ntraveled to Nuuk, Greenland in 2011. I accompanied her. Then in 2013 \nSecretary Kerry went to the ministerial meeting in Kiruna, Sweden. In \n2015 Secretary Kerry will again participate in this year's meeting in \nCanada, where the Arctic Council chairmanship will be handed over to \nthe United States.\n  I started off my comments by talking about what is going on with the \nweather and people feeling like we are under an Arctic siege here right \nnow in Washington. But I think it is safe to say that Arctic awareness \nis at an alltime high. But unfortunately, the investment has not \nmatched the interest. One barometer of your interest when you are \ntalking about the Arctic is: How do you move in the Arctic if there is \nice up there? You have to be able to plow through some ice. This is \nwhere an icebreaker comes into play.\n  But icebreakers are expensive. The Coast Guard estimates that it is \ngoing to be about $1 billion. It takes about 10 years to build. If I \nwere to ask anybody in this body how many icebreakers the United States \nhas, I think you would say: Well, of course we have an icebreaker up \nthere.\n  We have one medium-strength icebreaker, the Healy, which does a good \njob for us. But our only Polar Class vessel, the Polar Star is on \nassignment to Antarctica for the next 5 years. We will not see her in \nthe Arctic for 5 full years. The life expectancy, the useful life of \nthe Polar Star is only 6 to 8 years. It takes 10 years to build a new \none.\n  We are sitting here as a nation woefully behind when it comes to \nArctic infrastructure, if you define it by icebreaking capacity. Russia \nis cleaning our clock in terms of the number of icebreakers they have. \nThey have 27. Our own Coast Guard's High Latitude Study says it is \ngoing to require six major icebreakers--three heavy and three medium-\nsized icebreakers--to fulfill its statutory requirements.\n  Even China has one icebreaker. They are building six more. India--do \nyou think of India as an Arctic Nation? They are considering building \nan icebreaker. Why? Because they see the Arctic opportunity. They want \nto be part of an area on the globe that is piquing their interest for a \nhost of different reasons.\n  So as others in the Arctic region, whether it is Russia or whether it \nis Canada, as they continue some pretty aggressive national plans, \ncombined with state investment to develop their Arctic resources and \nadvance commerce in the north, the United States needs to be a \nparticipant. But we need to be more than a participant. We need to be a \nleader. We lead everywhere else. We led to the moon. We know more about \nthe mapping of Mars than we know about mapping in the Arctic.\n  We need to step it up. It is exciting to think that we can step it \nup. I am hoping that we will be able to focus our attention on these \nissues. It is not just the resources and infrastructure that will make \nthe Arctic a national priority. It is not just preparing for a 2-year \nchairmanship. It is about what the vision is--the long-term vision for \nthe United States' role in an emerging part of the globe. It is as \ndynamic as anyplace out there.\n  But we have to be ready. We lack certain basic infrastructure needs. \nI mentioned the need for an icebreaker. I am going to be introducing \nlegislation, hopefully very soon, to develop a solid foundation and put \nsome building blocks in place for that investment, including a focus on \nobtaining more accurate data for charting the Arctic. We simply are so \nfar behind in our hydrographic charting. We need to do better with our \nice forecasting, with our weather observation stations, with our \nweather buoys, with our monitoring out in our oceans, with just having \na level of communications and understanding of what we have. So, as we \nlook to the area, we have at least to be able to assess the accuracy of \nArctic weather and water forecasting. We have to be able to understand \nwhether we have gaps in Arctic weather and sea-ice observing networks \nand the status of our sea-ice analysis and forecasting services.\n  So we are going to be having a hearing tomorrow in the energy \ncommittee. We may be the only committee that is open for business. We \nmay be the only Senators that are here in the building. But we are \ngoing to be having the first-ever hearing on the Arctic. I think it is \nfair to say that it is not only the first hearing in the energy \ncommittee but the first-ever hearing on the Arctic as a whole, instead \nof just bits and pieces of it.\n  So I am encouraging all of my colleagues who may be locked out \nbecause they could not jump on a flight quickly enough or they could \nnot get on the road soon enough. But we will be having, I think, a very \ninformative hearing tomorrow in the energy committee to focus on what, \nagain, I am calling Arctic opportunities. I do not know if the timing \nof the hearing was just prescient on my part and that we knew that this \nwas going to happen. If so, I should also do part-time work as a \nweather forecaster. But I do think it is certainly timely. In fact, it \nis long past time that we focus again on an area that hosts amazing \npromise and opportunity for leadership as a nation. I would encourage \nall of my colleagues to join us in this new Senate Arctic Caucus. \nEmbrace your inner Arctic self. It really is a good place to be.\n  With that, I see that my colleague from Wyoming is here. He has been \nvery patient. As I mentioned to the Senator from Colorado, our \nPresiding Officer right now, Colorado enjoys good benefits from the \nState of Alaska. For the fine folks in Wyoming, 28 percent of their \ntotal exports from the State of Wyoming do go to Arctic nations. So \nthere is a connection. I look forward to working with both of my \ncolleagues as members of the energy committee on these issues of great \nimportance to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first, let me congratulate our colleague \nfrom Alaska, who is the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. That committee is in capable hands under her direction, \nwhether the Arctic--all energy. She is committed to affordable energy, \navailable energy, reliable energy, secure energy, and American energy.\n  So we are in good stead with the new chairman who has taken over in \nJanuary. As members of that committee, it is a great opportunity for us \nto work with her for affordable energy for all in America. We have \nopportunities for exports, and it is good to see her continued \nleadership on this and other topics.\n  I appreciate her hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1291-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1291-S1293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KING V. BURWELL\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, earlier today the United States Supreme \nCourt heard arguments in an important case, a consequential case. It is \ncalled King v. Burwell. This case was brought on behalf of millions of \nAmericans who have been harmed by the President's unlawful expansion of \nhis unworkable and unaffordable health care law.\n  Sometime before the end of June, the Court will decide if the law \npassed by Congress means what it says or if it means what the President \nwishes it said.\n  It looks at one very specific and very important part of the \nPresident's health care law. The law says that Washington could help \nsubsidize the premiums of people buying health insurance coverage \nthrough exchanges established by the States. President Obama decided \nthat wasn't enough. He wanted to use taxpayer dollars on behalf of \npeople buying insurance in the Federal exchange as well. That is it. \nThat is the legal question.\n  The law, written by Democrats in Congress--written behind closed \ndoors--only authorized subsidies for one group, but the President paid \nthem out for another group. The case is not about the Constitution, it \nis about the rule of law.\n  I was at the Court this morning listening to the arguments, and I \nexpect that the Justices will strike down the way the President \nexpanded the law.\n  Time after time this administration has claimed power it did not have \nand taken actions it cannot defend. The\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\nway the administration expanded the health care law is one of the most \nblatant of these power grabs, because when Democrats passed the law, \nthey got exactly what they wanted. They rejected Republican idea after \nRepublican idea that could have made this law better. They forced it \nthrough Congress with absolutely no Republican support.\n  It still wasn't good enough for the Obama administration, so it \nexpanded the law some more. ObamaCare is a minefield, and the \nadministration refused to give people the information they need to help \nthem navigate it.\n  The Obama administration knew this court case was coming well before \nthe enrollment period to buy insurance for this year even started. So \ndid the American President tell the American people these subsidies \nmight not be legal? Did he warn people? What did the President actually \nsay? Did he warn anyone signing up in the exchanges that they might not \nbe seeing the real price of any insurance they picked? No, the \nPresident refused to do so.\n  He knew he might lose the case. He knew it. He knew the risk he was \nmaking people take, but the President didn't say a word--people who \nwere just trying to make the best choices for their families. The White \nHouse did not tell people the truth about their options.\n  Several Republican Senators wrote to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services and the Secretary of the Treasury asking them to warn \npeople. We said people need this information. There are thousands of \ndollars at stake for families, and the Obama administration should at \nleast tell them what might happen.\n  The Secretary has refused to level with the American people.\n  Just the other day, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nadmitted she had no plan B. Her letter is clear and it is \nconsequential. She admits that if the Supreme Court rules against the \nObama administration, the President does not have the authority--does \nnot have the authority--to use administrative actions to undo the \nSupreme Court decision. The administration purposefully waited to admit \nthat until after the open enrollment period ended. It didn't want to \ntake the chance that warning people might hurt its enrollment numbers.\n  Today at the Supreme Court, several Justices were skeptical of the \nadministration's legal defense. I expect the Supreme Court to say the \nPresident must enforce the law Congress has passed, rather than the law \nthe President wishes Congress had passed. If it does, it will help rein \nin this out-of-control White House. It will tell the Obama \nadministration it must obey the law and that the President cannot keep \nmaking up the rules as he goes along.\n  The health care law is clear. The President was wrong to expand his \nhealth insurance exchanges beyond what the law allowed. The President \nwas wrong to use the IRS to make up rules and penalties. The Obama \nadministration was irresponsible for not warning people.\n  Republicans will have a plan to protect the people harmed by the \nPresident's action and to create a path away from ObamaCare. First, our \nplan will help the millions of people who have been hurt by the White \nHouse's decision to illegally implement its health care law. It would \nbe unfair for families to lose their coverage in the middle of the year \njust because they believed the false promises made by Barack Obama. So \nRepublicans will help Americans keep their coverage for a transitional \nperiod.\n  Second, it will give States the freedom and flexibility to create \nbetter, more competitive health insurance markets, offering more \noptions and different choices at home where people live, not decisions \nmade in Washington.\n  We want to allow States to come up with health care systems that work \nfor them, not the bureaucrats in the Nation's Capital. We would give \nevery State the ability to create a better market, better opportunities \nsuited to the needs of that State's citizens. It is time for President \nObama to stop putting people through all of the pain this law has \ncreated.\n  The President's health care law continues to be unpopular, \nunworkable, and unaffordable. He needs to finally negotiate with \nRepublicans to give people the reform they wanted all along, which is \nwhat people asked for--the care they need from a doctor they choose at \nlower cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my \ndistinguished colleague and friend from the State of Wyoming, and I \nrise to talk about exactly the same issue and to differ with him, \nrespectfully, that the current law is unworkable, unpopular, and \nunaffordable. In fact, history demonstrates that it is certainly \nworking.\n  In the State of Connecticut we know well that it is working as it was \nintended because we have a State-run exchange, and we have cut the \nnumber of uninsured by one-half, while improving health care quality, \nlowering Medicaid spending, and making remarkable achievements across a \nwhole range of metrics. That same story is true of our Nation as a \nwhole, whether there are State-run exchanges or Federal supervised \nexchanges.\n  Today's point, whether it is in the Supreme Court or here, should be \nextraordinarily encouraging about the Congress's approval of the \nAffordable Care Act and the fact that it is working across the country. \nIt is succeeding in delivering exactly what was intended, what the \nCongress promised, what its advocates saw, access for all Americans to \naffordable health insurance.\n  The ACA is working today to protect Americans from abuses, and I saw \nthem literally day in and day out as attorney general: people who lost \nhealth insurance when they got sick, people who were denied coverage \nbecause of a preexisting condition, people who were charged more \nbecause of their gender, people who were denied the basic care they \nneeded and deserved for themselves, their children, and their families, \ngiving them access not only to health care but also to work and to \nfamily stability.\n  I saw every day as attorney general how imperiled and critical health \ncare is in this country and how much we need to do more and do better \nin this area.\n  The uninsured rate in this country is the lowest it has been in 7 \nyears, and we have lowered it a remarkable 25 percent in just 1 year. \nEight million people have gained health insurance through the exchanges \nwho didn't have it before, and I know that States with federally run \nexchanges have made improvements, just as Connecticut has done, which \nis fully in accordance with the absolutely crystal-clear intent of this \nCongress and this law to provide affordable health insurance for all \nAmericans, regardless of where they live, what State, what ZIP Code, \nwhatever their occupation and background.\n  Let's be clear. As with any big law there are kinks that need to be \nironed out, there are glitches that need to be resolved, but the \nAffordable Care Act is working now and working better every month, \nevery year.\n  The legal issue before the Court has been debated today in depth, and \nI believe with the great persuasiveness--similar to the Presiding \nOfficer, I had the honor to serve as a law clerk to the Supreme Court \nand watch many arguments. To say that today is historic I think is \ntrue, but in my view almost every argument before the Supreme Court is \nhistoric in its consequences--some more than others, but every one is \nconsequential because cases don't reach the U.S. Supreme Court unless \nthey are difficult and consequential, and issues of statutory \ninterpretation that are said to be simple often are more complicated \nthan they may seem.\n  But I know, without a doubt, having read this statute, that the text \nand structure of the Affordable Care Act clearly demonstrate--in fact, \nthey unmistakably demand--that Federal tax credits be available to \nevery eligible taxpayer in every State in this country.\n  I have done arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court, and I had the honor \nto be attorney general of the State of Connecticut as well as a U.S. \nattorney.\n  Having looked at this statute as a whole, having read the words that \nneed to be interpreted by the Supreme Court, I have reached this \nconclusion: Contrary to the argument of partisan opponents, both the \nact itself and the plainly overwhelming evidence from its consideration \nand passage demonstrate its nationwide scope.\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\n  I wasn't here at the time it was passed, but from the legislative \nhistory and, most important, from the structure and language of the act \nitself, there seems to be irrefutably and incontrovertibly an \nunderstanding that tax credits would be available regardless of which \ngovernmental agency set up an exchange. The act simply would not have \nworked any other way and courts have an obligation to read statutes in \na way that makes the most sense in terms of the overriding intent and \npurpose of the Congress.\n  The financial support simply, for universal coverage, would not be \nthere without this interpretation, a commonsense interpretation that \nmakes sense of congressional intent, purpose, and the law as a whole.\n  The law has given so many families across the country access to care \nfor the first time. There has been an effort to repeal this act \nlegislatively. There has been an effort to overturn it in the courts. \nBoth have failed because it is working and because it is \nconstitutional.\n  A ruling for the plaintiffs in this case that is now before the Court \nwould not only be contrary to law, it would be catastrophic to millions \nof families who owe their health insurance to the structure the ACA has \nestablished. It would be, in fact, a human tragedy as well as a legal \ntravesty.\n  There is simply no alternative that has been offered by opponents to \nthis law. It is difficult therefore to see how this misguided lawsuit \nis anything other than one more cynical attempt to repeal or overturn \nthis law--or torpedo it by any means necessary, regardless of the \ncollateral damage to millions of innocent people who would suffer loss \nof health care insurance and health care. And the tragedy would be not \nonly for them but for our entire Nation because the cost would ripple \nthroughout our society--the cost in lost work; the cost in families \nsuffering from the consequences of bankruptcy, which is caused most \nfrequently by health care-related financial issues; the cost in the \nability of our workforce to function at the height of efficiency that \nwe all need; and the cost ultimately in diseases that have to be \ntreated and ailments that have to be addressed and preventable health \ncare consequences for our children. Prevention is one of the most cost-\neffective goals of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n  So I will work with my colleagues to support this act and to \ndetermine what other efforts can make progress toward the ultimate goal \nthat we all should share--an America that is free from disease or \ninjury that will bankrupt our families, an America that is healthier \nand better able to afford health care, and quality and timely health \ntreatment.\n  The lack of standing on the part of these plaintiffs seems clear, but \nputting aside all of the technical issues and the legal debate, the \nAffordable Care Act has allowed America to make huge, exciting strides \nin the direction of better health care. So we should be proud of the \nact passed by this body. Even many of us perhaps who were not here at \nthe time can look forward to how much further we can go, and America \nhas that fundamental obligation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1293-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1293-S1295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am back now for the 91st consecutive \nweek the Senate has been in session to urge my colleagues to wake up \nand pay attention to the threat of climate change. I am delighted and \nproud to be joined today by my colleague and friend Senator Baldwin \nfrom Wisconsin to consider the effects of carbon pollution in her \nState.\n  According to scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, \nweather stations around the State show that average temperatures in \nWisconsin increased by about 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit between 1950 and \n2006. During the same period Wisconsin got wetter. Annual average \nprecipitation increased by almost 3 inches. These changes are likely to \ncontinue and intensify as carbon pollution continues to pile up in the \natmosphere. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison estimate \nthat by midcentury the State could warm by 4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit. \nBy the end of the century the climate in Wisconsin may look more like \nthat of present-day Missouri or Oklahoma, raising the possibility of a \ndramatic shift in the Wisconsin economy and way of life.\n  This winter has been pretty cold in the Eastern United States and in \nWisconsin. So was last year. Cold arctic air dipping down over North \nAmerica drops the mercury. As we continue into a time of what has been \ncalled global weirding, scientists say that climate change may make \nthese cold blasts more common as it alters patterns in the atmosphere. \nIn a nutshell, on top of the long-term warming trend lies weather \ndisorder. But the long-term warming trend is apparent. New research \nfrom UW-Madison's Professor Jonathan Martin shows that last year the \nso-called cold pool of frigid air that accumulates in the Northern \nHemisphere each winter was the smallest since records began in the \nwinter of 1948 to 1949. This year it is on track to be even smaller.\n  Sadly, some of our colleagues just can't face up to the role that \nhuman activity--such as our carbon pollution from burning fossil fuel--\nplays in the changes we are seeing around us. One colleague--indeed, \nthe senior Senator from Wisconsin--is among this group. In January he \nvoted against amendments to the Keystone XL bill stating that climate \nchange is real and that humans contribute to it. Well, in 2013 the \nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel--his State's largest paper--noted that this \ntype of denial was at odds with both Wisconsin opinion and Wisconsin \nscientific evidence. The senior Senator from Wisconsin, wrote the \npaper's editorial board, ``is just flat-out wrong.'' The paper went on \nto say, ``We elect politicians to make tough decisions and find \nsolutions, not to shut their eyes and cover their ears, as Johnson \nrepeatedly has done on this issue.'' The article continued: \n``[S]tubbornly denying the facts on climate change may be akin to \ndenying the facts on evolution or whether the Earth is flat.''\n  Professor John Kutzbach of the University of Wisconsin--an elected \nmember of the National Academy of Sciences--was among a group of \nclimate scientists who in 2011 wrote to us in Congress imploring us to \ntake action on climate change. Here is what the letter said:\n\n       Congress needs to understand that scientists have \n     concluded, based on a systematic review of all of the \n     evidence, that climate change caused by human activities \n     raises serious risks to our national and economic security \n     and our health both here and around the world. It is time for \n     Congress to move on to the policy debate.\n\n  Well, I welcome that debate. Indeed, the chairman of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, recently said on the \nfloor of the Senate that she hopes we can ``get beyond the discussion \nas to whether or not climate change is real and talk about . . . what \ndo we do.'' So where is that debate? Where are the other Republicans? \nLet's finally talk about the cost of action and the cost of inaction.\n  The Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts was formed in 2007 \nby the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the University of \nWisconsin Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. The scientists \nand public officials in this program are doing important work to help \nthe State of Wisconsin understand and prepare for climate change. They \nare studying how it will affect wildlife, water resources, public \nhealth, and important Wisconsin industries such as forestry, \nagriculture, and shipping and tourism on the Great Lakes.\n  Climate change threatens iconic aspects of the Wisconsin environment \nand economy. The Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts \nAgriculture Working Group reports that higher summer temperatures and \nincreasing drought will create significant stress on livestock, even \ntouching--dare I say it--Wisconsin's famed cheese industry. Victor \nCabrera, an assistant professor in the University of Wisconsin-Madison \nDairy Science Department--they have one--says heat stress\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\ninterferes with fertility and milk production. Dairy cows could give as \nmuch as 10 percent less milk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture \npredicts that by 2030 climate change will cost the U.S. dairy sector \nbetween $79 and $199 million a year in lost production. When opponents \nsay reducing carbon pollution will cost too much, they conveniently \nleave out the cost of doing nothing, such as these costs.\n  Well, the dairy State is not waiting for Congress to take action. The \nUniversity of Wisconsin is leading a USDA-funded effort to identify \ndairy practices that minimize the emission of greenhouse gases and make \ndairies more resilient to the effects of a changing climate. Some \nWisconsin dairy farmers are burning excess methane in enormous manure \ndigesters--that is a frightening concept--to generate their own \nrenewable electricity.\n  Wisconsin sportsmen know that Wisconsin has more than 10,000 miles of \ntrout streams--some of the best trout fishing in the country. Cold-\nwater fish, such as the brook trout, are there, but they are highly \nsensitive to temperature increases in streams. Under the worst cases \nanalyzed by the researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and \nthe Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, ``brook trout are \nprojected to be completely lost from Wisconsin's streams.'' Even the \nbest-case scenarios see losses of as much as 44 percent of the \nbrookies' current range by midcentury. Other cold-water species, such \nas the brown trout, are not much better off.\n  Trout Unlimited--sportsmen and conservationists working to protect \ntrout streams in the Driftless Area in southwest Wisconsin and parts of \nMinnesota, Illinois, and Iowa--did a 2009 study showing fishing in the \nDriftless Area adds over $1 billion per year to the surrounding \neconomies.\n  We have heard of loggers having trouble getting to the timber because \nthe ground is thawed and too soggy to hold up logging equipment. For \nWisconsin's loggers, the hard, frozen winter ground is what lets them \nmove logging equipment. According to a study out of the University of \nWisconsin, that period of frozen ground has decreased by 2 to 3 weeks \nsince 1948, shortening the working window for loggers before their gear \nbogs down.\n  And then there is the badger. The Upper Midwest and Great Lakes \nLandscape Conservation Cooperative even lists the great Wisconsin \nbadger as one of the species at risk from regional climate change.\n  Senator Baldwin knows that, done right, action on climate change \nsaves Americans money, spurs American innovation, and creates new \nAmerican industry and jobs. Focus on Energy, Wisconsin's statewide \nenergy efficiency program, has been helping Wisconsin families and \nbusinesses save money and reduce energy use since 2001. The Wisconsin \nPublic Service Commission expects this program to inject over $900 \nmillion into the State's economy, and net over 6,000 new Wisconsin jobs \nover the next decade.\n  I am very grateful to my friend Senator Baldwin for her strong \nleadership on behalf of the people of Wisconsin to stave off the worst \neffects of climate change in her home State.\n  I yield to her now.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse for his \ncommitment to addressing the threats that climate change poses \nglobally, to our country, and to our States. I thank him for \nhighlighting some of those threats to my home State of Wisconsin.\n  Let there be no doubt that global climate change is real. It is a \nfact. The question is not whether it is happening, but rather how we \nare going to address it. Are we going to do all we can to leave the \nnext generation a safer and healthier world?\n  As my friend from Rhode Island just noted, climate change will be \ncostly to our economy and to our very way of life, and the longer we \nwait to act, the more costly these impacts will be.\n  Throughout our history, the State of Wisconsin has been a proud home \nto environmental leaders who have worked to pass on a stronger \nenvironment to future generations--Aldo Leopold, John Muir, and Senator \nGaylord Nelson, founder of Earth Day and the namesake for the Nelson \nInstitute at the University of Wisconsin, which my colleague from Rhode \nIsland just mentioned in his remarks. As a representative of our great \nState, it is one of my top priorities to follow in this legacy and to \npreserve our natural resources and quality of life for future \ngenerations.\n  It is not hard to see why Wisconsinites have always deeply valued \nenvironmental protection. Looking out at the crystal clear waters of \nLake Superior from its south shore, or standing atop Rib Mountain \ngazing at the forests and farmlands of central Wisconsin, to casting \nyour fishing rod in the world-class trout streams of the Driftless \nregion in southwestern Wisconsin, there is no question that we are \nblessed by the natural beauty of our State.\n  But even now, the impact of climate change can be seen on each of \nthese landscapes and in the economies they support. We see it in our \nagriculture--growing seasons are shifting, and extreme weather harms \nour crops, and we have increasing concerns about drought and our \ngroundwater.\n  In fact, NASA recently warned that within a few decades--within our \nlifetimes--the United States may enter a megadrought that could last 30 \nyears.\n  In my home State, the resulting decreased soil moisture will put \nadditional stress on farmers, on private wells, and on municipal \ndrinking water systems. These prolonged droughts, combined with \nincreased intensity of storm events and changing temperature patterns, \nwill force farmers to make changes to how and what they grow. This is \nextremely troubling, as agriculture is an $88 billion industry in my \nhome State of Wisconsin.\n  We also see the negative effects of climate change on our Great \nLakes. In Lake Michigan, for example, lake levels are largely driven by \nprecipitation. Changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change \nmay cause more dramatic fluctuations or prolonged changes in lake \nlevels.\n  In addition, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration shows that summertime surface water temperatures have \nincreased 8 degrees Fahrenheit since 1980. Warmer surface water \ntemperatures disrupt the food chain, which threatens our fish \npopulation. As these adverse effects are expected to worsen in the \ncoming decades, they will inevitably lead to more wildlife disease, and \nwarmer waters that will drive out native fish.\n  Changing water levels also create new challenges for property owners \nand communities along the Great Lakes. Infrastructure may need to be \nredesigned, insurance demands may change, and new health risks may \nemerge or be exacerbated as additional stress is imposed on our sewer \nsystems. Each of these will hurt our local economies.\n  Tourism is also a major part of Wisconsin's economy, and the \nNorthwoods is a favorite destination to fish, camp, hunt, and \nsnowmobile. But projections show that by midcentury, the climate of \nareas such as Bayfield and Vilas County in the Northwoods will be more \nsimilar to what we have known in the southeastern part of the State of \nWisconsin in counties such as Waukesha County.\n  Meanwhile, Waukesha County's climate could be more similar to what we \nused to expect hundreds of miles south in the neighboring State of \nIllinois. The impacts on tourism, recreation, and the landscapes we \nhold near and dear may be dramatic, and the threats may be daunting. \nBut we cannot continue to let the challenges overwhelm us and cause \ninaction on our part.\n  Wisconsin's State motto is ``Forward.'' The people of Wisconsin have \nnever been afraid of the challenges we face or what the future holds. \nWe have a strong progressive tradition of confronting our challenges \nand working together to shape our future for the next generation.\n  In fact, analysis by the World Resources Institute in 2013 found that \nWisconsin is well positioned to meet national goals for carbon \npollution reduction. By extending existing clean energy policies, \nWisconsin could reduce its emissions substantially in coming years.\n  In addition, many of Wisconsin's most successful companies are \nleaders in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean technology. \nThey are vital sources of innovation and will provide opportunities for \nthe workers of today and tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\n  I believe smart investments by government, by companies and \ninstitutions, and by citizens will help us confront the challenge of \nclimate change, while positioning Wisconsin for 21st century economic \nand ecological resiliency.\n  This opportunity is great. We must meet the challenge head on--going \nforward the Wisconsin way.\n  I once again thank Senator Whitehouse for his laser focus on this \nissue that is so critical to all of our home States, as well as, \nfrankly, the entire global community.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Prime Minister of Israel \nshared with the Congress and the American people his perspective \nregarding Israel's national security interests and the threat the \nradical regime in Tehran poses to stability in the greater Middle East. \nThe Prime Minister explained later in the day in a meeting here in the \nSenate why any agreement that leaves Iran with a threshold nuclear \nweapons capability is harmful not only to the strategic interests of \nIsrael but to the United States and to our allies.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama appears to be pursuing an agreement \nthat is designed to leave the Iranians with a threshold nuclear \ncapability under which they can retain thousands of centrifuges, \ncontinue to master the nuclear fuel cycle, advance ballistic missile \nresearch and testing, and keep secret any possible military dimensions \nof nuclear development that has already occurred. Iran has a record of \ncovertly pursuing aspects of a nuclear weapons program.\n  The administration has pursued the P5+1 negotiation, not as part of \nan overall strategy to end Iran's nuclear program and to defeat its \nefforts to dominate the region but as a stand-alone matter of \nlitigation where a settlement must be reached. This negotiation \nshouldn't be about getting the best deal the Iranians will agree to; it \nshould be about the strategic objective of ending Iran's nuclear \nweapons program.\n  Many in Congress have been wary of what kind of concessions the Obama \nadministration might agree to with the Iranians and what were the \nresponsible steps to be taken if Iran refused to give up the pursuit of \na nuclear weapons capability.\n  Yesterday I began the process to move to legislation that would meet \nthe demands from both sides of the aisle--to give Congress the ability \nto review and vote on any deal the President agrees to with Iran. From \na legislative perspective, given that this bipartisan bill was \nintroduced last week and that the Foreign Relations Committee has ample \ntime to mark up this bill and send a substitute to the floor, I was \nsurprised that some Senators made statements objecting to their own \nlegislation. It was surprising to see some Members on the other side of \nthe aisle threaten to filibuster their own bill--a bill they rushed to \nintroduce before the President's negotiations were complete.\n  This isn't complicated. A bill was introduced, and, as I discussed \nwith the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, it can be marked \nup, and the committee-passed bill would be the substitute the Senate \nthen considers.\n  From a policy perspective, it makes clear to the administration not \nto strike a deal that leaves Iran as a threshold nuclear state. And it \nmakes obvious sense to consider the Nuclear Review Act before the \ndeadline for a political agreement because the Iranians need to know \nthat congressional sanctions will not be lifted if a bad deal is \nreached, and some will oppose lifting sanctions if they refuse to \ndisclose the potential military dimensions of their nuclear program.\n  But, look, time is running out. Iran's Foreign Minister said today \nthat he believes they are very close to a deal.\n  There is nothing partisan about the Senate acting to serve its \nconstitutional role in oversight and in pursuing policies that uphold \nthe national security interest. It was the Obama administration that \ndecided to negotiate an agreement with Iran that would not be submitted \nto the Senate as a treaty. The White House went out of its way to \nbypass the elected representatives of the people in this negotiation \nwith Iran. It is the Obama administration that is negotiating a deal \nwith the Iranians that will leave them with a nuclear infrastructure. \nAnd it is the Corker-Graham-Menendez-Kaine bill that will ensure that \nCongress will review any deal the President strikes with Iran.\n  So let's be clear. The actions we have taken would allow the sponsors \nof this sensible, bipartisan legislation to begin the debate next week. \nAnd it will allow for the Foreign Relations Committee to follow the \nregular order and debate and vote on the bill. If the committee reports \na bill, the committee bill will become the text that the full Senate \ndebates. That is called the regular order.\n  It is my sincere hope that the sponsors of this bill will have the \nopportunity to review and defend their bill in committee and will not \nfilibuster and prevent the full Senate from also acting on their \nimportant legislation. The Senators who introduced the bill--who \nintroduced it--should certainly vote to debate the measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1295-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1295-S1296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DEEDEE CORRADINI\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a truly iconic \nUtah leader, a remarkable woman, and Salt Lake City's first and only \nfemale mayor, Ms. Deedee Corradini.\n  Sadly, Mayor Corradini lost her short but valiant battle with lung \ncancer this week. She was a fighter until the end--just as she was in \nher career and in all aspects of her life.\n  Deedee was a true trailblazer in every sense. She served as Salt Lake \nCity's mayor for 10 years during a time of significant growth and \nchange. During her tenure, she was instrumental in finalizing the \ncity's bid to host the 2002\n\n[[Page S1296]]\n\nWinter Olympics. She aggressively courted economic development and \nmanaged transportation infrastructure to ensure that Salt Lake City was \nprepared to take the world stage.\n  Always energetic, Mayor Corradini was full of ideas and \ndetermination, and she always knew how to get things done.\n  After her mayoral service, she worked for a time in academia and real \nestate, but perhaps her greatest personal achievement was her vigorous \nadvocacy of women's ski jumping. She served for 10 years as the \npresident of Women's Ski Jumping USA, where she lobbied tirelessly for \nthe inclusion of women's ski jumping in the Winter Olympic Games. She \nwas able to see her vision realized at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics \nas women ski jumpers dazzled the world in this arena for the first \ntime.\n  Prior to the Sochi games, she demonstrated her enthusiasm and \ndetermination to make this dream come true for women athletes stating:\n\n       We've already won. Every single one of the women's ski \n     jumpers, they've already won. . .Our battle to get the women \n     into ski jumping became much more than ski jumping. It really \n     became a women's rights issue and a human rights issue, \n     because we were really fighting for all women in all sports \n     and hopefully all aspects of life.\n\n  Deedee helped mentor many women and was an example of hard work, \ndetermination, and a will to succeed. Not only did she succeed in her \nprofessional pursuits; she was also a loving wife, daughter, sister, \nand mother.\n  Mr. President, Elaine and I send our deepest condolences to Deedee's \nfamily and friends, and we pray for their peace and comfort at this \ndifficult time. Her influence and legacy will be felt for generations \nto come. Utah was privileged to develop and grow under her leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1296-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           KILLING OF RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER BORIS NEMTSOV\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Today I recognize, on the Senate floor, the life and work \nof a true Russian patriot: Mr. Boris Nemtsov.\n  Tragically, Mr. Nemtsov was gunned down Friday night as he walked \nacross the Bolshoi Moskvoretsky Bridge with his girlfriend, just yards \nfrom the Kremlin and Red Square in central Moscow. Hours before his \ndeath, he had given a radio interview where he criticized Russian \nPresident Putin for his aggression in Ukraine and Russia's own economic \nwoes--brave acts in a nation where criticism of Putin is not tolerated.\n  Mr. Nemtsov has been one of the most vocal and highest profile \nopposition leaders in recent years, tirelessly speaking up for \ndemocratic reforms and rights on behalf of the Russian people. In fact, \nMr. Nemtsov has been working on behalf of the Russian people for nearly \n30 years.\n  He moved from physics into politics shortly after the Chernobyl \ndisaster in 1986, first winning a seat in the Russian Parliament in \n1990. After a series of successful economic reforms as a \nParliamentarian and later Governor, Nemtsov was then appointed Deputy \nPrime Minister under the first President of the Russian Federation, \nBoris Yeltsin, and even had a chance at the Presidency himself. \nHowever, he returned to Parliament after the 1998 crash of the Russian \nstock market until 2004. Since then, he was active in everything from \npolitics to banking, and over the years he raised repeated concerns \nthat Putin's policies were rolling back democracy and civic freedoms in \nRussia. Mr. Nemtsov had been arrested several times--and complained of \nofficial harassment--for his participation in demonstrations in support \nof reforms to end corruption, uphold the rule of law, and support basic \nfreedoms.\n  It is no surprise that tens of thousands of people showed up this \nSunday to a rally in Moscow. Originally scheduled to lead the event \nhimself to oppose Russian aggression in Ukraine, the rally turned into \nan opportunity for members of the opposition movement to mourn Mr. \nNemtsov's death. People held images of Mr. Nemtsov, flew flags, and \neven held up posters and signs with phrases such as: ``I am not \nafraid.''\n  Several thousand also showed up to his funeral Tuesday. Mr. Nemtsov's \nmother Dina Eidman received all the well-wishers. In recent months, she \nhad reportedly shared her fears that her son may be killed for his \ncriticism of President Putin.\n  Under President Putin there has been a troubling pattern of silencing \npeaceful dissent--a problem no doubt made worse by the deliberate \nwhipping up of nationalistic fervor in recent months around Putin's \ninvasion of eastern Ukraine.\n  We recall the tragic death in prison of Russian human rights lawyer \nSergei Magnitsky, jailed for uncovering hundreds of millions of dollars \nin tax fraud perpetuated by Russian officials in 2009. Mr. Nemtsov had \neven visited Washington, DC, in 2010 to support the Magnitsky Act.\n  Some of you may know of Natalya Estemirova or Anna Politkovskaya, two \nRussian human rights activists and journalists who were outspoken about \nhuman rights abuses in Chechnya, and murdered in 2009 and 2006, \nrespectively. There was also the 2006 poisoning in London of Alexander \nLitvinenko, an FSB officer who defected and made several claims of \ncorruption against Russian law enforcement officials. Incredulously, \none of those suspected for his murder by British authorities was later \nelected to the Russian Parliament. Sadly, the list goes on.\n  More recently, the nationalistic passions unleashed by the annexation \nof Crimea and Sevastopol last year has led to more narrowing of free \nspeech and the marginalization of activists. Many have faced \nharassment, prison sentences, even violence. And in many of these types \nof cases, perpetrators are not brought to justice. In a country where \nauthorities may sometimes be involved in crimes of their own and where \nlaw enforcement, judicial, and investigative bodies lack credibility, \nthere is very little accountability.\n  What has been happening in eastern Ukraine and Russia is deeply \ntroubling. President Putin has used the invasion of Ukraine to justify \na further crackdown on his own people's talents and aspirations. He has \nused state-controlled media to unleash anti-Western propaganda that is \nan insult to the Russia people. He has bet his people's economic and \ninternational standing on the pursuit and protection of his own \nkleptocracy. The Russian people deserve better.\n  In the case of Mr. Nemtsov, I echo the words of President Obama and \ncountless others: an independent investigation must take place to find \nout who was responsible for Mr. Nemtsov's death, and the perpetrators \nmust be swiftly brought to justice. The same goes for the many others \nwho had the courage to peacefully report the truth or voice dissent in \nRussia and then found themselves in jail or murdered.\n  I joined Senator Johnson this week in leading a resolution \nrecognizing Boris Nemtsov and calling for an investigation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this hero who has been taken from us too soon, \nand I hope we can continue to work in his honor to support the Russian \npeople as they stand for democratic reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1296-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1296-S1298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, next week the Nation will celebrate the \n50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, when we commemorate the series of \nmarches of nonviolent civil rights protestors from Selma to the Alabama \nState capital of Montgomery. They were marching for the right to vote, \nwhich had been guaranteed by the adoption of the 15th Amendment to the \nConstitution in 1870. The first section of the amendment reads: ``The \nright of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or \nabridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, \ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.''\n  These marches gripped the attention of the Nation because of the \nviolence reaction from the Alabama State troopers, who attacked the \nmarchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge after leaving Selma. The State \ntroopers attacked the marchers using billy clubs, tear gas, fire hoses, \nand dogs, and numerous marchers were wounded and were beaten \nunconscious.\n  The images shown on television galvanized the American public in \nsupport of voting rights. President Lyndon Johnson called on Congress \nto enact voting rights legislation and make\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\ngood on both the promise of the 15th Amendment as well as the \nresponsibility of Congress to enforce the amendment ``by appropriate \nlegislation.''\n  One of those protestors beaten on the bridge was a Freedom Rider, \nspeaker at the March on Washington, and a leader of the Student \nNonviolent Coordination Committee. That protestor was John Lewis.\n  I was honored and privileged to enter Congress in 1987 at the same \ntime as Congressman John Lewis. John Lewis has been a friend and mentor \nof mine for many years and is known as the ``conscience of the \nCongress.'' And while I did leave the House in 2006 to enter the Senate \nin 2007, I have continued to be inspired by Congressman Lewis and his \ncontinuing struggle to make sure all Americans enjoy the benefits of \nequal justice under the law.\n  Just last week during Black History Month, I had the honor, along \nwith Congressman John Lewis, to address a group of students from \nBaltimore who took their own pilgrimage to Selma as we approach the \n50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n  High School students and teachers from Park School, Baltimore City \nCollege, City Neighbors High School, and Cristo Rey Jesuit High School \nparticipated in a trip to southern cities such as Greensboro, Atlanta, \nSelma, Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, and Memphis, focusing on the \ncivil rights movement.\n  I wish to share some of the stories that the students told to \nCongressman Lewis and me last week, because their idealism, \ndetermination, and knowledge of both the past and present is very \ninspirational.\n  Let me begin with a brief history of how this trip came into being. \nIn 2004, the first group of students and faculty from the Park School \nof Baltimore and Baltimore City College High School traveled throughout \nthe American South, visiting with participants in the Civil Rights \nMovement and touring the museums, sites, and memorials that stand in \nwitness to the foot soldiers, heroes, and martyrs of the movement. The \ntrip was the dream of three Park School faculty members: Carol Kinne, \nTraci Wright, and Stradine Harris. They envisioned young people from \ndifferent schools and different backgrounds learning together and \nbecoming inspired to be agents of change upon their return.\n  Money to cover the expenses of the trip is raised each year by the \nstudents. They sell pizza and candy, rake leaves, write grant \nproposals, and solicit funds from various benefactors.\n  While learning about the Civil Rights Movement is a primary goal of \nthe trip, equally important is inspiring students to raise awareness of \ncivil rights issues facing people today and to become activists for \njustice in their own communities.\n  In 2015, four Baltimore schools--City Neighbors and Cristo Rey having \njoined the original two--sent 38 students on the trip.\n  The January 2015 trip was a special one, as the group had the chance \nto meet with former Ambassador Andrew Young in Atlanta and to attend an \nevent for the movie, Selma, that took place on the Edmund Pettus Bridge \nin Selma, in honor of the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n  The group also visited the International Civil Rights Center in \nGreensboro, NC, attended church service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, \ntoured the Rosa Parks Museum, met with activists at the Equal Justice \nInitiative and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and learned about the \nmovement in other museums in Birmingham, Memphis, and Little Rock. More \nimportantly, the group was able to meet and learn from people who \nfought for change: Cleopatra Goree, Catherine Burks-Brooks, Kurt \nCarrington, Roscoe Jones, Dr. Sybil Hampton, and others.\n  I wish to share just a few of the many stories from students who went \non this trip, as related in their blog:\n  Amber Smiley is a 12th grader at Cristo Rey. Amber wrote:\n\n       Across from the museum was this statue of people being \n     attacked by dogs and hit with high amounts of pressured \n     water. In these statues you could see the emotion in every \n     one of them. You could see the fit and the drive to make \n     changes. After leaving we had lunch with 3 women that \n     marched, taught, and fought for rights. The women's names are \n     Ms. Cleopatra Goree, Ms. Catherine Burks-Brooks, and Ms. \n     Mimes. Each one of their stories varied but all built up to \n     the bigger theme that we have to strive to make the world \n     better. These words stuck with me like glue on two pieces of \n     paper. Also, they said it's our turn to make a change its \n     make thing about how can each school community to come and \n     make a change in Baltimore. These women impacted my life and \n     the whole group to change the injustices in our world. I was \n     really honored to have them come and give us these points of \n     views and life stories. It was really a blessing.\n\n  Latonyah Williams is a 12th grader at City Neighbors. She wrote:\n\n       At the Little Rock Central visitor center, I found a quote \n     that immediately grabbed my attention as I walked through the \n     doors. It goes ``If not us, then who? If not now, then \n     when?''--John Lewis. It grabbed at me because it shows the \n     mindset behind how the leaders were thinking back when they \n     were fighting for our rights. They weren't thinking of \n     themselves or their lives, but of the future and the many \n     generations to come. So now I want to have the mindset of if \n     not me, then who will take a stand? If not now, then most \n     likely it will not ever happen.\n\n  I am confident that this trip continues to impact students long after \nthey return to Baltimore.\n  So today, while we recognize the achievements and accomplishments of \nheroes like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, Thurgood Marshall, \nand John Lewis, we cannot shy away from the painful history of race \nrelations in our country. To do so would be a disservice to all those \nwho struggled and sacrificed in the name of equality.\n  Slavery and segregation were dark and painful chapters in American \nhistory, and those abhorrent practices occurred in Maryland and \nthroughout the rest of our Nation.\n  Today, we must confront the issue of racial profiling. Racial \nprofiling is the practice of discriminatory profiling based on race, \nethnicity, religion or any other stereotype, and it is a matter that \nneeds to be addressed from its root causes.\n  I ask: how many more cases like Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and \nEric Garner must we have? How many more families will have to suffer \nuntil we get this right?\n  It has been heartbreaking to see several other American towns--from \nFerguson, MO, to New York City, gripped by such a tragedies that \nresulted from racial profiling. Eighteen-year old Michael Brown was \njust days away from starting his first college classes, but he no \nlonger has the chance to pursue his dreams.\n  In the Senate I have introduced the End Racial Profiling Act. This \nlegislation is a step in the direction of ensuring equal treatment of \nall people under the law, conserving resources, and restoring trust in \nthe men and women who risk their lives by signing up to protect our \ncommunities.\n  Racial profiling is un-American. It has no place within the values of \nour country. It turns communities against the partnerships needed to \nkeep our neighborhoods safe.\n  Racial profiling is defined in a standard, consistent definition as \nthe practice of a law enforcement agent relying on race, ethnicity, \nreligion or national origin as a factor in their investigations and \nactivities.\n  The legislation I have introduced creates an exception for the use of \nthese factors where there is trustworthy information, relevant to the \nlocality and time frame, which links persons of a particular race, \nethnicity or national origin to an identified incident or scheme.\n  Law enforcement agencies would be prohibited from using racial \nprofiling in criminal or routine law enforcement investigations, \nimmigration enforcement, and national security cases.\n  The legislation I have introduced is supported by a broad coalition \nof civil rights groups such as the NAACP, Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights, ACLU, Rights Working Group, ACLU, and numerous \nother national, State, and local organizations.\n  While some may predict further gridlock and political polarization \nwith a Congress led by one party and the President of another, I firmly \nbelieve that we will find ways to work together on the issues most \nimportant to the American public--and racial profiling is clearly one \nof those issues.\n  Congress overwhelmingly reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006 \nafter building an extensive record that made a compelling case for the \ncontinued need to protect minority voters from discrimination.\n  As much as we wish it wasn't so, racism has not disappeared from \nAmerica\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\nand there continue to be individuals and groups who would use our \nvoting system to deliberately minimize the rights of minority voters. \nCongress should act to revitalize the Voting Rights Act.\n  Protecting the right to vote also extends to restoring the rights of \nnearly 4 million Americans across the country who have been released \nfrom prison but barred from the voting booth, often for life. I have \nbeen leading the fight for the Democracy Restoration Act, which would \nrestore voting rights to individuals after they have served their time \nand have been released from incarceration.\n  If we truly want to break the cycle of recidivism, we need to \nreintegrate former prisoners back into society. When prisoners are \nreleased, they are expected to obey the law, get a job, and pay taxes \nas they are rehabilitated and reintegrated into their community. With \nthese responsibilities and obligations of citizenship should also come \nthe rights of citizenship, including the right to vote.\n  The current patchwork of State laws results in the lack of a uniform \nstandard for eligibility to vote in Federal elections.\n  I believe that Congress should take strong action now to remedy this \nproblem and enact a nationwide standard for restoration of voting \nrights. That is why I have introduced the Democracy Restoration Act.\n  As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, let us \ncontinue the march for justice for all Americans. I urge Congress to \naddress the issues of voting rights and racial profiling during this \nsession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1298-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CENTENNIAL OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY RESERVE\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, yesterday marked the centennial of the \nU.S. Navy Reserve, an indispensable and valuable part of our Armed \nForces. The Navy Reserve was established as the Naval Reserve on March \n3, 1915, and since then sailors have served in every conflict from \nWorld War I to the present. In addition, five U.S. Presidents: John F. \nKennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. \nBush have all served honorably in the Navy Reserve.\n  Today, we have more than 2,000 Navy Reserve sailors deployed around \nthe world and our country is extremely grateful for the contributions \nand sacrifices that these sailors have made and continue to make to the \nhistory of the United States.\n\n\n                      Lieutenant Michael Grabowski\n\n  One of those sailors I would like to talk about today is LT Michael \nGrabowski from Norwalk, CT. Lieutenant Grabowski is a perfect example \nof the student-citizen-soldier who wears two uniforms, one protecting \nthe people of my State and the other honorably protecting our soldiers \noverseas. As a civilian, Lieutenant Grabowski serves in the Connecticut \nState Police and is one of six servicemembers of the Connecticut State \nPolice currently mobilized by our Armed Forces. In addition, he is a \nfirst-year law student at Quinnipiac University. Michael is currently \nmobilized to Qatar supporting Operation Enduring Freedom as a master of \narms in the Navy. Michael is a fine example of the courage and \nsacrifice that citizens of Connecticut and all across the country have \nmade to protect our freedoms.\n  Today we celebrate Michael and every sailor and their families' \ncommitment and service; and encourage all Americans to seize the \nopportunity to honor and support these brave men and women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1298-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1298-S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE SECTOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks to the Association of Private Sector \nColleges and Universities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities\n\n       Our nation is home to the world's greatest system of \n     colleges and universities. From the beginning, federal policy \n     has been to give grants and loans to students and let them \n     choose from among all types of institutions--public four-year \n     universities, community colleges, for-profit colleges, and \n     private non-profits.\n       For example, students can study automobile technology at \n     Nashville's auto diesel school or forensic psychology at \n     Argosy University or computer information systems at DeVry \n     University.\n       Student choice and competition are the drivers of American \n     higher education's success. And an important participant in \n     American higher education has always been our for-profit \n     colleges and universities.\n       The students served by for-profit colleges underscore their \n     importance. Nearly 2,100 institutions educate 3.3 million \n     students representing, approximately 12 percent of all \n     college enrollments, 1.8 million Pell students and 1.9 \n     million federal loan borrowers. More than half of enrollments \n     are students of color. Fifty percent of students are juggling \n     school with children. More than a third of these students are \n     working full-time while going to school. For-profits \n     accounted for 44 percent of certificates, 20 percent of two-\n     year associate's degrees and 7 percent of bachelor's degrees \n     granted in the United States in 2012.\n       The President along with many governors and state \n     legislatures are setting goals to increase the number of \n     citizens with college degrees or certificates. Governor \n     Haslam in Tennessee has an ambitious goal called Drive to 55, \n     to see 55 percent of Tennesseans with degrees or certificates \n     by 2025. The president has called for America to have the \n     highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.\n       The only way to achieve these goals is to include all \n     sectors of higher education, including for-profit colleges \n     and universities. Yet this administration has taken aim at \n     the for-profit sector, and has created regulations \n     specifically targeting your colleges and universities.\n       My view is that our policies should equally apply to all \n     institutions of higher education, no matter the sector. There \n     are bad apples in the for-profit sector--but there are bad \n     apples in every sector of higher education.\n       So let me begin to describe my priorities for all sectors \n     of higher education, which includes your colleges and \n     universities:\n       1) Make it easier for students to go to college (FAST Act)\n       2) Make it simpler for colleges and universities to educate \n     (Task Force on Regulation)\n       3) Make sure that accreditation ensures quality \n     (Accreditation)\n       4) Make it harder to overborrow (FAST Act, Skin in the \n     Game)\n       5) Make sure colleges are collecting useful data for \n     students, families and policymakers (Consumer Data)\n       These are my priorities as we work over the next few months \n     to reauthorize this law and ensure that 20 years from now, \n     our colleges and universities still remain the best in the \n     world in the quality of education they provide.\n       Number one, make it simpler for colleges and universities \n     to educate. Today we have a government form so complicated \n     and confusing that it discourages as many as 2 million \n     Americans from attending college each year. This is the \n     dreaded FAFSA--the Free Application for Federal Student Aid--\n     which consists of 108 questions on topics ranging from your \n     spouse's federal tax exemptions to the net worth of your \n     parents' investment farms.\n       I have joined with a bipartisan group of senators to \n     introduce legislation that would simplify the FAFSA form to \n     just two questions--1) What was your household income two \n     years ago? 2) What is your family size?\n       Four experts before our committee testified that these two \n     questions would provide about 95 percent of all the \n     information the federal government needs to determine award \n     amounts.\n       It would also make the process, as much as the questions, \n     less intimidating for parents. Because our bill would ask for \n     household income from two years ago--as opposed to last \n     year's income--it would restore sanity to the parents of \n     applicants who are often being asked to provide the \n     government with their income totals before they've even \n     received their W-2s for the year.\n       One mentor with Governor Haslam's Tennessee Promise \n     program, a woman named Cathy Hammon, says the form has a \n     ``chilling effect''--intimidating parents who may themselves \n     never have attended college, and have no experience \n     navigating the process. She says this: ``It's the very youth \n     we worry about the most that struggle with it.''\n       The FAST Act would also restore year-round Pell \n     availability. This gives students common-sense flexibility. \n     According to a study by New America, under today's Pell \n     schedule: ``If a student attends a college that treats the \n     summer as the start of the year, receives Pell Grants as a \n     full-time student in that summer, and then attends full-time \n     in the fall, she will not have enough aid to attend full-time \n     in the spring.'' That doesn't make sense and it doesn't help \n     students. So our proposal would let them use Pell all year.\n       Number two, make it simpler for colleges and universities \n     to educate.\n       Over a year ago, Vanderbilt University hired the Boston \n     Consulting Group to determine how much it costs the \n     university to comply with federal rules and regulations. The \n     answer: $150 million, or 11 percent of the university's total \n     non-hospital expenditures last year. Vanderbilt Chancellor \n     Nick Zeppos says that this adds about $11,000 in additional \n     tuition per year for each of the university's 12,757 \n     students.\n\n[[Page S1299]]\n\n       The Higher Education Act totals nearly 1,000 pages; there \n     are over 1,000 pages in the official Code of Federal \n     Regulations devoted to higher education; and on average every \n     workday the Department of Education issues one new sub-\n     regulatory guidance directive or clarification. No one has \n     taken the time to ``weed the garden.''\n       The result of this piling up of regulations is that one of \n     the greatest obstacles to innovation and cost consciousness \n     in higher education has become--us, the federal government.\n       A conspicuous example of this is the Gainful Employment \n     regulation. It's a perfect symbol of what's wrong with our \n     regulatory process that the Administration needed nearly 945 \n     pages to define a two-word phrase that has been in the higher \n     education law in one form or another since 1965.\n       What's especially concerning about the regulation is--\n       First, the rule is designed to almost exclusively impact \n     and penalize for-profit colleges and universities. It \n     selectively ignores concerns about student loan debt levels \n     across all sectors of higher education.\n       The Department of Education's own National Center for \n     Education Statistics reports that 26% of graduates from \n     public, four-year colleges and 39% of graduates from private, \n     four-year colleges would not be considered ``gainfully \n     employed'' using the Department's metrics. It seems \n     ridiculous that this regulation could shut down a nursing \n     program at a for-profit institution but not one in exactly \n     the same circumstances at a non-profit or public institution.\n       Second, the rule's complex debt-to-income ratios over-\n     emphasize a graduate's income right after college. This is \n     especially shortsighted for educational programs that hold an \n     important public benefit such as education or social work, \n     but don't result in early-career, high-paying salaries.\n       Third, this regulation has nothing to do with the quality \n     of the education being provided. It simply relies on \n     arbitrary government definitions of affordable student loan \n     debt. What would be the result? More than 800,000 students \n     will be kicked out of their programs at a time when many \n     public colleges are unable to accommodate more students.\n       This simply isn't a good regulation and I think the \n     Administration knows I'll do what it takes to oppose it. I've \n     cosponsored legislation by Richard Burr and Virginia Foxx to \n     overturn the gainful employment regulation, and other \n     regulations that are equally ill advised. I led a letter \n     signed by several of my colleagues opposing the proposed \n     regulations, and I am prepared to offer an amendment to \n     restrict funds from being used to implement the rule. As we \n     approach the rewrite of the Higher Education Act, I intend to \n     do what I can to prohibit the Department from implementing \n     this regulation and treat all institutions equally.\n       This is just one example of regulatory excess.\n       And when it comes to bad regulations, let me make clear: we \n     cannot just blame President Obama and Education Secretary \n     Arne Duncan. They have contributed to the problem, but so has \n     every president and every education secretary--and that \n     includes me--since 1965 when the first Higher Education Act \n     was enacted.\n       More than a year ago, four members of the Senate education \n     committee--two Democrats and two Republicans--asked a group \n     of distinguished educators to examine the current state of \n     federal rules and regulations for colleges and universities. \n     We asked them not just to tell us the problem, but to give us \n     specific solutions.\n       They last month sent to us, ``Recalibrating Regulation of \n     Colleges and Universities,'' a remarkable report in which \n     they outline 59 specific regulations, requirements and areas \n     for Congress and the Department of Education to consider--\n     listing 10 especially problematic regulations. In their own \n     words, America's 6,000 colleges and universities live in a \n     ``jungle of red tape'' that is expensive and confusing and \n     unnecessary.\n       So with this reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, \n     Ranking Member Murray and I will work on a process that takes \n     full advantage of the recommendations in this report so we \n     can include many of them in the reauthorization of the Higher \n     Education Act.\n       But the bottom line is that regulations are taking good \n     money away from educating students and performing research \n     and all sorts of other things colleges and universities ought \n     to be doing.\n       We won't let that happen again with this reauthorization.\n       Number three, make sure that accreditation ensures quality.\n       Our higher education system today is governed by what's \n     known as the ``triad'':\n       The federal government, which ensures that colleges and \n     universities have the fiscal and administrative capability to \n     participate in federal aid programs.\n       The state governments--governor, legislature, state boards \n     of education--that authorize institutions of higher \n     education, oversee public institutions, and provide \n     substantial public funding.\n       Finally, and perhaps most important, is the accreditation \n     system.\n       The system also has one other major check, the student \n     consumer--who is able to choose from over 6,000 colleges and \n     universities, and ideally is unlikely to waste their time and \n     money on a worthless degree. When it comes to ensuring \n     academic quality--the choice is this: Either we have \n     Washington regulate our over 6,000 colleges and universities, \n     or we let them self-regulate through accreditation. I much \n     prefer accreditation.\n       That does not mean our system of accreditation is problem-\n     free. Today, accreditors meddle in areas that are none of \n     their business. And sometimes they're too stuffy to allow \n     some of the innovation that needs to come in education. We \n     need to take a hard look at the system and the role it serves \n     for the American taxpayer.\n       We need to answer questions, such as:\n       Are accreditors focused on the right things such as student \n     learning and quality?\n       Does the current structure of regional accreditation make \n     sense in today's world when higher education is increasingly \n     national in scope?\n       Are federal rules and regulations on accreditors getting in \n     the way of their ability to asses and ensure academic \n     quality?\n       But we need to keep in mind that this system is far \n     preferable to any regulatory body created by the federal \n     government.\n       Number four, make it harder for students to over-borrow.\n       There's a lot of discussion about student debt in the \n     United States, but when you drill down on who's really got so \n     much debt: It's a very small contingent of mostly graduate \n     students. For most Americans, college is a good investment \n     that will pay off.\n       Three out of four of our college students attend a public \n     2- or 4-year college and university. Of those, about two out \n     of five of all students attend community colleges where the \n     average tuition and fees are under $3,300. Those students \n     receive an average of $4,850 in grants and scholarships. So \n     the average community college student in America is receiving \n     about $1,500 more in grants and scholarships than what it \n     costs in tuition and fees to attend college.\n       Thirty-seven percent of all of our college students attend \n     public 4-year universities. The average in-state tuition and \n     fees is about $8,900. Those students receive in average \n     $5,800 in grants and scholarships. We're not talking loans, \n     so they have to pay $3,100 on average, in tuition and fees.\n       And then we have students who attend 4-year colleges that \n     are private. That's about 15 percent. Their average tuition \n     and fees are $30,000 but the scholarships and grants take \n     that down to $12,500. At for-profit colleges and \n     universities, the average cost is about $15,000.\n       About 2 percent of federal borrowers have more than \n     $100,000 in debt. Graduate students are typically the \n     problem.\n       The FAST Act would discourage over-borrowing by limiting \n     the amount a graduate student is able to borrow. It would \n     also help undergraduates from borrowing too much, by limiting \n     borrowing based on enrollment. For example, a part-time \n     student would be able to take out a part time loan only.\n       In addition, my proposal would allow institutions to limit \n     borrowing based on evidence that students completing the \n     program have difficulty repaying their loans.\n       I would also like to give schools more ability to counsel \n     students on borrowing. Many in Congress are concerned with \n     students borrowing more than is necessary while attending \n     college and anecdotal examples of increased institutional \n     counseling has led to reduced borrowing by students.\n       I believe that the institution, especially if we give you \n     the ability to counsel students and limit borrowing, should \n     bear some responsibility for this borrowing--after all you \n     are the ones charging these students. However, I am seeking \n     your input on this topic. Some of your members, as well as \n     the association itself, have talked with me and my staff \n     about this topic. I hope those discussions continue.\n       Number five, make sure the data colleges are collecting are \n     useful for students, families and policymakers.\n       Before we rewrite this law, we need to know what \n     information consumers actually find useful as they shop for \n     schools, how much information is too much and what is the \n     role of the federal government.\n       The federal government collects thousands of data points \n     annually on schools, yet still cannot answer some of \n     policymakers and students basic questions. In the future, \n     Department of Education should only collect data that is \n     useful to consumers or to policymakers regarding how well our \n     federal programs are working. Consumers nor policymakers are \n     able to absorb all of the data currently collected.\n       This is a prime area to reduce institutional burden. So we \n     need to determine what information is truly needed. That may \n     mean collecting new and different data that better fulfills \n     federal responsibilities to taxpayers and drives the free \n     market which makes our country and higher education system \n     number one.\n       It is also important to ensure that the Department is not \n     allowed to manipulate this data to create opaque, \n     inappropriate or contrived metrics such as recently happened \n     with cohort default rates and gainful employment, and will \n     more than likely occur in the forthcoming ratings system.\n       I look forward to the upcoming reauthorization. Senator \n     Murray and I are working very well in moving a fix to No \n     Child Left Behind and I see no reason why the Higher \n     Education Act will be any different. I intend to move to this \n     bill this spring after we complete Senate action on No Child \n     Left Behind. We will hold several hearings before holding a \n     mark-up of a reauthorization early this summer. I look \n     forward to continuing to work with you as the process \n     unfolds. Thank you for everything you have done to be helpful \n     so far and for providing opportunity to those seeking a \n     higher education.\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1300-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JEFFREY SHAW\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Jeffrey Shaw \non his retirement after serving Southwest Gas Corporation, Southwest \nGas, for 27 years. It gives me great pleasure to recognize his years of \nhard work and dedication to a company that services thousands across \nNevada.\n  Mr. Shaw stands as a shining example of someone who has devoted his \nlife to serving his State and community. After earning his bachelor of \nscience in accounting from the University of Utah, Mr. Shaw worked for \nArthur Andersen & Co. in its Dallas and Las Vegas offices in the audit \ndivision. In 1988, he began his career at Southwest Gas as director of \ninternal audit. From there, Mr. Shaw worked to move higher in the \ncompany, climbing from controller and chief accounting officer all the \nway to president and chief executive officer of Southwest Gas. Today, \nthe company services over 1 million homes across the country.\n  Mr. Shaw is not only driven in his endeavors with Southwest Gas, but \nwithin the local Las Vegas community as well. He is a member of the \nNevada Society of Certified Public Accountants and the Leadership Las \nVegas Alumni Association. He also serves on the boards of the Council \nfor a Better Nevada and the UNLV Foundation, and he is a past president \nand a current board member of both the Western Energy Institute and the \nLas Vegas Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. His work \nthroughout these many organizations demonstrates his dedication to \nhonorably representing Nevada on multiple fronts. Although he is \nretiring, his legacy within these organizations will continue for years \nto come.\n  It is not only Mr. Shaw's commitment and drive to excel that places \nhim among the most notable in his community, but also his genuine good \nnature in helping others. He has served Las Vegas by contributing to \nhigher education and the local Boy Scout community, and by working to \nimprove the quality of life across the State. His commitment to helping \nthose around him is unwavering.\n  I am very grateful for his dedication to the people of Las Vegas and \nto the State of Nevada. He exemplifies the highest standards of \nleadership and community service and should be proud of his long and \nmeaningful career. Today, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Mr. Shaw on his retirement, and I give my deepest \nappreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada a better place. I \noffer him my best wishes for many successful and fulfilling years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1300-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DONALDO MCINTOSH\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Donaldo \nMcIntosh on his retirement after 58 years of service to Nevada and to \nthe country. His hard work and dedication throughout the years is \nhonorable.\n  Mr. McIntosh started his career in 1957 as a military police officer \nin the U.S. Army. His service extended for 3 years, protecting those in \nhis local community, as well as his country. After serving in the Army, \nMr. McIntosh then spent the rest of his career working in the \ntransportation industry for the city of Las Vegas. In 1970, he worked \nas safety director for the Las Vegas Transit System and Greyline Tours \nand then for Transportation Unlimited. His final years of service were \nspent as a transportation escort for the Pahrump Senior Center.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. McIntosh for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America. His service to his \ncountry and his bravery and dedication earn him a place among the \noutstanding men and women who have valiantly defended our Nation. As a \nmember of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that \nCongress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals \nwho serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for after their \nservice.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan supporting scientifically-based state management of \n     gray wolves and calling for legislative action by the U.S. \n     Congress in an effort to remove the Western Great Lakes gray \n     wolf population from the endangered and threatened species \n     list; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, On December 19, 2014, the U.S. District Court for \n     the District of Columbia returned the Western Great Lakes \n     population of gray wolves to the federal endangered and \n     threatened species list. This is the third time in the last \n     decade that federal courts have disregarded the judgment of \n     U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientists and overturned a \n     delisting of the gray wolf in the Great Lakes regions; and\n       Whereas, Based on objective scientific criteria, gray \n     wolves have made a remarkable recovery from near extinction \n     and are no and longer endangered in Michigan. Michigan's gray \n     wolf population exceeds by more than three times the number \n     or wolves biologists consider necessary to maintain a healthy \n     population and has grown steadily for more than a decade. \n     Michigan's wolf population has met all federal recovery goals \n     for delisting, both in terms of the number of wolves and the \n     stability of those numbers; and\n       Whereas, The extreme protection afforded gray wolves under \n     the federal Endangered Species Act prevents sound management \n     of this species in Michigan. Gray wolves increasingly \n     endanger people and domestic animals as they encroach more \n     and more on developed areas, and they also impact other \n     wildlife. In 2014, deadly wolf attacks on livestock and dogs \n     increased 75 percent in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. As a \n     result of the court's decision, Michigan's laws allowing \n     citizens to protect their valuable livestock and dogs from \n     wolves have been invalidated. The federal law was designed to \n     bring back species from the brink of extinction, not manage \n     the complicated interactions between people and an \n     increasingly large and expanding predator population; and\n       Whereas, Michigan is well-prepared to manage gray wolves. \n     The state of Michigan has developed a scientifically-based \n     management plan that will continue to maintain a healthy gray \n     wolf population while allowing for more flexibility when \n     conflicts between people and wolves arise. This plan will \n     allow the state to meets its obligations under sections 51 \n     and 52 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan of 1963 \n     to protect the public health and natural resources in the \n     interest of the general welfare of the people; and\n       Whereas, Michigan cannot properly manage the gray wolf \n     population until gray wolves are removed from the federal \n     endangered and threatened species list in the Great Lakes \n     region. The federal courts' continued interference infringes \n     on this state's rights under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution, and the U.S. District Court's ruling must be \n     overturned or the fundamental flaws in the federal Endangered \n     Species Act corrected so that science and reason can prevail; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we support scientifically-\n     based state management of gray wolves by the Michigan Natural \n     Resources Commission and the Michigan Department of Natural \n     Resources; and be it further\n       Resolved, That to achieve that end, we support federal \n     legislation to lift federal protections on the Western Great \n     Lakes gray wolf population so they are no longer considered \n     endangered, and we call on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to appeal \n     the recent federal court ruling that returned gray wolves in \n     the Great Lakes region to the federal endangered and \n     threatened species list; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, the director of the US. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service, the Michigan Natural Resources \n     Commission, and the director of the Michigan Department of \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1302-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1302-S1303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n       S. 648.

A bill to amend the Water Resources Research Act of 1984 to \nreauthorize grants for and require applied water supply research \nregarding the water resources research and technology institutes \nestablished under that Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Water Resources \nResearch Amendments Act. First authorized in 1964, the Water Resources \nResearch Act established 54 Water Resources Research Institutes at top \nland grant universities in each of the 50 States and the U.S. \nterritories. These institutes created a grant program and provided \nopportunities for applied water supply research. The bill I introduce \ntoday would reauthorize the grant program for the next 5 years and \nwould add a program focused on research and development of green \ninfrastructure.\n  Water and the availability thereof is a defining characteristic of \nU.S. landscape, culture, wealth, and security. Clean water is a \nrelatively rare and invaluable resource. Last year's funded projects \nincluded research into the impacts of climate change on water supply \nlakes, the development of better detection methods for pathogens in \ndrinking water, and the impacts of drought on farm supply chains. In my \nown State, some of the tools we use for restoration of the Chesapeake \nBay were products of these same grants in previous years. WRRA \nResearchers across the Mid-Atlantic States have developed ways to keep \nthe Chesapeake waters cleaner through urban stormwater treatment, \nimproved roadway design, and eco-friendly poultry farming practices. \nWRRA-funded projects develop innovative and cost-effective solutions \nfor similar water resources issues across the country. Undoubtedly, \nfunding WRRA is an intelligent and necessary investment in the future \nof our water resources.\n  WRRA authorizes two types of annual grants. First, it supplies grants \nto each Water Resources Research Institute for research that fosters \nimprovements in water supply reliability, explores new ways to address \nwater problems, encourages dissemination of research to water managers \nand the public, and encourages the entry of new scientists, engineers \nand technicians into the water resources field. Second, WRRA authorizes \na national competitive grant program to address regional water issues. \nAll WRRA grants leverage non-federal dollars at a minimum ratio of 2 to \n1, but often far beyond that level, as high as 5 to 1.\n  The Water Resources Research Act was most recently reauthorized in \n2006, in PL 109-471. In that period, the program was authorized at \n$12,000,000 per year, providing $6,000,000 each to state and \ncompetitive project grants. Authorization for these grants expired in \nfiscal year 2011. Today's bill would reauthorize both grant programs \nfor an additional 5 years by providing $7,500,000 for institutional \ngrants and $1,500,000 for national competitive grants. This lower \nauthorization level reflects our efforts to adjust for present fiscal \nlimitations. The proposed authorization maximizes the economic \nefficiency of the program without compromising its efficacy. An \nindependent review panel has judged that the Water Resources Research \nInstitutes command significant funding leverage for the modest amount \nof appropriations required to support it. Thus, we can be sure that we \nare supporting top-notch science while maximizing cost-effectiveness. \nMoreover, by funding this network of institutes we are investing in our \nfuture. The Water Resources Research Institutes are the country's \nsingle largest training program for water scientists, technicians, and \nengineers.\n  Today, floods, droughts, and water degradation issues pervade the \nnation. Simultaneously, water resources are increasingly critical for \nproduction of resources, economic stability, and the health and well-\nbeing of the citizenry. WRRA grants provide us with improved \nunderstanding of water-related issues and better technology to address \nthem. Nearly half a century after the Water Resources Research grant \nprogram was first put in place, this program is relevant, critical, and \ndeserving of our support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend to \nall veterans with a serious service-connected injury eligibility to \nparticipate in the family caregiver services program; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a bill today along \nwith Senator Baldwin that will help veterans and the men and women who \ncare for them. Called the Caregivers\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\nExpansion and Improvement Act, it would open the VA Family Caregivers \nProgram to all eligible veterans who were severely injured while \nserving our country.\n  I introduced legislation creating the Family Caregiver Program in \n2009 so caregivers of severely injured veterans could take care of our \nheroes at home. The program provides home health training, peer \nsupport, and a small financial stipend to caregivers of severely \ninjured veterans. The caregivers also have access to mental health \nsupport and enrollment in the VA's Civilian Health and Mental Program, \nif they are not already eligible.\n  When the Caregivers Program was created, we had to limit eligibility \nfor the program to post-9/11 veterans. It has been wildly successful. \nTwenty thousand veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan participate \nin the program today. This is more than five times the number the VA \noriginally estimated would sign up. The program helps caregivers, who \nshoulder the cost of homecare, know they are not alone.\n  Since introducing the Caregivers Program 6 years ago, I have gotten \nto know many caregivers in my State. One family who lives in Chicago, \nDan and Trish Sylvester, made a lasting impression on me. Trish, a \nveteran of the Iraq war, is 100 percent disabled due to severe PTSD. It \ncan be triggered by anything from a backfiring car to simply a bad \nthought running through her head. Dan, who is a veteran himself, \ngraduated from DePaul Law School last year and now practices law part \ntime.\n  Today, as he did all through law school, Dan takes care of Trish, \nmaking sure she stays on top of all her medications and going with her \nto counseling appointments. Trish's symptoms first took hold in \nFebruary 2011, and she was hospitalized multiple times.\n  The Sylvesters' found out about the Family Caregiver Program shortly \nafter it was launched and applied with the help of a Jesse Brown VA \nemployee named Erica. They use the Caregivers stipend to pay for \ncounseling services that are not provided by the VA. The money also \nhelped them avoid having to take out more in student loans than they \nhad to and kept Dan from having to add a part-time job to his already \nfull plate when he was a student. Dan says the resources available to \nhim through the program are lifesavers.\n  Both Trish and Dan showed courage in serving our country. Their \nsacrifice didn't end after their deployments. They continue to show \ngreat courage every day that they work together on Trish's recovery.\n  The bill Senator Baldwin and I are introducing today would allow \neligible veterans from all wars to apply for the VA Family Caregivers \nProgram. The VA has estimated that as many as 88,000 additional veteran \ncaregivers could qualify for the program under this bill.\n  Not only does the program allow veterans to stay in their homes with \ntheir families, it is a money-saver for taxpayers. The VA spends an \naverage of $332,000 per veteran per year in VA nursing homes. It spends \nan average of $88,000 per veteran per year in community nursing homes. \nIt also spends about $45,000 a year in per diem payments to veterans in \nState Veterans Homes. Through the Caregivers Program, the VA cost per \nveteran per year is about $36,000. This includes the stipend, which \naverages between $600 and $2,250 a month, based on the level of care \nand the geographic location, and services provided to the caregiver. It \nis an enormous savings to the VA, when you consider the cost of the \nalternative, full-time, institutional care. And it's a tremendous \ncomfort to the veterans and the caregivers who look after them.\n  I commend each of the caregivers who have made the decision to care \nfor our heroes. These veterans sacrificed their health and well-being \nfor their country, and their caregivers have sacrificed much of their \nown lives, careers, school, retirement, to care for them upon their \nreturn home. We owe each and every one of them a great debt of \ngratitude. We want to make sure all qualified family caregivers are \nenrolled in this program.\n  With this bill, we are on the way to helping many families in need. \nWe can finally provide assistance to the caregivers of Veterans of all \neras on an equal basis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 657\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish a credit for married couples who are both employed and have \nyoung children; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \njoin my colleagues in taking a step back from the partisan bills on the \nfloor this week to talk about the ways we should be able to work \ntogether to grow the economy and help our working families.\n  Democrats have an economic theory that we are pretty confident about. \nWe believe that real, long-term economic growth is built from the \nmiddle out, not from the top down. We believe that government does have \na role to play in investing in our working families and making sure \nthey have the opportunity to work hard and succeed, offering a hand up \nto those who want to climb the economic ladder and provide a better \nlife for themselves and their families. We believe our government and \nour economy should be working for all families, not just the wealthiest \nfew.\n  Thankfully we have had the opportunity to put some policies in place \nover the past few years that have pulled our economy back from the \nbrink and have started moving it in the right direction. We are not \nthere yet, but across the country businesses have added almost 12 \nmillion new jobs. We have had over 59 straight months of job growth, \nincluding almost 1 million manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate is \nnow under 6 percent. Health care costs are growing at their lowest rate \nin almost 50 years, while millions more families now have access to \naffordable coverage. The Federal budget deficit has been reduced by \nover two-thirds since President Obama took office.\n  Although many Republicans seem to keep threatening to bring us back, \nwe have been able to move away from the constant tea party-driven \ncrises and uncertainty that were really destroying jobs and holding \nback our economy.\n  We are headed in a good direction. I am proud of the policies that we \nfought for that helped us to get here, but we do have a whole lot more \nto do.\n  The economy has changed over the past few decades, and our Tax Code \nhas not kept up. Working families have seen their incomes stagnate \nwhile the cost of living, health care, and education has continued to \ngo up. More and more families have two workers in the workforce, which \nis a good thing for so many women but brings additional expenses, such \nas childcare and transportation and the increased marginal tax rate \npaid by the second worker in the family. That is why I am very proud to \nintroduce two middle-class tax cut bills today that will put money in \nthe pockets of working families and update our Tax Code for the 21st-\ncentury economy.\n  My 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act would create a new 10-percent \ncredit on up to $10,000 of the income of the second earner in a family. \nIn other words, qualifying working families can reduce their income \ntaxes by up to $1,000, which can go a long way toward offsetting some \nof the additional costs these families bear as they go back to work. \nThat tax cut rewards families for more work, and it would especially \nhelp women who want to rejoin the workforce today.\n  The second bill I am introducing today is the Helping Working \nFamilies\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\nAfford Child Care Act. This bill will update and reform the outdated \nchild independent tax credit to help more working families. It would \nincrease the tax credit to keep up with the rising costs of quality \nchildcare and would make sure that the credit actually keeps up with \nthe times by indexing it to inflation.\n  I am very proud to introduce these two bills today, but I am even \nmore proud that my bills are just two of the bills Democrats are \nintroducing today that will help working families by putting more money \nin their pockets and helping them access more opportunity. My \ncolleagues are going to be talking about the bills they wrote, but our \npackage of bills also includes, besides what I just talked about, an \nearned-income and childcare tax credit expansion and expansion of the \nAmerican opportunity tax credit to help middle-class families afford \nchildcare so they can get back on the job and help them pay for college \nso they can work hard and invest in themselves and their careers.\n  We know Republicans like to talk about cutting taxes. Well, with \nthese bills we are giving everyone a chance to do exactly that--and not \nwith more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations. Republicans have given that trickle-down theory a try, \nand it failed. Our approach is tax cuts for the middle class, for the \nworkers who need it the most, to help them afford the costs they are \nfaced with, such as childcare, putting food on the table, getting back \non the job, and to give them the opportunity to work hard and succeed.\n  We want to grow the economy from the middle out, not the top down, \nand we think these middle-class tax cut bills are a very strong step in \nthe right direction. We hope Republicans will join us to get these \ndone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Portman, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Coons, \n        Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Warner, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Tillis, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 665. A bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Blue Alert plans \nthroughout the United States in order to disseminate information when a \nlaw enforcement officer is seriously injured or killed in the line of \nduty, is missing in connection with the officer's official duties, or \nan imminent and credible threat that an individual intends to cause the \nserious injury or death of a law enforcement officer is received, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rafael Ramos \nand Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015.\n  Every day, more than 900,000 Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. \nUnfortunately these officers can become targets for criminals and those \nseeking to evade our justice system, and we must make sure our officers \nhave all the tools they need to protect themselves and each other.\n  Each year thousands of law enforcement officers are assaulted while \nperforming their duties and many suffer serious injuries or even lose \ntheir lives. In December 2014, New York City Police Department officers \nRafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were assassinated while sitting in their \nmarked police patrol car in Brooklyn. This legislation is named after \nthose officers in honor of the ultimate sacrifice that they made to \nserve and protect their fellow citizens.\n  According to preliminary data compiled by the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial Fund, law enforcement fatalities in the \nU.S. rose 24 percent in 2014, reversing what had been two years of \ndramatic declines in line of duty deaths. The report indicates that 126 \nfederal, state, local, tribal and territorial officers were killed in \nthe line of duty this year, compared to 102 in 2013. Ambush-style \nattacks such as those that took the lives of officers Ramos and Liu \nwere the number one cause of felonious officer deaths for the fifth \nyear in a row. Fifteen officers nationwide were killed in ambush \nassaults in 2014, matching 2012 for the highest total since 1995.\n  I thank my original cosponsors who have joined me in introducing this \nlegislation, including my lead co-sponsor Senator Graham.\n  The rapid dissemination of critical, time-sensitive information about \nsuspected criminals is essential to keeping our communities safe. This \nlegislation would encourage, enhance, and integrate Blue Alert programs \nthrough the United States. The Attorney General would establish a \nnational Blue Alert communications network within the Department of \nJustice. The Blue Alert system could be used when a law enforcement \nofficer is: seriously injured or killed in the line of duty; missing in \nconnection with the officer's official duties; or an imminent or \ncredible threat that an individual intends to cause the serious injury \nof death of a law enforcement officer is received.\n  The Blue Alert system could be used when the suspect has not been \napprehended, and where there is sufficient descriptive information of \nthe suspect and any vehicles involved, if applicable. This information \ncan be used by local law enforcement, the public and the media to help \nfacilitate capture of such offenders and ultimately reduce the risk \nthey pose to our communities and law enforcement officers.\n  Currently there is no national alert system that provides immediate \ninformation to other law enforcement agencies, the media or the public \nat large. Many states have created a state Blue Alert system in an \neffort to better inform their local communities. The State of Maryland, \nunder the leadership of former Governor Martin O'Malley, created their \nBlue Alert system in 2008 after the murder of Maryland State Trooper \nWesley Brown. Blue Alert programs have been created in 20 states to \ndate, with a growing number of states considering establishing Blue \nAlert programs.\n  The purpose of our National Blue Alert legislation is to keep our law \nenforcement officers and our communities safe. And based on the success \nof the AMBER Alert and the SILVER Alert, I believe this BLUE Alert will \nbe equally successful in helping to apprehend criminal suspects who \nhave seriously injured or killed our law enforcement officers.\n  I am also pleased to say this legislation has the endorsement of the \nFraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York \nCity Police Department, and many other law enforcement associations. \nPassing this legislation can help us live up to our commitment to help \nbetter protect those who serve us. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1307-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1307-S1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 96--CONDEMNING THE MURDER OF BORIS NEMTSOV, AND FOR \n                             OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Graham) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 96\n\n       Whereas, on February 27, 2015, Russian opposition leader \n     and former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov was brutally \n     murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin in Russia's capitol \n     city Moscow;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov was a man of conviction and principle \n     who dedicated his life to the fight against corruption in \n     Russia and sought to advance democracy, human rights, free \n     speech, free market reforms, and the rule of law throughout \n     his life;\n       Whereas, in December 2011, Mr. Nemtsov helped mobilize the \n     largest anti-Kremlin demonstrations since the early 1990's, \n     leading tens of thousands of Russians to march in protest of \n     widespread fraud and corruption in the parliamentary \n     elections;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation responded \n     by passing a series of harsh laws that vastly expanded the \n     definition of treason, increased government control over the \n     media, and limited the scope and activities of opposition \n     parties and civil society organizations;\n       Whereas Russian authorities exploit these laws for their \n     own political ends and use them to intimidate members of the \n     opposition, human rights activists, and others with whom they \n     disagree;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov strongly opposed these and other \n     repressive measures, and expressed concerns that President \n     Vladimir Putin's policies were threatening democracy and rule \n     of law in Russia;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov strongly criticized Russia's annexation \n     of Crimea and military\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\n     activities in eastern Ukraine, blaming President Putin for a \n     ``mad, aggressive and deadly policy of war against Ukraine'' \n     and lying to the Russian people about this policy;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov had been investigating Russia's role in \n     Ukraine and was preparing to release an investigative report \n     conclusively proving the participation of the Russian Armed \n     Forces in the invasion of Ukraine and revealing the extent to \n     which the Government of the Russian Federation was involved;\n       Whereas, prior to his death, Mr. Nemtsov planned to lead a \n     Spring March on March 1, 2015, to protest the Russian \n     military's presence in Ukraine;\n       Whereas, on February 28, 2015, Ukrainian President Petro \n     Poroshenko stated that he believed Mr. Nemtsov had been \n     murdered because he planned to disclose this evidence of \n     Russia's involvement in Ukraine;\n       Whereas President Putin called critics of his government \n     ``a fifth column'' and ``national traitors'', inviting \n     violent attacks upon them and sponsoring a campaign of \n     hatred, intimidation, and aggression;\n       Whereas, on February 20, 2015, a new movement called Anti-\n     Maidan marched freely through Moscow calling for violence \n     against this ``fifth column'', with signs naming Mr. Nemtsov \n     as an enemy of Russia;\n       Whereas Mr. Nemtsov's colleagues stated that he was under \n     state surveillance shortly before his murder and he was \n     murdered in one of the most heavily-secured areas of Moscow, \n     suggesting the Government of Russia's culpability;\n       Whereas other prominent figures in Russia who have \n     criticized President Putin and his government have also been \n     assassinated, including Vladimir Golovlyov, Yuri \n     Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko, \n     Magomed Yevloyev, Stanslav Markelov, and Natalia Estermirova;\n       Whereas none of the individuals responsible for these \n     assassinations have been brought to justice, raising serious \n     questions about the ability of Russian authorities to conduct \n     a credible investigation into Mr. Nemtsov's murder;\n       Whereas a culture of impunity and lack of accountability \n     prevail in Putin's Russia, with law enforcement, judicial, \n     and investigative bodies often used to target political \n     opponents and civil society, and thus lacking credibility to \n     conduct an investigation themselves;\n       Whereas the Russia Investigative Committee released a list \n     of motives for Mr. Nemtsov's murder which do not take into \n     account his role as a prominent government critic, \n     surveillance cameras were allegedly turned off for \n     maintenance during the time of his murder, and Kremlin-\n     sponsored channels are inciting fear and hatred by \n     propagating conspiracy theories that blame the United States \n     for his assassination;\n       Whereas these continuing assassinations are intended to \n     intimidate the people of Russia and undermine political and \n     social reform in the Russian Federation; and\n       Whereas support for rule of law and human rights in the \n     Russian Federation will help ensure its future as a free, \n     strong, and vibrant society and enduring stability in the \n     Russian Federation will come from an active civil society in \n     which democracy flourishes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the courageous work of Boris Nemtsov, a \n     tireless advocate for reform and human rights who sacrificed \n     his life in the fight for freedom and democracy in the \n     Russian Federation;\n       (2) expresses its deepest condolences to the family, \n     friends, and colleagues of Mr. Nemtsov, as well as to all the \n     people of Russia;\n       (3) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the murder \n     of Boris Nemtsov on February 27, 2015, as well as the \n     assassinations of numerous other human rights and democracy \n     activists in the Russian Federation since President Vladimir \n     Putin came to office;\n       (4) urges the President to seek a United Nations Security \n     Council resolution that establishes an independent \n     investigation into the assassination;\n       (5) calls upon the Government of Russia to support and \n     facilitate an independent inquiry into the murder of Mr. \n     Nemtsov;\n       (6) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     release all political prisoners and to end the ongoing \n     harassment of political opponents, human rights activists, \n     and journalists;\n       (7) calls for the restoration of an independent judiciary \n     and the rule of law in the Russian Federation, and an end to \n     all restrictions on the media and freedom of speech;\n       (8) urges the President to add the names of persons that \n     Mr. Nemtsov requested be added to the visa ban list as \n     provided for under the Sergei Manitsky Rule of Law \n     Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of Public Law 112-208) \n     and continue to sanction human rights violators in the \n     Russian Federation;\n       (9) urges the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) to obtain, examine, and publish the \n     investigative report Mr. Nemtsov planned to release as part \n     of the OSCE observer role in eastern Ukraine to demonstrate \n     the inability of the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     suppress the truth Mr. Nemtsov represented; and\n       (10) urges the President to significantly increase United \n     States Government support to like-minded partners and human \n     rights activists in the Russian Federation to create a more \n     vibrant civil society and open media environment in which \n     democracy can flourish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1308-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1308-S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 97--SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \nWhitehouse) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas there are more than 3,500,000,000 women in the \n     world today;\n       Whereas women around the world have fundamental human \n     rights, participate in the political, social, and economic \n     life of their communities, play a critical role in providing \n     and caring for their families, contribute substantially to \n     the growth of economies and the prevention of conflict, and, \n     as farmers and caregivers, play an important role in \n     advancing food security for their communities;\n       Whereas the advancement of women around the world is a \n     foreign policy priority for the United States;\n       Whereas on September 24, 2014, President Barack Obama \n     highlighted the United States support for the advancement of \n     women, noting: ``Where women are full participants in a \n     country's politics or economy, societies are more likely to \n     succeed. And that's why we support the participation of women \n     in parliaments and peace processes, schools, and the \n     economy.'';\n       Whereas women remain underrepresented in conflict \n     prevention and conflict resolution efforts, despite proven \n     success by women in conflict-affected regions in moderating \n     violent extremism, countering terrorism, resolving disputes \n     through nonviolent mediation and negotiation, and stabilizing \n     societies by improving access to peace and security services, \n     institutions, and decisionmaking venues;\n       Whereas on December 19, 2011, the Obama Administration \n     launched the first United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security (referred to in this preamble as \n     the ``National Action Plan'') that includes a comprehensive \n     set of national commitments to advance the active \n     participation of women in decisionmaking relating to matters \n     of war and peace;\n       Whereas the National Action Plan states the following: \n     ``Deadly conflicts can be more effectively avoided, and peace \n     can be best forged and sustained, when women become equal \n     partners in all aspects of peace-building and conflict \n     prevention, when their lives are protected, their experiences \n     considered, and their voices heard.'';\n       Whereas the National Action Plan requires the National \n     Security Council staff to coordinate a comprehensive review \n     of, and update to, the National Action Plan in 2015 with \n     consultation from international partners and civil society \n     organizations;\n       Whereas according to the Bureau of International Narcotics \n     and Law Enforcement Affairs of the Department of State, \n     women's full and meaningful participation in security forces \n     vastly enhances their effectiveness;\n       Whereas the ability of women and girls to realize their \n     full potential is critical to the ability of a country to \n     achieve strong and lasting economic growth and political and \n     social stability;\n       Whereas according to the International Monetary Fund, \n     ``focusing on the needs and empowerment of women is one of \n     the keys to human development'';\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific and Cultural Organization, two-thirds of the \n     781,000,000 illiterate people in the world are female;\n       Whereas according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, compared to uneducated women, \n     ``educated women are less likely to marry early and more \n     likely to have smaller and healthier families. They are also \n     more likely to get a job and earn a higher wage.'';\n       Whereas according to the Food and Agriculture Organization \n     of the United Nations, the majority of women living in rural \n     areas of the developing world are heavily engaged in \n     agricultural labor, yet they receive less credit, land, \n     agricultural inputs, and training than their male \n     counterparts;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Population Fund, \n     women have access to fewer income-earning opportunities and \n     are more likely to manage the household and engage in \n     agricultural work, making women more vulnerable to economic \n     insecurity caused by natural disasters and long-term changes \n     in weather patterns;\n       Whereas according to the World Bank, women own or partly \n     own more than one-third of small and medium-sized enterprises \n     in developing countries, and 40 percent of the global \n     workforce is female, yet, women entrepreneurs and employers \n     have disproportionately less access to capital and other \n     financial services compared to men;\n       Whereas despite strides in recent decades, women around the \n     world continue to face significant obstacles in all aspects \n     of their lives, including underrepresentation in all aspects \n     of public life, denial of basic human rights, and \n     discrimination;\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\n       Whereas despite achievements by individual female leaders, \n     women around the world are still vastly underrepresented in \n     high-level positions and in national and local legislatures \n     and governments and, according to the Inter-Parliamentary \n     Union, women account for only 21.9 percent of national \n     parliamentarians;\n       Whereas 1 in 3 women around the world has experienced some \n     form of gender-based violence, and 1 in 4 women has suffered \n     abuse during pregnancy;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization, \n     approximately 800 women die from preventable causes related \n     to pregnancy and childbirth every day, with 99 percent of all \n     maternal deaths occurring in developing countries;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Population Fund, \n     more than 200,000,000 women and girls around the world would \n     like to access family planning services but are unable to do \n     so;\n       Whereas according to data from the World Bank, women \n     between the ages of 15 and 44 are at a greater risk of rape \n     and domestic violence than cancer, war, traffic accidents, \n     and malaria combined;\n       Whereas on August 10, 2012, President Barack Obama \n     announced the United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond \n     to Gender-Based Violence Globally, the first interagency \n     strategy to address gender-based violence around the world;\n       Whereas violence against women and girls impedes progress \n     in meeting many international global development goals, \n     including efforts to stem maternal mortality and the spread \n     of HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas on October 11, 2013, President Barack Obama stated \n     that the practice of child marriage was a ``threat to \n     fundamental human rights'';\n       Whereas according to the International Center for Research \n     on Women, one-third of girls worldwide are married before the \n     age of 18 and 1 in 9 girls are married before the age of 15;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization, suicide \n     is the leading cause of death for girls ages 15 to 19, \n     followed by complications from pregnancy and childbirth;\n       Whereas it is imperative to alleviate violence and \n     discrimination against women and afford women every \n     opportunity to be full and productive members of their \n     communities;\n       Whereas 2015 marks the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World \n     Conference on Women, where 189 countries committed to the \n     Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action to integrate \n     gender equality into all dimensions of society;\n       Whereas 2015 marks the deadline for meeting the United \n     Nations Millennium Development Goals, and progress towards \n     meeting the targets for gender equality and women's \n     empowerment remains uneven; and\n       Whereas March 8 is recognized each year as International \n     Women's Day, a global day to celebrate the economic, \n     political, and social achievements of women past, present, \n     and future, and to recognize the obstacles that women still \n     face in the struggle for equal rights and opportunities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals of International Women's Day;\n       (2) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of countries to generate \n     economic growth, sustainable democracy, and inclusive \n     security;\n       (3) recognizes and honors individuals in the United States \n     and around the world, including women who are human rights \n     defenders, who have worked throughout history to ensure that \n     women are guaranteed equality and basic human rights;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment to ending discrimination and \n     violence against women and girls, to ensuring the safety and \n     welfare of women and girls, to pursuing policies that \n     guarantee the basic human rights of women and girls \n     worldwide, and to promoting meaningful and significant \n     participation of women in all aspects of their societies and \n     communities;\n       (5) supports international calls for a ``Post-2015 \n     Development Agenda'' to include a stand-alone goal to achieve \n     gender equality and women's empowerment;

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 98\n\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``MS'') can impact people of all ages, races, and \n     ethnicities, but is at least 2 to 3 times more common in \n     women than in men;\n       Whereas there are approximately 2,300,000 people worldwide \n     who have been diagnosed with MS;\n       Whereas MS is typically diagnosed in individuals between \n     the ages of 20 and 50, however it is estimated that between \n     8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents are living with MS \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas MS is an unpredictable neurological disease that \n     interrupts the flow of information both within the brain and \n     between the brain and the rest of the body;\n       Whereas symptoms of MS range from numbness and tingling in \n     the extremities to blindness and paralysis, and the progress, \n     severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person \n     cannot yet be predicted;\n       Whereas there is no laboratory test available that can \n     definitively diagnose MS;\n       Whereas while MS is not directly inherited, studies show \n     that there are genetic and, probably, environmental factors \n     that make certain individuals, such as Caucasians of Northern \n     European ancestry, more susceptible to the disease than \n     others;\n       Whereas the exact cause of MS is still unknown and there is \n     no cure;\n       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national \n     network of independent MS organizations dedicated to the \n     enhancement of the quality of life for all those affected by \n     MS, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness \n     Week;\n       Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is \n     to increase opportunities for cooperation among MS \n     organizations and provide greater opportunity for the \n     effective use and development of resources for the benefit of \n     individuals and families affected by MS;\n       Whereas the United States plays a critical role in \n     coordinating MS research globally and amplifies the impact of \n     research in the United States through which results are \n     delivered to MS patients;\n       Whereas in 2012, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society of \n     the United States was a founding member of the Progressive MS \n     Alliance, which coordinates research to accelerate the \n     development of treatments for progressive MS by removing \n     international scientific and technological barriers, and \n     which now includes MS societies from 11 countries;\n       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition recognizes and \n     supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of \n     every calendar year;\n       Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are \n     to invite people to join the movement to end MS, encourage \n     everyone to do something to demonstrate their commitment to \n     moving toward a world free of MS, and to acknowledge those \n     who have dedicated their time and talent to help promote MS \n     research and programs;

Res. 8\n\n       Whereas on March 7, 1965 ``Bloody Sunday'', approximately \n     600 civil rights marchers, led by now-Representative John \n     Lewis of\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\n     the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Reverend \n     Hosea Williams of the Southern Christian Leadership \n     Conference, headed east out of Selma, Alabama to the State \n     Capitol in Montgomery, Alabama;\n       Whereas the civil rights activists sought to protest \n     discriminatory voter registration practices, and the shooting \n     of Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was shot after protecting his \n     mother and grandfather in a civil rights demonstration on \n     February 18, 1965, in a restaurant in Marion, Alabama, and \n     died eight days later on February 26, 1965;\n       Whereas the nonviolent marchers were met and attacked with \n     clubs, whips, police dogs, and tear gas carried by State \n     troopers, local lawmen, and townspeople at the Edmund Pettus \n     Bridge as they were leaving Selma;\n       Whereas dozens of peaceful marchers were injured in the \n     forced retreat by State troopers, local lawmen, and \n     townspeople;\n       Whereas images of innocent protestors brutally beaten and \n     severely injured on March 7, 1965, remembered as ``Bloody \n     Sunday'', were depicted in television screens and in \n     newspaper articles across the country;\n       Whereas Bloody Sunday galvanized a generation of civil \n     rights activists, and heightened support and awareness for \n     the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas on March 9, 1965, two days later, Reverend Martin \n     Luther King, Jr. led a nonviolent protest reportedly as many \n     as 2,500 people before turning around after crossing the \n     Edmund Pettus Bridge due to a barricade of State troopers;\n       Whereas on March 15, 1965, despite pressure from political \n     figures, U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., issued an \n     injunction allowing the voting rights march from Selma to \n     Montgomery to proceed, overturning then-Alabama Governor \n     George Wallace's prohibition of the protest;\n       Whereas on March 21, 1965, with the protection of U.S. Army \n     troops and the Alabama National Guard, more than 3,000 \n     people, led by Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., set out from \n     Selma to Montgomery, a 54-mile journey, marching an average \n     of twelve miles a day along Route 80 and sleeping in fields;\n       Whereas the nonviolent protestors safely reached the steps \n     of the Alabama State Capitol on March 25, 1965, by which \n     point their numbers had grown to 25,000, including many \n     religious and community leaders of all denominations, races, \n     and backgrounds;\n       Whereas during these pivotal weeks, on March 17, 1965, and \n     with the Selma protestors at the forefront, President Lyndon \n     Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress, calling for \n     Federal voting rights legislation to protect African \n     Americans from barriers that prevented them from voting;\n       Whereas with the Nation captivated by the courage and \n     conviction displayed by the civil rights activists, the \n     United States Congress passed and President Lyndon B. Johnson \n     enacted into law the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 on \n     August 6, 1965; and\n       Whereas issuing a postage stamp honoring the fiftieth \n     anniversary of the civil rights marches is fitting and proper \n     because the marches united our country and helped affirm the \n     principle that all Americans shall be treated equally at the \n     voting booths as guaranteed under the United States \n     Constitution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Postmaster General should issue a commemorative \n     postage stamp honoring the 50th anniversary of the three \n     civil rights marches from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, \n     Alabama; and\n       (2) such stamp should--\n       (A) be issued in the denomination used for first-class mail \n     up to 1 ounce in weight;\n       (B) bear such illustration or picture as the Postmaster \n     General determines; and\n       (C) be placed in sale at such time and for such period as \n     the Postmaster General determines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/04/senate-section/article/S1310-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 9--HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF \n   REVEREND THEODORE M.
