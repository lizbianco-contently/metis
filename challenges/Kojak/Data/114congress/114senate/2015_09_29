Mr. President, last night, 77 Senators voted to \nadvance legislation that would keep the government funded through the \nfall at the bipartisan level agreed to by both parties. The bill hardly \nrepresents my preferred method for funding the government, but it is \nnow the most viable way forward after Democrats' extreme action forced \nour country into this situation.\n  Let's remember how we got here. Democrats knew the American people \nwere unlikely to buy their desire for more bureaucracy and more debt, \nbut they figured they might in a crisis. So Democrats pursued a \ndeliberate strategy of blocking government funding all year in order to \nforce our Nation to the brink. Democrats said they would block \ngovernment funding legislation they had even voted for in committee. \nSome of these bills came out of committee overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis. Democrats said they would block government funding of \nlegislation they had actually praised in their press releases when \nthese bills emerged from the Appropriations Committee with large \nmajorities. Democrats even voted repeatedly to block the bill that \nfunds our military, to repeatedly block the bill that funds medical \ncare and pay raises for our troops. That is how far Democrats are \nwilling to go--at a time of daunting international threats--in order to \ntear down the normal government funding process and force our country \ninto this situation that we now face.\n  Well, I am not prepared to let the Democrats lead us over the cliff. \nThe bill before us would keep the government open; it would allow time \nfor cooler heads to prevail. That is why I joined 76 other Senators and \nvoted to advance it yesterday.\n  But, look, obviously the best way to fund the government is by first \npassing a budget and then passing appropriations bills. The Senate also \npassed a budget. The Senate is prepared to pass appropriations \nlegislation too. All that is needed is for Democrats to drop these \nendless filibusters.\n  We know that nearly all these funding bills are bipartisan. We know \nthat Democrats and have supported and praised them. And with the CR \nbehind us, we can turn back to the work of trying to pass these \nappropriations bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S6983-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2089\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I am reminded of that famous line from \n``Cool Hand Luke'': ``What we have here is a failure to communicate.''\n  What we have here in Congress is a failure to legislate, a failure to \nexert congressional authority. What we have here is a failure to use \nour leverage. What we have here is a failure to use the power of the \npurse.\n  Conservatives across America are unhappy, and rightly so. We were \ntold that when we took over Congress, when Republicans were elected to \nCongress, that things would be different: that if voters put us in \ncharge, we would right the ship, we would stop the deficits. And here \nwe are with another continuing resolution.\n  What is a continuing resolution? It is a continuation of the deficit \nspending of the past. It is a continuation of the waste. It is a \ncontinuation of the duplication. What is a continuing resolution? It is \na steaming pile of the same old, same old.\n  Let me be clear: A continuing resolution is not a good thing. It is \nmore of the status quo. It is a warmed-over version of yesterday's \nfailures. It is an abdication of congressional authority. It is an \nabdication of congressional power.\n  Let's at least be honest. With a continuing resolution, no waste will \nbe cut, no spending will be cut, no regulations will be stopped, and \nthe debt will continue to mount.\n  We are told that we cannot win, that we need 60 votes to defund \nanything, but perhaps there is an alternate future where courage steps \nup and saves the day.\n  All spending is set to expire automatically. This is the perfect time \nto turn the tables, to tell the other side that they will need 60 votes \nto affirmatively spend any money. See, it doesn't have to be 60 votes \nto stop things. All spending will expire, and only those programs for \nwhich we can get 60 votes should go forward.\n  What would that mean? That would mean an elimination of waste, an \nelimination of duplication, an elimination of bad things that we spend \nmoney on.\n  If we had the courage, we could use the Senate's supermajority rules \nto stop wasteful spending. If we had the courage, we could force the \nother side to come up with 60 votes to fund things like Planned \nParenthood. The budget is loaded with nonsense and waste.\n  Some will say our job is to govern, to preside. But to preside over \nwhat? To preside over a mountain of new debt? To be the same as the \nother side--to continue to add debt after debt? Our debt will consume \nus if we continue to preside over the status quo. It is as if we are on \nthe Titanic and just simply reshuffling the chairs. A continuing \nresolution continues the wasteful spending of money.\n  I can go on and on about what we are wasting money on. I will tell of \na few.\n  We spent $300,000 last year studying whether Japanese quail are more \nsexually promiscuous on cocaine. I think we could poll the audience and \nsave money. These things should never have had money spent on them, but \nif we do a continuing resolution, it will continue.\n  We spent several hundred thousand dollars studying whether we can \nrelieve stress in Vietnamese villagers by having them watch American \ntelevision reruns. I don't know about you, but I don't want one penny \nof taxpayer dollars going to this ridiculous stuff. If we continue, if \nwe pass a continuing resolution, no reform will occur.\n  We spent $800,000 in the last couple of years developing a televised \ncricket league for Afghanistan--$800,000. Do you know how many people \nhave a television in Afghanistan? One in 10,000 people. And I don't \ncare if they all have TVs, it is ridiculous that our money, which we \ndon't even have--we have to borrow it from China to send it to \nAfghanistan. If we pass a continuing resolution, we are agreeing to \ncontinue this nonsense.\n  We spent $150,000 last year on yoga classes for Federal employees. So \nnot only do we pay them nearly 1.5 times as much as private-sector \nemployees, we give them yoga classes. If we pass a continuing \nresolution, this goes on and on. Nothing will change. The status quo \nwill continue, and we will continue to spend ourselves into oblivion.\n  We spent $250,000 last year inviting 24 kids from Pakistan to go to \nspace camp in Alabama. We borrow money from China to send it to \nPakistan.\n  It is crazy, it is ridiculous, and it should stop. We have the power \nto stop it. Congress has the power to spend money or not spend money, \nand yet we roll over and we say: It must continue; we don't have the \nvotes to stop it. Nonsense. The other side doesn't have the votes to \ncontinue the spending if we would stand up and challenge them.\n  We spent $500,000 last year or the year before developing a menu for \nwhen we colonize Mars. We sent a bunch of college students to Hawaii to \nstudy this. We paid $5,000 apiece. They got 2 weeks all expenses paid \nin Hawaii. And do you know what a bunch of college kids came up with? \nPizza. This is where your money is going.\n  I could go on, hundreds and hundreds of programs. If we do not exert \nthe power of the purse, this continues.\n  We should attach to all 12 individual spending bills--not glommed \ntogether--we should attach hundreds of instructions, thousands of \ninstructions. Now, some of the media have said: Well, those would be \nriders on appropriations bills. Exactly. That is the power of the \npurse. If you object to the President writing regulations without our \nauthority, Congress should defund the regulations. Congress should \ninstruct him on ObamaCare, on what we object to. Congress should \ninstruct him that we don't want money spent on Planned Parenthood. \nHundreds and hundreds of instructions should be written into every bill \nand passed and sent to him.\n  Would we win all of these battles? Do we have the power to win every \nbattle and defund everything we want? No. But do you know what we start \nout with? Our negotiating position right now is, we start out with \ndefunding nothing. Why don't we start out with a negotiating position \nthat we defund everything that is objectionable? All the wasteful \nspending, all the duplicative spending, let's defund it all. If there \nhas to be a negotiation, let's start from defunding it all and see \nwhere we get, but it would take courage because we would have to let \nspending expire. If we are not willing to let the spending expire and \nstart anew, we have no leverage. The power of the purse is there only \nif you have courage. We must have the courage of convictions to say \nenough is enough, that the debt is a greater threat to us than letting \nspending expire.\n  Now, several will report on this speech and say: Oh, he wants to shut \ndown government. No, I don't. I just want to exert the power of the \npurse, and that means spending must expire. I am all for renewing the \nspending, but let's renew only the spending that makes sense. We have \nthe power of the purse if we choose to exert it. Look at the mountain \nof debt. Look at the debt that continues to be added up. We have not \nbeen doing our job.\n  The way we are supposed to spend money in Congress is 12 individual \nappropriations bills. They have passed out of committee. Why aren't \nthey presented on the floor? The Democrats have filibustered the only \none presented. Let's present every one of\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nthem, and let the public know--let everyone in America know--that it is \nDemocrats filibustering the spending bills. It is Democrats who desire \nto shut down government. It is Democrats who desire not to have any \nrestrictions on where the money is spent. It is Democrats who are \nsaying: We don't want to end wasteful spending. We don't want to end \nany spending. We don't want any controls over spending. We want to \ncontinue the status quo. But we should not be complicit with them.\n  We have allowed this to go on for too long. It threatens the very \nheart of the Republic. It threatens our very foundation to continue to \nborrow $1 million a minute. It is time that we stood up. It is time \nthat we took a stand and said enough is enough.\n  When is the last time we did it in the appropriate fashion? When is \nthe last time Congress passed each of the individual appropriations \nbills with instructions on how to spend the money? It was 2005, a \ndecade ago. It has been a decade. In the last decade we have added \nnearly $10 trillion in new debt. It is time to take a stand.\n  I, for one, have had enough. I have had enough. I am not going to \nvote for a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution is simply a \ncontinuation of the mounting debt. I, for one, will not do it. A \ncontinuing resolution is retreat. It is announcing your defeat in \nadvance.\n  What we should do is take a stand. We should say to the other side: \nIn the Senate, it requires a supermajority. What does that mean? It \nmeans 60 votes to pass spending. What would happen? Spending that is \ncontroversial, like Planned Parenthood, would fall away. They can ask \nfor private donations. Good luck on that. You wouldn't find things \nbeing funded that are controversial. What would happen is there would \nno longer be funding for wasteful and duplicative projects.\n  We listed these a couple years ago. I think we had $7 billion worth \nof just duplication. Did we fix it? No. Every year the President--even \nthis President--puts forward $10, $15, $20 billion worth of programs \nthat could be eliminated. Do they ever get eliminated? No, because \nCongress is dysfunctional and we continue to pass a continuing \nresolution, which means we do nothing to exert the power of the purse.\n  Congress is a shadow of what it once was. Madison said that we would \nhave coequal branches and we would pit ambition against ambition. We no \nlonger do that. Congress is a withering shadow. It is a shadow of what \nit once was. Congress has no power, exerts no power, and we walk and we \nlive in the shadow of a Presidency that is growing larger and larger \nand larger.\n  The President is not afraid. He says he has his pen and his phone. So \nhe is writing and creating law. One of our philosophers we look to is \nMontesquieu, and Montesquieu said when the Executive begins to \nlegislate, a form of tyranny will ensue. That is what we have now; we \nhave Executive tyranny. It is not just this President, though. It has \nbeen going on for a while, probably for 100 years. We have been \nallowing more and more power to accumulate in the hands of the \nPresidency.\n  What we need is a bipartisan taking back of that power. We need \nCongress to stand up on its own two feet and say: Enough is enough. We \nare reclaiming the power of the purse, and we are going to do whatever \nis necessary to get rid of the wasteful spending, the duplicative \nspending, the offensive spending, and we are going to do what the \nAmerican people want and that is to spend only what comes in.\n  But I will tell you, I, for one, will oppose this continuing \nresolution. I recommend that everybody in America call their \nCongressmen and say: We are tired of the mounting debt. We want you to \nstand up. We want you to stand up and say enough is enough. Let the \nfunding expire, and make the other side come up with 60 votes to spend \nthe money.\n  It is time we took a stand. I hope we will.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Remembering Frances Oldham Kelsey\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in August this country lost a hero, a woman \nmost have not heard of, but her story is legendary. Frances Oldham \nKelsey passed away in August at the age of 101. She was a woman of \ntremendous courage and conviction. She was a trailblazing scientist. \nShe earned her Ph.D. and then her medical degree from the University of \nChicago while raising daughters. She did things that women of her \ngeneration were usually not allowed to do or certainly rarely \nencouraged to do.\n  As she began her professional life, it was the early 1960s and a \nhorrific scourge was afflicting Europe and other countries around the \nworld. Thousands of babies were dying in the womb, thousands more were \nborn with severe birth defects--including deformed arms and legs that, \nas history will tell us, resembled flippers--missing organs, missing \nlimbs.\n  The United States was largely spared from these terrible effects \nbecause of Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey. As a medical officer at the FDA, \nDr. Kelsey was charged with investigating and approving the drug called \nKevadon, better known in history by its generic name, thalidomide. The \npharmaceutical company Merrell was expecting a speedy approval. After \nall, the drug was used around the world as a sedative and as a \ntreatment for morning sickness. The drug had made a windfall for its \nGerman manufacturer, and Merrell was hoping for the same in our \ncountry. But Dr. Kelsey, who at that time was a woman in very much a \nman's world at the FDA, a woman who was not all that experienced, was \nwilling to show her courage and demand further investigation before she \nwould approve this drug.\n  With few studies providing the safety of Kevadon--thalidomide--she \nrejected the application. Merrell protested, drug companies were \noutraged, and a number of other employees at the FDA disagreed. She \nasked for, though, and reviewed more data, and again she rejected the \napplication. Again, Merrell protested. Again, other people were \noutraged by this woman's decision. Merrell's executives called her a \npetty and nitpicking bureaucrat.\n  It is always easy to pick on a bureaucrat--a nameless, faceless \nbureaucrat, or a named bureaucrat with a face. It is easy to pick on \nbureaucrats. People here do it all the time.\n  They called her office, and they peppered her with letters. They went \nover her head to her FDA bosses. Dr. Kelsey again--imagine a young \nwoman without sort of the support that a more experienced, older, and, \nparticularly in those days, male researcher might have had. She held \nher ground. She continued to reject the application. Meanwhile, the \nhorrible toll was mounting in places around the world where thalidomide \nwas sold.\n  In late 1961, the German manufacturer pulled the drug, and health \ndepartments around the world began to issue warnings. In March 1962, \nMerrell, the drug company, seeing the handwriting on the wall, finally \nwithdrew its thalidomide application.\n  That might have been the end of the story, but staffers for Senator \nEstes Kefauver, a Democrat from Tennessee who had long been battling \npharmaceutical companies to strengthen our country's drug oversight, \ngave the Washington Post a tip. The Senator's staff wanted the country \nto know about this woman, Dr. Kelsey, wanted people to know about the \nheroine who had spared our children from the terrible consequences of \nthis drug. They wanted them to know that Big Pharma--Senator Kefauver \nwanted them to know that Big Pharma, the big drug companies, had fought \nher every step of the way, putting pressure on the FDA, going over her \nhead, sending her letters, perhaps indirectly threatening her. \nFortunately, she stood her ground against a very powerful combatant, \nfor want of a better term.\n  In no small part because of Dr. Kelsey and her persistence, we have \nthe Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962, which strengthened drug approval\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nstandards. We have a branch of the FDA dedicated to testing and \ninvestigating new drugs. Who became the head of it? Dr. Kelsey. Over a \n45-year career, she helped to rewrite our drug and medical testing \nregulations, she strengthened patient protections, and she cracked down \non medical conflicts of interest. Her rigorous standards were not only \ninstrumental in improving drug safety in the United States, they also \nset the world standard for drug safety. The United States is known all \nover the world as having the gold standard to protect the public by \nrigorous testing and rigorous examination to protect the public against \ndrugs that can do damage.\n  Everybody thought thalidomide was harmless except Dr. Kelsey. Because \nshe had the authority at the FDA to do it right and then was able to \nexpand that authority working with Congress, uncounted lives, \ninnumerable lives--we don't know how many lives were saved and how many \npeople have been protected against harmful drugs. She had a 45-year \ncareer. She made a huge difference. Her accomplishments are heroic. She \nhas received many honors.\n  But we should remember that for all of Dr. Kelsey's recognition, \nthere are thousands more Federal employees working with little \nappreciation and sometimes not very high pay. I am sure Dr. Kelsey \ncould have been making more money practicing medicine, but look at the \nlives she saved and look at the difference she made. Expand that to so \nmany government workers, so many people who do their jobs.\n  Members of Congress--well-paid, well-dressed, getting good taxpayer \nbenefits--love to attack the bureaucracy, love to call bureaucrats \nnames, love to nitpick agencies, when, in fact, so many of them are \nmaking a huge difference in keeping the air we breathe, the water we \ndrink, the drugs we take, the consumer products we use--keeping them \nsafe. That is something those Federal employees should be proud of. \nThey protect Americans from pollution and predatory lenders and faulty \nproducts and infectious diseases and dangerous drugs.\n  We have made so much progress over the past century because of \nAmericans like Frances Kelsey, but unfortunately too many people in \nthis town seem to have amnesia and are trying to turn back the clock.\n  I sit on the banking committee. We had a hearing today. I sit in the \nbanking committee at least once a week for a couple of hours. I listen \nto my Republican colleagues who seem to have forgotten that the economy \nsort of imploded--almost imploded in 2008 and 2009. They seem to want \nto go back to those days of deregulation, not holding Wall Street \naccountable--the same kinds of things--the deregulation, the weakening \nof the FDA, the weakening of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nthe weakening of the Department of Agriculture standards, and all of \nthe things that we do, where this country works better because we have \ngovernment--call them bureaucrats--we have government bureaucrats who \nare working to protect the public interest.\n  So we should honor Dr. Kelsey not with awards but with action to \nprotect her legacy. Yet people right now in this Congress--I heard a \nlong speech last night from the junior Senator from Texas, not ever to \nbe confused with the senior Senator from Texas--I heard him again \nthreaten government shutdowns. When government shuts down, food is less \nprotected and water is likely going to be less clean, and all of the \nthings that happen when government is not doing its job.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in honoring Dr. Kelsey's legacy and \nremembering the work that heroic public servants in our Federal \nworkforce do for this country.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. President, I want to read a brief letter. I was at my 45th high \nschool class reunion. Some of us in this body might have reached an age \nclose to that; most of you have not. At my 45th reunion, I met a woman \nwho was there visiting someone else. She was much younger. She handed \nme this letter.\n  She said: Senator Brown, I want to thank you for a couple of things. \nThanks for the Affordable Care Act.\n  She has a photography business.\n  She said: Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I was able to pursue my \ndream and open my business. I am diabetic. I was unable to self-insure \ndue to my preexisting condition. I was forced to work low-wage jobs \njust so I could get insurance. Now, because of the Affordable Care \nAct--ObamaCare--I can thrive as an entrepreneur. Thank you.\n  I hear those stories. I meet people. Now 600,000 Ohioans have health \ninsurance who did not have it prior to the Affordable Care Act, and \n100,000 additional Ohioans who are not much older than these pages \nsitting here, who are 19, 20, maybe 25, have insurance on their \nparents' health plan. One million--that is in Ohio alone--1 million \nseniors in Ohio have no copay, no deductible, and get free preventive \ncare tests for osteoporosis, tests for diabetes, and physical exams.\n  More than 100,000 seniors have saved an average of $700 on their \nprescription drugs because of the Affordable Care Act. A family like \nthis--the parents of a child who has juvenile arthritis or diabetes or \nwhatever a child might be afflicted with can get insurance in spite of \nthe child's preexisting condition.\n  When I hear in the Republican debates they all saying ``Repeal \nObamaCare,'' it would be nice if one sort of gutsy reporter would say, \n``Well, what about all those millions of seniors who now get free \npreventive care? What about those millions of people who have consumer \nprotections so they cannot be denied coverage because they have a sick \nchild? What about those people who got so sick that their medical care \nwas very expensive and the insurance company cancelled their care? They \ncannot do that anymore. What about those people?'' I just wish we would \nhear that question one time.\n  We honor Dr. Kelsey today, and we think about when government does \nthings right in partnership with the private sector to make this \ncountry a better place to live.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     World Trade Center Health Program and Victim Compensation Fund\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, we just passed the 14th anniversary \nof the September 11 attacks. Americans all across the country honored \nthe memory of 2,977 lives lost. There were moments of silence. There \nwere testimonials from friends and family of the victims. There were \nstatements, speeches, and posts online by my colleagues in Congress \nvowing to ``never forget.'' But the victims of September 11 are not \njust the men and women who were killed on that horrible day; the terror \nattacks on that day in 2001 are still claiming American lives. This \nincludes the heroes who ran into the towers to save whom they could, \nwho worked on the piles so that Americans might rebuild, and who would \nnot abandon their community in a time of terrifying confusion and \nintense grief. Many of them are now sick because of their work at \nGround Zero, and many are dying.\n  In 2010, after years of delay, we finally established the James \nZadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation programs to provide our first \nresponders, the survivors, and their families with the health care and \nbenefits they very desperately needed. Tomorrow, at midnight, the bill \nauthorizing this funding will expire.\n  More than 33,000 first responders and survivors have an illness or \ninjury caused by the attacks or their aftermath. More than 1,700 have \npassed away from 9/11-related illnesses. More police officers have died \nsince 9/11 from 9/11-related diseases than died on 9/11 itself. Since \nthe 14th anniversary of the attacks earlier this month, another six 9/\n11 first responders have died. Think about that. In just a few short \nweeks, 6 more of our 9/11 heroes have died: John P. McKee, Roy \nMcLaughlin, Reginald Umpthery, Kevin Kelly, Thomas Zayas, and Paul \nMcCabe. They were married, and they had kids. Their average age was \njust a few years older than mine--53. They will all miss birthday \nparties\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\nand graduations. They will miss evening dinners and holidays. They \nleave behind mortgages, car payments, and college-tuition payments. \nThese 9/11 illnesses not only rob families of their loved ones, but \nthey leave them to face expenses without, in many cases, the family's \nprimary breadwinner.\n  Two weeks ago, hundreds of first responders from all over the country \ntraveled to Washington to lobby Congress not to let their health care \nprogram expire. If Congress doesn't act now, how many more first \nresponders and their families are going to suffer medically and \nfinancially because we didn't do our job and reauthorize this program?\n  Let me tell you about just one responder, Ken George from Long \nIsland. Ken was 37 on September 11, 2001. He was working for the New \nYork City Highway Department, and after the attacks he went to do \nsearch and rescue work. He was there for a couple of weeks. Almost \nright away, Ken developed a cough, then asthma, and then the asthma led \nto restricted airway disease. Doctors found crushed glass from Ground \nZero in his lungs. He was forced to retire in 2006 because his medical \nailments became too burdensome, and now, as he put it, he is \n``financially hurting like you wouldn't believe.''\n  We are not talking about statistics. We are not talking about data \npoints on a chart. We are talking about a 51-year-old man with a wife \nand three kids, with crushed glass in his lungs because he chose to do \nthe right thing. He chose to answer the call of duty, and he chose to \nsearch for survivors after 9/11. On top of everything else he is \ndealing with, Ken now has to worry if he will get the health treatments \nhe needs and if his family will have the basic financial support they \nneed.\n  The health program officially expires tomorrow at midnight, but these \nillnesses--Ken's and thousands of others'--never expire, and neither \nshould their health care.\n  We must reauthorize and make permanent the World Trade Center Health \nProgram and Victim Compensation Fund. The participants in the health \nprogram live in every single State. They live in 429 of the 435 \ncongressional districts. Every Senator in this Chamber has constituents \nwho are sick and dying and are in this program.\n  A majority of this body has already signed on as cosponsors of this \nlegislation, including many after our day of action a couple weeks ago. \nSo let's finish this job. Let's give our 9/11 heroes the care and \ncompensation they deserve and so desperately need. Let's truly never \nforget. The clock is ticking. Let's do our job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                  Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the \nlatest developments in international trade.\n  As most of my colleagues know, this week officials from the Obama \nadministration are meeting in Atlanta with representatives from our \nnegotiating partners in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. \nMany reports indicate that our trade negotiators are hoping to conclude \ntalks and finalize a deal over the next few days.\n  Now, as the Presiding Officer is aware, I was an original author of \nthe legislation that renewed trade promotion authority, or TPA, earlier \nthis year. I fought extremely hard to renew TPA because I believe it is \nan absolutely essential tool to ensure we get the very best trade \nagreements possible. For years I have been one of the most outspoken \nproponents in Congress for full engagement in the various trade \nagreements that have been under negotiation, including the TPP.\n  A strong Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement could greatly enhance \nour Nation's ability to compete in an increasingly global marketplace \nand result in a healthier economy and more high-paying jobs that come \nwith increased U.S. trade. After all, when we are talking about the 12 \ncountries currently taking part in these negotiations, we are talking \nabout 40 percent of the global economy. As a group, TPP countries \nrepresent the largest market for our goods and services exports. Trade \nwith these countries already supports an estimated 4 million U.S. jobs, \nand, with a good trade agreement in place, I believe it can do even \nbetter.\n  The Asia-Pacific region, where this agreement is focused, is one of \nthe most economically vibrant and fastest growing areas in the world. \nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the world economy will \ngrow by more than $20 trillion over the next 5 years, and nearly half \nof that growth will be in Asia. Unfortunately, our share of exports to \nthe Asia-Pacific has been on the decline, as exports to the region lag \nbehind overall U.S. export growth. One reason U.S. companies have lost \nso much market share in this very important part of the world is that \nmany countries in the region maintain steep barriers to U.S. exports \nwhile they have been negotiating to remove many of the same types of \nbarriers for other countries, most notably for places such as China and \nthe European Union.\n  On average, Southeast Asian countries impose tariffs that are five \ntimes higher than the average U.S. tariff. In addition, their duties on \nU.S. agricultural products often reach triple digits. There are also \nnumerous other barriers, such as regulatory restrictions, that impede \naccess for U.S. exporters in many of these countries. These obstacles, \nand increased global competition, have made it increasingly difficult \nfor U.S. companies to remain competitive in Asia.\n  Put simply, a strong TPP Agreement is the best tool we could have to \nincrease the growth of U.S. exports to the Asia-Pacific region.\n  There are also important strategic and security reasons to support a \nstrong TPP Agreement. We have all seen in recent years how the \neconomies of our Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiating partners have \nbeen shaped by China's expanding economic influence. I think we would \nall prefer that the United States remain the world leader in trade. If \nwe want to maintain and expand our influence in the Asia-Pacific, it is \nessential that we more fully engage in that region. A strong TPP \nAgreement will facilitate that engagement and help ensure that trade \npatterns develop under a U.S. model, operating under U.S. rules and \napplying U.S. standards.\n  A strong TPP Agreement can help us create high-paying jobs through \nincreased exports, as well as help secure our strategic and economic \nposition in the Asia-Pacific region. But to do all of that, we need a \nstrong agreement. That is why I have been pushing the Obama \nadministration to negotiate wisely in order to reach a TPP Agreement \nthat advances our Nation's interests and provides significant benefits \nfor American workers and job creators.\n  Despite these obvious advantages to concluding a TPP Agreement, I \nthink it is critically important that the administration take the time \nnecessary to get the agreement right. A number of key issues are \noutstanding, and how they are resolved will go a long way to \ndetermining whether I can support the final agreement.\n  Our country has a long history of negotiating and reaching high-\nstandard trade agreements. While they haven't all been perfect, our \nexisting trade agreements have, in my view, advanced our interests in \nforeign markets and strengthened our own economy.\n  There are a number of reasons why, historically, our trade \nnegotiators have fought long and hard to get gold-standard agreements. \nThe most obvious reason is that anything less is unlikely to pass \nthrough Congress. If the administration is serious about not only \ngetting an agreement but getting an\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nagreement passed, they need to make sure they get our country the best \ndeal possible. If that means continuing negotiations beyond Atlanta, so \nbe it. Getting a good agreement will be worth the wait.\n  Over the years, I have laid out very clearly what I think a good \nagreement looks like. These ideas are embodied in the recently enacted \nTPA law. If the administration and our negotiating partners do conclude \nan agreement this week, they can be sure that I will examine it very \ncarefully to ensure it meets these standards. As I have stated many \ntimes before, if the agreement falls short, I will not support it. I \ndon't think I will be alone on that.\n  I am as big a proponent of expanding U.S. trade as you will find in \nthis Chamber, with the possible exception of the Presiding Officer, \nand, in concept, I very much support the idea of a Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. While I worked very hard for a number of years to get a \nTPA bill through Congress, I have made it abundantly clear that I will \nnot support just any deal, whether it is this or any other future \nadministration that wants to sign it. We need to get a good deal. \nIndeed, as I have said, we need to get the best deal possible.\n  No one--at least no one from our side of the negotiations--should be \nin a hurry to close talks if it means getting a less-than-optimal \nresult for our country. Ultimately, I don't believe anyone in the \nadministration wants to reach an agreement that will not pass in \nCongress.\n  I think our negotiators understand these concerns. My hope is that, \nas they move through the latest rounds of talks in Atlanta this week, \nthey consider what it will take to get a deal through Congress. If we \nlook at the bipartisan coalition that supported our TPA bill, we should \nget a pretty good sense of the balance it will take to get enough \nsupport here in the Senate and over in the House. Put simply, if TPP \ndoes not reflect that balance, it is hard to see how it will be \nsuccessfully enacted into law.\n  As always, I am an optimist. I know we can get a good deal here, and, \nfor my part, I am going to do all I can to help ensure that we do.\n  I don't think I am alone when I say I am going to be watching very \nclosely to see what happens in Atlanta this week. All of us have an \ninterest in the outcome of these negotiations. Hopefully, in the end, \nthose of us who have supported TPA and its promise of better trade \nterms for U.S. workers and expanded market access for American goods \nand services will not be disappointed at the outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                      Federal Perkins Loan Program\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to support reauthorizing the \nPerkins Loan Program, which will expire tomorrow, September 30, if the \nSenate does not act.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed legislation to extend \nthis vital program for 1 year. I urge my Senate colleagues to support \nthis bill and send it immediately to the President for his signature.\n  I want to recognize and thank my colleagues, Senator Baldwin, Senator \nCasey, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Portman, for their leadership \nin highlighting the importance of this program. I am pleased to join \nwith them in submitting a Senate resolution urging its extension.\n  Since 1958, the Perkins Loan Program has helped make college \naffordable for millions of students who have financial need. In the \nState of Maine, more than 5,000 students received a Perkins loan last \nyear, providing $9.2 million in aid. Last Friday, I had a conversation \nwith the president of the University of Maine, who told me just how \ncritical Perkins loans are to UMaine students.\n  Perkins loans are a critical part of a college's and a student's \nfinancial aid resources. These loans help to fill gaps beyond what is \navailable through the Department of Education's Direct Loan Program and \na family's ability to pay. A Perkins loan can meet that additional need \nso that students do not have to resort to borrowing through private or \nhigher cost loans, and, most of all, so they can remain in school.\n  Perkins borrowers are predominantly from lower income families. For \nexample, at the University of Maine last year, 64 percent of Perkins \nborrowers had a family income of $40,000 or less.\n  The Perkins Loan Program is campus-based, which means that \nparticipating colleges and universities administer the loans. When \nstudents graduate, they make payments directly to their college or \nuniversity, and those payments are used to make new loans to other \nstudents through a revolving fund. These revolving funds are a \ncombination of a Federal contribution and an institutional match.\n  Now, I think it is important to understand that Congress has not had \nto appropriate funds for the Perkins Loan Program since 2004 because of \nthis revolving fund concept, but institutions continue to be able to \nassist needy students through this self-sustaining program. That is why \nwe simply cannot allow it to lapse.\n  As a Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, I know that our committee is committed to the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I strongly support that \neffort. In the meantime, however, we must ensure that there is not a \nlapse in the financial assistance provided to students under the \nPerkins Loan Program.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the House-passed bill extends the authority \nfor the Perkins Loan Program for an additional year and does not \nauthorize any additional Federal funds. Students who receive a Perkins \nloan during this academic year and remain in the same academic program \nwould be eligible to receive future Perkins loans.\n  We only have 1 day before the Perkins Loan Program expires. Students \nat our colleges and universities are looking at us--they are depending \non us--to ensure that this vital and proven program does not expire. I \nurge my colleagues to pass the House-passed legislation so that the \nPerkins Loan Program can continue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the chancellor of the University of Maine System in \nsupport of the reauthorization of the Perkins Loan Program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Maine's Public Universities,\n\n\n                                   University of Maine System,\n\n                                   Bangor, ME, September 23, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senator, Bangor State Office,\n     Bangor, ME.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I'm writing to you on behalf of the \n     University of Maine System in support of the Federal Perkins \n     Loan Program. Perkins loans are an invaluable component of an \n     institution's and student's financial aid resources. The \n     flexibility, low fixed interest rate and generous \n     cancellation benefits are both unique and critical to our \n     needy student population, especially many middle and low-\n     income students. The program is administered at the school \n     level providing a highly efficient, self-sustaining program \n     with accountability, transparency, and risk-sharing.\n       The Federal Perkins Loan Program is in danger of being \n     discontinued. Without Congressional intervention, this \n     program will be terminated and the Perkins funds recalled \n     beginning October 1, 2015.\n       Throughout the 56-year history of the Perkins Loan Program, \n     $7.9 billion in federal contributions have been leveraged \n     with institutional contributions into over $36 billion in \n     low-cost loans to more than 30 million needy students. The \n     fact that this program provides critical support each year to \n     more than a half-million students across the country, \n     operating solely right now on the existing revolving fund \n     dollars, is quite remarkable. A key factor of the program's \n     success is the central role of the college that originates, \n     services, and collects the loans, while providing loan \n     counseling for the borrower. This is one of the most \n     effective and efficient public-private partnerships in the \n     federal government.\n       Perkins loans also offer more favorable forgiveness options \n     for borrowers than any other federal loan program. Full or \n     partial forgiveness is available to borrowers who work in \n     designated, high-need, public-service areas. During a time \n     when we are trying to reduce student loan indebtedness, the \n     loan forgiveness aspect of this unique program provides \n     financial relief to the student, and a well-educated \n     workforce to fortify public service in rural and inner-city \n     communities.\n       Students enrolled at one of the institutions in the \n     University of Maine System have benefited for many years \n     because of the efficiencies of the Perkins Loan Program. In \n     fiscal year 2013-2014 the University of Maine System awarded \n     almost $5.1 million in Perkins Loans to 3,386 students who, \n     without this program, would be forced to either borrow \n     higher-cost loans or leave school altogether.\n       If this program is eliminated, students at one of the \n     institutions in the University of\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\n     Maine System will lose a vital resource in support of their \n     higher education goals. Public universities already struggle \n     to provide sufficient financial aid to students, especially \n     the lower and middle class who currently benefit from this \n     program.\n       Eliminating the Perkins Loan Program will either force \n     students to borrow through less desirable loan programs, or \n     universities to make even more difficult cuts in an attempt \n     to fund the gap from the loss of this program.\n       I sincerely hope that the students enrolled at all of the \n     institutions in the University of Maine System, and all \n     across the state, can count on your support of this vitally \n     important and proven program. Also, 1 hope you can help \n     facilitate a budget solution that does not impact funding in \n     other critical areas relating to higher education and other \n     federal loan programs.\n       If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. \n     Thank you for your time and we appreciate your hard work and \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James H. Page,\n                           Chancellor, University of Maine System.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                      Federal Perkins Loan Program\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, much attention has appropriately been \nfocused upon our next 36 hours in the Congress. A lot of attention--\nagain, appropriately--focused on whether there would be a government \nshutdown for failure to pass a continuing resolution. Now we believe \nthat is, hopefully, going to be avoided.\n  In just under 36 hours, there are a number of other vital programs \nthat will expire, lapse, or sunset if this Congress does not take \nappropriate action. I am here to join my colleagues, Senator Collins \nand, in a moment, Senator Ayotte, to call attention to one of those \ncritical programs, one of those vital programs, and that is the Federal \nPerkins Loan Program, the authorization of which will expire in less \nthan 36 hours if we do not take collective action in this body.\n  I am here today to call on our colleagues across the aisle to join me \nin supporting the extension of the Federal Perkins Loan Program. \nAlready we have seen encouraging bipartisan support for the program \nhere in the Senate. The Presiding Officer, Senator Collins, Senator \nKirk, Senator Ayotte, and just today Senator Thune have all joined me \nand more than 20 Democrats last week in submitting a resolution \nhighlighting the importance of the Federal Perkins Loan Program and \nurging its extension.\n  Yesterday our colleagues in the House of Representatives unanimously \npassed a measure that would extend the program for 1 year. I am hoping \nthis body will do exactly the same. While I look forward to a broader \nconversation about improving Federal support for students as we look to \nreauthorize the Higher Education Act, we simply cannot sit idly by and \nwatch the Federal Perkins Loan Program expire as America's students are \nleft with such uncertainty.\n  Since 1958, the Federal Perkins Loan Program has been successful in \nhelping Americans access affordable higher education with low-interest \nloans for students who cannot borrow or afford more expensive private \nstudent loans. In my home State of Wisconsin, the program provides more \nthan 20,000 low-income students with more than $41 million in aid. The \nimpact of this program isn't just isolated to the Badger State. In \nfact, the Federal Perkins Loan Program aids over one-half million \nstudents with financial need each year, across 1,500 institutions of \nhigher education. The schools originate, service, and collect the \nfixed-interest-rate loans. What is more, institutions maintain loans \navailable for future students through a revolving fund.\n  Since the program's creation, institutions have invested millions of \ndollars of their own funds into the program. In addition to making \nhigher education accessible for low-income students, the program serves \nas an incentive for people who wish to go into public service as \ncareers by offering targeted loan cancellations for specific \nprofessions in areas of high national needs, such as teaching, nursing, \nand law enforcement.\n  As a Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions and as a U.S. Senator representing a State with a rich history \nof investment in cherishing of higher education, it is a top priority \nfor me to fight to ensure the Federal Perkins Loan Program continues \nfor generations to come.\n  I am fighting for students like Benjamin Wooten. Benjamin is a 2004 \nUW-Madison graduate and a small business owner from Genoa, WI, whose \nfamily fell on hard times while he was attending school. Ben shared \nwith me:\n\n       The fact that I did not have to pay interest while I was in \n     school was a huge help to me. I was attending school full \n     time, working and trying to live on a meager budget. . . . I \n     am a grateful and successful small business owner. I paid my \n     loan off in full about a year ago with pride and excitement. \n     I know that when I repaid my loan it was returned to a \n     revolving fund and will be lent back out to other students in \n     need.\n\n  I am also fighting for students like Brittany McAdams. Brittany is a \nmedical school student with a passion for pediatrics and helping the \nmost vulnerable among us--something that doesn't always yield a \nsignificant paycheck, especially in comparison to some of her medical \nschool peers. Brittany said:\n\n       I want to be able to treat patients from all socioeconomic \n     levels, despite their ability to pay. In other words, I want \n     to do important work for less money than most other \n     physicians. . . . The Perkins Loan is so valuable because it \n     does not collect interest while we are in school. To me, that \n     says the government believes that what I am doing with my \n     life is important. That our country needs more doctors \n     willing to tackle primary care. That while we need to pay for \n     our graduate degrees, that they are going to do their part to \n     make it just a bit easier. The Perkins Loan makes me feel \n     valued and respected and even more passionate about my work.\n\n  Finally, I am here today fighting for students like Nayeli Spahr. \nNayeli was raised by a single immigrant mother who worked two full-time \njobs. She attended 10 different schools in 3 different States before \nshe finished high school. Without the Federal Perkins Loan Program, \nNayeli said that her opportunity to get a college education would have \nbeen ``an illusory dream.''\n  Today, Nayeli is the first in her family to finish college and is now \nin her last year of medical school and is planning to work with those \nwho are underserved in our urban communities. She finished by telling \nme:\n\n       The Perkins loan program helped me reach this point. And, \n     its existence is essential to provide that opportunity for \n     other young adults wanting to believe in themselves and to \n     empower their communities to be better. Please save it.\n\n  You don't have to look very far to find the significant impact of the \nFederal Perkins Loan Program--the significant impact that it has on \nAmerica's students. There are thousands of stories like the few that I \njust shared, representing thousands and thousands of students who are \nstill benefiting from the opportunities provided to them by this hugely \nsuccessful program. Let's show the American people\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\nand the one-half million students impacted by this program that we can \ncome together, that we can find a bipartisan and commonsense solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to immediately take up and pass the House bill \nso that we can avoid another crisis of our own creation and put \nAmerica's students and our Nation's future first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today and join my colleagues, and I \nwish to thank Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin for the speech that she \ngave and for her leadership--as well as yours, Mr. President--on the \nresolution to extend the Federal Perkins Loan Program. This is \nsomething we should take up and pass right now. There is strong \nbipartisan support to do so.\n  Yesterday the House of Representatives passed the Higher Education \nExtension Act of 2015, which would extend this important program for an \nadditional year. But if the Senate does not act by tomorrow, this \nprogram, which helps the most financially needy students receive a \ncollege education, will expire. We can't let that happen.\n  I have heard from students, colleges in my State, universities, and \nfinancial aid administrators who have urged us to act and to make sure \nwe continue this program, which allows students with exceptional \nfinancial needs to have access to low-interest loans they need so they \ncan get higher education, live the American dream, and contribute to \nour society. Making sure they have that access is critical.\n  In New Hampshire, approximately 5,000 students received a Perkins \nloan during the last academic year. Across the country, as Senator \nBaldwin mentioned, over one-half million students received a Perkins \nloan during the 2013-2014 academic year. That is one-half million \nstudents across this country that will be impacted--their access to \nhigher education negatively impacted--if we do not take up the House-\npassed bill and immediately pass it in this body.\n  The cost of higher education in the United States continues to \nskyrocket. My home State of New Hampshire has the highest average \nstudent-loan debt in the country--either putting college out of reach \nfor too many or requiring students to take on substantial amounts of \ndebt in order to get a college education that is often hard to repay, \nespecially with the first job they receive right out of college.\n  There are several things we must do to address the issue of rising \ncollege costs, including, in my view, requiring schools to have more \nskin in the game and providing more transparency for students and for \nparents. But as we stand here today, there is one thing right now we \ncan do to help make college just a little bit more affordable, \nespecially for low-income students and families, and that is by taking \nup and passing the House bill to extend the Federal Perkins Loan \nProgram for 1 more year. Allowing Perkins to expire would mean that \nhundreds of thousands of low-income students across the country could \nsee a decrease of about $2,000 on average in their student aid \npackages. For many, that could put college out of reach because they \nare counting on it. If we don't take this up now, we will be in a \nposition of really leaving those students hanging, and we should not do \nthat. We should not allow that to happen.\n\n  I again thank my colleague from Wisconsin and the Presiding Officer, \nwho is from Ohio, for his leadership.\n  Again, this has such strong bipartisan support. I hope we get it done \ntoday. Let's do it now. Let's make sure we extend the Perkins Loan \nProgram for another year, just as the House did, and ensure we can work \ntogether to make college more affordable for everyone so that everyone \nhas the opportunity to live and achieve the American dream.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Perkins Loan \nProgram as well. We heard a number of important presentations here \nabout the critical nature of this program to students across the \ncountry who are trying to fulfill the American dream, and one way to do \nthat is to have access to higher education.\n  I have often said in the context of early learning, whether we are \ntalking about early learning programs or prekindergarten programs, if \nkids learn more now, they will earn more later. That linkage, that bond \nbetween earning and learning is, of course, at the core of what we are \ntalking about when it comes to higher education as well.\n  The benefit of a higher education has become so essential not only to \nbeing able to learn and to grow but also to getting the best job you \ncan to be able to move forward. One of the ways young people are able \nto do that is by having access to Perkins loans. They are fixed-rate, \nlow-interest loans, and they are meant for students who, as we heard \nbefore on this floor, have exceptional financial needs. For example, in \nPennsylvania, in the 2013 to 2014 school year, nearly 40,000 students \nin Pennsylvania, at more than 100 colleges and universities, were able \nto go to school because of these loans. Nationwide, more than 539,000 \nstudents were helped. For many students, these loans are the difference \nbetween staying in school and working toward a bright future or \nliterally dropping out of school.\n  According to the Coalition of Higher Education Assistance \nOrganizations, one-quarter of all loan recipients are from families \nwith incomes of less than $30,000 a year. We all have examples in our \nStates.\n  I have one example from the northwestern part of Pennsylvania. \nEdinboro University is part of our State system of higher education. I \nhad a chance to speak at their graduation this year.\n  Nikki Ezzolo, a 2015 graduate of Edinboro University, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       I am sending this to you to tell you that I just started my \n     new job at Highmark.\n\n  Highmark is a major health care company in western Pennsylvania.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       I am a single mom who wasn't your normal 20 year old at \n     college. I was an adult student who had left school more than \n     once when I thought I couldn't do it. The last time I came \n     back I was dedicated to getting my degree but I didn't have \n     enough financial aid to help me pay my bill. I had messed up \n     along the way in school and used up my only chance of having \n     a good life with my daughter.\n       I wanted to thank you for the perkins aid that I needed in \n     order to graduate. I am proud to be a college grad and my \n     daughter is proud of me too. I have always been a bartender \n     and this week I started my career at Highmark. I am so \n     grateful for getting the perkins money to help me. I know \n     that I wouldn't be where I am right now without it and that \n     is a really scary thought.\n\n  Whether it is Nikki from northwestern Pennsylvania or Kayla McBride, \na recent graduate of Temple University--Temple University is all the \nway at the other corner of our State in southeastern Pennsylvania. \nKayla also talked about the Perkins loan. Kayla said:\n\n       I wanted to extend my gratitude to Temple University and \n     the Bursar's Office.\n       With the rising costs of tuition, attending college might \n     seem impossible for some students. I come from a single-\n     family home and my mom did everything in her power to see \n     that I graduated. When my mom was laid off from her job, I \n     thought graduating would no longer be possible. I received \n     some scholarships, but it was still not enough to cover the \n     entire cost of tuition as well as room and board.\n       Without the assistance of the Federal Perkins Loan \n     finishing college would've been very difficult. I am now a \n     college graduate and I am thankful for all of the financial \n     assistance I received during my undergraduate years. College \n     can be an expensive investment, but I am glad that I had the \n     Perkins Loan to assist me.\n\n  Both cases exemplify and validate the importance of the Perkins Loan \nProgram.\n  Since the 1960s, over 30 million students have been helped by Perkins \nloans, and we have to do everything we can to continue the program.\n  What we are trying to do now is very simple. We are trying to get \nsome time in order to fully update and reauthorize Perkins loans so \nthat all students have access to an affordable college education. I \nurge the majority to work with us on this bipartisan effort to allow \nthe bill to pass so we can move forward and continue the Perkins Loan \nProgram even as we focus on changes in the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last night, with an overwhelming vote, the \nSenate ended debate that will conclude\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\nthe postcloture period, which will run until midnight tonight. Tomorrow \nmorning the Senate will pass a continuing resolution appropriations \nbill that will keep the lights on and keep the Federal Government \nrunning.\n  I have told my constituents that the irony of this is that we only \nappropriate funds for about 30 percent of the government, and half of \nthat 30 percent, roughly, is for defense spending; 70 percent, as the \nPresiding Officer knows well since he is an expert in this area, is on \nautopilot.\n  Since 2011, since the Budget Control Act, we have actually done a \nremarkably decent job of freezing the growth of discretionary spending. \nIt is roughly at the 2007 appropriations level. But the problem is that \nwithout bipartisan cooperation, we are unable to touch the 70 percent \nof government spending that has been growing by leaps and bounds, and \nthat simply can't continue.\n  This year, for the first time since I believe 2009, under the new \nmajority, the 114th Congress actually passed a budget, and that was a \nnotable achievement. I am almost a little sheepish about mentioning \nthat as an achievement because most people across America would think \nthat is not something to be particularly proud of and that that should \nhappen routinely, so why give anybody a pat on the back for doing \nsomething they ought to have done in the first place? But our budgets \nhave been missing under this administration, and literally the last \nbudget that was passed was 2009.\n  One of the benefits of having a budget is there is a regular \nappropriations process. That may sound like getting in the weeds for \nmost people, but this is the money we should be appropriating subject \nto spending caps to keep the government running. It is for items such \nas military construction and veterans' benefits, paying our men and \nwomen in uniform through the Defense appropriations bill. Those are \nessential items on which I know we would all agree.\n  The only reason we had to deal with the drama of this so-called \ncontinuing resolution is because notwithstanding the fact that we \nactually passed a budget and notwithstanding the fact that the various \nappropriations subcommittees had passed a budget and indeed the whole \nAppropriations Committee had voted them out and they were available for \naction on the floor, our friends across the aisle decided they were \ngoing to block those appropriations bills. Given the fact that under \nSenate rules it takes 60 votes to close off debate, our only \nalternative was to pass a continuing resolution, which I believe will \nfly out of here tomorrow morning with overwhelming support. It is a \nterrible way to do business, and it creates needless uncertainty for \nthe people we ought to be caring a lot about--people such as our \nveterans and our military servicemembers.\n  Even though we had the opportunity to move the appropriations process \nunder what we call regular order around here and not resort to this \ncontinuing resolution process, our Democratic colleagues decided \ninstead to turn their misguided filibuster summer into an equally \nmisguided filibuster fall.\n  Many of these bills, of course, came out with strong support. Here is \nan example of some of the oddity of this process: Some of the bills \nthey blocked were the very same pieces of legislation they supported in \nthe Appropriations Committee. For example, many of my colleagues from \nacross the aisle praised elements of the Defense appropriations bill, \nonly to then buckle under the Democratic leadership's pressure and \ntwice block the bill from going forward.\n  In some cases, our Democratic colleagues were quick to send out press \nreleases to their constituents back home celebrating their \naccomplishments under these very same bills and claiming a victory that \nwould benefit their home State. That was true in particular of both of \nour colleagues representing the State of New Jersey. When the bill was \noverwhelmingly voted out of committee, our colleagues from New Jersey \napplauded funding for a bill for F-16 fighters based in their State. \nThe junior Senator said: ``The inclusion of this funding is a deserving \nvictory for our U.S. Air National Guard.'' Similarly, the senior \nSenator said: ``Securing this funding in the Department of Defense \nAppropriation bill is a win, win, win.'' But these same Senators \nfilibustered that bill on the Senate floor. How do you explain that one \nback home? And they did that twice, along with virtually all of our \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  Unfortunately, the other 11 appropriations bills haven't made it to \nthe Senate floor because the majority leader recognizes that it is \nprobably a futile effort to do so--bills that many of our colleagues \ncelebrated, only to then refuse to take action that would move them \nforward, at the behest of Democratic leadership.\n  We didn't have to resort to this drama, and believe me, our \nDemocratic colleagues have been beating the drum, saying: There is \ngoing to be a shutdown. There is going to be a shutdown.\n  Well, they are the ones who created this crisis in the first place \nthat necessitated the passage of a continuing resolution by \nfilibustering the very same appropriations bills many of them voted for \nin committee and sent out press releases saying: Look at me. Look at \nwhat I have done for my constituents.\n  I don't know how to put a better word on it, but I think it reeks of \nhypocrisy at the very least.\n  But I also believe we have a responsibility--those of us who choose \nto operate in a responsible fashion--to try to govern the best we can \neven in the face of such arbitrary hypocrisy by some of our opponents. \nThey blocked the very same bills on the floor that they voted for in \nthe Appropriations Committee, thus creating this ``crisis.'' I put \nquotes around that. There was never really a crisis because we knew we \nwere going to do our job and make sure we kept the lights on, paid the \nmoney to our veterans for the benefits they earned, and that our \nmilitary--many of whom are in harm's way defending our freedoms and \nthose of our allies--was going to be taken care of. But the idea that \nyou would vote for bills in committee and then come to the floor and \nblock them is hard to explain, and, in fact, I can't explain it other \nthan using the word ``hypocrisy.''\n  Another element of this discussion has been whether we would use this \ncontinuing resolution to cut off money to Planned Parenthood. As we \nknow, Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in America. \nWell over 300,000 abortions are done at Planned Parenthood facilities \neach year.\n  I want to assure our Democratic colleagues, even though they have \nfilibustered our efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and to make sure \nthat not one penny of tax dollars goes to support the No. 1 abortion \nprovider in America, this fight is not over, based on their \nfilibustering of the defund Planned Parenthood legislation that we \nvoted on or their refusal to even consider the pain-capable abortion \nban.\n  We have said it before, but it bears repeating. I think most people \nwould be shocked to find out that the United States is only one of \nseven nations in the world that allows late-term abortions after a baby \nin utero is a viable human being. We are right there alongside the \ngreat defenders of human rights such as China, North Korea, and \nVietnam. While many States such as my State have imposed limitations at \nthe State level, I think it is appropriate for us to recognize that \nmedical technology has now allowed us to save preterm babies that we \ncould not in the past. In fact, the distinguished Presiding Officer, I \nbelieve, has shown me a picture on his iPhone of a child that was born \nthat weighed, I believe, somewhere around 1 pound at 20 weeks or so.\n  So we ought to be having this debate because I think what it reflects \nis who we are as a nation and whether we want to continue to subsidize \nthe sort of horrific practices we have seen depicted in some of these \nvideos, and most of them involve late-term abortions because that is \nwhere the money is. That is where Planned Parenthood harvests tissue \nfrom these late-term babies and then sells them. The only question is \nwhether they do it with the appropriate legal informed consent and \nwhether they do it for profit, as some of these videos would suggest, \nboth of which, by the way, are banned by current law--selling it for \nprofit and doing it without informed consent. Both of those are current \nprovisions of the law. We are conducting investigations in\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\nfour different committees in the Congress to make sure Planned \nParenthood is not in violation of current law, in addition to the steps \nwe have begun to both make sure no tax dollars go to Planned Parenthood \nto subsidize their abortion practice--the largest abortion provider in \nthe United States--and then to redirect that money to provide for \nwomen's health at community health centers and other places.\n  I was surprised this morning when I caught a glimpse of the hearing \nthat is occurring over in the House of Representatives where Cecile \nRichards, the chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood, is \ntestifying. Somebody asked her about her compensation. I was shocked \nthat she said: Well, I get paid $520,000 a year--$520,000 a year. This \nmoney--the vast majority of the money that Planned Parenthood gets is \nFederal tax dollars, primarily through Medicaid. So, in effect, the \ntaxpayers are subsidizing the chief executive officer of Planned \nParenthood--the No. 1 abortion provider in the country--her salary of \n$520,000 a year.\n  I remember after the financial crisis in 2008, a number of our \ncolleagues would come to the floor and say: We need to do something \nabout these excessive salaries of people working in the financial \nservices industry; this is an outrage. But I will tell my colleagues, I \nhaven't heard one peep out of our colleagues across the aisle about the \n$520,000 that Cecile Richards is paid each year as CEO of Planned \nParenthood, the No. 1 abortion provider in the country and an entity \nsubsidized mainly or in large part, I should say, by U.S. tax dollars--\nabout one-half billion dollars a year. Maybe that is a discussion we \nought to have.\n  The last thing I want to say is I think it is important to stress, in \nthe context of this debate, the value and the meaning of human life \nthat the fight is not over with the votes we have had so far. It is \nimportant to stress how some of the advocates back home in Texas, for \nexample--some of the strongest champions for the unborn in the \ncountry--have made clear how they hope their elected representatives \nwill respond to these horrific videos and the current debate. Just \nyesterday, for example, the executive director of the Texas Alliance \nfor Life, Dr. Joe Pojman, said he applauded the strong efforts of \nRepublican leadership in Congress to move forward with the strategy of \nshifting funds from Planned Parenthood to better providers of women's \nhealth services--providers that are not part of the abortion industry. \nIndeed, that is exactly what the Texas legislature has done, and it is \nsomething we need to do. In his statement, Dr. Pojman went on to say \nthat instead of a government shutdown, better options exist for \nachieving success.\n  This is similar to the statement made by Carol Tobias earlier, the \nleader of the National Right to Life organization. In other words, at \nthis pivotal moment in time, Congress has an opportunity to make \nprogress with legislation that would further the cause for life and \ndefend those who cannot defend themselves and to put on record all 100 \nMembers of the Senate. I know many people would prefer to look the \nother way because of the gruesomeness of this practice, particularly as \nit regards late-term fetuses--children who, if born, even though they \nare not full term at 40 weeks, could literally live outside of the \nwomb. In fact, neonatologists, as I mentioned a moment ago, have \ndemonstrated incredible capability of keeping these children alive even \nif they are born preterm.\n  We will, I hope, have a vote on--Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska has \nintroduced a bill that has actually passed the House of Representatives \ncalled ``the born alive'' bill. This bill simply would say, if a child \nis born alive as a result of a botched abortion, the health care \nprovider must do everything in their power to save and preserve that \nlife. I think it is important to get every Senator on record on that \nissue because this is a little bit different than the issue of \ndefunding Planned Parenthood. I think we ought to do both. We ought to \nban funding of tax dollars for Planned Parenthood, the No. 1 abortion \nprovider in the country, but we ought to also focus on the \ndesensitization of America and the world to some of these horrific \npractices, some of which we were shocked by when Kermit Gosnell, an \nabortion doctor in Pennsylvania, would literally deliver these babies \nalive and then kill them. I know people don't want to talk about it. \nThey don't want to think about it. They would prefer to just look the \nother way, but we can't, in the name of our very humanity, look the \nother way. We have to deal with this and where better to have that \ndebate and discussion and to put people on the record than right here \nin the U.S. Senate. That is what our plan is going forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                      Federal Perkins Loan Program\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think a lot of people here talk about \nwhat they think everyone should be focused on, but what I think we \nshould be focused on is that this month students across the country are \nmaking their way back to college campuses. When more Americans pursue \ntheir degrees beyond high school, it is actually good for our country. \nIt strengthens the middle class. It strengthens the workforce that \nneeds to compete in the 21st century global economy. So here in \nCongress what I believe we should be working on are ways to help more \nstudents earn a degree and gain a foothold into the middle class.\n  Unfortunately, instead of keeping students' options open to help them \nsucceed, we are facing another deadline and another artificial crisis. \nIf we do not act in the Senate, the Perkins Loan Program will expire \nafter tomorrow. That means that more than 100,000 students will no \nlonger be eligible for this assistance over the next year. That is \ngoing to leave a lot of students in this country in the lurch.\n  Without Perkins loans, students might have to take out private loans \nthat have higher interest rates and fewer repayment options. So \nstudents would end up with a heavier burden of student debt or they \nmight decide not to enroll in the first place. That is the exact \nopposite outcome we need for the future of this economy.\n  In my home State of Washington, more than 15,000 students received \nPerkins loans last year. That includes about 4,700 students from the \nUniversity of Washington. I want to make sure the next class of \nstudents has the same opportunity so they can better afford college.\n  We in Congress need to supply students with more support to manage \nrising college costs, not less. I am hopeful that today we can extend \nthe Perkins loan for 1 year while we work to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act because there is no reason to block this bipartisan \nlegislation that would give our students some certainty for next year.\n  The Perkins Loan Program gives students with financial needs three \nthings that private loans do not. The loans are low cost. They do not \naccrue interest while a student is enrolled and for 9 months afterward. \nThat can reduce student debt by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. \nThe loans provide flexible repayment terms, and they also give those \nwho are interested in the public sector generous forgiveness options.\n  The House Representatives has already acted to extend this program \nfor 1 year. We should do the same before the clock runs out.\n  I am so glad this effort to extend the Perkins Loan Program has \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate. It would provide new students \nwith some certainty for the current school year. Today, students face \nunprecedented challenges in financing their education. The cost of \ncollege has skyrocketed, and many students are struggling under the \ncrushing burden of student debt. Preventing the Perkins Loan Program \nfrom expiring will not solve all of their problems. I hope we can \ncontinue this bipartisan work on ways to make college more affordable \nand rein in student debt.\n  Passing this bill to extend the Perkins Loan Program is a step we can \ntake so students don't have the rug pulled out from under them. There \nis no reason students should have to face this uncertainty and there is \nno reason we shouldn't be able to pass this by unanimous consent.\n  I know firsthand how important education is for families and for our \nNation's middle class. When I was 15, my dad was diagnosed with \nmultiple sclerosis and, in a few short years, he\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\ncouldn't work any longer. Without warning, my family had fallen on hard \ntimes, but instead of falling through the cracks, my brothers and \nsisters and I got a good public education at our schools and we had a \ncountry at our back that helped make sure we were able to go to college \nwith student loans and what is now known as the Pell program. My mom \ngot the skills she needed to find a better paying job at Lake \nWashington Vocational School. So even though we faced some hard times, \nwe never lost hope that with a good education we would be able to find \nour footing and earn our way to a stable middle-class life.\n  Students at colleges and universities across the country today are \nlooking now to us to make sure they have a solid pathway into the \nmiddle class. So I urge my colleagues to support extending this program \nto make sure students have the financial aid tools they need so they \ncan build their skills, grow our economy, and help lead the world in \nthe 21st century.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I join my fellow colleague from \nWashington State, talking about the Perkins Loan Program. The House has \nalready acted on this. They extended it for 1 year. All we are asking \nis that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle allow us to have the \nopportunity to do that here, probably by unanimous consent.\n  It shouldn't be terribly controversial. After all, this is a program \nthat is working. I am following a number of my colleagues today in \ntalking about this. We just heard from Senator Murray. We also heard \nfrom Senators Collins, Baldwin, Ayotte, and Casey. This is a bipartisan \neffort. It is an attempt on our part to ensure that students are not \ngoing to fall between the cracks. They are getting started this fall in \ncolleges and universities, and they are wondering whether this program \nis going to be here or whether we are going to allow it to expire. We \nought to be sure these young people know that, yes, the program is \ngoing to be here and, yes, they are going to have the opportunity to \nget ahead by using this relatively low-cost student loan option that is \nfocused on kids with the most need to be able to get an education.\n  Since 1958 this program has been strong. It has been one that works. \nBy the way, there is no appropriation involved. There is no spending \ninvolved here. It is a matter of allowing the program to continue. The \nprogram has what is called a revolving fund, where whenever somebody \ngets a loan and pays that money back, the money goes back to another \nstudent. This is an opportunity for us to continue a program that is \nworking.\n  If we don't pass it, we are going to have a situation where new loans \nwill not be awarded. College tuition is already too tough. I hear it \nall the time from families back home and from students back home. One \nof the biggest concerns they have--we had a tele-townhall meeting last \nnight, and one of the biggest concerns that people have, of course, is \nthe cost of education. This is a way to ensure that young people can \npursue their dreams, despite the fact that college tuitions are too \nhigh in many cases. This is a tool that is incredibly important.\n  It is also a matching program that hasn't been talked about much on \nthe floor today. The fact is that the program is administered by the \nschools, and the schools actually match so that they are providing some \nof the funding for this. That is another reason why I like this \nprogram.\n  There are 67 colleges and universities in the Buckeye State, my State \nof Ohio, that participate and take advantage of this. I have gotten \ninteresting correspondence from some of the schools and students. Last \nyear there were 25,000 or so Ohio students who received Perkins loans. \nI heard from Kent State. They have 3,000 students involved in Perkins. \nI have heard from Ohio State, which has 1,700 students there. I have \nalso heard from other schools. I have heard from the University of \nToledo, Oberlin, and Ohio Wesleyan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome of the correspondence because it describes the needs of the \nprogram so well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                   Kent State,\n\n                                    Kent, Ohio, September 3, 2015.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor & \n         Pensions\n       Dear Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray: On \n     behalf of Kent State University, I write to you today in \n     support of reauthorizing the Federal Perkins Loan Program \n     before it is due to expire on September 30.\n       Since its inception over 55 years ago, the Perkins Loan \n     Program has played an important role in providing need-based \n     financial aid for our students by distributing low-interest, \n     subsidized loans to those with demonstrated financial need.\n       Kent State University students receive the largest volume \n     of Perkins Loans in the entire State of Ohio. Total \n     disbursements for the 2015-16 academic year alone are \n     estimated to reach over $9M.\n       While there have not been federal capital contributions to \n     the Perkins Loan Program in recent years, universities have \n     continued to use existing resources to fund new loans for \n     needy students. Absent Congressional action before the end of \n     this month, these loans will cease to be disbursed and \n     hundreds of thousands of students across the nation will lose \n     a vital source of aid.\n       In a higher education environment that focuses on access \n     and affordability, the expiration of the Perkins Loan Program \n     would have a devastating effect. I therefore urge that you \n     delay the expiration of the Perkins Loan Program until \n     Congress has the opportunity to enact a comprehensive \n     reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Beverly Warren,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Oberlin College & Conservatory,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                Oberlin, Ohio, September 18, 2015.\n     Hon. Rob Portman,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Portman: I am writing to you as President of \n     Oberlin College asking that you intervene to extend the \n     Perkins Loan Program, which is set to expire on September 30, \n     2015. As you may be aware, the Perkins Program provides \n     federal funds to institutions of higher education in order to \n     offer low-interest loans of up to $5,500 per year to \n     students. More than 500,000 students received Perkins Loans \n     in the 2013-2014 academic year, totaling more than $1 billion \n     in disbursed student aid. However, not all the funding for \n     this program comes from the federal government, as up to one-\n     third of the funds appropriated by the federal government are \n     matched by participating institutions. Ultimately, Perkins \n     Loans are an important piece of the campus-based federal aid \n     model, offering flexibility and discretion to financial aid \n     officers to help students afford their higher education.\n       At Oberlin College we have committed to meeting 100% of \n     every student's demonstrated financial need. While we do this \n     predominantly with grant dollars, the Perkins Loan Program is \n     a vital component in making an Oberlin education affordable \n     for both our low and middle-income families. Last year alone \n     more than 320 Oberlin students received funding of over $1 \n     million from the Perkins Program. Many students tell us, \n     particularly lower income students, that without the help of \n     the Perkins Loan it is likely they could not have attended \n     Oberlin.\n       Senator Portman, I urge you to support the reauthorization \n     of the Perkins Loan Program. As history has shown us, the \n     Perkins Program was one, if not the first, form of federal \n     student aid that has helped millions of students afford \n     higher education. At Oberlin, while we have a tremendous \n     institutional commitment to making college affordable through \n     our needbased grant program, we also know our students rely \n     heavily on Perkins Loans as a means to attain their \n     educational aspirations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Marvin Krislov,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n       Michael Bodnar: My wife and I are very concerned about \n     Congress not extending the Perkins Loan Program. With two \n     children in College and one on the way, we would not be able \n     to send them to the type of school needed to excel in this \n     world today.\n       Every time we vote the political platform of higher \n     education is expressed as so important. Now we and our \n     children are faced with the possibility of losing vital money \n     needed to stay in college.\n       We urge you to move forward and make sure that this program \n     is extended. Most of our friends that have children in \n     college rely on this program to help them pay their tuition.\n       Mary Bodnar: My husband and I are very concerned that The \n     Federal Perkins Loan is on the verge of being discontinued.\n       By not acting on this very important issue which comes due \n     on October 1st you are putting many families and College \n     students at risk of not being able to afford their higher \n     education. We have two children in college\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\n     and one on the way and this program is vital to us as a \n     family. Every year it's time to vote a representative into \n     office weather it's the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate we hear how important it is to educate our children.\n       Please make sure that this important Federal Loan Program \n     continues. All of our friends that have children in college \n     depend on The Federal Perkins Loan Program to get their kids \n     through college.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. It is not just about Ohio. It is about the entire \ncountry. There are 1,700 postsecondary institutions that take advantage \nof the program. Allowing it to expire is going to affect all those \ninstitutions and all those many thousands of students.\n  Tuition is far too high. We should be making it easier--not harder--\nfor students to be able to pay for college. I have heard concerns from \nsome of my colleagues that we shouldn't extend this and not allow a \nunanimous consent agreement to occur here because they would like to \nimprove the program to make it better and even more targeted, updated, \nand modernized, and make sure the funds are allocated properly. I don't \ndisagree with that at all. I agree that this program, like every other \nprogram in the Federal Government, could be improved. That should be \npart of our work. We should be improving these programs so they are \nmore cost effective and efficient and getting to the folks who really \nneed the program the most.\n  While I agree we need to look at it and make changes, I don't think \nwe should take this step of allowing it to expire. Why? Because, in \neffect, what we are doing there is we are saying that it is going to be \nat the expense of the students who need the aid. It should be on us. We \nshould be doing our work. So I hope that we will go ahead and allow \nthis extension to occur, and then let's work on those solutions. I \nthink that it may be easier to have these reforms take place if we are \nnot working under the gun--in other words, allowing this program to \nexpire. Letting something lapse and trying to figure out how to bring \nit back is not the way the American people and the people of Ohio whom \nI represent expect Congress to work. I think we can get this done, and \nI think we can do this with the extension.\n  The Department of Education already indicated to us that they may \nstart to recall funding in October from colleges and universities if \nthis program is not extended. By the way, not extending Perkins won't \nhelp with the Nation's budget problems, because, again, it is a \nrevolving fund. The way it works is one loan is paid back and another \nloan is extended.\n  This is the right thing to do. As we ensure that government continues \nto operate, let's ensure the Perkins Loan Program does as well.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \ntheir discussion today on this issue. I want to urge leadership on both \nsides of the aisle to focus on this issue. Let's be sure and do what \nthe Senate should do along with the House. The House acted already with \na 1-year extension. Let's simply do what the House has already done. \nLet's ensure we are providing loans to students who need them while we \ncontinue our efforts to reform this program and make it even stronger \ngoing forward.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n     James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to hopefully prick the \nconscience of the Senate to ask the Senate to honor the memory of James \nZadroga and all of those first responders who on September 11 responded \nto a national tragedy.\n  I come to the floor to achieve a goal that I and others did in 2010, \nwhich was then to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation \nAct, and today it is to speak to reauthorize it before it expires.\n  Now, Jim Zadroga was a New Jerseyan, but he was also a hero who after \nSeptember 11, 2001, ran towards the World Trade Center--not away--to \nhelp us recover. But while working on the site, breathing in the smoke, \ndust, and debris, unknown to him, he was developing an illness from \nwhich he would never recover.\n  Jim was the first emergency responder to die directly because of \nhealth effects from working at Ground Zero. For years we had pieces of \nlegislation in Congress to right the wrong created when hundreds of \nemergency workers were left out of the World Trade Center emergency \nworker settlements. It took us 9 years to pass the original bill. Let's \nnot let it expire tomorrow.\n  Let's send a clear message to our first responders, those who \nresponded on that fateful day and those who may be called upon to \nrespond on some future fateful day, that we will never forget what they \ndid for their fellow citizens, for this Nation, on the day that changed \nthe world--for Jim Zadroga, who passed away, and for every other first \nresponder sick because of their response to duty, some of whom have \ndied and left loved ones behind.\n  If you told any American 14 years ago that we would let expire our \ncommitment to provide for those who helped in the 9/11 recovery effort, \nthat their government would be slow to respond to their illnesses, \ntheir suffering, and their sacrifices, no American would believe it. \nBut that is what we are on the verge of doing. That is exactly what we \nare on the verge of doing.\n  We just had the September 11 commemoration. We all faithfully and \nresponsibly went to remember the lives of those fellow Americans who \nwere lost. We all paid tribute to them and to those who sacrificed in \nresponse. Yet here we are, just a few weeks after, on the verge of \nallowing to expire the very law that helps those who did their duty--\nsome who did beyond their duty, because they were first responders not \neven from New York City but who came from across the country to help in \nthe aftermath. No American would believe that we are about to let this \nexpire. That is where we are, and it must change. This law is set to \nexpire at midnight tomorrow.\n  Now, there is still enough funding to pay out claims for months to \nfollow, but the reauthorization bill that I and other colleagues have \ncosponsored is needed now for a number of reasons. First and foremost, \nto provide the security, the peace of mind, and reassurances to those \nfirst responders that these critical programs will last longer than \njust what the next couple of months' funding would provide. It also \npermanently lifts the statute of limitations on the Victims \nCompensation Fund to provide for those first responders who need access \nbeyond next year because we don't know what latent illness may befall \nthem as a result of their sacrifice at Ground Zero.\n  Very importantly, it exempts the key programs from the budget \nsequestration cuts that would hollow out the critical safety net that \nthis program provides for those September 11 first responders. The \nsequestration, which I voted against, imposes arbitrary and capricious \ncuts to funding that will continue to provide care and support for \nthose 9/11 heroes, who sacrificed everything to help those in need on \nthat tragic day.\n  The fact is, Congress must act, and this time, let's not wait for a \npublic outcry before we ensure that these heroes receive the care and \nsupport they deserve. Last week I stood with colleagues and first \nresponders to call on all of us to do what is right and honor these \nheroic men and women.\n  Let's reauthorize the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation \nReauthorization Act before it expires tomorrow. It is the least we can \ndo to say thank you for the risks they took and the sacrifices they \nmade. Fourteen years after the attack, we still have a profound and \nmoral obligation to take care of these brave men and women, the first \nresponders who risked their lives and are now suffering health effects \nas a result of their efforts.\n  All of us remember that day. We remember where we were on the day \nthat changed the world. We remember that it brought us closer together \nas family, as a community, one Nation indivisible. This is not a New \nYork or a New Jersey issue. Nearly every State in the Nation has a \nfirst responder or more who ultimately will benefit from the fund \nbecause of an illness they have contracted or a loved one they left \nbehind.\n  There is a reason we call this great country the United States of \nAmerica, because, in fact, whether there are wildfires in the West, \nflooding in the Mississippi or any other great consequence to our \ncountry, we take care\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\nof our own collectively. In fact, this is the moment to take care of \nthose whom we have heralded as heroes. It is not simply enough to say \nso in words, but we have to do so in deeds.\n  We should remember that feeling that we had on that day and \nsubsequently the days afterwards and honor the heroic men and women, \nsuch as James Zadroga, and reauthorize the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in recent years we have faced a lot of \ndifficulty filling positions for service to our Federal Government, not \nthe least of which are critical diplomatic posts around the world. We \nhave seen delays in confirming Federal judges, one of the most \nimportant duties of the Senate. These men and woman are chosen for life \nappointments.\n  The most frustrating part of this is that virtually all of these \nnominees should be confirmed with overwhelming support. To be nominated \nby the President at the White House for an ambassadorial spot or even a \nFederal judgeship you go through a clearance process in the beginning \nfor the White House to choose this person, then a background check--and \nit is a pretty extensive background check--and then eventually, if the \nWhite House is satisfied this person is fit for the job, with no \nobstructions to their moving forward, they send them to Congress and it \ngoes through this process all over again.\n  So these nominees have been vetted once, twice, three times before \nthey finally reach the point where there is a vote on the nominee in a \ncommittee on Capitol Hill in the Senate. If they clear that vote--and \nit is a partisan vote--if they clear that vote, then they make it to \nthe Executive Calendar. It takes a long time. While this is going on, \npeople are sitting there in suspense as to whether they are going to be \nselected and when they finally might get a chance to serve.\n  For some reason, we have seen a virtual standstill since the \nRepublicans have taken control of the Senate when it comes to filling \ncritical positions appointed by the President. It is time for us to \nschedule up-or-down votes on more than 27 foreign affairs and judicial \nnominees who are awaiting floor action.\n  Given the foreign policy challenges we face around the world, the \ndelays in considering delays for our ambassadors and other critical \nforeign policy positions is inexcusable. Many come to the floor on the \nother side of the aisle every day to criticize the President and his \nforeign policy. Yet when he asks for men and women to serve and \nrepresent the United States in foreign countries, they languish on the \ncalendar.\n  Most of the people languishing on the calendar for ambassadorial \nspots are not political, they are professional. They are men and women \nwho have served our government through Democratic and Republican \nadministrations, have developed a good reputation, and are now moving \nup to a new responsibility. Why in the world is the Republican majority \nrefusing to allow those men and women to serve the United States? I \ndon't understand it. I think it is dangerous. I think some people are \nputting politics ahead of national security.\n  As of today, we have at least 11 foreign affairs nominees on the \nSenate Executive Calendar. Typically the vast majority of those \nnominees move quickly in a bipartisanship manner. However, over the \npast few years that has all changed. Everything is political now. Last \nyear the Senate Republicans held up more than 30 nominees at various \ntimes. At least 10 of them were held over from the last Congress.\n  Most astonishingly, on the Senate Executive Calendar today, at a time \nwhen the international community is facing a terrible conflict in \nSyria, is a professional named Gayle Smith. She is a qualified nominee \nwho wishes to serve as the head of USAID, U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment. What does that Agency do? That Agency provides food and \nmedicine to the refugees of the Syrian war. It is a big process. It has \nto be moved into countries and into refugee camps in massive amounts to \nkeep innocent people--victims of this war--alive.\n  Gayle Smith has been waiting for weeks, if not months, for approval. \nSo what is so controversial about her? The only controversy is she was \nchosen by President Obama. She is eminently qualified. No one has \nraised any questions about her competency to do this job. She came to \nsee me a week or two ago. She is anxious to serve our government, and \nthe job she has to do is critically important at this moment in \nhistory. Yet she languishes on the Senate Executive Calendar not \napproved. So there is no nominal leader of this massive Agency which is \nresponsible for the well-being of so many innocent people. There are \nanother 10 just like her. In addition to this, three dozen more await \nconfirmation in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Many of them \nhave had hearings; they just sit there. This includes people like \nJeffrey Hawkins to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Central African \nRepublic. Now, most of us would struggle to find that on a map, but the \nfact is, that country is facing its own conflict that has displaced \nmore than one-half million people. Yet the post of U.S. Ambassador to \nthat country goes vacant, not because of any controversy about Jeffrey \nHawkins but the fact that he was chosen by this President. That is it. \nThat is the only complaint.\n  It also includes Roberta Jacobson, who has been named as the next \nAmbassador of Mexico. Roberta is a seasoned diplomat who would be a \ngreat asset to a country that is our neighbor and closest among Latin \nAmerican countries.\n  It includes Daniel Rubinstein to be the next Ambassador to Tunisia, \none of the few countries to emerge from the Arab Spring as a \nfunctioning democracy. In total, some of these posts have been vacant \nfor more than 1 year, despite the President's efforts to fill them. \nOther nominees are supposed to replace current Ambassadors who are \nlooking forward to moving to their next post. They cannot do it. Why? \nThe Senate does not want to call them for a vote.\n  That is a decision to be made by the Republican majority. It is a \nshame our nominees, many of whom are noncontroversial, who have \ndistinguished careers in the Foreign Service, languish on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar for months at a time, in some cases a year. There \nused to be a spirit of bipartisanship when it came to national \nsecurity, one that had a long and proud tradition. I hope the majority \nnow will return to that proud tradition.\n  We have a similar delay when it comes to judges. So far this year--\nthis year, and here we are in the month of September, near the end, \ncoming into October--so far this year, the Republican-controlled Senate \nhas held confirmation votes on six judges--six--all year. Well, you \nsay, the President only has 2 years left. Maybe it is normal that you \nwould not approve a judge for a lifetime appointment if he only has a \nlittle over a year left now. During President George W. Bush's final 2 \nyears in office, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed 68 judicial \nnominees--6 so far this year by the Republicans. At this point in 2007, \nthe Democratic Senate had confirmed 29 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees. That is nearly five times the number that has been cleared by \nthe Republican Senate, despite the fact that there is no controversy \ninvolving any of those nominees.\n\n  There are 16 noncontroversial judicial nominees currently pending on \nthe Senate Calendar whom we could confirm right away. Seven of these \nnominees would fill judicial emergencies. That means they are being \nsent to courthouses where the cases are stacking up and people are \nasking: When am I going to get my day in court?\n  Well, you will not get your day in court until the new judge gets his \nday in the Senate. We don't know when that might happen. There is no \nreason to delay these confirmation votes. These nominees would be \nconfirmed\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\nwith overwhelming support. We need to put them into the vacancies on \nthe Federal bench. Overall, there are 67 vacant Federal judgeships now, \n31 of which have been designated as judicial emergencies. Most of those \nvacancies are from States where there is at least one Republican \nSenator. What that means is that nominee would not even be on the \ncalendar were it not for the approval of that Republican Senator. So \nthey have bipartisan support. I urge my Republican colleagues to work \nin good faith to fill these vacancies on the Federal bench. This is an \nimportant responsibility of the Senate. We should not neglect it.\n  The vast majority of nominees could be confirmed today. If debate is \nneeded on a few of them, so be it. If a rollcall is needed, let's have \nit. We cannot leave vacant important positions in our government and in \nour judicial system: 16 judicial nominees, 11 nominees for foreign \naffairs. We could vote on them this afternoon. Are we holding off the \nvote because we are too busy on the Senate floor? If you are following \nthe Senate, you know that is not the case. It is time for us to do our \njobs so these nominees can do theirs. For the sake of national security \nand our system of justice, let's move forward in a bipartisan fashion \nand vote on these nominees.\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. President, another school year has begun. In August, I marked the \noccasion by holding a press conference outside of Argosy University. \nDon't be surprised if you have not heard the name Argosy University. It \nis a for-profit college in downtown Chicago. This for-profit college is \npart of an industry that enrolls 10 percent of all college students--\nthe for-profit colleges and universities--10 percent of the students. \nThey take in 20 percent of all the Department of Education financial \naid. Here is the kicker. For-profit colleges and universities account \nfor 44 percent of all the student loan defaults: 10 percent of the \nstudents, 44 percent of the student loan defaults.\n  Why does that happen? Because of several things. First, they are very \nexpensive. They accept anyone--virtually anyone. Many of the students \nstart going to these for-profit schools and realize they are getting \ntoo deep in debt and they drop out. Then they have the worst world: a \nstudent debt and no degree. Some of them finish the school, finish the \ncourse, and are given a diploma. They find out that they cannot get a \njob with it.\n  When you look at the Brookings Institution's recent study of for-\nprofit schools, they ranked last when it comes to good-paying jobs \nafter college. Then what happens? The students cannot make enough money \nto pay off their student loans and they default. That, sadly, is the \ncycle that has faced thousands of students across America. This \nindustry is in trouble. It is in such trouble that many of the large \nfor-profit schools are threatened and some have collapsed. The largest, \nCorinthian College, this for-profit university sent shock waves through \nthe industry. They raked in profits, leaving students with mountains of \ndebt, and then when they were asked to prove to the Federal Government \nthat the students actually got a job after they graduated, they \nfalsified the returns to the Federal Government. When they were \nchallenged, they went under. They sunk.\n  When they sunk, look what happened. The students who had gone to \nschool there were told: Corinthian just disappeared. You no longer have \na university. Then they learned that the courses they took could not be \ntransferred to any other school except maybe another for-profit school \nsomewhere. The net result of it is, the students had an option: give up \nwhatever credits they had at Corinthian and walk away from their \nstudent loans or keep their Corinthian credits and pay their student \nloans.\n  The students who walked away from their student loans, of course, \ncreated an obligation to Federal taxpayers who had to make up the \ndifference.\n  Argosy University is another one of these for-profit colleges. It is \nowned by Education Management Corporation. It is one of the companies \nthat are also being looked at very carefully. Students who walk through \nArgosy's doors in Chicago or surf their ads online considering \nenrollment should know the company that runs this school, Argosy \nUniversity, is under investigation by at least 14 different State \nattorneys general for unfair and deceptive practices.\n  In 2013, the Colorado attorney general sued EDMC, which owns Argosy, \nfor deceiving, misleading, and financially injuring students. The \nColorado attorney general's investigation centered on Argosy and found \na long, elaborate pattern of deceptive behavior by the school. That is \nnot all. EDMC is also being sued by the Department of Justice under the \nFederal False Claims Act for falsely certifying compliance with \nprovisions of Federal law. It turns out that they are incentivizing \npeople to sign up students at their schools, these for-profit schools. \nThey give them a signing bonus if they can lure some young student into \nsigning up. That violates the law.\n\n  In addition, the San Francisco city attorney found that EDMC, the \ncompany that runs Argosy, engaged in marketing tactics that \nunderestimated program costs for students and inflated job placement \nfigures. They were just flatout lying to these kids.\n  According to the Department of Education, EDMC is considered ``not \nfinancially responsible.'' It has been placed on the Department's \nspecial heightened cash monitoring status.\n  The company withdrew its stock from trading on NASDAQ because it no \nlonger wanted to make public filings with the SEC. You see, if you make \na public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and lie, \nyou can go to jail, so they just withdrew their stock rather than be \ncaught lying.\n  In addition, in Chicago, an Argosy student seeking an associate's \ndegree in business, information technology, or psychology will pay \nabout $34,000 in tuition to this for-profit school. Two blocks away, \nthe students at City Colleges of Chicago Harold Washington Campus are \nalso getting the same degree, and the cost there is $7,000. It is \n$34,000 at Argosy and $7,000 at the City Colleges of Chicago. \nIncidentally, the hours at the City Colleges of Chicago are \ntransferable to other universities and schools--not if it is Argosy.\n  One in fifty students at the Harold Washington Campus is likely to \ndefault ultimately when it comes to paying their student loans; at \nArgosy, one out of seven. It is just too darn expensive, and these kids \ncannot pay back the loans.\n  A recent Brookings report found that Argosy University Chicago--the \none I visited in August--is No. 9 in the country on the list of schools \nwhose students owe the most in Federal student loans. They owe a total \nof $6.2 billion--billion. In fact, of the top 25 schools on the list, \n13 are for-profit colleges and account for 10 percent of all the \noutstanding student loan debt in America.\n  I want to close, as I see my colleague is on the floor seeking \nrecognition. I close by using one more example: ITT Tech. It sounds \ngreat, doesn't it. It is No. 16 on Brookings' list. Students owe $4.6 \nbillion in loans. It is not surprising. An associate's degree, a 2-year \ndegree at ITT Tech, costs $47,000, and the students have a one-in-five \nchance of defaulting on the loans they make at that school. Meanwhile, \nITT Tech, which does business in Chicago--Arlington Heights, Orland \nPark, and Oak Brook--has been under investigation by at least 18 State \nattorneys general for unfair and deceptive practices, has been sued by \nthe New Mexico attorney general for misrepresentation to students about \ntheir accreditation status and sued by the Federal Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau for predatory lending. The list just goes on.\n  The point I am getting to is we are subsidizing these schools. This \nis the most heavily subsidized for-profit business in America; 80 \npercent to 95 percent of their revenue comes straight from the Federal \nTreasury. If all of the money going to for-profit colleges and \nuniversities--think about the University of Phoenix, DeVry, Kaplan--if \nall of that money were combined, this would be the ninth largest \nFederal agency in Washington. But, instead, the CEOs who run these for-\nprofit companies are making a ton of money. The top man at the \nUniversity of Phoenix--the biggest one--makes $9 million a year. How is \nthat for being a college president? And some of these other ones, small \nchange--$3 million a year. They get to run these for-profit schools \nwhile these kids stack up in debt, end up defaulting, and end with \ntheir lives ruined. Incidentally, defaulting on a debt means you still \nowe it to the grave. Student loan debts are not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\n  I could go through a long list, but I hope Congress comes to its \nsenses when the higher education bill comes to the floor. This rip-off, \nthis scam on students and families across America, has to come to an \nend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n         Pharmaceutical Industry and Cost of Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss one of the major crises \nfacing our health care system today, and that is that the \npharmaceutical industry itself has become a major health hazard to the \nAmerican people. The pharmaceutical industry in this country is \ncharging the American people by far the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs.\n  The result is that one out of five Americans, including patients \nsuffering from cancer who get a prescription from a doctor, is unable \nto afford to fill that prescription. This is totally absurd. The result \nis that Americans who are unable to buy the drugs that were prescribed \nto them become much sicker than they should have been, and in some \ncases they die. The result is also that people will end up in the \nemergency room or in the hospital at great expense to themselves and to \nthe system because they were unable to afford the drugs that would have \nimproved their health.\n  As Dr. Marcia Angell, a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard \nMedical School and a former editor of the New England Journal of \nMedicine, recently wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       Why do drug companies charge so much? Because they can.\n\n  Simple truth. There is not a rational economic reason for that. They \ncharge outrageously high prices because nobody is stopping them in this \ncountry.\n  The United States is the only major country on Earth--the only one--\nthat does not in one form or another regulate prescription drug prices. \nWhat that means is you could walk into the drugstore and the pharmacy \ntomorrow, and you could find that the price you are paying for a drug \nyou have been using for many years has doubled, tripled, or gone up 10 \ntimes, and the United States has chosen to be the only major country on \nEarth that does not address this issue.\n  Let me give a few examples, some of which have received a good deal \nof attention recently.\n  In the United States, Daraprim, a prescription drug used to treat \npatients diagnosed with cancer and AIDS, shot up in price from $18 a \npill to $750 a pill, literally overnight, after this drug was acquired \nby a former hedge fund manager by the name of Martin Shkreli, who is \nquickly becoming the poster child for pharmaceutical greed. This same \nexact drug sells for 66 cents a pill in Britain, and Mr. Shkreli is \ncharging the American people $750 for a drug used to treat patients \nwith cancer and AIDS. That makes no sense to me, and it makes no sense \nto the American people.\n  Last week Congressman Elijah Cummings and I sent a letter to Mr. \nShkreli asking him to explain why the price of this drug has \nskyrocketed by over 4,000 percent. Now the good news--or it appears to \nbe the good news--is that Mr. Shkreli recently said he would lower the \nprice of this lifesaving drug, although he has not yet indicated what \nthe new price will be. But let's be very clear--this is just one of \nmany examples of price gouging within the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I wish to give another example. In the United States the prescription \ndrug Sovaldi, which is used to treat a very serious and widespread \ndisease, Hepatitis C, costs $1,000 a pill--a thousand bucks a pill. In \nEurope, the same exact drug, made by the same exact company, costs $555 \na pill. In Egypt and India, the same drug costs $11 a pill.\n  The cost of this drug has become so expensive that Medicaid and the \nVeterans' Administration--and many veterans are suffering with \nHepatitis C--both Medicaid and the VA are rationing access to Sovaldi \nand other blockbuster Hepatitis C drugs to only the sickest patients. \nIn other words, people in the United States are dying and suffering \nbecause they or the government programs they rely on--Medicaid or the \nVA--are simply unable to afford the outrageous prices this company is \ncharging.\n  According to a recent article in the Atlantic magazine, despite \nrationing Sovaldi, the State of New Mexico--and I am just using New \nMexico as one example; this is taking place all across the country--the \nState of New Mexico will spend an estimated $140 million this year on \nthat drug alone.\n  I should tell you this issue first came to my attention as the former \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee when the VA requested an \nadditional $1.3 billion for that particular drug--$1.3 billion for one \ndrug. This is unacceptable and it has to change.\n  Last year, the pharmaceutical industry--shock of all shocks; I know \nthe American people will be very surprised to hear this--the \npharmaceutical industry spent $250 million on lobbying and campaign \ncontributions, and they employed some 1,400 lobbyists. Well, that is \nwhat you get when you spend one-quarter of a billion dollars and you \nhave 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill. What you get is the ability to \nrip off the American people, to charge our people prices far higher \nthan the people of any other country on Earth pay. And you have the \nthree largest drug companies in this country making $45 billion in \nprofit last year. So that is not a bad investment. Hey, just spread the \nmoney around on Capitol Hill--$250 million--throw in some campaign \ncontributions, and the three largest drug companies make $45 billion in \na year. Meanwhile, all over this country, one out of five Americans \ncannot afford to fill their prescriptions. People die. People become \nsick. State governments spend huge sums of money on these drugs because \nthey are so expensive.\n  The time has come to say loudly and clearly: Yes, the drug companies \nmake a lot of campaign contributions, but maybe, just maybe, Congress \nmight have the radical idea that it is more important for us to \nrepresent our constituents than the people who throw all kinds of money \nat us in Congress.\n  It is unacceptable that total spending on medicine in the United \nStates has gone up by more than 90 percent since 2002. It is \nunacceptable that the monthly cost of cancer drugs has more than \ndoubled over the last 10 years to $9,900 a month. In the United States \nof America, you should not be forced into bankruptcy because you are \ndiagnosed with cancer.\n  It is time--in fact, the time is long overdue--for our country and \nour Congress to join the rest of the industrialized world by \nimplementing prescription drug policies that work for everybody and not \njust the owners in the pharmaceutical industry. That is why I recently \nintroduced legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs in \nAmerica. That legislation is cosponsored by Senator Al Franken of \nMinnesota and was introduced in the House by Congressman Elijah \nCummings.\n\n  Specifically, this is what the bill would do: No. 1, it requires \nMedicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate with the prescription \ndrug companies for better prices--a practice that was banned by the \nBush administration several years ago. No. 2, this bill would allow \nindividuals, pharmacists, and wholesalers to import prescription drugs \nfrom licensed Canadian pharmacies, where drug prices are significantly \nlower than they are in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a comparison of the \nprices of some drugs in the United States with Canada be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 BRAND VS.

I will give a few examples. We have a drug called \nCrestor that deals with high cholesterol. Here in the United States, we \npay $608 for a 90-day supply; in Canada $160--74 percent less in \nCanada. Premarin for estrogen therapy is $324 in the United States and \n$90 in Canada. Nexium is $782 in the United States and $228 in Canada. \nSynthroid is $878 in the United States and $212 in Canada. It is the \nsame product, the same company. It is not generic. These are the same \nexact brand name products. Celebrex--a widely used drug for arthritis--\nis $878 in the United States and $212 in Canada.\n  What this bill would do, in addition to having Medicare negotiate \ndrug prices with the pharmaceutical industry--which would substantially \nlower the prices Medicare pays--this bill would allow individuals, \npharmacists, and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed \nCanadian pharmacies, where drug prices are substantially lower than \nthey are in the United States.\n  I live 100 miles away from the Canadian border. In 1999, I took a \nbusload of Vermonters--mostly women, many of them dealing with breast \ncancer--over the Canadian border into Montreal. As long as I live, I \nwill never forget the looks on their faces when they bought the same \nmedicine they were buying in Vermont, in the U.S.A., for one-tenth of \nthe price--one-tenth of the price. These were working-class women who \nwere struggling with breast cancer and who didn't have a whole lot of \nmoney. They were able to purchase the exact same medicine for 10 \npercent of the price in Montreal. That makes no sense to me, and it \nonly speaks to the power of the pharmaceutical industry over the \nCongress that we have Members here who vote for all kinds of free-trade \nagreements--they just love free trade. We can bring in any product we \nwant from China. We can have lettuce and tomatoes coming in from farms \nin Mexico. But for some strange reason we cannot bring in brand name \ndrugs from Canada. We just can't do it. We can't figure out how to do \nit. And everybody here knows what the reason is--it is the power of the \npharmaceutical industry, their campaign donations, and their lobbying \nefforts.\n  Our bill does a lot more than that. We cannot in good conscience tell \npeople in our States that they must continue to pay outrageously high \nprices for prescription drugs when year after year drug companies make \nbillions of dollars in profit and year after year people in our country \nget sicker and in some cases die because they can't afford the medicine \nthey need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Climate Change and Economic Growth\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, last Friday, China announced its \ndecision to implement a national cap-and-trade program beginning in \n2017. It will cover the majority of China's greenhouse gas emissions, \nincluding those from power generation, iron and steel production, \ncement, chemicals, and manufacturing. In creating the world's largest \nmarket-based program that puts a price on carbon pollution, China is \nshowing that it knows that climate change and economic growth can be \naddressed at the same time.\n  China stepped up on climate finance as well, matching the United \nStates' contribution to the Green Climate Fund. China's announcement \ndirectly counters the arguments made by opponents of climate action \nhere at home. The original idea was that essentially we should wait for \nChina, that our actions would not make a difference without China, or \nworse, that we would be harming our own economic growth while they kept \nburning fossil fuels.\n  That argument, originally--that idea that on the challenge of our \ngeneration we should wait for other countries--was ridiculous on its \nface. After all, the United States must always lead. We are the \nindispensable Nation regardless of what the other countries may or may \nnot be doing. But even if you subscribe to that argument, everything \nchanged last week. The world is taking action around us. We are now at \nrisk of being left behind, both in terms of our energy systems and our \ninternational standing.\n  China's recent announcement to peak its coal use, reduce emissions \nfrom superpollutants, and now its decision to implement a cap-and-trade \nprogram throw the old arguments out the window.\n  Those who oppose climate action have also said that addressing \nclimate change would slow economic growth. Of course, we have known for \nyears that this is not true. Consider the plummeting cost of clean \nenergy or savings at the pump due to higher fuel economy standards, \nboth of which are good for consumers and good for the climate. Now we \nhave further confirmation that countries can reduce emissions without \nsacrificing economic growth.\n  China obviously has no interest in putting the brakes on its growth. \nBy including in its cap-and-trade program many sectors that are vital \nto its future growth, China is showing the United States and the rest \nof the world that it means business. China does not have a monopoly on \nideas to reduce carbon pollution. In fact, most of their good ideas are \nstill coming from us. The Senate has a long history of proposing \nmarket-based solutions to climate change, dating back to the 2003 \nClimate Stewardship Act from Senators McCain and Lieberman.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Whitehouse and I reintroduced our American \nOpportunity Carbon Fee Act. Our bill would impose a price on carbon \npollution and use the revenues to cut a $500 check for all Americans, \nwhile lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 29 \npercent. Economists from across the political spectrum agree this is \ngood policy.\n  Putting a price on carbon in a revenue-neutral way will provide \nnumerous benefits above and beyond the significant cuts in carbon \npollution. It will give companies the policy certainty that they need, \nand it will send a price signal to polluters. By using revenues to \nlower tax rates and provide dividends to every American, we can\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\nstimulate economic growth and protect the most vulnerable among us.\n  Carbon pollution entails costs, but right now taxpayers are footing \nthe bill. By making polluters responsible for the damage they cause and \nreturning all of the revenues to individuals and employers, we will \nsend a signal that innovation in clean energy and other low-carbon \ntechnologies will be the driving force behind the global economy of the \n21st century.\n  The United States should not cede leadership in those sectors to \nChina, Germany or any other country. We always lead. It is what \nAmericans do best. American ingenuity led to some of the most exciting \ndevelopments in the last century--from the airplane and the assembly \nline to the microprocessors and solar cells. With the right policies, \nwe can assure American leadership for the next century as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the distinguished \ncareer of Richard Evans, who has served as a Transportation Security \nAdministration, TSA, aviation compliance inspector, passenger service \nmanager, and county sheriff.\n  Richard Evans has always been a man of sound judgement and \nconviction. He began his law enforcement career at the Orange County \nSheriff's Department in 1964 at the age of 21. As would become \nrecurrent in his career, Richard rose through the ranks for 20 years \nand retired from the sheriff's department as an investigator. During \nRichard's exemplary career, he participated in numerous high-level, \ndangerous undercover cases. The department called upon Richard to \nparticipate in many joint Federal, State, and local task forces. He \nalways answered the call and was willing to go above and beyond.\n  Following his service with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, \nRichard spent 17 years rising through the ranks of the world's largest \nairline fleet, American Airlines. Richard worked at the John Wayne \nAirport in Orange County, the Ontario International Airport, and the \nLos Angeles International Airport. He completed his career with \nAmerican Airlines at McCarran Airport in 2001.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Richard answered the call to \nservice yet again and joined the TSA. He was quickly assigned to the \nlaw enforcement liaison section, where he built upon his 20 year law \nenforcement career and his 17 years with American Airlines. For nearly \ntwo decades, Richard has been the point of contact for all dignitary \nmovements and specialized screening at McCarran Airport. In conjunction \nwith Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials, Richard \nseamlessly ensured the safe and security of dignitaries in one of the \nNation's busiest airports.\n  Official records note thousands of successful escorts, which include \nescorts for the President of the United States, the Vice-President of \nthe United States, and former Presidents. Richard has personally \ncoordinated the movements of Kings, Queens, Prime Ministers, Princes, \nPrincesses, Ambassadors, and senior officials from more than 57 \ndifferent countries. Nearly every Governor in the United States, a vast \nmajority of Executive Branch Cabinet Secretaries, multiple Supreme \nCourt Justices, and countless Members of Congress have experienced \nRichard's unrivaled expertise and without fail everyone agrees: Richard \nis the standard for exceptional service.\n  Richard Evans is a wonderful man and one of the finest public \nservants I have had the pleasure of meeting during my career. His \ntrustworthy, problem-solving nature was always apparent when crises or \nchallenges presented themselves. Dignitaries in the United States and \naround the world were fortunate to have been in his capable care. I \ncommend Richard for his service to this Nation, and I wish him the best \nin his retirement and future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S6999-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6999-S7001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this month, the Senate passed a resolution \nrecognizing Hispanic Heritage Month and celebrating Hispanic Americans \nas dedicated public servants in the highest levels of government. These \ngreat Americans include a Supreme Court Justice, 3 U.S. Senators, 34 \nmembers of the House of Representatives, and 3 members of the \nPresident's Cabinet. I commend the U.S. Senate for passing this \nresolution celebrating Hispanic heritage, but we should be doing much \nmore than approving a resolution. We should be working on a bipartisan \nbasis to pass comprehensive immigration reform, as the Senate did last \nCongress under a Democratic majority. At the same time, the Senate \nshould immediately confirm the several judicial nominees supported by \nthe nonpartisan Hispanic National Bar Association.\n  There are three outstanding Hispanic judicial nominees that are \ncurrently pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar: Luis Felipe \nRestrepo, nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the Third \nCircuit; Armando Bonilla, nominated to a judicial vacancy in the Court \nof Federal Claims; and John Michael Vazquez, nominated to a judicial \nemergency vacancy in the district of New Jersey. A fourth, Dax Lopez, \nhas been nominated to a judicial vacancy in the Northern District of \nGeorgia, and is still awaiting a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  These dedicated public servants are eager to serve, but they have \nbeen blocked by the Republican leadership's virtual shutdown of the \njudicial confirmation process since they took over the majority in \nJanuary. More than 8 months into this new Congress, the Republican \nleadership has allowed just six votes for judges. At this rate, the \nSenate this year will confirm the fewest number of judges in more than \na half century. Luis Felipe Restrepo, Armando Bonilla, John Michael \nVazquez, and Dax Lopez all deserve an up or down vote by this Senate.\n  Judge Restrepo was nominated last year to fill an emergency vacancy \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania. If \nconfirmed, Judge Restrepo would be the first Hispanic judge from \nPennsylvania to ever serve on this appellate court and only the second \nHispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit. He was unanimously \nconfirmed 2 years ago by the Senate to serve as a district court judge. \nDuring his tenure as both a Federal district court judge and as a \nFederal magistrate judge, he has presided over 56 trials that have gone \nto verdict or judgment. He is superbly qualified, and I have heard no \nobjection to his nomination. Despite his outstanding credentials and \nexperience, it took the Republican majority 7 months just to schedule a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee for this qualified nominee.\n  Judge Restrepo has bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania Senators \nand was voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote. \nHe has the strong endorsement of the nonpartisan Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation. At his confirmation hearing in June, Senator Toomey stated \nthat ``there is no question Judge Restrepo is a very well-qualified \ncandidate to serve on the Third Circuit.'' Senator Toomey described \nJudge Restrepo's life story as ``an American dream'' and recounted how \nJudge Restrepo came to the United States from Colombia and rose to the \ntop of his profession by ``virtue of his hard work, his intellect, his \nintegrity.'' I could not agree more.\n  Given his remarkable credentials, wealth of experience, and strong \nbipartisan support, the Senate should have confirmed Judge Restrepo \nmonths ago. Instead, for 10 months since his nomination back in \nNovember 2014, he has been denied a vote on his confirmation. No Senate \nDemocrat opposes a vote on his nomination. He is being denied a \nconfirmation vote by Senate Republican leadership. No one doubts that \nhe\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nwill be confirmed once Majority Leader McConnell schedules his vote. I \nhave heard Senator Toomey indicate his strong support and that he would \nlike to see Judge Restrepo receive a vote, but I have yet to see him \nask for a firm commitment on a vote. The people of Pennsylvania are no \ndoubt wondering when this longstanding and emergency vacancy on their \nappeals court will be filled.\n  Another outstanding public servant is Armando Bonilla, who was first \nnominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims back in May \n2014. If confirmed, Mr. Bonilla would be the first Hispanic judge to \nhold a seat on that court. He is strongly endorsed by the Hispanic \nNational Bar Association. He has spent his entire career, now spanning \nover two decades, as an attorney for the Department of Justice. He was \nhired out of law school into the Department's prestigious Honors \nProgram and has risen to become an associate deputy attorney general in \nthe Department.\n  Armando Bonilla's background is also one that reminds us of the \nAmerican dream. The son of a Cuban immigrant and Cuban American father, \nMr. Bonilla has told the story of his mother's flight from Havana with \nhis aunt and his grandmother. He has told the story of his uncle, ``Tio \nMario,'' who eventually disappeared trying to help other exiles. And he \nhas told the story of his father, who dropped out of high school, but \nserved our country by joining the Marines and took on several jobs to \nsupport Armando and his sister. As Mr. Bonilla has beautifully \ndescribed, his father ``exemplified the most outstanding qualities of \nthe Hispanic culture and Hispanic people: the selfless sacrifice, the \nsteely resolve, and unbridled optimism and the genuine pride in an \nhonest day's work--all toward the cause of improving the lives of the \nnext generation.'' Mr. Bonilla should be confirmed without further \ndelay.\n  The U.S. Court of Federal Claims has been operating with several \nvacancies since February 2013. Only 11 of the 16 seats on the court are \noccupied by active judges. We could have a court working at full \nstrength if we confirmed Mr. Bonilla and the other four nominees \npending on the Senate Executive Calendar. All five of them were \nnominated more than a year ago and have twice been voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. There is no good reason to \ndelay an up-or-down vote for these uncontroversial nominees.\n  John Michael Vazquez was nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in \nthe district of New Jersey in March. He has been a public servant for \nboth the Office of the Attorney General for the State of New Jersey and \nas a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in the District \nof New Jersey. During his tenure in the U.S. attorney's office, Mr. \nVazquez handled a wide array of Federal investigations and prosecutions \nwhile serving in the general crimes unit, the major narcotics unit, the \nterrorism unit, and the securities and health care fraud unit.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nMr. Vazquez ``Well Qualified'' to serve as a district judge, its \nhighest rating. He also has the support of his two home State Senators, \nSenators Menendez and Booker. He was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote. There is no reason why Mr. Vazquez, along with \nJudge Restrepo and Mr. Bonilla, should not be confirmed today. Each of \nthe outstanding Hispanic judicial nominees pending on the floor will be \nconfirmed overwhelmingly if Majority Leader McConnell will simply \nschedule a confirmation vote.\n  Over the past 7 years, the Senate has acted to confirm some \noutstanding Hispanic American judicial nominees. President Obama \nnominated the first Latina to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, as well \nas the first Latino circuit judges in three circuits: Alberto Diaz on \nthe fourth circuit, Adalberto Jordan on the 11th circuit, and Jimmie \nReyna on the Federal Circuit; and has already appointed 35 Hispanic \nAmericans to serve on the Federal bench, more than any other president \nin history. But this record does not mean that the Senate should shut \ndown any further confirmations as some in the majority may desire. The \nSenate has an obligation to vote on judicial nominees in regular order \nand to consider them fairly based on their individual merit.\n  A recent report from The Brookings Institution dated September 18, \n2015, confirms that the Republican obstruction on judicial nominees is \nunprecedented in recent history. It states: ``Senate Republicans' \naggressive slowdown in judicial confirmations so far in 2015 . . . are \ncontrary to the confirmation records in the final two years of the \nother two-term presidencies since 1961--Ronald Reagan, William Clinton, \nand George W. Bush.'' And a recent report by the Alliance for Justice, \ndated September 17, 2015, notes that ``the burgeoning vacancies are the \nresult of playing politics with judicial selection. And the victims are \nthe people and businesses who cannot access courts to seek justice and \nthe judges who must shoulder the burden of increased caseloads and \nfewer resources.''\n  I urge all Senators to read these reports as well as a recent story \nin the Associated Press that highlights the real consequences of Senate \nRepublicans' judicial blockade. The story highlights a case brought by \nLatino migrant farmworkers for wage theft in Federal district court in \neastern California. I ask unanimous consent that the Associated Press \narticle be printed in the Record. The workers have waited more than 3 \nyears to learn whether they can proceed with their claim. As years go \nby, the workers' attorney worries that her clients will have moved and \nbe impossible to reach if and when she is able to recover their stolen \nwages. This is another heartbreaking example that justice delayed is \neffectively justice denied. The Senate, however, can act right now to \nalleviate the considerable backlog of cases in the Eastern District of \nCalifornia by confirming the noncontroversial pending nominee for this \ncourt, Federal Magistrate Judge Dale Drozd. Judge Drozd was voice voted \nout of the Judiciary Committee in June, and there is no reason why we \ncannot vote today on his confirmation.\n  The Republican leadership's virtual shutdown of judicial \nconfirmations has only served to undermine the judicial branch and harm \nthe American people. I urge Senate Republicans to change course and \nlead responsibly. The Senate should immediately turn to the \nconfirmation vote of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo and then schedule \nconfirmation votes for the other 15 judicial nominees, including Mr. \nBonilla and Mr. Vazquez, without further delay.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Associated Press, Sept. 27, 2015]\n\n          Wheels of Justice Slow at Overloaded Federal Courts\n\n                         (By Sudhin Thanawala)\n\n       SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--Attorney Martha Gomez has been waiting \n     more than three years to hear from a federal court whether a \n     group of farm workers in California's Central Valley can \n     proceed with their lawsuit alleging wage theft.\n       The case in California's Eastern District could result in \n     payouts for thousands of migrant workers, but each passing \n     day raises the possibility that they will have moved on and \n     be impossible to track down, Gomez said.\n       ``Everybody is in limbo, and it's hard to explain that,'' \n     she said.\n       Across the country, federal district courts have seen a \n     rise in recent years in the time it takes to get civil cases \n     to trial and resolve felony criminal cases as judges' \n     workloads have increased, according to statistics from the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n       The problem is particularly acute in some federal courts \n     such as California's and Texas's Eastern Districts. Judges \n     there have workloads about twice the national average and say \n     they are struggling to keep up.\n       The result, the judges and attorneys say, is longer wait \n     times in prison for defendants awaiting trial, higher costs \n     for civil lawsuits and delays that can render those suits \n     moot.\n       ``I think it's fair to say that things are quite bad,'' \n     said Matt Menendez, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for \n     Justice at New York University School of Law who has studied \n     judicial caseloads.\n       Legal scholars say Congress needs to fill judicial \n     vacancies more quickly but also increase the number of judges \n     in some districts--both issues that get bogged down in \n     partisan political fights over judicial nominees.\n       California's Eastern District, which covers a large swath \n     of the state that includes Sacramento and Fresno, has had an \n     unfilled judicial vacancy for nearly three years, and it has \n     the same number of judicial positions--six--it had in 1978, \n     according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n       The Judicial Conference of the United States, the national \n     policy-making body for\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\n     the federal courts, has recommended Congress double the \n     number of judicial positions in the district.\n       In the late 1990s, the median time for civil cases to go to \n     trial in the district averaged 2 years and four months. From \n     2009 to 2014, that number jumped by more than a year. The \n     median time to resolve criminal cases nearly doubled to an \n     average of 13 months.\n       ``You're never out from under it,'' said Morrison England, \n     the court's chief judge. ``You're constantly trying to do \n     what you can to get these cases resolved, and we just can't \n     do it.''\n       The weighted caseload per judge has climbed from an average \n     of nearly 600 in the late 1990s to over a 1,000.\n       The Eastern District of Texas has seen similar increases.\n       ``The way one older judge put it to me: 'If you have too \n     many cases, you start to lose the time to think about \n     them,''' said Ron Clark, the court's chief judge.\n       The vacancy in California's Eastern District is in Fresno, \n     which is down to just one full-time district court judge.\n       Attorneys say they are reluctant to file cases in the \n     Fresno court because of delays and have faced additional \n     expenses from having to drive to Sacramento when their case \n     gets assigned to a judge there who has been called in to \n     help.\n       Gomez's April 2012 lawsuit was filed in Fresno and alleges \n     that Castlerock Farming and Transport forced the workers--\n     grape harvesters--to work off the clock and did not provide \n     them with proper rest breaks.\n       Jim Hanlon, an attorney for Castlerock, said he does not \n     comment on pending cases. The company says in court documents \n     it did not directly employ the workers and has already \n     defended their claims in a separate lawsuit.\n       Anthony Raimondo, an attorney for another defendant in the \n     case, said at least some of the time it's taken to resolve \n     the lawsuit can be attributed to its complexity.\n       The case lists multiple defendants and alleged labor code \n     violations and seeks class action status on behalf of as many \n     as several thousand employees. Early on, the judge overseeing \n     the case, Senior U.S. District Judge Anthony Ishii, put it on \n     hold pending a class certification ruling in a related case.\n       But Raimando and Gomez say there have been delays that \n     appear to have no explanation other than a backlogged court. \n     Castlerock, for example, filed a motion to dismiss the \n     lawsuit last September that the judge has yet to rule on.\n       A woman who answered the phone in Ishii's chambers said he \n     would be away until the end of September and unavailable for \n     comment.\n       Lawrence O'Neill, the one full-time district court judge in \n     Fresno, said he could not comment on any pending case. But he \n     said the court's caseload has made it difficult to get trial \n     dates for civil cases.\n       He pointed to two cases on his docket--one alleging \n     excessive force by police and the other race and sex \n     discrimination by an employer--that were filed in 2013, but \n     won't go to trial until 2017.\n       ``We can slow things down because we simply can't work any \n     harder or faster,'' he said. ``But the real important effect \n     of that is people who need our help to move their lives \n     forward are delayed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7001-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PERKINS LOAN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, unless we act quickly, our longest running \nstudent loan program--the Perkins Loan Program--will meet its demise on \nSeptember 30. It will end not because it is ineffective or because it \ndoes not make college more affordable for needy students or because we \nhave debated and built consensus on how best to reform our Federal \nstudent loan programs. Rather, the Perkins Loan Program might end \nbecause some of my colleagues refuse to extend it as we routinely do \nwith other programs awaiting reauthorization. We should not allow this \nto happen. I hope that my colleagues will swiftly approve H.R. 3594, \nthe Higher Education Extension Act, a bipartisan bill to extend the \nPerkins Loan Program that the House of Representatives passed by a \nunanimous vote yesterday.\n  The Perkins Loan Program was created in 1958 as the National Defense \nStudent Loan Program. Approximately 1,500 colleges and universities, \nincluding a dozen in my home State of Rhode Island, disburse more than \n$1.2 billion in Perkins loans to students who have demonstrated \nexceptional financial need.\n  The Perkins Loan Program carries some of the most generous terms of \nall the Federal student loan programs. Perkins loans are offered at a \nlow, fixed rate of 5 percent. No interest accrues until the student \nenters repayment, which starts after a 9-month grace period, giving the \nrecent graduate time to get on his or her feet. The Perkins Loan \nProgram also encourages public service, offering generous loan \nforgiveness for many public sector careers, including for school \nlibrarians, something that I have long championed.\n  Another compelling feature of the Perkins Loan Program is that \nparticipating institutions must contribute their own resources--$1 for \nevery 2 Federal dollars. Many institutions, including colleges and \nuniversities in Rhode Island, have invested more than their legal \nobligation. As students repay their loans, institutions are able to \nmake new loans. In other words, participating colleges and universities \nhave a real stake in students being able to repay their loans, \nsomething that is missing from our other Federal student loan programs \nand something that I have been advocating we need more, not less, of.\n  In Rhode Island during the 2013-2014 school year, over 9,000 students \nattending Rhode Island colleges benefitted from more than $18 million \nin low-cost Perkins loans. Without this assistance, these students \nwould face a gap in their ability to pay for college and could be \nforced into risky private loans or higher cost parent loans.\n  We need to maintain the Perkins Loan Program as we continue working \ntowards a comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. We \ncannot and should not leave needy students and families in the lurch by \ncutting off access to this vital program.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support swift passage of H.R. 3594, \nthe Higher Education Extension Act, to ensure there is no lapse in the \navailability of Perkins loans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7001-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7001-S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the international \nnuclear agreement with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction, JCPOA. Reached on July 14, 2015, after years of difficult \nnegotiations among the United States and the other P5+1 countries--\nChina, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Germany--and Iran, the \nagreement confronts the Iranian nuclear program, which has long been \nthe subject of U.S., European Union, and United Nations sanctions.\n  Throughout these years of international negotiations, and more \nrecently, during these months of congressional debate, I have been \nfocused on one goal--ensuring that our dual-track policy of diplomacy \nand economic sanctions results in an outcome that verifiably prevents \nIran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Iran getting the bomb is simply \nunacceptable, and blocking that is in our national security interests \nand that of our allies, including Israel.\n  This international agreement impacts the safety and security of \nAmericans and our allies and is an incredibly serious matter, deserving \ncareful and considered scrutiny. That includes a thorough and \nresponsible debate in Congress. That is why I voted for the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, P.L. 114-17, which provided \nCongress with a 60-day window to consider the JCPOA prior to its taking \neffect. And that window was filled with vigorous debate in the Senate. \nRegardless of one's position for or against the international \nagreement, one thing is clear: every Senator has had an opportunity to \npass their judgement on whether we are right to choose a path of \ninternational diplomacy to achieve our goal of verifiably preventing \nIran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. In my judgement we are.\n  For me personally, I felt that it was critical to closely review the \ndetails of the agreement and hear from individuals on all sides of this \ndebate, including experts and constituents, and listen to their \narguments. I have attended numerous classified briefings with \nadministration officials, including those with firsthand technical, \nscientific, and diplomatic expertise, heard from the Ambassadors of our \nP5+1 partners, and benefited from many candid conversations with \nWisconsin constituents. All of these interactions have been invaluable \nand have informed my conclusion that rejecting this international \nagreement is not in our national security interest. According to the \nagreement, before receiving relief from sanctions, Iran must comply \nwith a number of far-reaching and long-term obligations to limit its \nnuclear program, all of which will be verified by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, through an unprecedentedly robust \ninspections and monitoring framework. Iran's obligations include \nredesigning the Arak reactor to eliminate the plutonium pathway to \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S7002]]\n\nweapons; eliminating its current stockpile of highly enriched uranium, \nreducing its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 97 percent, \nand capping enrichment at that level for 15 years; reducing the number \nof operational centrifuges by two-thirds and severely limiting research \non advanced enrichment technology; converting the underground Fordow \nfacility to a medical research center; accepting intrusive IAEA \nmonitoring of Iran's nuclear supply chain and fuel cycle; and \nsatisfactorily answering IAEA questions into the possible military \ndimensions of its prior nuclear program. In exchange for verifiably \nmeeting these obligations, Iran will receive relief from U.S. and \ninternational nuclear-related sanctions. And importantly, U.S. \nsanctions against Iran related to human rights violations, support for \nterrorism, and illicit arms shipments remain in effect. Should the \ninternational verification regime catch Iran noncompliant with its \nobligations, the agreement includes a provision allowing the United \nStates to unilaterally reimpose nuclear-related U.N. sanctions.\n  My judgement on this issue has also been guided by the hard lessons \nthat should be learned when America chooses to engage in military \naction and war in the Middle East. It is easy to conclude that a \nrejection of international diplomacy and the JCPOA would shatter the \ncurrent international coalition, making key multilateral sanctions \nimpossible, and would result in Iran restarting its illicit nuclear \nactivities, leading to inevitable military action. Indeed, I have been \nstruck by the inability of opponents of the agreement to put forth a \ncredible alternative that does not involve military action in the \nMiddle East. In this case, it is simply not feasible for the United \nStates to go it alone. So I am proud that America led six countries \ntoward a historic international agreement with Iran that verifiably \nprevents it from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  While the agreement does represent the best option to prevent Iran \nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon, moving forward, Congress and the \nadministration must work together in a bipartisan manner and in concert \nwith our allies to ensure that the agreement is implemented \neffectively. Implementation is critical because this agreement is not \nbuilt on trust of Iran. In fact, the agreement is built on mistrust of \nIranian motives and a clear-eyed view of Iran's past and present \ndestabilizing activities in the region.\n  That is why the JCPOA establishes the most intrusive inspections and \nmonitoring framework in the history of arms control agreements. \nApproximately 150 IAEA inspectors, outfitted with the latest training \nand technology, much of which originates from the cutting-edge work of \nthe U.S. Department of Energy's National Labs, will be onsite in Iran \nand ready to report any suspicious behavior.\n  In addition to this stringent monitoring regime, the very real threat \nof snapback sanctions will work to incentivize Iranian compliance with \nits JCPOA obligations. According to the agreement, in the event of \nIranian cheating, the United States has the ability to unilaterally \nreimpose nuclear-related U.N. sanctions as well as add on to U.S. \nsanctions against Iran beyond those related to human rights violations, \nsupport for terrorism, and illicit arms shipments that remain in place. \nAnd Iran should make no mistake: I, along with my colleagues in the \nSenate, will not hesitate to reapply sanctions should Iran break the \nterms of the JCPOA. In short, if Iran cheats, even along the margins, \nwe will catch them and there will be a heavy price to pay.\n  I am under no illusions regarding Iran's continuing destabilizing \nbehavior in the region and its record during the Iraq war, which \nincludes supporting Shiite militias that killed American \nservicemembers. From human rights violations to support for terrorism \nand criminal client states such as Assad's Syria to its illicit nuclear \nprogram, Iran is a bad actor. That is why it is absolutely critical \nthat the JCPOA move forward and block Iran from developing or acquiring \na nuclear weapon, an unthinkable outcome that would make it an even \ngreater security challenge.\n  At the same time, I support taking immediate, additional steps to \ncounter Iran's non-nuclear activities in the region and bolster the \nsecurity of our Gulf Cooperation Council partners--who support the \nJCPOA--and Israel. From the time of the establishment of the modern \nJewish State in 1948, the United States and Israel have shared a \nspecial bond, grounded in our mutual commitment to democracy, freedom, \nrespect for the rule of law and the quest for a secure and stable \nMiddle East. I have spent more time in Israel than in any foreign \ncountry, and my travel and interactions there have greatly informed my \nunderstanding of the security challenges Israel faces.\n  That is why I have been a longtime supporter of annual U.S. aid to \nIsrael, which is currently set at $3.1 billion per year, as well as \nadditional funding for Israeli missile defense systems such as Iron \nDome, David's Sling, and Arrow, all of which are so valuable in \nprotecting Israeli citizens. I support increasing that level of \nassistance and broadening and deepening our two countries' \ncollaboration in the security and intelligence spheres. The United \nStates and Israel are currently drafting a new 10-year memorandum of \nunderstanding to govern the nature of U.S. military assistance to \nIsrael. This is an opportunity to further strengthen our security \nrelationship with Israel and ensure its qualitative military edge.\n  In conclusion, the United States cannot afford to walk away from an \ninternational agreement that is based on a robust inspections and \ncompliance regime and will verifiably prevent Iran from developing or \nacquiring a nuclear weapon. While there are legitimately held policy \ndifferences on this highly complex issue, going it alone is not an \neffective path forward and not in our national security interest. I \nsupport moving this international agreement forward so we can begin \nenforcing it and preventing Iran from developing or acquiring a nuclear \nweapon. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7002-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        RECOGNIZING THE POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. PETERS.

WILLIAM JEFFERSON TERRY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate and \ncelebrate the life and contributions of Dr. William Jefferson Terry of \nMobile, AL, who was the first pediatric urologist in the State of \nAlabama. He was a nationally known and a well-respected physician.\n  Dr. Terry was born in Mobile, AL where he later returned to begin his \nurology practice. He graduated cum laude from the University of Alabama \nand was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After receiving his M.D. degree \nfrom the University of Alabama School of Medicine, he was an intern and \nresident at the University of Kentucky Medical Center; he then served \nas a resident and chief resident in urology at the University of \nAlabama Medical Center in Birmingham, followed by a fellowship in \npediatric urology at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston.\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\n  His valuable contributions to the medical profession have been \nrecognized by his colleagues. He was honored by the University of \nAlabama Medical Alumni Association with the 2007 Garber Galbraith \nMedical Political Service Award for outstanding service to the medical \nprofession and the 2010 Distinguished Service Award. He was also \nhonored by the University of South Alabama Department of Internal \nMedicine as the 2009 John McGehee Excellence as a Teacher Award. The \nMedical Association of the State of Alabama honored him this year with \nthe Paul W. Burleson Award presented in recognition of a medical career \nthat encompasses not only high ethical and professional standards in \npatient care, but includes extraordinary service to physician \norganizations at the county, State, and national levels. Dr. Terry was \na delegate to the American Medical Association for 20 years, served on \nthe AMA Council on Medical Service, and was chairman of the Alabama \ndelegation to the AMA for 7 years. He was active in many issues \nrelating directly to the patient-physician relationship and the quality \nof care being delivered.\n  In addition to being a remarkable physician, Dr. Terry was a fierce \nadvocate for his patients and the medical community. He worked \ntirelessly and successfully to stop the implementation of ICD-10, which \nhe and the physicians he served believed was not practical and harmful \nto medicine. He carefully questioned the Affordable Care Act and gave \nof himself extensively towards advancing quality health care. He was a \nwonderful friend and adviser to me. As a voice from the real world of \nmedicine, his views impacted my decisions significantly. On a personal \nnote, I knew the quality of his practice firsthand as he provided top \nquality care to my mother. He placed his patients first and was a \ntireless worker.\n  Senator Bill Cassidy, a fellow physician and friend of Dr. Terry, \nrecognized Dr. Terry's commitment to his profession, country, and \nfamily:\n\n       Beyond serving his family and community, Dr. Terry \n     genuinely cared about the future of the medical profession. \n     He made his passion for creating more sensible public policy \n     a priority, even testifying before Congress and moderating a \n     discussion between physicians, the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid, and the Office of the National Coordinator for \n     Health Information Technology. His contributions to the \n     policy making process are absolutely invaluable.\n       I am privileged to say that Dr. Terry was a fellow \n     American, and a colleague as a physician. He was a blessing \n     to many. Remember his widow and children in prayer. We who \n     were blessed look forward to being reunited in heaven.\n\n  Dr. Terry was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather, as well as \na dedicated member of the Dauphin Way United Methodist Church. He was a \nman of God. He dearly loved his family, country, and profession. His \nintegrity and work ethic were second to none. Dr. Terry's life \nrepresented the highest ideals of the serving physician, and he was \nheld in the highest esteem and affection by the many he served. He \nleaves surviving him Elizabeth, his wife of 39 years; his three sons, \nWilliam, Miller, and Gordon; and his four granddaughters, Eleanor, \nSally, Lida, and Eloise.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Terry for his \ndedication and many contributions to the field of medicine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7003-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONWAY, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the town of Conway in New \nHampshire is celebrating its 250th anniversary this year. Months of \nobservances will culminate with a ceremony this Thursday, October 1, \nthe anniversary date of the signing of the town's charter in 1775 by \nColonial Governor Benning Wentworth. Appropriately, this commemoration \nwill be held at Founders Park in Redstone, site of Conway's first \nmeetinghouse and the early settlers' cemetery.\n  Today, the Town of Conway--encompassing the villages of Kearsarge, \nIntervale, Redstone, Conway, North Conway, East Conway, Center Conway, \nand South Conway--is a vibrant and popular tourist destination, often \ndescribed as the gateway to New Hampshire's spectacular White Mountain \nNational Park. But the region's human history goes back many centuries \nprior to the arrival of the first British explorers and settlers.\n  The area was originally home to the Pequawket Native American tribe, \nmembers of the larger Algonquian Abenaki tribe. Along the bountiful \nSaco River, they fished, hunted, and farmed. The initial White explorer \nof the region, Darby Field of Exeter, first encountered members of the \nPequawket tribe in 1642. The Native Americans' dominion over the area \nformally ended on October 1, 1775, when Colonial Governor Wentworth \nchartered 65 men to establish the new town of Conway, named for the \ncommander in chief of the British Army, Henry Seymour Conway.\n  By the mid-1900s, visitors from across America and also Europe \ndiscovered the wild beauty of the White Mountains. Artists came to the \nregion to capture the landscape on canvas, creating what became known \nas the White Mountain School of Art. King Edward VII purchased 12 \npaintings by artists of the White Mountain School to display at Windsor \nCastle.\n  Beginning in 1871, the railroads came to Conway. Trains carried \ntimber and wood products away from the town and brought more and more \ntourists into the town. North Conway was reborn as a booming tourist \ncenter for the region. By the early 20th century, so-called snow trains \nbrought growing numbers of winter sports enthusiasts to Conway. Ski \nresorts began to open, led in 1937 by Cranmore, with its innovative \n``Skimobile'' ski lift.\n  In the 1980s, the coming of scores of factory outlet stores \ntransformed North Conway into a major shopping destination. Combined \nwith a robust outdoor recreation industry, this ensured Conway's \nstanding as a four-season attraction for visitors and was a major boost \nto the economy.\n  From countless visits to Conway, including during my time as Governor \nand Senator, I can testify that its greatest assets are the everyday \npeople of the town and its villages, who are unfailingly gracious and \nfriendly. Conway takes its unique character not only from the stunning \nnatural setting, but also from its stores, cafes, restaurants, and \nB where people know your name, and where the small-business \nowners are right there, every day.\n  Conway's celebration of its first quarter millennium has required \nyears of planning and countless volunteer hours from local citizens. In \nparticular, I salute the tireless organizing efforts of Brian Wiggin \nand Jill Reynolds, co-chairs of the ``Conway Celebrates Legacy'' \ncommittee. I know that, for them, this has been a labor of love. I also \ncongratulate board of selectmen chair, David Weathers, and the town's \nother leaders. Most importantly, I salute the townspeople and families \nof Conway, who warmly welcome many tens of thousands of visitors \nannually from across the United States and always make us proud to be \nGranite Staters.\n  So congratulations to the Town of Conway. I wish everyone a wonderful \ncelebration this Thursday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7003-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7003-S7004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HAYDEN MEATTEY\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I have been a strong supporter of \nSpecial Olympics for many years. It is a truly extraordinary global \nmovement, bringing together more than 4.5 million athletes in 170 \ncountries. This summer, folks in my State have come to admire one \nespecially talented and accomplished Special Olympian, Hayden Meattey \nof Goffstown, NH.\n  Hayden was one of only two Granite Staters selected to compete this \nsummer at the Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles. He returned \nhome to a hero's welcome at Goffstown High School, having won a gold \nmedal in the 800-meter speedwalking event and a bronze in the 800-meter \nevent.\n  Qualifying for the World Games was itself a remarkable achievement \nagainst talented competition. Hayden, a cross-country runner and \nspeedwalker, trained twice a week with his team at Goffstown High \nSchool and independently the rest of the week, constantly pushing to \nexceed his personal best. Nancy Kelleher, coordinator of Team \nUncanoonuc and Hayden's coach for 9 years, praised his work ethic as \nexceptional.\n  His fellow students at Goffstown High packed the school gymnasium for \na rally to wish him luck before he left for Los Angeles. When Hayden \nand his\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\nteammates on Team Uncanoonuc entered the gym, the room erupted in \ncheers and clapping.\n  To say that Hayden is popular at Goffstown High is an understatement. \nAs Principal Frank McBride put it: ``Hayden is just one of those sweet, \nkind human beings who puts a smile on everyone's face. He makes my day \nbetter. I think he does that with most of the people he comes into \ncontact with.''\n  The Special Olympics World Games are a remarkable sporting event. The \naccent is not on the participants' disabilities, but on their \nabilities. The athletes' success is determined by their own hard work, \ntalent, and determination.\n  In truth, Hayden was already a winner before he left for the games. \nHe already had demonstrated grit and determination by joining Team \nUncanoonuc, training like an Olympian, and earning the chance to \ncompete at the highest level with Team USA against athletes from nearly \n170 nations. His gold and bronze medals in Los Angeles only confirmed \nwhat his friends and family already knew, that Hayden is a young man of \nindomitable spirit.\n  Hayden was accompanied to Los Angeles by his very proud mom, dad, \nbrother, and stepdad. I know that folks in Goffstown are also very \nproud of all he has achieved. So am I, and so are folks all across the \nGranite State. On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I thank Haden \nMeattey for representing the United States at the games with a noble \nspirit and a champion's heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7004-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LOWELL PIMLEY\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to honor Director \nLowell Pimley of the Bureau of Reclamation as he retires after more \nthan three decades of public service. The values of hard work and \npracticality that he learned on his family's farm outside Chester, \nMontana, have echoed loudly throughout his 35-year career with the \nBureau of Reclamation. On the occasion of his retirement, I would like \nto thank him, farmer to farmer, for the long hours, the technical \nexpertise, and the uniquely Western perspective he has brought to bear \non this demanding job.\n  Lowell Pimley joined the Bureau of Reclamation in 1980 as a civil \nengineer after graduating from Montana State University with his \nbachelor's and master's degree in Civil Engineering. He applied himself \nto developing, designing, and supporting tunnels, bridges, pipelines, \nand other infrastructure projects. As he gained recognition for his \nengineering skills and his leadership ability, Mr. Pimley rose through \nthe ranks to become the Technical Service Center Director in 2008. \nThere, he led a team of more than 500 engineers, scientists, and \ntechnicians as they assisted in the planning, design, and construction \nof water resource projects.\n  Mr. Pimley came to Washington, DC, to become the Deputy Commissioner \nfor Operations in 2013 and began overseeing all five of Reclamation's \nregions and the Native American and International Affairs Office. In \n2014, Secretary Jewell recognized his talents and appointed Mr. Pimley \nto serve as Acting Commissioner. While serving in Washington, Mr. \nPimley testified before Congress both as the Deputy Commissioner and \nActing Commissioner, representing his agency well and providing \nCongress with his valuable insight.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation has already acknowledged Mr. Pimley's \noutstanding service over his career, including the Meritorious Service \nAward in 2012 and a Distinguished Service Award in 2015 for his \noutstanding leadership, dedication, and accomplishments. He is widely \nrespected by his peers, stakeholders, and folks across the country. To \nthat list of appreciation, I would like to add my own thanks and \ncongratulations on a career dedicated to public service. As he retires, \nhe can be proud of his lasting legacy, ensuring that Reclamation \ncontinues to supply water and power to the farms, towns, and \ncommunities of the West.\n  I again offer Mr. Pimley my warmest congratulations and hope that he \nenjoys a rich and rewarding retirement with his wife, Debbie, and their \nchildren Ashley, Brittany, and Brian, as they head back West to \nLittleton, Colorado, and to the family farm near Chester, \nMontana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7004-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:28 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 136.

Mr. President, I rise today for my 113th ``Time to \nWake Up'' speech on climate change. They say 13 is unlucky. I don't \nknow what 113 is, but I do know what climate change is. It is very \nreal. We shouldn't kid ourselves. And it is an urgent challenge for our \ncountry and our world. Our leading scientific organizations say so. Our \nnational security leaders say so. All of our National Laboratories say \nso. Major American businesses say so. Religious leaders of all faiths \nsay so. Pope Francis certainly said so last week. But the Senate is \njammed by persistent, meretricious climate denial. The denial comes in \nmany guises, but, like a compass, all the denial points in the same \ndirection: whatever helps the fossil fuel industry keep polluting. That \nis the true north of climate denial--whatever helps the fossil fuel \nindustry. Look at the fossil fuel money pouring into the Republican \nParty and tell me this is a coincidence.\n  We have Senators who deny that anything is happening, who say it is a \nhoax. We have Senators who deny that we can solve this. We have \nSenators who deny their faith in the American economy to win if we \ninnovate. We have Senators who simply shrug and say: I am not a \nscientist. A bunch of Senators say: Don't even worry about it; climate \nchange has stopped. The junior Senator from Florida tells us, ``Despite \n17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface \ntemperatures [on] the earth have stabilized.'' The junior Senator from \nTexas proclaims that ``satellite data demonstrate for the last \nseventeen years, there's been zero warming. None whatsoever.''\n  Let's leave aside for a moment the cherry-picked data this conclusion \nis based on, which leaves out the oceans, which cover a mere 70 percent \nof the Earth's surface. I will get back to oceans in a minute. But even \nthis cherry-picked data needs a trick to deny the long-term trend. \nUsing their trick, you could convince yourself climate change has \nstopped six times in the history of this increase from 1970. It is easy \nto do. You pick a spot here and you pick a spot there, and in the \nvariability you make it a flat line and you say: There, you see a \npause. The problem is that these manufactured pauses keep climbing.\n  When this bogus climate pause idea was trotted out in an op-ed in the \nProvidence Journal, my home State paper, PolitiFact quickly determined \nthat it uses ``cherry-picked numbers and leaves out important details \nthat would give a very different impression.''\n  When we look at the linear trend for this whole data set, from 1970 \nto 2013, no one can deny that the Earth is warming. Research shows that \nclimate change is marching on. The past decade was warmer than the one \nbefore that, which was warmer than the one before that. Seventeen of \nthe 18 hottest years in the historical record have occurred in the last \n18 years. NOAA and NASA count 2014 as the hottest year on record, and \nso far 2015 is on track to be even hotter than 2014. Fluctuations do \nnot statistically alter the trend.\n  It is a disservice to the truth and to this Senate to suggest that \nthis heralds the end of climate change. As noted UC Berkeley physics \nprofessor Richard Muller put it, ``When walking up stairs in a tall \nbuilding, it is a mistake to interpret a landing as the end of the \nclimb.''\n  Plus, for what reason would it have stopped? There is no basis for \nthe pause. We know why it is happening. Global warming is caused by \ncarbon pollution. We have known that science since Abraham Lincoln wore \na top hat around this town. That is not news. And our carbon pollution \nsure hasn't stopped. We just broke 400 parts per million of carbon in \nthe atmosphere for the first time in the history of the human species.\n\n  There is no intellectual basis behind the pause theory. These claims \nof a climate change pause have been debunked. Just a couple of weeks \nago, researchers from Stanford University published a study: ``There is \nno hiatus in the increase in the global mean temperature, no \nstatistically significant difference in trends, no stalling of the \nglobal mean temperature, and no change in year-to-year temperature \nincreases.'' In other words, there is no pause.\n  A different study prepared for the U.S. Climate Variability and \nPredictability Program reviewed this so-called pause data and said \nthis: It ``not only failed to establish a trend change with statistical \nsignificance, it failed by a wide margin. [A]ny argument that global \nwarming stopped 18 or 20 years ago is just hogwash,'' said one of that \nreport's authors--just hogwash. When legitimate scientists and \nstatisticians examine the data for global mean temperature, they don't \nfind any so-called pause.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber shows global average temperatures \nsince the late 1800s, which is about the time we began burning fossil \nfuels in the Industrial Revolution. In yet another study out this \nmonth, researchers did a little test. They showed this chart to 25 \neconomists, but instead of temperature they told the economists that \nthe chart showed world agricultural output. That stripped the data of \nany political baggage of climate change. It made this a simple \nstatistical question: Does this chart show that the measured \nphenomenon--climate change, temperature, world agricultural output--\ndoes this chart show whatever the measured phenomenon is stopped in \n1998? The economists looked, and they flatout rejected that conclusion. \nWhat they agreed was that claiming the phenomenon had stopped would be \nmisleading and ill-informed.\n  So why did this pause theory appear that is a mistake, that is \nhogwash, that is based on cherry-picked numbers all toward a conclusion \nthat is misleading and ill-informed? Why? Because the big carbon \npolluters and their allies in Congress don't want us to act. So we keep \ngetting this mischief fed to us.\n  The enterprise that performs that evil task of feeding mischief into \nthis debate is perhaps the biggest and the most complex racket in \nAmerican history. It is phony. They cherry-pick a handful of \nstatistically insignificant data points and tell us the whole problem \nwent away on its own. Then the real scientists take a look at it and \nsay that is bunk. But in the meantime, the polluter enterprise notched \na public relations victory. It bought some time to keep polluting for \nfree, and sadly it got some of our colleagues to be party to it.\n  Telling the American people there is a pause in global warming may \nlull the gullible to sleep, but it is phony, it is inaccurate, and it \nis wrong. It ignores the truth. It ignores the science. Basically what \nit is, is cheesy fossil fuel PR dressed up in a lab coat to look like \nscience, just enough to fool people that little bit.\n  Now let's turn back to the oceans--that 70 percent of the Earth's \nsurface the other data left out. These data show the decades-long \nwarming of the surface oceans--1960 to 2010. No pause. Remember, the \ndeniers conveniently left all this data out when they cherry-picked \ntheir pause data--70 percent of the Earth's surface left out.\n  The first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, decrees that \nall of that heat in the ocean had to come from somewhere. Research \nshows that greenhouse gases trap excess heat in the atmosphere and that \nover 90 percent of that excess heat went into the oceans, was absorbed \nby our oceans. People who insist that the climate has not warmed in \nrecent decades ignore this one little thing--the oceans, which cover 70 \npercent of the surface of the Earth. The oceans don't lie. This warming \nis changing the oceans and our fisheries. Water expands when it warms. \nThat is the law of thermal expansion--unless somebody wants to come and \ndeny that. The seas are rising across the globe. In Rhode Island, we \nmeasure it at the Newport Naval Station tide gauge. Basically it is a \nglorified yardstick. It is not complicated. There is no theory \ninvolved. It is a measurement. It says we are up nearly 10 inches since \nthe 1930s. That may be funny to landlocked States, but when there are \n10 more inches of sea to be thrown against your shores by a big ocean \nstorm, coastal States take that stuff very seriously. NASA measures it \naround the world with satellites; it is not just the coastal stations \nthat take\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\nthese measures. NASA measures from satellites. We measure the exploding \nacidity of the seas. The exploding acidities of the sea are directly \nrelated to CO2 absorption--unless people want to deny \nchemistry. You can put CO2 seawater in a high school lab and \nyou can make the pH change. That is what we are doing on a global \nscale, and we don't get to repeal laws of chemistry around here, no \nmatter how powerful the special interests.\n  Last week, His Holiness Pope Francis called on us to work together to \nprotect our common home. He warned us in his recent encyclical: ``Those \nwho will have to suffer the consequences of what we are trying to hide \nwill not forget this failure of conscience and responsibility.'' But \nfirst we have to want to protect our common home. If what we want to \nprotect is the fossil fuel industry, at all costs, at any cost, we need \na priority adjustment.\n  In our rotten, post-Citizens United, billionaire special interests \npolitics, perhaps the Pope would have had more effect if he had a super \nPac, but it shouldn't take a super Pac for us to heed the Pope's \nwarning or to heed the science or to heed our national security leaders \nor to heed everyone else who has lined up to try to wake us up.\n  Pope Francis also said ``to avert the most serious effects of the \nenvironmental deterioration caused by human activity,'' now is the time \nfor courageous actions and strategies.\n  Today's New York Times has this headline: ``Many Conservative \nRepublicans Believe Climate Change Is a Real Threat.'' Once you get \naway from this building and the pernicious influence of the fossil-fuel \nindustry and its relentless money and threats, it is not a question of \nideology, it is a question of special interest influence, and \nconservative Republicans increasingly understand that this is real. \nEleven of them just broke rank in the House.\n  It is time to come together in good faith to tackle this real and \npersistent threat--the threat of climate change.\n  It is time for us to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/29/senate-section/article/S7009-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
