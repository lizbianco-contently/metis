Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Measures Considered By the Senate\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Senate's passage of the Keystone \njobs bill is great news for the American people. The Senate will soon \nturn its attention to a few different matters.\n  First, we will be voting on a bipartisan measure that has been \nchampioned by the Chairs of the Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services \nCommittees.\n  We lose thousands of our heroes every year to suicide. It is a tragic \nsituation. Senators McCain and Isakson are leading efforts to do \nsomething about it. Their legislation would provide more of the mental \nhealth and suicide prevention support our Veterans deserve. The measure \nalready passed unanimously through the House of Representatives. Now we \nhope for a bipartisan outcome on the Senate floor.\n  The same should also be said of a second piece of legislation we will \nconsider. It is a debate that will challenge our colleagues on the \nother side with a simple proposition. Do they think Presidents of \neither party should have the power to simply ignore laws they don't \nlike? Will our Democratic colleagues work with us to defend key \ndemocratic ideals such as the separation of powers and the rule of law \nor will they stand tall with the idea that partisan exercises of raw \npower are good things?\n  The House-passed bill we will consider would do two things. It would \nfund the Department of Homeland Security and rein in Executive \noverreach.\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\nThat is it. It is simple, and there is no reason for Democrats to block \nit.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we are told that next week we can \nexpect the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which \nfully funds the Department of Homeland Security and includes the law \nenforcement priorities that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis in the \nHouse--and I think will be approved on a bipartisan basis in the \nSenate, hammered out in the Senate Appropriations Committee--will be \ncoming to the Senate.\n  The House of Representatives has therefore voted to fund Homeland \nSecurity in essentially the way the President has asked for and the \nDemocrats and Republicans agreed on. It is not a perfect bill for \neverybody, but we have to do those things. We have to agree and fund \nall the departments and agencies of our government.\n  Yet we now have a statement that our Democratic colleagues are going \nto block the bill. They apparently intend to say Republicans blocked \nthe bill and that somehow Republicans didn't fund Homeland Security. \nThat is the message they are going to try to promote.\n  They are going to say they want a clean bill. What does a clean bill \nmean? Is it a bill that funds the Immigration and Nationality Act as \nwas passed by Congress, some 500 pages? It funds the officers and \nenforcement officials who carry out those duties every day. Does it \nfund those? Yes, it funds those.\n  What is it that people are complaining about then? What is this clean \nbill they want to see?\n  I would suggest it is not a clean bill they want. In reality, they \nwant legislation that will fund action by President Obama that violates \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act, actions that he has taken through \nExecutive amnesty. That is the problem we are dealing with.\n  Apparently they believe the President of the United States, who \ndoesn't agree with the way immigration law is written, the way it has \nbeen carried out for 30, 40 years--he is not happy with that. He asked \nthe Congress to change it.\n  Congress said: No.\n  He said: I am going to do it anyway. Right across the river from \nWashington--I am going to lease a building that houses 1,000 new \nworkers--new workers--and those workers are going to process and give \nout legal status, work permits, Social Security participation, Medicare \nparticipation to 5 million people. People who, according to the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, are unlawfully in the country and are \nnot able to work. Businesses cannot hire somebody who is in the country \nunlawfully.\n  Is there any country in the world that says it is appropriate for a \nbusiness to hire somebody who entered that country unlawfully? What \nkind of logic can support such reasoning?\n  So the President is not an imperial master. He asked Congress and \nCongress said no, but he wants to go ahead and do it.\n  Our Democratic colleagues are now telling us they are not going to \nsupport funding of Homeland Security because Congress--the House of \nRepresentatives bill and the bill I think will have a majority in the \nSenate--will not fund this building, the 1,000 people, and all the \nother activities that will be needed to execute this unlawful, \nunconstitutional Executive amnesty.\n  It is through the looking glass. I mean, what world are we in?\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years. They enforce the law, \nthey don't enforce what some President said he would like to see done \nthat is not lawful. Colleagues, this is so serious that the Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement officials, their association filed a lawsuit, \nand they challenged the actions of their supervisors telling them not \nto enforce plain immigration law. They went to Federal court.\n  Has anybody ever heard of that before? This is the equivalent of the \nFBI for the immigration service. These are first-rate officers. Many of \nthem have been there 20 or 30 years.\n  They say: You are asking us to not enforce the law.\n  They have challenged it in court. I have never heard of anything such \nas that before. The people in charge of enforcing the law having to go \nto court to keep from being told not to enforce the law? It is amazing.\n  This bill will not deny a penny of funding. It will not deny any \nfunding for any program, activity or action that is authorized by law. \nIt does not deny funding for any of those programs that are actually \nauthorized by the laws of the United States. In fact, it says: Spend \nthe money, Mr. President, on enforcing and following the law. You \ncannot spend money unconstitutionally to advocate and create a system \nof law Congress rejected--an unlawful activity.\n  The Congress of the United States is not helpless when it confronts \nthe President. Colleagues, we have to get out from under our desks. Are \nwe afraid to say to the President of the United States we don't agree \nwith this, and we are not going to fund this?\n  Is that the world we are in? Are we hiding under our desks, that the \nPresident may go on television and attack us because we will not agree \nwith his ideas? Surely not, surely not.\n  The Congress has the power to appropriate money. It goes back to the \nhistoric development--before America became a nation--that the \nParliament took over the power of money from the King. Parliament \npassed the laws, not the King.\n  We adopted that and we created a constitutional order, instead of a \nKing, to decide how we operate. The Parliament, and the Congress of the \nUnited States, was empowered to handle the money.\n  What obligation, colleagues, does this Congress of the United States \nhave to give the President of the United States money to undermine the \nlaws of the United States? What power does he have to compel us to do \nso? Zero.\n\n  We should do the right thing. And the right thing is to say: Mr. \nPresident, we are willing to consider a form of immigration law, but we \ndidn't approve of this bill. We didn't support your bill last time and \nwe are not going to pass your bill this time. We are going to continue \nto work to improve immigration law and make it better and serve the \nnational interest of the United States--not special interests, not \nactivist groups and not big businesses, but the average working \nAmerican's interest. That is who we are going to serve in this process.\n  So why are we afraid to push back on that? It is amazing to me. So I \ndon't think we will. In fact, it is sort of remarkable that this is a \nbipartisan position that the President has overreached. I am not going \nto quote the names of Senators. I will be a little bit courteous at \nthis point and just quote some of the statements from all separate \nDemocratic Senators in the last few months when asked about this \nExecutive amnesty by the President. A lot of Senators have never been \nasked. They are probably thankful they weren't asked.\n  This is what one Senator said:\n\n       . . . but the President shouldn't make such a significant \n     policy change on his own.\n\n  Another Democratic Senator:\n\n       . . . but executive orders aren't the way to do it.\n\n  Another Senator:\n\n       I disagree with the President's decision to use executive \n     action to make changes to our immigration system.\n\n  Another Democratic Senator:\n\n       I'm disappointed the President decided to use executive \n     action at this time on this issue, as it could poison any \n     hope of compromise or bipartisanship in the new Senate before \n     it has even started. It's Congress' job to pass legislation \n     and deal with issues of this magnitude.\n\n  Absolutely correct. It is Congress's duty to do this.\n  What about another Democratic Senator:\n\n       I worry that his taking unilateral action could in fact \n     inflame public opinion, change the subject from immigration \n     to the President. I also have constitutional concerns about \n     where prosecutorial discretion ends and unconstitutional \n     authority begins.\n\n  A wise quote, I think.\n  Another Senator:\n\n       I have concerns about executive action . . . This is a job \n     for Congress, and it's time for the House to act.\n\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\n\n  Another Democratic Senator:\n\n       . . . the best way to get a comprehensive solution is to \n     take this through the legislative process.\n\n  So I would say, colleagues, why would any Senator, Democrat or \nRepublican--when the very integrity of the constitutional powers given \nto Congress are eroded in a dramatic way by the President of the United \nStates--not want to assert congressional authority? It is important for \nour constitutional structure, in my view.\n  Well, there we are. We had hearings in the Senate on these issues and \non the new nominee for Attorney General. The new nominee said she \nsupports and will actively work for the policy the President \nestablished. The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer \nin the land. They take an oath to see that the laws of the United \nStates are faithfully executed.\n  I believe strongly in this. I don't think it is a close question. It \nis not a close question, colleagues. The President's actions are \nunlawful. The President's executive actions impose a policy that is \ndetrimental to our ability to ever establish a lawful system of \nimmigration in America. They are against the wishes of the Congress, \nwhich rejected this proposal, and they are overwhelmingly in opposition \nto the views of the American people, as poll after poll has \ndemonstrated.\n  Do the American people have no role in their government? They can't \nexpect their Members of the Senate to vote for legislation that follows \nthe law instead of breaking the law? Aren't they frustrated already \nthat Congress is not following the law, and they are frustrated with \nthe President's failure to follow the law? I think they are.\n  Of course I would like to note that President Obama himself said 20 \ntimes he did not have the power to do this. He said, in May of 2008:\n\n       Congress's job is to pass legislation. The president can \n     veto it or he can sign it . . . I believe in the Constitution \n     and I will obey the Constitution of the United States. We're \n     not going to use signing statements . . .\n\n  Another time he said:\n\n       Ultimately, our nation, like all nations, has the right and \n     obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency \n     and citizenship. And no matter how decent they are, no matter \n     their reasons, the 11 million people who broke these laws \n     should be held accountable.\n\n  October of 2010:\n\n       I can't simply ignore laws that are out there.\n\n  On October 25 of 2010, he said:\n\n       I am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just \n     by myself. We have a system of government that requires the \n     Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen.\n\n  Well, even King George couldn't act contrary to the laws passed by \nParliament. That statement goes on:\n\n       . . . I just want to repeat, I'm president, I'm not king. \n     If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who \n     are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I \n     can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our \n     resources . . . but there's a limit to the discretion that I \n     can show because I'm obliged to execute the law. That's what \n     the Executive Branch means. I can't just make the laws up by \n     myself.\n\n  Well, how true is that? That is absolutely correct. It goes on. There \nare 20 of these. I could continue, but we will be talking about this as \nthe weeks go on.\n  Now, what do scholars say? Do the scholars say that this action is \nlawful and that Congress should fund it and we have an obligation to \nfund it or the President has the right to demand it? Jonathan Turley, \nwho is a Shapiro Professor of Law at George Washington University, a \nnationally recognized constitutional scholar, testified before Congress \nmany times, most often as a Democratic witness, has said he supports \nPresident Obama and voted for him. But he said this:\n\n       I believe the president has exceeded his brief. The \n     president is required to faithfully execute the laws. He's \n     not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same \n     resources to them. But I believe the president has crossed \n     the constitutional line . . .\n\n  He said that again yesterday at the judiciary hearing on the Attorney \nGeneral. He continues:\n\n       This goes to the very heart of what is the Madisonian \n     system. If a president can unilaterally change the meaning of \n     laws in substantial ways or refuse to enforce them, it takes \n     offline that very thing that stabilizes our system. I believe \n     the members will loathe the day that they allow that to \n     happen. This will not be the last president. There will be \n     more presidents who will claim the same authority.\n\n  Well, I think that is pretty significant. Professor Turley is a \nsupporter of President Obama personally, and someone who has been a \nfrequent Democratic witness for Congress.\n  Professor Nicholas Rosenkranz of Georgetown University Law Center, in \nhis testimony yesterday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said--\nand how simple and true is this. It is pretty insightful, frankly:\n\n       Rather than declining to comply with a duly enacted \n     statute--\n\n  The INA.\n\n     the President has decided to comply meticulously--with a bill \n     that never became law.\n\n  What a statement that is. And it is absolutely true. He went on to \nsay:\n\n       Congress has repeatedly considered a statute called the \n     DREAM Act, which would exempt a broad category of aliens from \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act. The President favored \n     this DREAM Act, but Congress repeatedly declined to pass it.\n\n  It is not in the code. It didn't pass. He goes on to say:\n\n       Once again, the President does have broad prosecutorial \n     discretion and broad discretion to husband executive \n     resources. But in this case, it is quite clear that the \n     President is not merely trying to conserve resources. . . . \n     To put the point another way, the President shall ``take Care \n     that the Laws''--capital L--``be faithfully executed''--not \n     those bills which fail to become law. Here, in effect, the \n     President is faithfully executing the DREAM Act, which is not \n     law at all, rather than the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n     which is supreme law of the land. The President cannot enact \n     the DREAM Act unilaterally, and he cannot evade article 1, \n     section 7, by pretending that it passed when it did not.\n\n  How much clearer can you lay it out? This professor is simply telling \nthe truth. There is no other way to look at this, in my opinion. \nCongress is being challenged at its very core by this action, and the \nresult of this challenge will have constitutional ramifications and it \nwill have ramifications as we consider the relative powers of the \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches in the years to come.\n  This is not a little matter, colleagues. It really is an affront to \nconstitutional order. We have a duty no matter what we feel about this \namnesty that goes well beyond DREAM Act amnesty. We have a \nconstitutional duty to defend the integrity of the Congress against an \nencroachment of monumental proportions by the President. That is the \nfundamental issue we will be dealing with when people complain about \nthe funding bill for DHS.\n  David Rivkin, who served two Presidents in the Office of White House \nCounsel, and Elizabeth Price Foley, a constitutional law professor, \nwrote an article recently in the Wall Street Journal. It just hammers \nand devastates the arguments the President is making in favor of his \nexecutive amnesty. They say this:\n\n       By announcing a global policy of nonenforcement against \n     certain categories, Mr. Obama condones unlawful behavior, \n     weakening the law's deterrent impact, and allows lawbreakers \n     to remain without fear of deportation . . . These individuals \n     are no longer deportable although Congress has declared \n     them so.\n\n  They conclude with a statement we need to consider. I believe their \nconcluding statement is accurate. I think it is pretty much \nindisputable. And if it is accurate, then Congress has a duty to stand \nfirm.\n  This is what they conclude:\n\n       The President, after months, finally extracted from the \n     Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice a \n     memorandum that allows basically what he is trying to do. It \n     has been heavily criticized. Legal scholars say it is a poor \n     analysis in a whole lot of ways. In fact, it is unacceptable.\n\n  This is what the authors of this recent opinion piece in the Wall \nStreet Journal said:\n\n       The OLC's memo endorses a view of presidential power that \n     has never been advanced by even the boldest presidential \n     advocates. If this view holds, future presidents can \n     unilaterally gut tax, environmental, labor or securities laws \n     by enforcing only those portions with which they agree. This \n     is a dangerous precedent that cannot be allowed to stand.\n\n  So this is what is at stake. And now we learn that the Democrats \nintend to oppose even going forward to consider the House bill that \nfunds the Department of Homeland Security--and they intend to block \nthat through the filibuster.\n  This is what Senator Barbara Mikulski is reported by Congressional \nQuarterly as saying last night:\n\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\n\n       Senator Mikulski tells CQ that Democrats will block the \n     Senate from proceeding to debate the DHS spending bill over \n     immigration riders.\n\n  Have they made that decision? Surely not. Surely we should move to \nthe bill. If they are unhappy with the language the House put in this, \nthen offer an amendment to take it out. They will have the right to \nhave full amendments, consistent with the rules of the Senate, on this \nlegislation. They can offer amendments to strike the language in the \nHouse that simply says we are not going to fund unlawful Executive \namnesty. It is a pretty stunning thing that we are dealing with and \nthat we will be confronting next week. I believe it is a position that \nis untenable. It is untenable constitutionally, it is untenable \nlawfully, and it is untenable because it is contrary to the will of \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House and Senate who oppose the \nPresident's action. It is untenable politically because overwhelmingly \nthe American people reject it.\n  I am flabbergasted that we are now hearing that Democrats might not \neven allow the bill to come up on the floor. What does that mean?\n  I suppose they will say: Mr. Republican Congress, are you shutting \ndown Homeland Security?\n  Why? I would ask.\n  Well, because you are putting in language that says the President \nshouldn't go off and create and endorse and support and fund changing \nof the law of the United States that Congress hasn't changed, and we \ninsist that you fund his activities and give him the money he needs to \ncarry out this project.\n  Then Congress says: No. We don't want to do that.\n  We oppose it and we won't pass the bill that funds Homeland Security.\n  That is a bad thing to do. The American people won't like it that you \ndon't fund Homeland Security, the Republicans may say.\n  And do you know what our Democratic colleagues will say?\n  No. You shut Homeland Security down because you kept the President \nfrom doing his activity. We are going to accuse you of not funding \nHomeland Security, and we are going to say you placed the Nation at \nrisk. The President is going to accuse you of defunding Homeland \nSecurity, and he is going to accuse you of putting the country at risk. \nAnd the media? Why, they are on our side, and they are going to report \nit that way. When you turn on your television at night, they are going \nto say to the American people that Republicans didn't fund Homeland \nSecurity, and you are going to lose.\n  Look, we are not through the looking glass yet. Give me a break. That \nis not going to sell. The American people are not going to buy that and \nthe press is not going to shill for this kind of story. It is going to \nbe clear who is not funding Homeland Security. It is going to be clear \nwho wants to create a lawful system of immigration and to fund it in an \neffective way and serve the national interests in this fashion.\n  I feel strongly about it. Hopefully this won't happen. Hopefully the \nreport last night is not going to be the position of the Democratic \nParty.\n  I just read of seven or eight of them who said they don't approve of \nthe President's action. Why would they vote not to even go to a bill? \nAnd remember, if the bill comes up and our colleagues don't like this \nlanguage in it, they can move to alter it or strike it. Let's vote on \nit.\n  Sometimes you win in this body; sometimes you lose. We lost many \ntimes--many on the Republican side--in supporting the Keystone \nPipeline. Now we are told the President may veto the bill that has well \nover 60 votes and many Democrats voting for it. Well, is Congress going \nto say ``We are going to ignore that'' and ask the law enforcement \nofficers or the other officers to ignore the President's veto and \npretend the law passed when it didn't pass? Of course not. And neither \ncan the President. We are coequal branches, and the President does not \nhave the authority and the right and the power to enforce a law that \nnever passed to grant amnesty to people who are unlawfully here.\n  It goes beyond prosecutorial discretion. As I said, I was a \nprosecutor for a long time. It is not prosecutorial discretion to give \nsomeone who is unlawfully in the country a work permit, a photo ID--as \nthey intend to do--a Social Security number, the right to participate \nin Social Security, the right to work, to take any job in America. What \njob are they going to take? Who is offering any jobs of any numbers \ntoday in America? Not many. So these individuals who are here \nunlawfully will now be able to go to the trucking company and take a \npretty good trucking job or maybe a forklift operator job or maybe they \nwant to work for the county commission.\n  I asked the Attorney General nominee 2 days ago at a hearing would \nthe Department of Justice sue a business that said: Well, we have job \nopenings, but we are going to hire those people who have green cards or \nwho came here lawfully and have a lawful status, but we are not going \nto hire somebody with temporary Presidential amnesty? Are you going to \nsue them for some sort of violation of rights?\n  She said she didn't know. They might. She basically said they might \nsue them. So this is a real danger.\n  The truth is, colleagues, we don't have enough jobs in America today. \nWe have the lowest percentage of Americans actually working, in the \nworking ages, that we have had since the 1970s. It has dropped steadily \nyear after year. There is no doubt that if you bring more people into \nour country than we have jobs for, it does make it harder.\n  Also, an excess of labor pulls down wages, and things aren't really \ngetting better. Median family wages since 2007 are down $4,000. That is \na stunning amount. Wages in December--last month--in America dropped 5 \ncents an hour.\n  This idea that the economy is on track, everything is wonderful--it \nis not so wonderful for average working Americans. Their wages went \ndown, not up, as we have been told is happening. This is not going to \nhelp. It is going to make that situation worse.\n  Fundamentally, we need a lawful system of immigration that we can be \nproud of, and somebody needs to be concerned first and foremost about \nthe people we represent. We should be concerned about the people who \nhave immigrated here lawfully. Their wages are down also, in some cases \neven more so. In fact, they are often competing most directly against \nunlawful immigrants.\n  I would say this: This is not the right way to do it. We are going to \ncontinue to talk about this. I believe the Congress of the United \nStates, once it is really understood what is happening, will listen to \nthe constituents of America. They will decide first and foremost that \nour duty is to create a lawful system of immigration that is fairly \nendorsed, that we can be proud of, and that serves the interest of the \nAmerican people--the national interest. That is what is being \noverlooked.\n  People are coming from abroad. They want to come to America. We have \nalways had the most generous immigration system in the world, and we \nbelieve in immigration. But they should come lawfully and the Congress \nshould help create a system that supports a lawful entry into America.\n  The council that represents the Customs and Immigration Service \nOfficers just January 22nd of this year issued a strong statement. They \nsaid:\n\n       The dedicated immigration service officers and adjudicators \n     at USCIS are in desperate need of help. The President's \n     executive amnesty order for 5 million illegal immigrants \n     places the mission of USCIS in grave peril.\n\n  Has anybody been listening to them or do they just listen to big \nbusiness? Do they just listen to activist groups? Do they just listen \nto lobbyists, politicians with their political schemes to win \nelections? Is that what they are listening to? They are not listening \nto the officers who are carrying out the duties.\n  Last fall the same group who represents these government workers--Ken \nPalinkas, a very able leader, said this:\n\n       Making matters more dangerous, the Obama administration's \n     executive amnesty, like S. 744 that he unsuccessfully lobbied \n     for, would legalize visa overstays and cause millions \n     additionally to overstay--raising the threat level to America \n     even higher.\n\n  It goes on with many other points.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak. I am very worried \nthat our Democratic colleagues are making a mistake. I think it is the \nright thing in this new Senate with Majority Leader\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\nMcConnell who has allowed more votes in 1 day than the Republicans got \nfrom Senator Reid the entire year last year. We probably doubled the \nnumber of votes this year than we had all of last year.\n  The Democrats are saying, we are not even going to go to this bill \nthat would fund Homeland Security. And if we don't go to it, then \nHomeland Security is not funded. Are they going to block a bill that \nwould fund Homeland Security?\n  Senator McConnell is saying you can have your relevant amendment. If \nyou don't like the language the House put in that says the money can \nonly go to fund lawful activities, then you can vote to take it out and \noffer an amendment to take it out; but if you don't have the votes, you \nlose. That is the way the system should work.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/30/senate-section/article/S671-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   EMPLOYER WELLNESS PROGRAMS: BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND LOWER COSTS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof my remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee hearing yesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Employer Wellness Programs: Better Health Outcomes and Lower Costs\n\n       This morning we are holding a hearing entitled ``Employer \n     Wellness Programs: Better Health Outcomes and Lower Costs.''\n       Ranking Member Murray and I will each have an opening \n     statement, then we will introduce our panel of witnesses. I \n     ask that each of our witnesses limits their testimony to no \n     more than five minutes. We will conclude the hearing at noon.\n       About half of Americans, or 149 million, have health \n     insurance through an employer. One thing we agree upon is \n     that it's a good thing for employers to encourage employees \n     to be healthier. There are a few ways that employers can do \n     this. Offering employees free gym memberships, access to \n     weight loss coaches, and on-site nurses, to name a few. \n     Today, we're going to hear from employers who offer lower \n     cost insurance if their employees lead a healthy lifestyle.\n       Obamacare was not a bipartisan law, but it did include a \n     bipartisan provision to strengthen workplace wellness \n     programs. Former Senator Harkin and I worked together on this \n     during the HELP Committee markup of Obamacare. Before \n     Obamacare, employers relied upon a 2006 regulation which \n     empowered them to discount employee premiums up to 20 \n     percent.\n       Today, employers have certainty of law that they can give \n     their employees up to 30 percent off of their premiums if \n     they make healthy lifestyle choices like maintaining a \n     healthy weight or keeping their cholesterol levels in check. \n     The law also gave the Secretaries of Labor and Health the \n     authority to extend this discount to 50 percent off through \n     regulations. And the Secretaries did just that for tobacco \n     cessation, so companies can also give employees who are \n     smoke-free a 50 percent discount off their premiums.\n       But these discount programs aren't a blank check. By law, \n     employers have to meet several conditions. First, they cannot \n     discriminate. Employers must make these programs available to \n     everyone and must provide a reasonable alternative if an \n     employee cannot complete the standard requirement. Second, \n     they have to be designed to promote health. So, your boss \n     can't offer a reward for a better job performance, but she \n     can do so if you stop smoking. Third, everyone should have a \n     chance to qualify at least once a year.\n       To get started, employees might simply fill out a \n     questionnaire about themselves and their family's medical \n     history, or undergo a basic health screening to take their \n     weight, temperature, blood pressure, as well as a finger \n     prick test for cholesterol or diabetes. This information \n     provides employees a baseline from which to work with a \n     medical professional to improve.\n       Today, we will seek to answer several questions. First, how \n     well are these programs working? A 2014 study conducted for \n     Interactive Health found 85% of 15,550 people surveyed either \n     improved or maintained their level of health risk and \n     companies' health care costs rose 6% more slowly. A September \n     2014 survey by the benefits consulting firm of Towers Watson \n     & Co. found that 18% of employers already use outcomes-based \n     wellness incentives and 48% plan to add one by 2017.\n       Next, we want to explore if any of these programs need to \n     be changed. There are a number of laws and regulations on the \n     books governing wellness programs, but do employers have all \n     the tools they need?\n       And we want to hear how a disturbing turn of events may \n     affect these programs. Specifically, the action the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is taking against \n     companies like Honeywell for encouraging employees to lead a \n     healthier lifestyle. I'm concerned the government is \n     encouraging workplace wellness on one hand, and discouraging \n     it on the other.\n       There is a great deal of evidence that tells us these \n     programs can make employees healthier and happier at work, \n     and for the investment employers make, they can see lower \n     health care costs.\n       Honeywell has a wellness program that is reportedly \n     compliant with Obamacare, provides for reasonable alternative \n     accommodations, and protects patient privacy. And, it's \n     working to improve employee health. 61 percent of Honeywell \n     employees identified with more than one health risk factor \n     eliminated at least one of those risk factors; and 46 percent \n     eliminated all of their risk factors.\n       What's wrong with that? Well, the EEOC seemingly believes \n     employers should not reward employees who make healthy \n     lifestyle choices with lower premiums. And in October last \n     year, the general counsel sued to stop Honeywell from doing \n     just that.\n       Even the White House has expressed concern regarding the \n     EEOC's actions. In December, when asked about the president's \n     thoughts on the EEOC wellness lawsuits, White House Press \n     Secretary Josh Earnest said the administration is concerned \n     EEOC's actions are, or could be, ``inconsistent with what we \n     know about wellness programs and the fact that we know that \n     wellness programs are good for both employers and \n     employees.''\n       Congress was clear in the health care law. The \n     administration was clear in the regulations. And the White \n     House has again reiterated its support for these programs. \n     But apparently that is not clear enough for the EEOC. The \n     EEOC is sending a confusing message to employers--reliance on \n     Obamacare's authorization of wellness programs does not mean \n     you won't be sued.\n       So, I'm working on legislation to provide employers and \n     employees even more clarity and certainty to continue to \n     offer these voluntary wellness programs and encourage healthy \n     lifestyle choices. Innovation and healthy choices should be \n     applauded, not punished.\n       Workplace wellness programs give individuals some control \n     over rising health care costs. Instead of watching \n     powerlessly as more money comes out of their paychecks each \n     month to cover rising health insurance premiums--wellness \n     programs give individuals the ability to regain some control \n     over those costs.\n       I admit that this represents a big shift in how we think \n     about the workplace in relation to our health. There has been \n     a sea change in how we talk about health at work. I remember \n     well the smoke in the hallways of the Nixon White House. That \n     was true in most workplaces then. These days, about the only \n     workplace you can smoke is the Speaker's office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/30/senate-section/article/S671-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S671-S672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CHIP KENNETT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Bayard \nWinslow ``Chip'' Kennett II, a native of Conway, N.H., who passed away \non January 17 at the age of 34.\n  Growing up in the Mount Washington Valley, Chip was a fantastic \nstudent-athlete and natural leader. At A. Crosby Kennett High School, \none of two schools in Conway which bears his family name, Chip \nquarterbacked the Kennett High School football team and was honored \nwith the Jack Burns Memorial Award for leadership, dedication and \nloyalty to his teammates on the Kennett High baseball team. His \nparents, Bayard and Theresa, instilled in Chip a love for the region \nand its people, and Chip spent his summers volunteering and working at \nConway's community recreation center.\n  Chip would later go on to a career in public service that spanned \nclose to a decade, rising from a college internship with then-New \nHampshire Representative John Sununu to a position in Senator Judd \nGregg's office, after which he returned to work for John Sununu upon \nhis election to the Senate. Before leaving Capitol Hill to join \nRaytheon's government affairs practice, Chip most recently worked for \nMaine Senator Susan Collins as her military legislative assistant and \ndirector of appropriations. During his time in Washington, Chip was \nactive in the New Hampshire State Society, helping to raise funds for \nNew Hampshire students hoping to intern in the Nation's capital as he \nhad during college. All those who knew him in the Senate recall his \nupbeat and caring nature, both qualities that buoyed him and his family \nthrough the difficulties of the past 2 years.\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\n  In October 2012, Chip's wife Sheila was 35 weeks pregnant when he was \ndiagnosed with stage IV advanced lung cancer. As he learned more about \nhis diagnosis, Chip, who was not a smoker, was struck by the lack of \nprogress in improving the survival rate for this deadly cancer which, \ncontrary to popular perception, annually affects more non-smokers than \nsmokers. During his own treatment, Chip became an advocate for lung \ncancer and worked exceptionally hard to increase awareness of the \ndisease and to end the negative stigma of a lung cancer diagnosis. He \ngave his time and legislative expertise to LUNGevity, a lung cancer-\nfocused nonprofit, to help fight for much-needed lung cancer research, \neducation and support. His efforts culminated in an invitation to \ntestify on Capitol Hill regarding the need to expedite trials for \nbreakthrough drugs to treat life-threatening diseases like lung cancer. \nThroughout his own battle with the disease, Chip held out hope that one \nday we could all celebrate a cure for cancer.\n  Chip truly embodied the spirit of public service, especially in his \nremaining days when he served as a voice for others. I know I speak for \nall in the Senate when I say thank you, Chip, for providing an example \nof what it means to be a great father, son, husband, friend and \nAmerican.\n  Chip is survived by his 5-year-old son Bayard ``Joe'' Kennett II, his \n2-year-old daughter Crosby Reynolds and his wife Sheila whom he met \nwhile they were both serving as staff members in the Senate; his mother \nand father, Bayard and Theresa Kennett of Conway, N.H., as well as his \nbrother and sister-in-law Tanner and Sarah Kennett of North Conway, \nN.H.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join me in honoring the life and service of Chip Kennett.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I wish to recognize the extraordinary \nlife of my friend Chip Kennett, who passed away on January 17 after a \ncourageous 2-year battle against cancer.\n  Bayard Winslow ``Chip'' Kennett II was born and raised in Conway, and \nhe was a proud New Hampshire native son. The Kennetts are pillars of \nthe Conway community whose roots in the Mount Washington Valley go back \ngenerations, and I have been fortunate to know Chip's family and to \nwitness their countless contributions to business and civic life in New \nHampshire.\n  Chip carried on his family's tradition of public service when he \nfirst came to Capitol Hill to serve his home State of New Hampshire. He \nserved as a congressional staffer for nearly 8 years--first as a \nlegislative correspondent to my predecessor Senator Judd Gregg and \nlater as a policy aide for former Senator John E. Sununu. More \nrecently, he was a senior aide to my colleague from Maine, Senator \nSusan Collins. When I first came to the Senate in 2011 and did not yet \nhave a full legislative staff in place, Chip generously offered his \ncounsel on national security and defense issues, for which I was very \ngrateful.\n  While working for Senator Gregg, Chip met the love of his life, \nSheila, who would become his wife.\n  In October 2012, Chip--seemingly healthy and active at the age of \n31--was diagnosed with Stage IV nonsmoker's lung cancer. There was no \ncure. In the face of an unimaginable prognosis, Chip understood better \nthan most that life is a gift, and he inspired us all with his \ndetermination to live his life to the fullest--making the most of the \ntime he had with his wife Sheila and their two young children, Joe and \nCrosby. Together, they found joy and meaning in simply being together \nduring everyday, ordinary moments--resolving to be ``present and \ngrateful.'' From family dinners to rooting for his favorite football \nteam on ``Patriots Football Sunday'', Chip savored the blessings of \nfamily and friendship.\n  True to his compassionate nature, he turned his diagnosis into a \ncause for good--becoming a counselor to others battling cancer, raising \npublic awareness of the disease and the need to reduce the stigma \nassociated with lung cancer. The blog that Chip and Sheila started \nprovided a ``Playbook for Living'' that served as a source of \ninspiration and encouragement to others who were fighting similar \nbattles with cancer. Chip also put his Capitol Hill experience to work \nas an advocate for lung cancer research, and his efforts are credited \nwith helping spur changes in Medicare coverage for lung cancer \ntreatments--a legacy that will continue to touch many lives.\n  Chip summed up his approach to living with cancer at a hearing last \nMay before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, where he testified \nthat ``thanks to medical breakthroughs, I have been able to experience \nmany quality filled days. We have enjoyed spending holidays with \nfriends and family. I have been able to continue working full time. As \na family, we have sat down at the dinner table together, have attended \ninnumerable swim lessons, soccer and tee ball practices for my son on \nSaturday mornings, and have sat in a church pew together on Sunday \nmornings. In other words, we have stayed busy--busy LIVING with \ncancer.''\n  Chip's strong network of family and close friends was extremely \nimportant to him. He was always happiest being around the people he \nloved. After his diagnosis, his family, friends, coworkers, and former \nHill colleagues--affectionately known as Team Kennett--mobilized to not \nonly support Chip and his family but also to support their efforts to \naid others fighting cancer.\n  The courage and strength with which Chip and his family faced his \nillness is an inspiration to us all. Perhaps Chip's greatest legacy is \nthe valuable lesson he taught us all about how to live fully in each \nmoment.\n  Chip was a wonderful, smart, and fun-loving man, and he had a big \nheart. It was a joy to know him and to call him a friend, and his loss \nis simply heartbreaking.\n  My heart and thoughts are with all of Team Kennett, including Sheila, \nJoe, and Crosby; as well as Chip's parents Bayard and Theresa Kennett \nof Conway; and his brother and sister-in-law Tanner and Sarah Kennett \nof North Conway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/30/senate-section/article/S672-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S672-S673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING BILLY'S BOUDIN & CRACKLIN\n\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, many of our Nation's small \nbusinesses are well-regarded for their ability to truly showcase the \nlocal culture, food, and heritage. Small businesses have a unique \nperspective and opportunity to take advantage of local recipes, \ningredients, and flavor profiles that allow them to provide regional \nfavorites for residents and tourists. Without a doubt, one of the most \nremarkable aspects of Louisiana is our delicious, extraordinary \ncuisine. This week, I would like to recognize this truly special piece \nof Louisiana culture by honoring Billy's Boudin & Cracklin of Krotz \nSprings, LA, as the Small Business of the Week.\n  South Louisiana has created its own genre of Louisiana cooking. With \ntraditions and recipes handed down through the generations, the charm \nand flavor of Acadiana is undeniable. Billy's Boudin & Cracklin was \noriginally founded in 1995 as a convenience store. It was not long, \nhowever, before Billy Frey and his father-in-law decided they needed to \nincorporate something in their store to set them apart from the \ncompetition. The brilliant addition of a family boudin recipe bolstered \nthe success of their store to what we know today. Two short years \nlater, Billy expanded their thriving business to the nearby city of \nOpelousas and purchased a popular local grocery store, Ray's, to \nestablish Billy and Ray's Boudin. Maintaining the local charm, the \nFrey's purchased Ray's secret boudin recipe and added it right onto the \nnew store's menu.\n  Recently, the business expanded once again to the ``Boudin Capitol of \nthe World'' in Scott, LA. What started out as a small convenient store \nhas turned into a regional favorite, with over 3,000 pounds of boudin \nmade daily between the three stores. In addition to the original boudin \nlinks, Billy's offers boudin in the form of balls, pistollettes, \nrollups, and sandwiches. They also have shipping options so nonlocals \ncan enjoy authentic Cajun boudin and cracklins from across the country. \nThe Boudin Balls have become a signature of the business, with around \n1.7 million of the regular and pepperjack-filled balls sold yearly. The \nfamous boudin recipe is so coveted that\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\nonly a select few people are in the know. In fact, this is taken so \nseriously that each member of the staff must sign confidentiality \nagreements before learning the family secret.\n  After 20 years of thriving business in the area, it is no surprise \nthat the Lafayette Daily Advertiser awarded Billy's Boudin & Cracklin \nas one of the ``Best Boudin'' places in their annual ``Best of \nAcadiana'' contest last year. It is great to see small businesses like \nthis share our State's rich traditions with both Louisianians and \nnonlocals. Congratulations again to Billy's Boudin & Cracklin for being \nhonored as this week's Small Business of the Week. I look forward to \ntrying their delicious boudin soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/30/senate-section/article/S673-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Nelson):\n       S. 324.

Res. 59\n\n       Whereas 1 in 6, or 19,200,000, women in the United States \n     have at some point during their lifetime experienced stalking \n     victimization, during which they felt very fearful or \n     believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed \n     or killed;\n       Whereas, during a 1-year period, an estimated 3,400,000 \n     persons in the United States reported that they had been \n     victims of stalking, and 75 percent of those victims reported \n     that they had been stalked by someone they knew;\n       Whereas 11 percent of victims reported having been stalked \n     for more than 5 years, and 23 percent of victims reported \n     having been stalked almost every day;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 victims reported that stalkers had used \n     email, instant messaging, blogs, bulletin boards, Internet \n     sites, chat rooms, or other forms of electronic monitoring \n     against them, and 1 in 13 victims reported that stalkers had \n     used electronic devices to monitor them;\n       Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic \n     measures to protect themselves, including changing identity, \n     relocating, changing jobs, and obtaining protection orders;\n       Whereas 1 in 7 victims reported having relocated in an \n     effort to escape a stalker;\n       Whereas approximately 1 in 8 employed victims of stalking \n     missed work because they feared for their safety or were \n     taking steps to protect themselves, such as by seeking a \n     restraining order;\n       Whereas less than 50 percent of victims reported stalking \n     to police, and only 7 percent of victims contacted a victim \n     service provider, shelter, or hotline;\n       Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the \n     laws of all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     territories of the United States;\n       Whereas stalking affects victims of every race, age, \n     culture, gender, sexual orientation, physical and mental \n     ability, and economic status;\n       Whereas national organizations, local victim service \n     organizations, campuses, prosecutor's offices, and police \n     departments stand ready to assist stalking victims and are \n     working diligently to develop effective and innovative \n     responses to stalking;\n       Whereas there is a need to improve the response of the \n     criminal justice system to stalking through more aggressive \n     investigation and prosecution;\n       Whereas there is a need for increased availability of \n     victim services across the United States, and such services \n     must include programs tailored to meet the needs of stalking \n     victims;\n       Whereas persons aged 18 to 24 experience the highest rates \n     of stalking victimization, and rates of stalking among \n     college students exceed the prevalence rates found in the \n     general population;\n       Whereas as many as 75 percent of women in college who \n     experience stalking-related behavior experience other forms \n     of victimization, including sexual or physical victimization, \n     or both;\n       Whereas there is a need for effective responses to stalking \n     on campuses; and\n       Whereas the Senate finds that ``National Stalking Awareness \n     Month'' provides an opportunity to educate the people of the \n     United States about stalking: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates January 2015 as ``National Stalking \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) applauds the efforts of the many stalking victim \n     service providers, police, prosecutors, national and \n     community organizations, campuses, and private sector \n     supporters to promote awareness of stalking;\n       (3) encourages policymakers, criminal justice officials, \n     victim service and human service agencies, college campuses \n     and universities, and nonprofit organizations to increase \n     awareness of stalking and the availability of services for \n     stalking victims; and\n       (4) urges national and community organizations, businesses \n     in the private sector, and the media to promote awareness of \n     the crime of stalking through ``National Stalking Awareness \n     Month''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/30/senate-section/article/S673-5", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S673-S674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 60--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF OBSERVING THE \n   NATIONAL SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH FROM JANUARY 1 \n  THROUGH FEBRUARY 1, 2015, TO RAISE AWARENESS OF, AND OPPOSITION TO, \n                             MODERN SLAVERY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Toomey, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Coons, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Shaheen, \nMrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. King, Mr. Markey, Mr. \nIsakson, and Mr. Rubio) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 60\n\n       Whereas the United States has a tradition of advancing \n     fundamental human rights,\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n     having abolished the Transatlantic Slave Trade in 1808 and \n     having abolished chattel slavery and prohibited involuntary \n     servitude in 1865;\n       Whereas because the people of the United States remain \n     committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a \n     national imperative to eliminate human trafficking, which is \n     the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or \n     obtaining of persons for labor or services through the use of \n     force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to \n     involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery, and \n     the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud, or \n     coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act \n     has not attained 18 years of age;\n       Whereas to combat human trafficking in the United States \n     and globally, the people of the United States, the Federal \n     Government, and State and local governments must be aware of \n     the realities of human trafficking and must be dedicated to \n     stopping this contemporary manifestation of slavery;\n       Whereas human trafficking is estimated to be a \n     $32,000,000,000 criminal enterprise, making it the second \n     largest criminal enterprise in the world, behind the drug \n     trade;\n       Whereas the United Nations estimates that nearly 21,000,000 \n     people around the world are victims of forced labor, \n     including 4,500,000 people who are victims of forced sexual \n     exploitation;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice estimates that up to 83 \n     percent of sex trafficking victims in the United States are \n     citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas beyond all differences of race, creed, or political \n     persuasion, the people of the United States face national \n     threats together and refuse to let modern slavery exist in \n     the United States and around the world;\n       Whereas the United States should actively oppose all \n     individuals, groups, organizations, and nations that support, \n     advance, or commit acts of human trafficking;\n       Whereas through education, the United States must also work \n     to end slavery in all of its forms around the world;\n       Whereas victims of modern slavery need support in order to \n     escape and recover from the physical, mental, emotional, and \n     spiritual trauma associated with their victimization;\n       Whereas human traffickers use many physical and \n     psychological techniques to control their victims, including \n     the use of violence or threats of violence against the victim \n     or the victim's family, isolation from the public, isolation \n     from the victim's family and religious or ethnic communities, \n     language and cultural barriers, shame, control of the \n     victim's possessions, confiscation of passports and other \n     identification documents, and threats of arrest, deportation, \n     or imprisonment if the victim attempts to reach out for \n     assistance or to leave;\n       Whereas although laws to prosecute perpetrators of modern \n     slavery and to assist and protect victims of human \n     trafficking, such as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \n     of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) and title XII of the \n     Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public \n     Law 113-4; 127 Stat. 54), have been enacted in the United \n     States, awareness of the issues surrounding slavery and \n     trafficking by those people most likely to come into contact \n     with victims is essential for effective enforcement because \n     the techniques that traffickers use to keep their victims \n     enslaved severely limit self-reporting;\n       Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date \n     of the Emancipation Proclamation;\n       Whereas February 1 is the anniversary of the date on which \n     President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending \n     the 13th Amendment to the States for ratification, to forever \n     declare that ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude . . \n     . shall exist within the United States, or any place subject \n     to their jurisdiction'' and is a date which has long been \n     celebrated as National Freedom Day, as described in section \n     124 of title 36, United States Code;\n       Whereas under its authority to enforce the 13th Amendment \n     ``by appropriate legislation'', Congress in the Trafficking \n     Victims Protection Act of 2000 updated the post-Civil War \n     involuntary servitude and slavery statutes and adopted an \n     approach known as the ``3P'' approach of victim protection, \n     vigorous prosecution, and prevention of human trafficking; \n     and\n       Whereas the effort by individuals, businesses, \n     organizations, and governing bodies to commemorate January 11 \n     as Human Trafficking Awareness Day represents one of the many \n     positive examples of the commitment in the United States to \n     raise awareness of, and to actively oppose, modern slavery: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports--\n       (1) the goals and ideals of observing the National Slavery \n     and Trafficking Prevention Month from January 1 through \n     February 1, 2015, to recognize the vital role that the people \n     of the United States have in ending modern slavery;\n       (2) marking this observance with appropriate programs and \n     activities culminating in the observance on February 1 of \n     National Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of title \n     36, United States Code;

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 60, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 60) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of observing the National Slavery and Trafficking Prevention \n     Month from January 1 through February 1, 2015, to raise \n     awareness of, and opposition to, modern slavery.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I have submitted a resolution \nwith Senator Kirk recognizing January as National Slavery and \nTrafficking Prevention Month. We are pleased to be joined by Senators \nLeahy, Toomey, Klobuchar, Coons, Rubio, Murray, Wyden, Brown, Shaheen, \nGillibrand, Kaine, Heitkamp, King, and Markey in sponsoring this \nresolution.\n  January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date of the \nEmancipation Proclamation, and February 1 is the anniversary of the \ndate that President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending \nthe Thirteenth Amendment--which abolished slavery--to the States for \nratification.\n  In 2009, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution I introduced to \nestablish January as Human Trafficking Awareness Month. That resolution \nwas made to raise awareness of, and opposition to, the human \ntrafficking. It is important that we continue to bring attention to and \nraise awareness of this horrific practice.\n  Human trafficking is a crime in which persons are forced to work \nagainst their will in sweatshops, prostitution rings, farms, private \nhomes, and other enterprises. The traffickers use force, threats of \nforce, and coercion to ensure that their victims believe they have no \nother choice but to work for their captors. Frequently, human \ntrafficking goes undetected because the victims are not only afraid of \ntheir traffickers, but they have been taught by their traffickers to \nfear law enforcement.\n  Human trafficking is estimated to be a $32 billion criminal \nenterprise, making it the second largest criminal industry in the \nworld, behind the drug trade. A 2014 Urban Institute study found that \npimps in Atlanta can make nearly $33,000 in just one week, which \namounts to over $1.7 million a year. The overwhelming majority of sex \ntrafficking victims in the United States are American citizens--83 \npercent by one estimate from the Department of Justice.\n  Unfortunately, children are often victims of this horrendous crime. \nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has reported \nthat one in seven endangered runaways are victims of sex trafficking.\n  Many of these children continue to be exploited into adulthood. A \nstudy of women and girls involved in street prostitution in my hometown \nof San Francisco found that 82 percent had been physically assaulted, \n83 percent were threatened with a weapon, and 68 percent were raped.\n  Unfortunately, such abuse is common around the world. According to \nthe United Nations, there are nearly 21 million people currently \nserving in some form of involuntary servitude. The United Nations also \nreported that in 16 percent of the 138 countries studied, there was not \none trafficking-related conviction between 2007 and 2010.\n  Over the past decade, Congress has taken action to enhance the tools \navailable to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking and to assist \nand protect trafficking victims. We passed the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act of 2000 and, 8 years later, passed the William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. These \nlaws strengthened Federal efforts to combat international and domestic \nhuman trafficking by expanding administrative subpoena authority, \nincreasing penalties for traffickers, and authorizing the Justice \nDepartment to seek preventive detention of those charged with \ntrafficking offenses.\n  Despite these important laws, further action is needed. Earlier this \nyear, Senator Portman and I introduced the Combat Human Trafficking Act \nof 2015. This bill would reduce the demand for human trafficking, \nparticularly the commercial sexual exploitation of children, by holding \nbuyers accountable and making it easier for law enforcement to \ninvestigate and prosecute all persons who participate in sex \ntrafficking.\n  In addition, I am pleased to join Senator Kirk in introducing the \nStop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act or the SAVE Act. This bill \nwould strike at child sex trafficking where it is increasingly \noccurring--the Internet--by prohibiting Internet companies from \nprofiting from allowing their websites to be used to traffic children.\n  We must act with urgency to end the practice of human trafficking. \nFor every day we wait, more lives are damaged by this horrible \npractice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in observing National Slavery and \nTrafficking Prevention Month to draw attention to human trafficking and \nto renew our collective efforts to eliminate this practice in the \nUnited States and around the world.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 60) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/30/senate-section/article/S675-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
