Mr. President, yesterday marked the 100th anniversary of a \nheinous and violent event that has tragically changed the world. On \nApril 21, 1915, near the beginning of World War I, the German Army \nintroduced to the world large-scale chemical weapons. That gas swept \nthe battlefield. People died and suffered enduring pain, and those who \nsurvived, with rare exception, suffered the rest of their lives.\n  The Kaiser's army released tons of chlorine gas, nearly devastating \nthe Allied line in Belgium. Europe would never be the same. The world \nwould never be the same.\n  The use of poisonous gas proliferated during World War I, bringing \ndeath and devastation to members of the military and civilians. \nFollowing World War I, nations joined to support the Geneva Protocol of \n1925, declaring that chemical weapons were so barbaric, so evil that \nthey should be prohibited from use.\n  The use of chemical weapons has continued. The world will never \nforget the atrocities perpetrated by Hitler during World War II, as \nNazi Germany used chemicals in the genocide of millions of Jews. During \nthe Nazi regime, at the beginning of it, five men--one name started \nwith S, one started with A, one started with R, I, and N--invented \nsarin gas. The world will not forget the atrocities perpetrated by the \nHitler regime during World War II as Nazi Germany used chemicals in the \ngenocide of millions--millions--of Jews.\n  The Iraq-Iran war of the 1980s was another terrible instance of \nlethal gasses being deployed as a tool of warfare. In 1988, Saddam \nHussein unleashed a chemical arsenal on his own people, killing \nthousands of Kurds. Those pictures are available to see. The people are \nindiscriminately lying there--old men, old women, middle aged people, \nand babies. The world witnessed these events in horror and decided \ninternational action was absolutely necessary again. In 1992, the \nChemical Weapons Convention was adopted in Geneva. The Chemical Weapons \nConvention outlaws the production, stockpile, and use of chemical \nweapons and requires their destruction. I voted for that ratification \nwith pleasure. I voted for ratification--which was ratified here in the \nSenate--of the convention to do something more about these chemical \nweapons.\n  But in spite of other efforts, the use of chemical weapons endures. \nOne hundred years have passed since that fateful date in Belgium, and \nthe world has yet to end the evil of those poisons. Today, Bashar al-\nAssad and his regime and forces loyal to him in Syria are responsible \nfor horrific violence that violates basic decency. It violates \ninternational laws of war and has shocked the global conscience.\n  It is no secret that Assad has repeatedly used chemical weapons \nagainst the Syrian people and the country over which he dictates. Even \nafter Syria was compelled to accede to the convention--the Chemical \nWeapons Convention in 2013--there is clear evidence that Assad has \ncontinued to reign terror over his own people by using barrel bombs \nfilled with chlorine to indiscriminately wreak havoc.\n  We are reminded of this all the time. I do not usually watch ``60 \nMinutes.'' It is a good program, but I usually have other things to do. \nBut I watched because of the promotion on Sunday evening about \nsomething they were going to do on ``60 Minutes.'' They had graphic \npictures that had never been shown before of what this evil person who \nruns this country of Syria did to his own people.\n  Sadly, in addition to the use of chemical weapons, the Assad regime \nhas carried out all manner of atrocities throughout the course of the \n4-year civil war in Syria. As we speak, about 400,000 Syrians have been \nkilled. He is responsible for the vast majority of those deaths. That \ndoes not take into consideration the millions of people who have been \ndisplaced.\n  The regime has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, \nincluding starvation, systematic murder, torture, rape, sexual violence \nand\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\nenforced disappearance. If there were ever, ever something that is \nevil, bad, wrong, it is what he has done. The action of the Assad \nregime has resulted in the deaths--as I indicated--of countless \ninnocent civilians and has sewn discord and disarray across the regime.\n  Yet Assad has repeatedly lied to the world about using chemical \nweapons. He loves to get on these shows. The U.S. journalists go over \nthere, and he sits there before us talking all of these lies about what \nhe has not done. There are dead people--hundreds of thousands of them \nthere. There are barrel bombs, cluster bombs. He targets civilians. He \nstarves them, demonstrating again and again what a terrible person he \nis and someone who cannot be believed about anything he says.\n  I am going to submit a Senate resolution condemning the actions of \nthe Assad regime and its military forces for these crimes they have \ncarried out against humanity. This legislation will express the Senate \nsupport for the referral of these evil acts that Assad has perpetrated \nand that have also been perpetrated by other Syrian officials and of \ncourse by the military leaders to an appropriate international tribune.\n  Also, I have to say, it turns my stomach to hear people talk about \nmaking a peace deal in Syria and having Assad be a part of that deal. \nHow could we do that? This resolution will make clear the Senate's \nopposition to any role for Bashar al-Assad in any final settlement of \nthat civil war. I am confident my Senate colleagues will join me in \ncondemning the Assad regime and its unthinkable campaign of evil \nagainst its own people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2312-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, help is finally on the way for the \nthousands of enslaved victims who suffer unspeakable abuse in the \nshadows. These victims often have nowhere safe to sleep. They often \nhave no safe place to turn to. And if they do try to escape, many risk \nbeing treated by the justice system like criminals instead of the \nvictims they truly are.\n  These victims deserve the help the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct would provide. It is a human rights bill that victims groups and \nadvocates have called ``the most comprehensive and thoughtful piece of \nanti-trafficking legislation currently pending'' and one that provides \nunprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking, who are all \ntoo often invisible and underserved.\n  We are relieved we can finally say that we will pass it today and \nthat the Senate won't violate longstanding bipartisan Hyde precedent in \ndoing so. But let me be as clear as possible. There was never a \nlogically consistent rationale for the filibuster that held up this \nbill, and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service explicitly \nbacked up what Republicans have long said when it confirmed that there \nare no private funds in this bill.\n  Thankfully, the filibuster is at an end. Today is a new day. Today, \nwe will finally vote to deliver much needed resources for the victims \nof modern slavery, with Hyde essentially applying to all funds used for \nhealth and medical services, just as it was in the original bill. This \nis nothing new; it is simply a reaffirmation of the status quo.\n  We know that today's outcome would not have been possible without the \nHerculean efforts of my colleague Senator Cornyn. He was absolutely \ndetermined to see justice for victims, and we really cannot thank him \nenough. He negotiated across the aisle in good faith. He never gave up, \nnot even in the bleakest hour. And today, the real focus of all our \nefforts--the victims of trafficking and modern slavery--can see that \nhelp is finally on the way.\n  We thank Senator Cornyn. We thank his negotiating partners from both \nparties. We thank Chairman Grassley for his superb work on this \nimportant bill in the Judiciary Committee as well. We look forward to \nthis bill's passage in the House and its signature by the President.\n  Mr. President, once the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act passes \nin the Senate, we will turn to consideration of the President's nominee \nto be Attorney General. That is just what I pledged we would do, and \nthat is what we will do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2312-5", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, I believe we are \ngoing to be hearing from the chairman of the Finance Committee shortly. \nSenator Hatch will be on the floor to discuss bipartisan trade \npromotion authority legislation which is important because we know that \ntrade is the key to supporting high-quality American jobs and exporting \nmore of the things American workers make and exporting more of the \nthings American farmers grow.\n  Congress is working again, and this bipartisan bill is another sign \nof that. No legislation will ever be perfect, but Chairman Hatch and \nRanking Member Wyden, along with Chairman Ryan in the House, put \ntogether an agreement of which we can all be proud. It protects and \nenhances Congress's role in the trade-negotiating process, while making \nsure Presidents of either party will have the ability to negotiate good \nagreements that can increase growth in our American economy and support \nmany high-quality American jobs. They are marking up that bill today. I \nwish them the best of luck. We look forward to having it on the floor \nin the very near future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2312-6", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank both of my colleagues who have spoken this \nmorning, Senators McConnell and Cornyn.\n\n\n                       Trade Promotion Authority\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this morning \nto talk once again about Congress's role in advancing our Nation's \ntrade policy. While I know trade policy can be a very contentious topic \nhere in Congress, there are two simple facts that are beyond dispute: \nNo. 1, more than 96 percent of the world's consumers live outside of \nthe United States, and No. 2, in order to be competitive, American \nbusinesses need to be able to sell more American-made products and \nservices to those overseas customers. In order to do that, we need to \ntear down barriers to American exports. At the same time, we should lay \ndown enforceable rules for our trading partners so that we can be sure \nAmerican workers and job creators are competing on a level playing \nfield.\n  In order to accomplish these goals and to advance our Nation's \ninterests in the global marketplace, Congress and the administration \nneed to work together. Most people acknowledge this reality. Yet, there \nare differing views as to what mechanisms should be in place to \nfacilitate cooperation between these two branches of government. In the \nend, there is only one legislative tool with a proven track record, and \nthat is trade promotion authority, otherwise known as TPA.\n  For decades--going back as far as FDR--TPA has been a cornerstone of \nU.S. trade policy. TPA is a compact between the Senate, the House, and \nthe administration. Under this compact, the administration agrees to \npursue objectives specified by Congress and to consult with Congress as \nit negotiates trade agreements. In turn, both the House and the Senate \nagree to allow for expedited consideration of trade agreements without \namendments.\n  For a number of reasons, this compact is essential for conclusion and \npassage of strong trade agreements. Put simply, without TPA, our \ntrading partners will not put their best offers on the table because \nthey will have no guarantee that the agreement they reach will be the \none Congress actually votes on in the end.\n  The most recent version of TPA expired 8 years ago. While trade \nnegotiations have continued since that time, without TPA in place, our \nnegotiators have effectively been negotiating with one arm tied behind \ntheir backs. We need to renew TPA sooner rather than later in order to \ngive these negotiators the tools they need to reach the best deals \npossible.\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\n  The stakes are very high. Currently, the United States is in the \nmidst of negotiating some of the most ambitious trade agreements in our \nNation's history--most notably, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. \nIf we want those negotiations to succeed--and I would hope that for the \ngood of our country most of us do want them to succeed--we need to \nrenew TPA.\n  Last week, I was joined by my colleague Senator Wyden and Chairman \nRyan of the House Ways and Means Committee in introducing the \nBipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of \n2015. This legislation would renew TPA and promote the advancement of \n21st-century trade policies. Later today--in just a little while, in \nfact--the Senate Finance Committee will be marking up this bill, as \nwell as other important pieces of trade legislation.\n  It has taken a long time to get here. As you may recall, I, along \nwith the two former chairmen, Senator Baucus and Congressman Camp, \nintroduced a bill to renew TPA early last year. That bill had \nbipartisan support in Congress and was broadly endorsed by the business \ncommunity. It also had the support of officials in the Obama \nadministration.\n  When Republicans took control of the Senate this year and I became \nthe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I made renewing TPA my \ntop trade priority for this Congress and set out to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. This legislation we will be \nmarking up today is the result of that hard work, and I am grateful to \nmy colleagues for working with me to get us this far.\n  Of course, the effort to renew TPA really began a long time before we \nintroduced our bill last year. Indeed, the discussion and debate over a \nnew and improved TPA began even before the last iteration expired in \n2007. We have been talking about this for a long time. Now is the time \nto act.\n  Over the past few weeks, as we have been preparing to move our \nlegislation forward, some people--including some of my colleagues--have \nexpressed concerns about TPA and trade agreements in general. So I wish \nto take a few minutes this morning to address some of the specific \nissues that have been raised.\n  Constitutional and sovereignty concerns. Some have argued that TPA \ncedes too much power to the administration and undermines Congress's \nconstitutional authority to make laws.\n  I know the people have heard the President claiming that TPP--the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership--will be ``the most progressive trade \nagreement in history,'' and they have heard him brag about the labor \nand environmental standards the administration is shooting for with the \nagreement. The question inevitably becomes, will President Obama try to \nuse this or other trade agreements to try to advance unilateral changes \nin U.S. law and policy? Even though we all know that no trade agreement \ncan go into force without Congress's approval, given this \nadministration's track record on executive overreach, people are right \nto be concerned about these issues.\n  Fortunately, our TPA bill addresses these uncertainties. Rather than \nceding authority to the executive branch, our bill empowers Congress at \nevery step, from trade negotiations to final approval of the agreement \nitself.\n  Our bill makes clear what objectives a trade agreement must reach in \norder to be approved by Congress. In fact, the bill contains the \nclearest articulation of trade priorities in our Nation's history. It \nincludes nearly 150 ambitious, high-standard negotiating objectives, \nincluding strong rules for intellectual property rights and \nagricultural trade, as well as protections for U.S. investment.\n  In addition to setting negotiating objectives, our legislation \nconstrains the administration in a number of ways. For example, it \nensures that implementing bills for trade agreements will include--and \nI am quoting the text of the bill--``only such provisions as are \nstrictly necessary or appropriate to implement'' trade agreements.\n  Additionally, it makes clear that any commitments made by the \nadministration that are not disclosed to Congress before an \nimplementing bill is introduced are not to be considered part of the \nrelevant agreement and will have no force of law.\n  Our legislation clarifies that trade agreements must be concluded \nwithin the TPA timeframe and that any substantial modifications or \nadditions made after that time will not be eligible for approval under \nTPA procedures.\n  So while I understand and even sympathize with those who might be \nsuspicious of this administration and its tendency to push the \nboundaries of its constitutional authority, our TPA bill speaks to \nthese exact concerns.\n  Furthermore, for those who might be worried that trade agreements \ncould we used to harm U.S. sovereignty, our bill addresses those issues \nas well.\n  First, the bill makes clear that any provision of a trade agreement \nthat is inconsistent with Federal or State law will have no effect.\n  Second, it states specifically that Federal and State laws will \nprevail in the event of a conflict with the trade agreement.\n  Third, it affirms that no trade agreement can prevent Congress or the \nStates from changing their laws in the future.\n  Fourth, it confirms that the administration cannot unilaterally \nchange U.S. law.\n  As you can see, far from abdicating Congress's power from U.S. trade \npolicy, our TPA bill enhances the role of Congress when it comes to \ntrade agreements.\n  Immigration. In addition to general concerns about constitutional \npowers and U.S. sovereignty, I have heard some express specific \nconcerns that President Obama can use the Trans-Pacific Partnership to \nenact changes to our immigration laws and that TPA will somehow empower \nhim to do so. These concerns are unfounded for at least two reasons.\n  First, immigration is completely irrelevant to the objectives of the \nTPP agreement and administration officials have been clear and \nunequivocal that no immigration provisions are under negotiation.\n  Just last week, USTR Michael Froman testified before the Senate \nCommittee on Finance and said:\n\n       I can assure you that we are not negotiating anything in \n     TPP that would require any modifications of the U.S. \n     immigration laws or system, any changes to our existing visa \n     system. And, in fact, TPP will explicitly state that it will \n     not require changes in any party's immigration laws or \n     procedures.\n\n  Second, even if people don't trust this administration, particularly \nwhen it comes to immigration, the provisions of our TPA bill, the ones \nI just got through talking about, provide greater congressional \noversight and authority over trade agreements and prevent this or any \nfuture administration from misleading Congress about what is included \nin any trade agreement.\n  In other words, if anyone is worried that despite their clear \nstatements to the contrary, the administration will use TPP to advance \nits immigration agenda, they should support our TPA bill.\n  Transparency. Another concern I have heard from people both in and \nout of government is that trade agreements currently under discussion \nhave been negotiated behind closed doors and that by renewing TPA, \nCongress would be enabling this type of secrecy.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the opposite is \ntrue. Our TPA bill goes further than any previous version of TPA to \npromote transparency both for Members of Congress and the American \npeople.\n  Under our legislation, any Member of Congress who wants access to the \nnegotiating text will get it, and at any time during the negotiations, \nMembers of Congress will be able to request and receive a briefing from \nUSTR on the status of negotiations.\n  In addition, the bill will require the administration to publicly \nrelease the full text of an agreement at least 60 days before they sign \nit, giving the American people full access and knowledge of all trade \nagreements before they are signed and well before they are submitted to \nCongress for their approval.\n  In short, any Member of Congress who is concerned about a lack of \ntransparency in trade negotiations should be a cosponsor of the Hatch-\nWyden-Ryan TPA bill.\n  Currency. The last concern I will talk about today deals with \ncurrency manipulation. Specifically, I have heard from colleagues that \nour TPA\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nbill should include stronger, enforceable standards to prevent our \ntrading partners from engaging in currency manipulation.\n  Now, make no mistake, I think currency manipulation is a serious \nissue. Like my colleagues, I am worried the currency policies of a \nnumber of countries, including some of our trade partners, continue to \nhave negative consequences on U.S. businesses and workers. I believe \nCongress should carefully consider ways to address this issue. That is \nwhy, for the first time, our TPA bill includes a negotiating objective \nintended to address currency manipulation.\n  While I understand some of my colleagues would like that provision to \nbe stronger, this is a very complex issue. Many have expressed valid \nconcerns that by requiring our trade agreements to contain enforceable \ncurrency provisions we would be inviting a number of unintended \nconsequences, including challenges to U.S. monetary policy. In \naddition, most have acknowledged that such provisions would effectively \nderail the TPP negotiations, harming our farmers, ranchers, \nmanufacturers, and others who so desperately need access to these \nmarkets.\n  It is not just me saying this. Yesterday, I received a letter from \nTreasury Secretary Lew expressing these very concerns about the \npossibility of including enhanced currency provisions in TPA. On top of \nthat, 10 former Treasury Secretaries, from both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, sent a letter to congressional leaders that \nmade similar arguments.\n  As you can see, there is more than ample reason to doubt the wisdom \nof inserting stronger currency provisions into TPA. I think it is fair, \ngiven Secretary Lew's very clear statements, to assume that President \nObama would not sign a TPA bill that included such provisions, and I \nthink it is more than fair to say that even if he would sign such a \nbill, it would be devastating to our ongoing trade negotiations; \nthereby, threatening growth and jobs right here at home. That being the \ncase, I hope my colleagues pursuing this route will reconsider their \npositions.\n  Once again, we are going to mark up our TPA bill later today. I am \nexcited and pleased for this opportunity. I think we will get a strong \nbipartisan vote to report the bill and send it to the floor. We have \ncrafted a very good bill, one that I think Members of both parties can \nsupport. I know some Members have anxieties and concerns about these \nissues. We have put the bill together with those types of concerns in \nmind and, as I think I have demonstrated today, anyone who is truly \nsupportive of trade and of opening foreign markets to U.S. goods and \nservices and wants to create more good jobs right here at home should \nsupport our bill.\n  Since the day we introduced our legislation, letters and statements \nof support have been pouring in. I will mention just a few.\n  We have had statements from administration officials, including the \nPresident himself, and to say support from the business community has \nbeen overwhelming would be a gross understatement. We have letters from \nvirtually every industry--farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, tech \ncompanies, health care companies, and I could literally go on and on, \nbut I will not, at least not right now. Instead, today, I will just \nmention two of the many letters of support we have received from \nbusinesses and job creators.\n  I have a letter from the Trade Benefits America Coalition signed by \nhundreds of companies and major trade associations expressing their \nstrong support for the Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA bill.\n  I have another letter signed by nearly 300 State and local chambers \nof commerce, farm bureaus, and manufacturing associations, all \nexpressing their support for the swift renewal of TPA.\n  Leaders from a number of leading conservative organizations have \nexpressed support as well, including the Conservative Reform Network, \nthe Cato Institute, Americans for Tax Reform, American Enterprise \nInstitute, American Action Forum, Tea Party Express, 60 Plus, American \nCommitment, American Conservative Union, Americans for Job Security, \nCenter for Individual Freedom, Citizens for Limited Taxation, \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, Conservative Reform Network, Council \nfor Citizens Against Government Waste, Crossroads GPS, Digital Liberty, \nEnding Spending, Frontiers of Freedom, Georgia Center Right Coalition, \nInstitute for Liberty, Minnesota Center Right Coalition, National \nTaxpayers Union, R Street, Rio Grande Foundation, Taxpayer Foundation \nAlliance, and the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy.\n  That is a long list and by no means contains everybody who is for \nthis bill, and it is growing every day. As you can see, TPA is \nsupported across the ideological spectrum.\n  I suppose this is the best way I can put it: Senator Ted Cruz \ncoauthored an op-ed with Senator Ryan in support of our bill in today's \nWall Street Journal. If both Ted Cruz and Barack Obama support our \nlegislation, it is probably safe to say we are onto something.\n  I appreciate all the support we have received thus far for our TPA \nbill. It has been gratifying to see, and I look forward to talking more \nwith colleagues about these issues in the coming week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring quorum calls before the votes this morning be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The New Congress\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is over 100 days since the 114th \nCongress has been in session led by a new majority following the \nNovember election. This Chamber can point to significant \naccomplishments in this short period of time.\n  Now, none of us is spiking the football or saying that we have done \nmiraculous things, but it is undeniable that we have made discernible, \nconcrete progress on important matters that affect the lives and the \nquality of life of the American people.\n  In only 3 weeks into the new Congress, the Senate already had more \nvotes on amendments than the Chamber did in all of last year. What that \nmeans is that, on a bipartisan basis, Senators have been able to \ncontribute their ideas on legislation--how to improve it and get votes \non it. That was something we promised voters that would change after \nthe last election. In the new Congress and under the new majority \nleader, Senator McConnell, we have delivered.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Senate passed a budget that actually \nbalances in 10 years--something the Chamber has done only once since \n2009. More recently, we sent to the President's desk the so-called doc \nfix, which, more importantly, ensured access to the doctors and \nhospitals that our seniors need. We also made great strides in \nproviding the American people a final say on the Iran nuclear deal that \nis being negotiated now by the President's representatives. We have \nmade progress on bipartisan legislation that ensures the United States \nwill get the best deal with our trading partners in pending \nnegotiations--opening up American goods and services to global markets, \nwhich is good for our economy. It is good for jobs, and it is good for \nbetter wages for hard-working American families.\n  But I must say, even with all of these accomplishments, I am most \nproud of the deal we were able to reach this week concerning the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  I have noticed one thing since I have been here in Washington; it is \nthat the rich and powerful seem to do pretty well. They are well \nrepresented on K Street, and they are not hesitant about letting their \nneeds be known. But one\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\nindicator of the character of a nation is how that nation--our Nation--\ntreats those who are the most vulnerable in our society, those who \nactually need our help, who do not have lobbyists or other people \nworking on their behalf in the halls of Congress.\n  So this legislation, I think, actually is a very positive step \nbecause it demonstrates that we have not fallen deaf to the cries of \nthose who actually need our help--the victims of human trafficking.\n  This legislation will be instrumental in helping victims of sexual \nabuse and trafficking recover from a life in bondage, and it will \nprovide stronger tools for law enforcement officials to track down and \npunish those who want to keep them in the shadows, who want to continue \nto make profit from the pain, the anguish, and the involuntary \nservitude of typically young women between the ages of 12 and 14. And \noften these young women--these children--are treated as criminals and \nnot as the victims they truly are. With the passage of this bill, we \nare one step closer to reining it in.\n  So I thank our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, some of whom \nare here in the Chamber, for working with us in the spirit of trying to \naccomplish something important and actually getting it done. I know the \ndistinguished ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, with whom I \npartnered on a number of important topics, is here, and I thank him for \nhis contribution. And the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, has \nbeen very important in the negotiation and in getting us to yes.\n  Finally--and I know time is short, so I will have more to say on this \nlater. But there are literally 200 outside groups--faith-based groups, \nlaw enforcement organizations, and other organizations--that worked on \nthe sidelines cheering us, asking us to get this done--groups such as \nRights4Girls, Shared Hope International, Coalition Against Trafficking \nin Women, the End Child Prostitution and Trafficking organization, and \nthe National Association to Protect Children. These groups and hundreds \nof others across the country have literally been our boots on the \nground.\n  I also think it is important to recognize organizations such as \nGoogle Ideas and the McCain Institute, particularly Cindy McCain, who \njoined me in Houston recently to talk more about this important topic.\n  So there are a lot of people who contributed to get us to where we \nare today. We are not done yet. We have some important votes in just a \nfew minutes--a total of 8 votes today--before we complete our work on \nthis legislation, but I think this is a good day. This will be a good \nday for the Senate and for the victims of human trafficking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 301\n\n       (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 301.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 301.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of March 16, 2015, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from Texas \nhas said. We have worked together. I hope we continue to do this, but \nbefore I talk about my substitute, I want to yield the floor to the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, so many Members helped us get this bill \nback on a bipartisan path, but I want to thank Senators Reid, Cornyn, \nKlobuchar, Feinstein, Mikulski, and Leahy in particular for their work. \nI also want to thank all of the staff who have worked extremely hard to \nget this done, especially Melanie Rainer from my staff.\n  From the beginning of this debate, Democrats have been very clear \nthat this bill to help survivors should focus squarely on that goal \nalone. We also felt this conversation was no place for a debate about \nrestrictions on women's health access. While there are clear \ndifferences between the two parties when it comes to women's health, I \nknow Senator Cornyn and many others agreed with us that an effort to \nfight back against human trafficking in our country is, without \nquestion, no place for gridlock and dysfunction. It should not have \ntaken this long, but I am very pleased that we were able to work \ntogether, find common ground, and reach an agreement.\n  This agreement isn't perfect. No comprise ever is, and I am sure my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would say the same thing. I \nbelieve there is much more we can and must do to protect and strengthen \nwomen's access to comprehensive, high-quality health care.\n  In the 21st century, there is no reason a woman should be prevented \nfrom exercising her constitutionally guaranteed right to make her own \nchoices about her own body. That is something I could not feel more \nstrongly about, and I am going to keep working to not only protect that \nright but expand and improve access to care for women across the \ncountry.\n  I am very glad, however, that the amendment we are proposing this \nmorning would provide survivors now with real, dedicated funds and \nsupport, including important health services. Critically, this \namendment would take away the expansion of restrictions on women's \nhealth that would have occurred under the original legislation. It \nwould ensure that the Hyde language is now not expanded to any new \nprograms under this bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this amendment so we \ncan pass this bill to help trafficking survivors, and then move as \nquickly as possible to confirm our highly qualified nominee for \nAttorney General.\n  I thank my colleagues again for their work to reach this compromise. \nThe families and communities we serve rightly expect us to work \ntogether to solve problems and not let gridlock and dysfunction get in \nthe way of results. I am very pleased we were able to find that common \nground and a path forward for this important legislation. I am very \nhopeful that now we will be able to continue working together to tackle \nthe many other challenges our country faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my substitute amendment, No. 301, brings \ntogether three very important bills that provide a comprehensive \napproach to preventing human trafficking and help survivors rebuild \ntheir lives. First, it includes the Leahy-Collins-Murkowski-Ayotte \namendment to protect runaway and homeless youth from trafficking. \nSecond, it includes the Klobuchar-Cornyn bill as reported in February \nby the Judiciary Committee. The safe harbor bill encourages States to \ntreat victims of trafficking as victims and not--as oftentimes they are \ntreated--as criminals. Finally, it includes the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill, \nS. 178, but without the divisive language that limits victims' \nservices, which has held us up so long.\n  My amendment came about as a response to the request of survivors and \nthe dedicated people who work with them, the people who actually see \nthis day-by-day, for whom it is not a theoretical thing, but is an \nactual day-by-day crisis. They have urged us to remove the unnecessary \nand harmful provision which stalled this bill for weeks.\n  Congress has a long history of passing legislation to address human \ntrafficking. We did so in the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act, which included the reauthorization of the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act. We consistently have addressed \nhuman trafficking legislation without abortion politics being inserted \nin the discussion. My amendment would return us to the path of the \nbipartisan bills we passed in years past. Importantly, my amendment is \ngoing to make sure we are preventing human trafficking in the first \nplace.\n  It is one thing to work with children after they become victims. I \nthink we would all agree it is better if we can\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nhelp prevent them from becoming victims. The best way to do that is to \nsupport runaway and homeless kids. Without a safe place to sleep, these \nchildren and teens are exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers. \nThe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, first passed in 1974, funds tried-\nand-true programs to help these youth stabilize their lives. When a \nhomeless or runaway teen is looking for a place to stay and there is \nnothing available, they sometimes resort to desperate measures. They \nare picked up almost at once by sex traffickers and exploited.\n  The substitute amendment reauthorizes and strengthens the programs \nthat have worked ever since 1974. It adds training for service \nproviders so we can better identify victims of trafficking and refer \nthem to the appropriate resources. It includes language to prevent \ndiscrimination against homeless youth based on their sexual orientation \nor gender identification.\n  We found, in the testimony before the Judiciary Committee, a growing \nnumber of homeless and runaway youth identify as LGBT. Many of them \nhave actually been thrown out of their homes for who they are. I am a \nparent; I am a grandparent. I find this heartbreaking to me that any \nchild, any child for whatever reason would be thrown out of their home. \nWe have to ensure that these vulnerable children who have already been \nrejected do not face rejection again because of how they look or dress \nor whom they love.\n\n  I urge all Senators to support this amendment. This is a moral issue. \nIf we are serious about listening to survivors and responding to their \nneeds and if we are serious about preventing human trafficking and \nprotecting vulnerable children in the first place, this amendment is \nthe strongest option before us.\n  We should be judged by what we do for the most vulnerable among us. \nThe combination of these three bills should bring us together. I urge \nthe Senate to support this comprehensive substitute.\n  Several of us in this body, both parties, have had the privilege to \nserve law enforcement before coming here, as I did. I said many times \non this floor that I still have nightmares today, 40 years later, from \nsome of the scenes I saw back then. I could arrest and prosecute these \npeople who harm these youth, but we could never give back to the youth \nwho they were before they were harmed.\n  Unfortunately, what I have nightmares about happens in so many more \nplaces. In the distinguished Presiding Officer's own home State, as \nwell as the home States of every single Member of this body, it is \nhappening today. These are the most vulnerable of our citizens. We as \nSenators should help protect them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                Request for Committee on Finance to Meet\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Finance be allowed to meet during today's session of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I object to the unanimous consent request to waive rule \nXXVI to allow the Finance Committee to pass a fast-track bill that will \nundermine the American worker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend from \nVermont, the Finance Committee is scheduled to deal with the trade \npromotion authority issue this afternoon. There are over 200 \namendments. I would say to my friend, all this objection is going to do \nwill be to require us to recess after the votes on trafficking and stay \nin session because we are going to finish the bill in the Finance \nCommittee today. I appreciate the Senator's opposition, but I want to \nmake clear to him and to our colleagues that it will not prevent the \ntrade promotion authority bill from being dealt with in Finance today. \nWe will simply go into recess after we finish the trafficking bill and \nstay in recess, and the committee will work until it reports out the \nbill.\n  I understand the Senator's vigorous opposition to it. The Senator has \nmade that quite clear. It is certainly understandable. The Senator has \na right to do that. I am just making the point that this particular way \nto oppose it will not be successful today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the majority \nleader, I appreciate his position. But as he knows, not only is there \nmassive opposition to this TPP agreement, but there is a lot of concern \nthat the American people have not been involved in the process, that \nthere is not a lot of transparency. What we are trying do is to make \nsure this debate takes place out in the public, that the American \npeople have as much time as possible to understand the very significant \nimplications of this trade agreement. I, and I suspect others, will do \nour best to make that happen.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand the position of my friend \nfrom Vermont on this. This Finance Committee meeting obviously will be \nopen to the public. There will be many amendments offered, most of them \nI expect reflecting the views of the Senator from Vermont, but the \nmeeting will go forward. The committee will simply be inconvenienced by \nthe current actions of the Senator from Vermont, but the committee will \ngo forward. The Senate will be in recess, and the committee will meet \nat the earliest possible time and finish the bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to \nspeak before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to make clear that the first \namendment we will vote on relative to the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act will remove the Hyde amendment which is the \nlongstanding, 39-year consensus that taxpayer funds will not be used to \nfund abortions. This amendment would completely strip that Hyde \namendment, and it would undermine the delicate compromise that has been \nreached on the important legislation. The next vote we will have will \nbe on that compromise piece of legislation, the Cornyn-Murray-Klobuchar \nlegislation. It would literally cut funding for human trafficking \nvictims as compared to this compromise.\n  I would urge our colleagues to stick with the bipartisan compromise \nand to vote against the Leahy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n      Frank R. Lautenberg Safer Chemicals for the 21st Century Act\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise on Earth Day to speak about our \nchildren and about chemical safety. We come in contact with thousands \nof chemicals every day. As I am speaking now, millions of our fellow \ncitizens are buying groceries or going to the hardware store or getting \nclothes or toys for their children. They assume the government has \nstudied the chemicals in these products and determined they are safe. \nBut that is not the case.\n  The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, or TSCA, is supposed to \nprotect American families, and it doesn't. There are over 84,000 known \nchemicals in manufactured and commercial products, and hundreds of new \nones come on the market every year. How many of those products have \nbeen regulated by the EPA? Less than half a dozen.\n  These are troubling numbers. TSCA has been in existence for almost 40 \nyears, and out of 84,000 chemicals--and counting--less than a dozen are \nactually regulated. The EPA cannot even regulate asbestos, a known \ncarcinogen. Since losing a court battle in 1991, they have not been \nable to regulate it. The risks and dangers have been around for \ndecades, but there is no cop on the beat. TSCA has failed.\n  Some States are trying to fill the gap by regulating a few chemicals, \nbut my home State of New Mexico, and the vast majority of others, have \nno ability to test chemicals. They don't have a department to write \nregulations. Without a working Federal law, they have no protection. \nEven California, which probably has the greatest capacity of all States \nto test and regulate, has only proposed rules for three chemicals. In 7 \nyears, since California passed a law to regulate chemicals, it has only \nbegun the process on three chemicals.\n  That is why I and others have worked so hard to find compromise on \nthis issue. That is why I introduced the\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\nFrank R. Lautenberg Safer Chemicals for the 21st Century Act.\n  I come to the floor today on Earth Day to urge all of my colleagues \nhere to make reforming our broken chemical safety law a priority. We \nhave a moral obligation to protect our kids from dangerous chemicals.\n  I have been privileged to work with Senator Vitter on this bill. I \nthank him and our colleagues who have worked with us. This is a true \nbipartisan effort. We don't always agree on some of the issues, but we \nhave one basic goal here. Reform is overdue. It is 40 years overdue.\n  All of our landmark environmental laws have been reformed or \namended--the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean \nAir Act--but not the Toxic Substances Control Act. It should have \nbeen--and it was not for lack of trying.\n  Our esteemed former colleague, the late Senator Frank Lautenberg led \nthe way for many years, with great determination.\n  He never gave up. Together we fought the good fight to pass our dream \nbill, but were never able to make any progress. And he realized we \nneeded to work with all stakeholders. Everyone at the table, including \nindustry. Because he understood, this is not about getting all that we \nwant. This is about getting the American people the protections they \nneed. His effort to reform TSCA was the last major legislation he \nintroduced.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago, the New York Times endorsed the \nLautenberg-Vitter bill. The Times said--correctly--that previous \nefforts at reform had gone nowhere, and the bill ``deserves to be \npassed because it would be a significant advance over the current \nlaw.''\n  That was 2 years ago. I was honored to take over as the lead Democrat \non the bill. Since then, I have listened to concerns. I reached across \nthe aisle. I brought everyone into the room, or at least tried to. With \nmy Republican colleague, Senator Vitter, we have improved the bill.\n  I want to talk for a moment about what this bill actually does, and \nhow it moves us forward. Specifically, it does the following:\n  First, the manufacture of a new chemical cannot begin until EPA \napproves it. Currently, a new chemical is on the market after 90 days, \nunless EPA finds unreasonable risk. Our bill gives EPA the time it \nneeds, and keeps these chemicals out of American homes in the meantime.\n  Second, current TSCA has no requirement for evaluating existing \nchemicals. None. Our bill does and includes deadlines, even more \naggressive than the EPA itself asked for.\n  Third, we require a stronger safety standard for all chemicals to be \nevaluated. No longer will EPA be required to choose the ``least \nburdensome'' regulation. Its criteria will be safety, science, and \npublic health--never cost or convenience.\n  Fourth, our bill defines, for the first time, our most vulnerable \npopulations--pregnant women, infants, the elderly, and workers--and \nexplicitly requires that EPA ensure they are protected from chemicals \nin commerce or manufacturing.\n  Finally, we limit confidential business information protection for \nindustry. Currently, it is limitless, unless challenged by EPA. We call \nfor a 10-year sunset on confidential business information claims.\n  Reform takes time. But, it should not take decades. We can't afford \nto wait any longer. Our children and our communities can't afford to \nwait for protection from chemicals. Yes, that means compromise. The \ngoal was not a perfect bill. The goal was, and is, real reform.\n  We have worked to address the issues with the original bill, and we \nstill have work to do. It doesn't do everything I want. Senator Vitter \nhas given a great deal as well. But this is a strong, bipartisan bill. \nI am confident it can pass the Senate. It will ensure EPA has the \nauthority to keep us safe, something EPA cannot do now.\n  So, let's be clear. We have a choice. We can continue with a law that \nhas failed. We can continue to leave the American people unprotected. \nOr we can actually make a difference. We can give the EPA the power it \nneeds to do its job--so that chemicals are tested--so that our homes \nand workplaces are safe--and so that American families are protected.\n  I believe the choice is obvious. To those who disagree, I would ask a \nsimple question. Are you willing to live with a failed law another 20 \nor 40 years? Because we all agree on one thing--TSCA is a failure.\n  This is the best chance we have, possibly for many years, to pass a \nlaw that will protect our kids from dangerous chemicals.\n  Our bill will make Americans safer. Not just Americans fortunate to \nlive in States with protections. All Americans. No matter where they \nlive.\n  For those Americans in States with existing safeguards, that won't \nchange. Those safeguards will stay in place. Any regulations in place \nas of January of this year will remain. And there is a role for States \nto play--to help with the thousands of chemicals that EPA will not be \nable to evaluate.\n  But, let's be clear. The EPA has the largest staff on chemical safety \nof any country in the world. They should be able to put that staff to \ngood use. To do otherwise is wasted opportunity and continued failure.\n  This has not been an easy process. But, it is a necessary one. I \nbelieve it will result in a good bill. We welcome a healthy debate. We \nwelcome constructive amendments. At the same time, we should not lose \nsight of the key goal--to actually pass a bill. To reform a law that is \nnot working. To protect our families and communities.\n  I believe we can do this. And Senator Lautenberg, who was a great \nenvironmental champion, he believed we could as well.\n  Americans trust that when they go to the grocery store, or when they \nare in their own homes, that the products they reach for are safe. The \ncurrent system fails that trust. It fails to provide confidence in our \nregulatory system. And it fails to provide confidence in our consumer \nproducts. We cannot let that failure continue. It hurts our economy, \nand it hurts the American people.\n  We need solutions, not roadblocks and closed doors. Senator Vitter \nand I will continue to work with all stakeholders. If we can make this \nbill better, we will. We all share that goal. But, here's the bottom \nline: We must work through the remaining challenges. Now is not the \ntime for digging in our heels--and going nowhere. Mr. President, 40 \nyears of that is enough. Now is the time for change.\n  There is only one essential question before us. Is this reform better \nthan what we have? The answer is yes. Can we make it even better? I \nhope the answer to that question is yes as well. But, that will require \na spirit of cooperation and compromise. That will require that we \ncontinue to have everyone at the table.\n  Critics charge that this is an alliance with the chemical industry. \nThat is false. It is an alliance with the American people. They put \ntheir trust in the American government to protect them. That trust has \nnot been met.\n  It is in everyone's interest--to identify dangerous chemicals, to \nprotect the American public, and restore confidence in the safety of \nthe products made by American companies.\n  We have a historic opportunity to create a chemical law that works \nand provide American families with the protections they expect and \ndeserve. Let's work together. Let's make that happen. Let's not wait \nanother 40 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Registration of sex offenders released from military \n              corrections facilities or upon conviction.''.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to speak very briefly on an amendment \nthe Senate will have an opportunity to vote on this afternoon.\n  Due to the way the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act is \ncurrently written, there is a problem with tracking sex offenders \nconvicted in a military justice system. Some of these offenders are \nexploiting the cracks in that system.\n  My amendment is, quite honestly, a fix to the problem and will help \nauthorities and the public better track sex offenders in our \ncommunities.\n  To explain, currently, military sex offenders are only required to \nself-report to a State government after they are released from a \nmilitary correctional facility.\n  Under the civilian justice system, sex offenders are registered in \nthe State before they are released. The State then provides the \ninformation to the Department of Justice to be included in both the \npublic and the private National Sex Offender Registry, which is where \nthe average citizen can go and see if there is a sex offender in their \nneighborhood.\n  A Department of Defense inspector general report issued in August of \nlast year revealed that an estimated 242 of the 1,312 released sex \noffenders failed to self-report.\n  In that inspector general's report, they said:\n\n       The lack of jurisdiction for DOD to register military sex \n     offenders with the National Sex Offender Registry enables \n     military sex offenders released from military prisons to \n     evade sex offender registration requirements.\n\n  I am not sure it can be put any plainer than that.\n  The Department of Defense tried to correct the problem by working \nwith State authorities and the U.S. Marshals, but underreporting \ncontinues today.\n  Differences in State laws in military reporting procedures enables \nsome criminals to totally evade reporting and detection.\n  A recent Scripps news report revealed grim examples of the \nconsequences of these cracks in the system.\n  Consider the recent case of Matthew Carr. The military convicted \nMatthew Carr for posing as a gynecologist. He preyed on seven women. \nAfter spending 7 years incarcerated, he evaded registration upon his \nrelease. He assaulted another woman before being apprehended by \ncivilian authorities. This assault was preventable in that community, \nbut the DOD wasn't required to post him as a sex offender.\n  In another case, a former officer served 5 years for sexually \nassaulting 3 minors in the cruelest way possible. He evaded \nregistration, and Scripps located this individual living within a mile \nof a school. It is scary, a pedophile living next to a school--and no \none knew he was there.\n  This amendment requires the Department of Defense to communicate a \ncriminal's information directly to the Attorney General to improve \ntracking and public notification.\n  My amendment is based upon a bipartisan bill, S. 409, that I \nintroduced with the support of Senator McCaskill. That bill already has \nthe support of 15 of our colleagues: Senators Ayotte, Blunt, Cornyn, \nCotton, Crapo, Fischer, Rubio, Sessions, Tillis, Toomey, Feinstein, \nKing, Mikulski, and Nelson.\n  My amendment costs taxpayers nothing, and it is a commonsense \nsolution to a real problem that exists.\n  I encourage my colleagues this afternoon, when we have an opportunity \nto\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\nget back into votes, that they support amendment No. 1121.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                       Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I objected to the unanimous consent \nrequest to waive rule XXVI to allow the Finance Committee to pass a \nfast-track bill because I think it is time we slowed down fast-track.\n  This trade agreement, I think everybody acknowledges, is of enormous \nconsequence to working people all over this country. We need more \ntransparency. We need to know what is in this legislation, and we need \nto involve the American people in this discussion.\n  I must say I am extremely disappointed that on a piece of legislation \nwhich involves 40 percent of the world's economy, that is the largest \ntrade agreement in the history of the United States of America, much of \nthe major media has virtually ignored this issue.\n  Now, you may be for the agreement, you may be against the agreement. \nI am strongly against it--and I will tell you why in a moment, but I \nwould hope we could all agree this is an enormously important issue \nthat deserves significant discussion on the part of the American people \nand their elected representatives.\n  I find it incomprehensible that, to the best of my knowledge, ABC--\nthe ABC television network--has had zero coverage of the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, zero; CBS television, zero coverage; NBC, zero coverage. \nPBS has had three mentions of the TPP. CNN has had zero coverage, FOX \ntelevision has had four mentions, and MSNBC--mostly because of the \nexcellent work of Ed Schultz--has covered it on 33 occasions, and all \nof this since January of 2015.\n  So here we are engaged in a discussion--some people are for it and \nsome people are against it--but how do the American people know what is \ngoing on if the major networks are virtually blocking out any serious \ndiscussion, any mention of the agreement?\n  Supporters of the fast-track bill have told us over and over again \nthat unfettered free trade will increase American jobs and increase \nAmerican wages, but they have been proven dead wrong every single time \nwe have had a trade agreement. In other words, we hear the same \nrhetoric: vote for NAFTA, vote for CAFTA, vote for the free-trade \nagreement with China. It is going to increase jobs in America, improve \nlife for the middle class. Yet every single time the rhetoric around \nthese past trade agreements has been proven to be dead wrong.\n  I was in the House of Representatives in 1993 and 1994 during the \ndebate over NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I remember \nall of those people who supported that agreement telling us how NAFTA \nwas going to open the Mexican economy for products made in the United \nStates of America and how it was going to create all kinds of good-\npaying jobs in this country.\n  On September 19, 1993, President Bill Clinton said the following:\n\n       I believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in \n     the first two years of its effect. . . . I believe that NAFTA \n     will create a million jobs in the first five years of its \n     impact.\n\n  That was President Bill Clinton, who strongly supported that \nagreement.\n  But it wasn't only President Clinton who made those claims. The \nHeritage Foundation, one of the most conservative think tanks in this \ncountry, said in 1993: ``Virtually all economists agree that NAFTA will \nproduce a net increase of U.S. jobs over the next decade.'' That is \nfrom the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n  Further, during the debate over NAFTA and the Senate in 1993, the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, who is now the \nmajority leader, said: American firms will not move to Mexico just for \nlower wages.\n  That was Senator McConnell. Virtually every major newspaper in \nAmerica had editorials saying: Support NAFTA--the Washington Post, New \nYork Times, Wall Street Journal. Support NAFTA; it is good for the \nAmerican worker.\n  Well, it turns out that NAFTA, which, of course, was supported by \nevery major corporation in America, supported by Wall Street, supported \nby all of the Big Money interests--well, it turns out that all of those \nprojections regarding NAFTA turned out to be dead wrong.\n  According to the well-respected economists at the Economic Policy \nInstitute, NAFTA has led to the loss of more than 680,000 jobs--not the \ncreation of 1 million jobs, the loss of 680,000 American jobs.\n  In 1993, the year before NAFTA was implemented, the United States had \na trade surplus with Mexico of more than $1.6 billion. Last year, the \ntrade deficit with Mexico was $53 billion.\n  I quote what the Economic Policy Institute says about NAFTA:\n\n       [President] Clinton and his collaborators promised [NAFTA] \n     would bring ``good-paying American jobs,'' a rising trade \n     surplus with Mexico, and a dramatic reduction in illegal \n     immigration. Instead, NAFTA directly cost the United States a \n     net loss of 700,000 jobs. The [trade] surplus with Mexico \n     turned into a chronic deficit. And the economic dislocation \n     in Mexico increased the flow of undocumented workers into the \n     United States.\n\n  Further, I quote an article that appeared in the New York Times \nyesterday:\n\n       Mexico has become the most attractive place in North \n     America to build new automobile factories, a shift that has \n     siphoned jobs from the U.S. and Canada. . . . In the past two \n     years, eight automakers have opened or announced new plants \n     or expansions in Mexico. . . . Low labor costs and fewer \n     tariffs are the swing factors.\n\n  That was the New York Times yesterday. In other words, despite all of \nthe rhetoric about how this unfettered free-trade agreement with Mexico \nwas going to create jobs in this country, it turned out--not too \nsurprisingly, I voted against NAFTA--to be exactly the opposite. Those \npeople who told us how great the agreement was going to be were dead \nwrong.\n  Why were they wrong? Well, for obvious reasons. When you have workers \nin low-wage countries, people who are prepared to work for 50 cents an \nhour, $1 an hour, $2 an hour, it doesn't take a Ph.D. in economics to \nfigure out that corporations will shut down in America, move to those \ncountries, pay workers pennies an hour--not have to worry about \nenvironmental regulations, not have to worry about, in some cases, \ntrade unions. You don't have to worry about that stuff.\n  So what would American corporations do? Of course they would go to \nthose countries. That is exactly what they have done.\n  I talked for a moment about NAFTA. What about permanent normal trade \nrelations with China? I don't think I have to elaborate on the fact \nthat when Americans go shopping and they walk into a department store--\njust look at the labels. Look at where the products are manufactured. \nTime after time, the products come from China, China, and China.\n  As unbelievable as it may sound, back in 1999 and 2000, we were \ntold--this is again what we were told--that permanent normal trade \nrelations with China would open up the huge Chinese market to all kinds \nof American-made products. The argument was, look, China is the largest \ncountry in the world. If we can just have an unfettered free-trade \nagreement with them, think about all the products manufactured in \nAmerica that would be sold to the huge population in China.\n  That was the argument. I think it is important for the American \npeople to hear what the supporters of permanent normal trade relations \nwith China--free trade with China--had to say back then and whether \nthose arguments turned out to be right. In other words, if we are going \nto look at TPP today and hear what people are saying now, it is \nimportant to hear what people said about these other free trade \nagreements back then.\n  Here is what President Bill Clinton said about PNTR with China back \nin 1999:\n\n       In opening the economy of China, the agreement will create \n     unprecedented opportunities for American farmers, workers and \n     companies to compete successfully in China's market . . . \n     This is a hundred-to-nothing deal for America when it comes \n     to the economic consequences.\n\n  That was President Bill Clinton.\n  In addition, this is what the conservative economists at the Cato \nInstitute--a very conservative think tank--wrote back in 1999:\n\n       The silliest argument against PNTR is that Chinese imports \n     would overwhelm U.S. industry. In fact, American workers are \n     far\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n     more productive than their Chinese counterparts . . . PNTR \n     would create far more export opportunities for American than \n     Chinese concerns.\n\n  In other words, we had a liberal President, President Clinton, saying \nPNTR--free trade--with China would open up great economic opportunities \nin America, create new jobs, and raise wages. We had a conservative \nthink tank say exactly the same thing. We had all of corporate America, \nall of Wall Street, all of the big-money interests saying: Oh boy, what \na great opportunity for the United States. We can create all these \njobs.\n  Well, were they right or were they wrong? I think everybody knows--\nthe facts are pretty clear--they were, once again, not wrong, they were \ndead wrong. The Economic Policy Institute estimated that PNTR with \nChina has led to the net loss of over 2.7 million American jobs. The \ntrade deficit with China has increased from $83 billion back in 2001 to \na recordbreaking $342 billion in 2014. I note that my Republican \ncolleagues often talk about our national deficit, which is an important \nissue, but I don't hear much discussion about our huge trade deficit, \nespecially with China, which was at $342 billion in 2014.\n  After all of the talk on the floor of the Senate and the floor of the \nHouse, after all of the editorials written in the major newspapers \nthroughout our country, after all of the discussion and expositions of \nWall Street and the big-money interests, it turned out that the trade \nagreement with China was an unmitigated disaster for American workers.\n  PNTR was passed in the year 2000. A couple of years later--and this \nkind of tells you everything you need to know about unfettered free \ntrade--Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of General Electric, one of our large \ncorporations, was quoted on this subject at an investor meeting 1 year \nafter China was admitted to the World Trade Organization, and this is \nwhat Mr. Immelt said:\n\n       When I am talking to GE managers, I talk China, China, \n     China, China, China. You need to be there. You need to change \n     the way people talk about it and how they get there. I am a \n     nut on China. Outsourcing from China is going to grow to $5 \n     billion. We are building a tech center in China. Every \n     discussion today has to center on China. The cost basis is \n     extremely attractive. You can take an 18 cubic foot \n     refrigerator, make it in China, land it in the United States, \n     and land it for less than we can make an 18 cubic foot \n     refrigerator today ourselves.\n\n  What Mr. Immelt was saying is what virtually every major corporation \nCEO was thinking, and it is not hard to understand why. In China, wages \nare very, very low. Environmental regulations are almost nonexistent. \nIt is hard to find a trade union to negotiate for workers. Why wouldn't \na company shut down in America and run to China? And that is exactly, \nof course, what they have done.\n  Before PNTR with China passed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told us \nit would create jobs. But just a few years later, on July 1, 2004, the \nAssociated Press ran an article with the headline ``Chamber of Commerce \nleader advocates offshoring of jobs.'' The article quotes Thomas \nDonohue, the president and CEO, who, by the way, just yesterday was \nbefore the Senate Committee on Finance advocating for the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. This is what the AP article said back in 2004:\n\n       Mr. Donohue urged American companies to send jobs overseas \n     as a way to boost American competitiveness . . . Donohue said \n     that exporting high-paid tech jobs to low-cost countries such \n     as India, China and Russia saves companies money.\n\n  So the dirty secret is that of course these guys like these free-\ntrade agreements--not because they are going to create jobs in America. \nNo one seriously believes that. When they are honest about it, they \nunderstand and they say that if companies shut down plants in America, \nthrow millions of people onto the streets in this country and move \nabroad--when they do that, their profits go up. And they are right. I \ngive them credit for that. That is right. That is what unfettered free \ntrade has meant in this country.\n  And on and on it goes. It is not just Mr. Immelt, the head of General \nElectric; it is not just Mr. Donohue, the head of the chamber of \ncommerce; it is major corporation after major corporation. It is Wall \nStreet. It is all of the moneyed interests. Before the agreement, they \ntell us as part of the discussion how many good jobs NAFTA is going to \ncreate, how many good jobs free trade with China will create, how many \ngood jobs the Korean trade agreement will create. After the agreement, \nword comes out: Hey, this is a good opportunity. Shut down in America, \ngo abroad, pay people pennies an hour, and bring your products back \ninto this country.\n  In 2011, we were told we just had to pass the South Korea Free Trade \nAgreement because of all the jobs it would create. Same arguments--\nanother free-trade agreement that is going to be great for the American \nworker. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce told us this free-trade agreement \ncould create some 280,000 jobs in America. Instead, the South Korea \nFree Trade Agreement has led to the loss of some 60,000 jobs and the \ntrade deficit with our country has gone from $16.6 billion in 2012 to \n$25 billion in 2014.\n  Now the administration, Wall Street, and the largest corporations in \nthis country are saying: Trust us. Forget about everything we said \nabout all of these other trade agreements. Yeah, maybe we were wrong on \nNAFTA. Maybe we were wrong on CAFTA. Maybe we were wrong on the China \nFree Trade Agreement. Maybe we were wrong on the South Korea Free Trade \nAgreement. But trust us, on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it is \ndifferent. This one really, really, really--cross our fingers--really \nis going to be different.\n  This one will support about, they say, some 650,000 American jobs. \nYou know, it is one thing to be fooled once. It is another thing to be \nfooled twice. It is another thing to be fooled three times. But there \ncomes a point where the American people are catching on that one of the \nreasons why the middle class of this country is disappearing, one of \nthe reasons why most or many of the new jobs being created are low wage \nand part time, one of the reasons why real inflation-accounted-for \nwages for American workers has plummeted is because of these disastrous \nfree-trade agreements. So you can fool me once. You can fool me twice. \nMaybe I am dumb and you can fool me three times. But there does come a \nlimit to how many times you think you can fool the American people.\n  When we talk about why the middle class of this country has been in \ndecline for the last 40 years, one of the important reasons is that \nsince 2001 we have lost nearly 60,000 factories in this country. Over \nthat same time period, we have lost over 4.7 million manufacturing \njobs. In 1970, 25 percent of all jobs in the United States were \nmanufacturing jobs. Today, that number is just 9 percent. In January of \n2001, there were 17.1 million manufacturing workers in this country. \nToday, there are only 12.3 million manufacturing workers.\n  In my small State of Vermont, we have lost 34 percent of our \nmanufacturing jobs over the past 14 years. In January of 2001, Vermont \nhad 47,000 factory jobs. Last February, it was down to 30,700. And that \nis true for virtually every State in this country.\n  Why is this significant? It is significant because historically \nmanufacturing jobs paid the highest wages available to blue-collar \nworkers. If you had a job at a manufacturing plant, if you had a union, \nthe likelihood was that you would earn decent wages, have decent \nbenefits, and you could actually support your family. You earned the \nwages that enabled you to take good care of your family. With the \ndecline of manufacturing, what has happened is we have seen a huge \nincrease in service industry jobs--McDonald's, Walmart--where wages are \nlow, benefits are nil, and American workers who work there are having a \nhard time surviving economically. Manufacturing goes down, people lose \ntheir jobs, wages go down, and new jobs are being created that pay \nsignificantly less than the jobs people used to have.\n  The fact is that TPP is just a new and easy way for corporations to \nship jobs overseas and force Americans to compete with low-wage workers \nin Vietnam and other countries. The minimum wage in Vietnam is 56 cents \nan hour. What this trade agreement says to American workers is, you are \nnow competing against people who in some cases will be working for 56 \ncents an hour. I think that is grossly unfair. We should not force \nAmerican workers into a race to the bottom.\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\n  Let's be clear. The TPP is much more than a free-trade agreement; it \nis part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large, \nmultinational corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs, \nundercutting workers' rights, dismantling labor, environmental, health, \nfood safety, and financial laws, and allowing corporations to challenge \nour laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.\n  The TPP is poised to be the largest free-trade agreement in history, \nencompassing 12 nations that account for roughly 40 percent of the \nglobal economy. That is why it has been referred to as ``NAFTA on \nsteroids.''\n  Incredibly, while Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, and major \nmedia companies have full knowledge as to what is in this treaty, the \nAmerican people and Members of Congress do not. They have been locked \nout of the process. While the full text of the TPP has not been made \npublic, there have been some leaks of what is included in it, and what \nI have seen is very disturbing.\n  It has been estimated by outside experts that the United States would \nlose more than 130,000 jobs to Vietnam and Japan alone if the TPP goes \ninto effect. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. At a time when \ncorporations have already outsourced over 3 million service sector jobs \nthat were in the United States, the TPP includes rules that will make \nit even easier for corporate America to outsource call centers, \ncomputer programming, engineering, accounting, and medical diagnostic \njobs. So these are not just manufacturing jobs; these are all kinds of \nother jobs which, if they can be done cheaper in other countries, will \nbe sent there.\n  Under TPP, Vietnamese companies would be able to compete with \nAmerican companies for Federal contracts funded by U.S. taxpayers, \nundermining American laws. The TPP will undermine U.S. sovereignty by \ngiving foreign corporations the right to challenge any law in this \ncountry that threatens their expected future profits before \ninternational tribunals. In other words, if we pass an increase in the \nminimum wage, under the TPP, Vietnamese companies that invest in \nAmerica could sue the United States in an international court full of \ncorporate lawyers if they believe it will hurt their profits. By the \nway, that is what this whole agreement is about--maximizing the \ninvestment profits of corporations from the United States and all over \nthe world.\n  If localities--local governments, state governments, federal \ngovernments--stand up and say: You know what, we want to protect \nhealth, and we want to protect the environment--if that impinges on the \nfuture profits of the corporation, it can take legal action against \nthat local, state, or federal agency. That may sound kind of crazy, but \nthat is exactly what has already happened in Egypt after it signed a \nfree-trade agreement with France. In 2012, a French utility company \nsued Egypt in an international tribunal for 82 million euros. And what \nwas Egypt's crime? For what were they being sued? They were being sued \nbecause they had increased their minimum wage, among other things. The \nFrench company saw raising the minimum wage for Egyptian workers--which \nis very low--as an impingement on their ability to make profits.\n  Further, large pharmaceutical companies are working hard to ensure \nthat the TPP extends the monopolies for their prescription drugs by \nextending patents that already can last for 20 years or more. Doctors \nWithout Borders--a heroic organization of doctors who go to some of the \nmost difficult, the poorest, the most dangerous parts of this world to \ntreat people who desperately need medical care--they are very brave \npeople. They wrote that ``the TPP agreement is on track to become the \nmost harmful trade pact ever for access to medicines in developing \ncountries.'' In other words, what the big pharmaceutical industry wants \nis for countries all over the world to have to pay top dollar for \nprescription drugs. They want to be able to maintain their patents for \nas long as possible and prevent those drugs from going generic, where \nthe prices would be significantly lower. The problem is that people in \npoor countries cannot pay a lot of money for their prescription drugs. \nSo if this agreement goes through and the pharmaceutical industry can \nforce poor countries to pay high prices for prescription drugs, people \nwill suffer and people will die.\n  After one disastrous trade agreement after another, I think it is \ntime for the American people and their elected officials to reassess \nhow we do trade in America. It is time to say we need trade agreements \nthat work for working people in this country and not just trade \nagreements that work for the CEOs of large, multinational corporations. \nIt is time to say to corporate America: If you want us to purchase your \nproducts, it is time you started manufacturing those products here in \nthe United States and not in low-wage countries all over the world.\n  The evidence is overwhelming. For decades, our trade policies have \nbeen responsible for lowering the standard of living of tens of \nmillions of Americans. People today all over this country are working \nlonger hours for lower wages. Most of the new jobs being created are \nlow-wage jobs, and many of them are part-time jobs.\n  We need to rebuild our manufacturing sector. To do that, we need a \nfundamental revision in our trade policies. NAFTA has failed. CAFTA has \nfailed. Permanent normal trade relations with China has failed. The \nKorea trade agreement has failed. It is basically insane to keep going \nwith the same type of trade policy that has failed and failed and \nfailed.\n  I hope very much that here in the Senate and in the House we can \ndefeat this TPP and come back to the table and develop a trade \nagreement that works for American workers, works for people all over \nthe world, and not continue these disastrous trade agreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I am glad that today the Senate will \ntake the long-overdue step forward and approve the Justice for Victims \nof Trafficking Act--bipartisan legislation that I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of that will help victims of human trafficking.\n  Montanans know firsthand the immeasurable damage human trafficking \nhas inflicted on our communities, our schools, and, most of all, the \nvictims of these horrific crimes. We also know the importance of coming \ntogether to support the victims of this modern-day slavery.\n  Too often, victims of human trafficking are underserved and fail to \nget the resources they so desperately need. This important bill will \nprovide our law enforcement officials and the communities with the \nnecessary tools to help lift these innocent victims out of the shadows.\n  Montanans understand the importance of cracking down on the \nperpetrators of these crimes and ensuring that we are serving as an \nadvocate for victims--without letting partisan politics get in the way.\n  I strongly urge all of my colleagues to come together today and do \nwhat is right for the victims of human trafficking and pass the Justice \nfor Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Airport Security\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, our Nation's airports are not secure. We \nwere rudely awakened to that fact last December when it was discovered \nthat for a several-month period at the Atlanta Airport, employees of \nthe airport--one in particular--since there was limited, if any, \nscreening of the airport employees coming into the airport, had \nconcocted a scheme with another fellow to transport guns to New York, \nwhere they were sold on the streets of Brooklyn.\n  The police couldn't figure out how in the world they were getting \nthese guns to New York because they kept watching the roads. It was in \nplain sight. What they were using were the defects in airport \nsecurity--if you can believe this--to bring guns to the Atlanta \nAirport. Then once at the airport, the airport employee would go up to \nthe sterile passenger area, where, in the restroom, he would meet a \npassenger who\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\ncame through security with an empty backpack and transfer the guns he \nhad brought onto the airport property to the passenger, who then would \ntake them on the flight from Atlanta to New York.\n  This went on for several months. This passenger even carried a \ncarbine. When he was arrested in December, he had 16 handguns in his \nbackpack on the airplane. It is a good thing these guys were criminals \nand not terrorists because you can imagine--this is exactly what we are \ntrying to prevent: weapons getting on airplanes.\n  Interestingly, when I got into this from the position of having the \nprivilege of being the ranking member of the commerce committee, where \nwe have jurisdiction over aviation, lo and behold, what I discovered in \nmy own State is that two airports had already solved the problem by \nincreasing security. The security we as passengers go through--they \nhave similar security for all airport employees. The first one to do \nthat was Miami International Airport back in 1999 after they discovered \na drug-smuggling ring. Instead of having hundreds of entry points into \nthe airport for employees, what they had was boiled down to a handful, \nwhere they screen the employees. It was then inaugurated by the Orlando \nInternational Airport after 2007 when they discovered a drug-smuggling \nring, and Orlando has boiled it down to about five entry points for \nairline employees. I went through those entry points at both Orlando \nand Miami, and it is not only what we go through as passengers, but \nthey also have to double-check that the person is who they say they \nare. They have their badge. The airport employee checks the photograph \non the badge with the person, and they swipe the card. In the case of \nthe Orlando Airport, they also have to punch in an identification \nnumber.\n  That seems to have solved the problem at those two huge airports, \nOrlando and Miami, but what about the other 448 commercial airports in \nthe United States? Are they going to be the victims? Are we, the \nAmerican traveling public, going to be the victims like they were in \nAtlanta?\n  In this age of terrorism, we cannot afford any of those mistakes. We \nhave been after the Department of Homeland Security and TSA to start \nchanging this. The Department of Homeland Security Secretary just \nannounced that they will take immediate steps to increase the screening \nof airport employees across the country because they indeed understand \nthis is a problem. They are going to have a comprehensive review. They \nare not saying they are going to require what Orlando and Miami do, but \nat the end of the day, they are going to have to end up doing that.\n  We have to simplify the system by boiling down the hundreds of entry \npoints to just a few, and then we have to put up screening devices \nsimilar to the ones passengers go through to go into a sterile \nenvironment.\n  I am very grateful to Secretary Johnson for calling on TSA to start \nthis immediate inquiry and to have some action. I hope the increased \nattention to this matter now will get airports and airport employees \nmore highly sensitized to what had been such a breach at the Atlanta \nAirport. If we can do this, then it will be another measure we can take \nto make sure the public is traveling safely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   United States-Canada Relationship\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, in 1941, in an address delivered at an \nevent in honor of the Canadian Prime Minister, Winston Churchill \nfamously declared, ``Canada is the linchpin of the English-speaking \nworld.'' As with most things, Churchill was able to see deeper truths \nand recognize Canada for what it really is. Today, I wish to recognize \nthe close and vital relationship between the United States and Canada, \nour great neighbor to the north. Canada is a critical partner to both \nAmerica and Arkansas. We ought to find every way to strengthen our \nrelationship and avoid every possible trouble on the horizon.\n  The bond between the United States and Canada starts with our common \nheritage and our common way of life, including individuals rights, \nconstitutional democracy, the rule of law, open markets, and the \ndefense of freedom around the world. Canada has stood with the United \nStates in our toughest hours to defend our common way of life. Canadian \ntroops fought alongside our GIs on D-day at Juno Beach, where 1 in \nevery 13 Canadians perished. After the 9/11 attacks, Canada was one of \nthe first countries to join our campaign in Afghanistan, where 158 \nbrave Canadians died on the battlefield--the rough equivalent of 1,400 \nAmerican troops. As with our own soldiers, we honor their ultimate \nsacrifice and entrust their families to the tender care of a loving \nprovidence.\n  Canada has also been a willing partner in many other security and \nhumanitarian operations around the globe, including Libya, Haiti, and \nthe NATO-led stabilization force in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990s. \nMoreover, Canada is part of the Five Eyes intelligence partnership, \nwhich has its roots in World War II. This partnership is vital to our \nnational security, helping, for example, to disrupt a 2013 Al Qaeda-\nassociated plot to derail a train traveling between New York and \nCanada. If successful, this attack could have killed dozens, perhaps \neven hundreds.\n  Canada and the United States also share the world's longest border--\nand the world's longest peaceful border. Over 300,000 people cross our \nshared border every day by every mode of transport. Americans too often \nforget ours is the most secure and mutually beneficial international \nrelationship among nations, taking for granted our peaceful partner to \nthe north. Our success as the global superpower and the ability to \nprotect our interests and global stability depends heavily on our \npeaceful and productive relationship with Canada. Without it, the New \nWorld would not be able to project power into the Old.\n  Our relationship with Canada is indeed productive, as Canada has \nremained our best and most important trading partner. Last year, $759 \nbillion in goods and services moved between Canada and the United \nStates. To put that into perspective, Canada purchased more goods from \nthe United States than did all 28 members of the European Union \ncombined and 2\\1/2\\ times more than did China. These purchases included \neverything from raw materials to paper produced in Ashdown, rice milled \nin Stuttgart, and construction hardware manufactured in Blytheville.\n  Moreover, Canada is the largest supplier of energy to the United \nStates. In January, in fact, the United States imported more oil from \nCanada than all OPEC countries combined, and Canada produces 97 percent \nof all U.S. natural gas imports. Of course, these numbers would be even \ngreater if President Obama would finally approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline which would also create thousands of high-paying American and \nCanadian jobs.\n  Arkansas, like America as a whole, has benefited immensely from our \nclose ties to Canada. Agricultural products, iron and steel produced in \nArkansas factories, and countless other products manufactured in the \nnatural state find their way to our friends in the north, providing \nArkansans with good customers and good jobs. Indeed, Canada is \nArkansas' No. 1 foreign customer and 66,000 Arkansas jobs depend on \nUnited States-Canada trade and investment, which totals $2.3 billion \nevery year.\n  Some of Arkansas' most recognizable names reflect these Arkansas-\nCanada ties. Murphy Oil, headquartered in El Dorado, has operated in \nCanada for over 60 years, producing oil and natural gas through stakes \nin several projects off the coast of Newfoundland and in Alberta and \nBritish Columbia. Walmart has also had a strong presence in Canada for \nover 20 years. Today, they employ over 90,000 Canadians across nearly \n400 retail stores. Tyson and Skippy Peanut Butter are just two of the \nhousehold names produced in Arkansas that are pantry staples in Canada. \nWith agricultural products making up nearly 20 percent of Arkansas' \nexports to Canada, Arkansas' ranchers and farmers help round out \nCanada's pantries and freezers.\n  Given these warm, longstanding ties to Canada, my team and I have \nworked\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\nclosely with the Canadian Embassy during my time in Congress to promote \nand strengthen our relationship. Unfortunately, the Obama \nadministration at times has impeded it. The Keystone Pipeline, for \ninstance, is not just good for American jobs but also a critical \nproject for Canada's economy. Yet President Obama dismissed it as mere \nCanadian oil from Canadian companies--cavalier comments that minimize \nthe pipeline's benefits for American workers, while also manifesting a \ncasual disregard for our close ally's interests.\n  Now we are seeing this neglect again with country-of-origin labeling \nrequirements for meat products processed in the United States which \nthreaten to disrupt trade between our two countries. These so-called \nCOOL regulations needlessly require different labeling for products \nborn, raised or slaughtered in either country. Today, processors are \nforced to either operate two production lines to keep their Canadian-\nborn or raised cattle separate from those born and raised in the United \nStates or maintain extensive records on where each head of cattle came \nfrom. These regulations unduly burden Canadian producers and American \nprocessors while also violating our treaty obligations. Yet they \ndeliver little value to consumers.\n  Yet, despite multiple adverse rulings from the World Trade \nOrganization, the administration continues to pursue appeals, a process \nwhich is expected to end next month. As a result of these trade \nbarriers and WTO rulings, Canada may be forced to impose reciprocal \ntrade barriers on American products. Unfortunately, products already \ntargeted for trade barriers include Arkansas rice, poultry, grains, and \nbeef. If the administration does not relent, nearly $130 million in \nArkansas agricultural trade with Canada will be threatened--more than \nhalf our State's annual total.\n  We should put a stop now to this trade dispute that no one intended \nand no one wants. I stand ready to work with my fellow Senators and the \nadministration to modify the labeling requirements at the earliest \nopportunity following a final WTO ruling. It will be good for Arkansas' \nfarmers and ranchers, good for American consumers, and good for the \nhealth of the United States-Canada partnership. Let's work together to \nfix this problem, protect American jobs, and help our neighbor to the \nnorth remain our linchpin in the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n           Commemorating National Crime Victims' Rights Week\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have commemorated National Crime \nVictims' Rights Week every April since 1981. This year it takes place \nfrom April 19 through April 25.\n  This week is dedicated to remembering victims of crime, building \nawareness, and advocating for victims' rights. It is also an \nopportunity to pay tribute to the millions of Americans and thousands \nof Iowans who fall victim to senseless acts of crime each year.\n  On Monday I introduced a bipartisan resolution commemorating National \nCrime Victims' Rights Week, and I am happy that my colleagues have \njoined me by unanimously passing this resolution this morning.\n  The theme for this week, ``Engaging Communities. Empowering \nVictims,'' recognizes the importance of offering the support necessary \nto help crime survivors heal.\n  During this week we also remember the contributions of the countless \ncrisis hotline volunteers and staff, victims' rights attorneys, medical \nprofessionals, and emergency responders who provide critical assistance \nto survivors of crime every hour, every day in communities across the \nUnited States.\n  The Judiciary Committee has worked to strengthen Federal laws and \ndirect resources to efforts to prevent crime from occurring in the \nfirst place. And, although we still have a way to go to ensure that all \ncrime survivors are treated with appropriate fairness and respect in \nthe criminal justice system, I am proud that we have made important \nstrides toward this goal.\n  An important issue for many crime victims is restitution. It is an \nissue that would be addressed by the ``Amy and Vicky Child Pornography \nVictim Restitution Improvement Act,'' a bill introduced by Senator \nHatch that has my strong support.\n  The Judiciary Committee, of which I serve as chairman, reported this \nbill on February 5. If enacted, the measure, which passed the full \nSenate by a vote of 98-0 on February 11, would reverse a Supreme Court \ndecision that limits the amount of restitution that victims of child \npornography can recover from any one perpetrator.\n  It would ensure that victims can recover a minimum amount of damages \nfor certain child pornography offenses, and it also would make any \nsingle perpetrator potentially responsible for the full damages that \nresult from an offense involving multiple perpetrators.\n  Americans also deserve to know that we are doing everything possible \nto prevent sexual assault, especially in our most acclaimed \ninstitutions of society, including college campuses and our Nation's \nmilitary. In fact, a zero tolerance standard needs to be set at the \nhighest levels of the Federal government.\n  Take, for example, the lack of accountability within some of our \nNation's Federal law enforcement entities. In the last few years, a \nstring of sex scandals involving prostitutes being solicited by public \nservants working for the FBI, Secret Service and, most recently, the \nDrug Enforcement Administration reflect an embarrassing lack of ethics \nand moral code of conduct by Federal agents hired to flush out illicit \ncriminal activity at home and abroad.\n  It should go without saying that this type of conduct by Federal law \nenforcement personnel--on or off the clock--cannot be tolerated. This \nbehavior telegraphs the wrong message about acceptable sexual conduct \nto society and contributes to the demand for the human sex trade around \nthe world.\n  I supported the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act \nof 2000, and earlier this year I chaired a Senate Judiciary Committee \nhearing on human trafficking, where witnesses discussed the \nconsequences of sex trafficking for both child and adult victims.\n  The witnesses at this hearing, which took place on February 24, 2015, \nalso testified in support of several measures that would help us \nfurther combat the various forms of human trafficking in the United \nStates.\n  One of these measures is the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \nwhich is now pending on the Senate floor, and of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  It is vitally important that we pass this legislation, which would \nauthorize much needed services to victims of child pornography as well \nas labor and sex trafficking.\n  The bill also equips law enforcement with new tools for prosecuting \nhuman trafficking offenses and recognizes that the production of child \npornography is a form of human trafficking.\n  Also, earlier this year, I introduced the Combating Human Trafficking \nAct. Among other things, the bill would clarify that Federal grant \nresources can be used to meet the housing needs of human trafficking \nvictims and offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those \nwho offer services to runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth.\n  I led the Judiciary Committee in supporting the inclusion of this \nlegislation as an amendment to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct during committee consideration of that bill.\n  The committee accepted the measure by voice vote on February 26. The \ncommittee reported the bill to the Senate floor by a vote of 19-0.\n  I am grateful we have been able to reach an agreement that will \nfinally allow a vote on this very important legislation, and I look \nforward to casting my vote in favor of this bill.\n  Our next challenge should be to address the two broken systems of \njustice found on our college campuses and within our military \ninstitutions. First, a flawed reporting system on college campuses \nrequires a stronger set of tools that would help survivors of sexual \nassault as well as protect the rights of the accused. That is why I \nhave cosponsored the ``Campus Accountability and Safety Act'' with \nSenator McCaskill.\n  It would establish new campus resources and support services for \nstudents, including: a requirement that colleges designate a \nconfidential advisor for survivors of sexual violence; new transparency \nand reporting requirements; coordination between colleges and local law \nenforcement; and\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\nprotections for due process rights of survivors and the accused.\n  It would also increase financial penalties for colleges found not in \ncompliance with the new standards.\n  Cases of sexual assault, which too often go unreported on college \ncampuses and in our own communities, require sustained, collective \nattention by policymakers, law enforcement, advocates, and survivors.\n  Every student who heads off to a college campus in America deserves \nto know that there is a system in place to secure justice and due \nprocess for the victim and the accused.\n  Likewise, every young man and woman who serves his or her country in \nuniform deserves to know that sexual assault is a crime and will be \ntreated and prosecuted as such.\n  In the last Congress, I cosponsored the bipartisan ``Military Justice \nImprovement Act'' with Senator Gillibrand.\n  The bill would empower enlisted soldiers and sailors to come forward \nand report a sexual crime.\n  It would create an independent system of justice within the ranks of \nthe military.\n  It would remove the chain of command from prosecutorial decisions \nregarding sexual assault.\n  The fear of retaliation and retribution in the military has been a \nreality for too many survivors of sexual assault. The current system \nhas created an environment that emboldens predators instead of \nempowering victims.\n  Barring access to fair and impartial justice pours salt in the wounds \nof those who have suffered immeasurable indignity and harm while \nserving their country in uniform. I will continue working to advance \nbipartisan measures through Congress to send a clear message. Sexual \nassault is a crime.\n  The sooner our culture and systems of justice on college campuses and \nin the Nation's military work together to deter, prosecute, and stop \nsexual violence, the safer our society will be for America's sons and \ndaughters growing up in the 21st century.\n  In closing, crime victims and survivors in the United States deserve \nour assistance in helping them cope with the often devastating \nconsequences of crime. That is why it is so important that we support \nthe mission and goals of National Crime Victims' Rights Week.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting \npassage of this resolution.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 273, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, for the leader, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 273 with the \nchanges that are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Kirk, for \n     himself and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     273, as modified.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a penalty \n for knowingly selling advertising that offers certain commercial sex \n                                 acts)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SECTION __. SAVE ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Stop \n     Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015'' or the \n     ``SAVE Act of 2015''.\n       (b) Advertising That Offers Certain Commercial Acts.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1591(a)(1) of title 18, United \n     States Code, as amended by this Act, is further amended by \n     inserting ``advertises,'' after ``obtains,''.\n       (2) Mens rea requirement.--Section 1591(a) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended in the undesignated matter \n     following paragraph (2), by inserting ``, except where the \n     act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is \n     advertising,'' after ``knowing, or''.\n       (3) Conforming amendments.--Section 1591(b) of title 18, \n     United States Code, as amended by this Act, is further \n     amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``advertised,'' after \n     ``obtained,''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``advertised,'' after \n     ``obtained,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to speak in support \nof my amendment No. 294 to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. \nIt is important as part of our duties as stewards of the taxpayer money \nto ensure that the Federal Government is running as efficiently as \npossible. This is rooting out waste, duplications, and overlap where we \nfind it in the Federal Government and in these programs.\n  This amendment simply requires the GAO--the Government Accountability \nOffice--to study the programs and initiatives which are affected by \nthis bill and those which are related to services for trafficking \nvictims and other victims services. In particular, the amendment \ndirects GAO to look for duplication and overlap and requires GAO to \nissue a report to Congress describing costs associated with them and to \nmake recommendations on how to achieve cost savings.\n  I do support this legislation. I voted for it when it was considered \nby the Judiciary Committee. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that \nother programs that are affected by this legislation are studied to \nmake sure we don't have duplication, that we don't have other programs \nthat are doing the same things. We need to make sure we are good \nstewards of the taxpayers' money. The GAO has considerable experience \nof this kind to do this type of analysis.\n  I look forward to having support for this amendment, and I ask my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to thank my \ncolleagues and to ask for their support for our first amendment, \nKlobuchar amendment No. 296. I understand it is going to be by voice \nvote, and it is something I have worked on for a long time.\n  I know everyone has put a lot of effort into this bill--certainly \nSenator Cornyn and I have--and we are very pleased that it is moving \nforward. I thank all my colleagues for their work.\n  This afternoon, I know we will be considering a number of important \namendments, and, as I mentioned, one is the safe harbor legislation. I \nthink we have 26 cosponsors on the bill.\n  Let's first get to why we are doing this bill. The United Nations \nconsiders human trafficking to be one of the three largest criminal \nenterprises in the world. The first is illegal trafficking of drugs, \nthe second is illegal trafficking of guns, and the third is illegal \ntrafficking of humans. It is not just something, as we know, that is \nhappening in faraway lands. It happens in our own backyards. It has \nhappened to 12-year-olds in my own State. As Senator Heitkamp knows, it \nhappens in the oil patches of North Dakota. That is why this bill and \nthis amendment No. 296, which passed with the bill unanimously through \nthe Judiciary Committee, are so important.\n  This is about treating the children who are victims of these crimes \nas victims because that is what they are. Right now, in many States \naround the country, these kids can still be prosecuted.\n  In a State such as mine, the State of Minnesota, we have in place a \nsafe harbor law that has been very effective. Why? One, it gives the \nkids the services they need, whether it is through child protection, \nwhether it is housing, whether it is getting the kind of medical care \nthey need. That is what our bill does. On the other hand, if you just \nprosecute these kids, do you actually think they are going to turn \nagainst the person running the sex ring? Are they going to turn against \nthe pimp? No. They are going to go right back into the hands of the \nperson they were with--the perpetrator--to begin with. In our State, we \nhave had a lot of success with this safe harbor law. We have obtained \none of the longest sentences ever--40 years--against someone who was \nrunning a sex ring because we give help to the victims of the crime.\n  As I said, there are 26 of my colleagues across the Senate who have \ncosponsored the bill. It has been an honor to work on the issue with \nSamantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nUnited Nations, and Cindy McCain, wife of our colleague Senator McCain. \nSenator Heitkamp, Cindy McCain, and I went down to Mexico to talk with \nthem about the partnership we have in going after these cases.\n  The amendment has the support of the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, Shared Hope International, and the \nNational Alliance to End Sexual Violence.\n  As I said, this bill and this amendment simply create an incentive \nfor States across the country to enact a safe harbor law. Fifteen \nStates already have these laws. Another 12 States are making progress \nin that direction. The House passed a similar bill last year under the \nleadership of Erik Paulsen, one of the Congressmen from Minnesota.\n  Secondly, in addition to creating an incentive for these States to \nenact safe harbor laws, the bill also creates a national strategy to \ncombat human trafficking. The national strategy will encourage \ncooperation and coordination among all the agencies that work on this \nproblem--Federal, State, tribal, and local. That is a major part of the \nbill, and it wasn't in the House bill. We think it is very important.\n  The bill also gives sex trafficking victims the right support they \nneed. It qualifies them for job-training programs. The bill allows \nvictims of sex trafficking to participate in the Job Corps program to \nhelp them get back on their feet.\n  Senator Cornyn, who is the lead Republican on this amendment, and I \nwere pleased to include a provision that Senators Whitehouse and \nSessions have been working on to clarify the authority of the U.S. \nMarshals Service to assist local law enforcement agencies in locating \nmissing children.\n  That is what the amendment does. There are incentives for the safe \nharbor laws we have already seen in 15 States. There is a national sex \ntrafficking strategy, which is something we dearly need as we see an \nincrease in these kinds of crimes. It qualifies victims of these crimes \nfor job-training programs. Finally, there is a provision to make it \neasier for the U.S. Marshals Service to assist local law enforcement, a \nmeasure proposed by Senator Whitehouse and Senator Sessions which is \nincluded in this amendment and which came through the committee.\n  I want to end by telling you what this is about. It is about a 12-\nyear-old girl in Rochester who got a text message. The text message \nsaid she was invited to a party. The text said to go meet in a parking \nlot. She went there, and then she was thrown into a car, brought up to \nthe Twin Cities, raped by a man, then sold on craigslist, sold for sex, \nand raped by two other men. Finally, weeks later, the guy who did this \nwas found, and he is being prosecuted federally.\n  That is what this is about. These are serious crimes. The average age \nof a victim is 12 years old--not even old enough to go to a high school \nprom, not old enough to get a driver's license.\n  Again, I thank Senator Cornyn for his work. We worked together on \nboth the bill as well as this amendment we are considering today. This \nhas been a lot of work the last month, but I am so pleased we are \nadvancing this important trafficking bill.\n  I see that the Senator from Maine is here. She has also been a leader \nin this area.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, let me commend Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar for the \nwork they have done on this antitrafficking bill.\n  This is, in fact, a horrendous crime. Just a few months ago in my \nhome State, in Bangor, a couple was arrested for allegedly trafficking \na 13-year-old girl. That is what we are talking about, and that is why \nthis legislation is so important.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill, and I commend Senator \nCornyn and Senator Klobuchar and others for working so hard on it.\n  The antitrafficking bill deals with the law enforcement piece of this \nhorrendous problem. But we also need to pay attention to prevention \nprograms. That is why this afternoon we will vote on a proposal that \nSenator Leahy and I, along with Senators Heitkamp, Ayotte, Murkowski, \nand Baldwin, have put forth to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act programs, which already have expired. They expired in 2013.\n\n  These are absolutely critical programs for preventing homeless youth \nand runaway youth from ending up in the hands of sex traffickers. The \nrunaway and homeless youth programs are comprised of three programs: \nthe Street Outreach Program, the Basic Center Program, and the \nTransitional Living Program. They have helped thousands of our homeless \nyouth meet their immediate needs and provided long-term residential \nservices for those who, sadly, cannot be reunited with their families.\n  The amendment that we are offering complements the underlying bill by \naddressing prevention, intervention, and recovery service for \ntrafficking victims, particularly among the most vulnerable \npopulation--our homeless youth.\n  According to a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine and the \nNational Research Council, homelessness is one of the most common risk \nfactors for sex trafficking. Without access to food, shelter, and \nsocial supports, homeless young people often turn to what is termed \n``survival sex;'' that is, a way to trade sex for a place to sleep, for \nfood, and for other basic necessities.\n  Another recent report found that one in four homeless youth are \nvictims of sex trafficking or engage in survival sex. Our amendment \nstrengthens the existing programs by ensuring that service providers \nknow how to identify trafficking victims and give these youth the \nsupport they need. In many cases these services can prevent these \nhomeless and runaway youth from becoming victims in the first place.\n  In Maine, our homeless shelters are critical partners in the fight to \nend human trafficking. In Portland, for example, the Preble Street \nResource Center has used Runaway and Homeless Youth Act resources to \nconnect youth who need food, shelter, health services, and educational \nsupport. The Preble Street Anti-trafficking Coalition is currently \nhelping approximately 50 trafficking victims whose ages range from 14 \nto 42. They enable them to start new lives.\n  New Beginnings, a great program in Lewiston, ME, and the Shaw House \nin Bangor, ME, are other organizations that have successfully leveraged \nFederal grants from the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program to provide \nshelter and services to homeless youth in my State. With this kind of \nsupport, young people can make their way off the street and away from \ncriminals who will exploit them at a time when they are at their most \nvulnerable.\n  There are more than 1.6 million homeless teens in our country--a \ntruly astonishing number. A growing number of these homeless youth \nidentify themselves as LGBT. It is estimated that up to 40 percent of \nrunaway or homeless youth are LGBT. Some of them have been kicked out \nof their own homes. Others have felt that there has been no place for \nthem in their community. Our amendment would help ensure that those \nseeking services through the federally funded programs are not denied \nassistance based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, \nsexual orientation, gender identity or disability.\n  All homeless young people need access to safe beds at night and \nservices during the day so that they never have to choose between \nselling their bodies and a safe place to sleep. I would like to thank \nSenator Leahy and Senator Heitkamp for being so passionate about this \nissue. They have worked with me to incorporate important feedback into \nour amendment, particularly from faith-based organizations.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, a letter be printed that I have from numerous \nfaith-based organizations endorsing our amendment. These organizations \nrepresent millions of people in all 50 States. They urge us to pass our \nlegislation with that nondiscrimination clause intact.\n  They include, for example: Covenant House International, the \nEvangelical Lutheran Church of America, the Interfaith Alliance, the \nNational Council of Jewish Women, the Metropolitan Community Churches, \nthe Methodist Federation for Social Action, the\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nUnited Church of Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries, and many \nothers that are backing our amendment.\n  We have clarified that providers can still provide and offer sex-\nspecific shelters and programming. By that, I mean all-girl shelters or \nall-boy shelters. The nondiscrimination clause is modeled--it is \nvirtually identical to a provision enacted into law during the last \nCongress through the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act. Nothing, \nnothing in our amendment alters the ability of faith-based providers to \ngive preference in hiring to people of their same faith.\n  The stand-alone bill on which our amendment is based was reported out \nof the Judiciary Committee last Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote of 15 to 3. It has the support of nearly 270 organizations \nincluding, as I mentioned, many faith-based providers that serve \nhomeless youth, other service providers, and antitrafficking groups. \nThey all strongly support the reauthorization of these prevention, \nintervention, and treatment programs.\n  Our health care workers in Maine are also tremendous partners in \nhelping to address trafficking crimes and their victims. Saint Joseph \nHospital in Bangor has educated its clinicians to identify the signs of \nhuman trafficking among their patients. Congress must do more both to \nprovide law enforcement with the tools it needs to pursue sex \ntrafficking, but we cannot forget those prevention and intervention \nprograms that are provided by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program.\n  By giving homeless youth the support and the services they need, we \ncan help prevent them from becoming trafficked in the first place. \nThese programs have provided lifesaving services and housing for \nAmerica's homeless and runaway youth for 40 years. They are vital in \naddressing this serious problem. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment that Senator Leahy and I, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Ayotte, \nSenator Murkowski, and Senator Baldwin are offering today. It is so \nimportant.\n  Again, I want to especially thank Senator Heitkamp for all of her \nadvocacy. She has done tremendous work.\n  I am very happy to yield the floor for her.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   March 11, 2015.\n       Dear Senators: As faith-based organizations representing \n     millions of people in all 50 states across our nation, we are \n     writing today regarding the Runaway Homeless Youth and \n     Trafficking Prevention Act. Based on the values of our \n     diverse faith traditions, we are committed to ensuring that \n     all victims of violence have equal access to justice, strong \n     legal protections and can access the lifesaving services they \n     need to move from crisis to stability. We urge you to pass \n     this legislation with the nondiscrimination clause intact. \n     Federal funds should not be used to discriminate.\n       In times of crisis, victims often turn to their faith \n     communities and leaders for guidance and support. Faith \n     leaders are on the front lines each day identifying victims, \n     providing refuge, referring victims and their families to \n     programs and services for homeless and trafficked youth, and \n     offering hope and healing. Part of meeting these needs \n     includes respecting the religious liberty of those receiving \n     services.\n       A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and \n     Human Services found that 46% of homeless youth had run away \n     from home because of physical abuse and 17% because of sexual \n     abuse. A growing number of homeless youth identify as LGBT, \n     and it is estimated that they comprise up to 40% of the \n     runaway homeless youth (RHY) population. We believe that ALL \n     vulnerable young people should have access to programs \n     designed to stop the cycle of victimization and provide \n     comprehensive solutions. Federal grantees must be prohibited \n     from discriminating against any youth based on their sexual \n     orientation or gender identity.\n       Thank you for your steadfast commitment to working with \n     faith communities to support vulnerable young people and \n     victims of trafficking. We look forward to working with you \n     to swiftly pass the Runaway Homeless Youth and Trafficking \n     Prevention Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       Catholics for Choice, Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, \n     Covenant House International, Evangelical Lutheran Church of \n     America, Global Faith and Justice Project, Global Justice \n     Institute, Interfaith Alliance, Jewish Labor Committee \n     Western Region, Methodist Federation for Social Action, \n     Metropolitan Community Churches, National Council of Jewish \n     Women;\n       National Center for Housing and Child Welfare, Religious \n     Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Religious Institute, \n     Society for Humanistic Judaism, The General Board of Church \n     and Society, United Methodist Church, The Jewish Federations \n     of North America, T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, \n     Unitarian Universalist Association, Unitarian Universalist \n     Women's Federation, United Church of Christ, Justice and \n     Witness Ministries, Women's League for Conservative Judaism.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to all of the \naccolades that have been expressed today to Senator Cornyn and Senator \nKlobuchar for giving a voice to the victims of the most horrific crime \nthat occurs in our country; those are the victims of human trafficking. \nWithout their hard work, without their advocacy, we would not be \ndebating this on the floor of the Senate. So it is so important to \nacknowledge that work and to advance the cause by working together.\n  Today, I wish to speak to amendment No. 290, which is the Collins-\nLeahy runaway and homeless youth amendment. I want to thank Senator \nCollins and Senator Leahy for being such fierce advocates for runaway \nand homeless youth. I have had years of experience working with victims \nand vulnerable youth. I can tell you based on this experience that this \namendment is the most critical piece that we are considering today to \ntruly address prevention and early intervention for a population that \nis the most susceptible to being trafficked; that is the population of \nrunaway and homeless youth.\n  It is a story I believe is too often told. It is a story of a runaway \nand homeless youth engaging in survival sex, being coerced into \ncriminal activity by people offering nothing more than a roof over \ntheir head or maybe even a meal. Since 1995, North Dakota has received \n$11.5 million in this very critical and important prevention program. \nHow many of these children have we rescued from a life of despair? We \nwill never know.\n  But I am certain, telling those stories and visiting them in the \nshelters and in their apartments that are transitory living situations, \nthat they would otherwise be so extraordinarily vulnerable. I have \nheard firsthand the stories of these homeless and runaway youth. The \nstories that you hear are literally heartbreaking. With prior physical, \nmental, and sexual abuse, these runaway and homeless youth have already \nbeen devalued. They have already been told that they are not worth what \nother children are worth. They have substance addictions. They have \nbeen shunned by their family or communities for who they are and how \nthey identify. They are the most marginalized children in our country.\n  Last July, a 13-year-old runaway from Minneapolis was picked up by \nher traffickers in the Cities and then worked her way across--she was \nheading off to the oil patch in western North Dakota. She stopped in \nFargo-Moorhead to make some money on the way, being trafficked by a man \nwho was selling a 13-year old for sex online through backpage.com. \nFargo-Moorhead law enforcement set up a sting and rescued the victim \nand arrested the trafficker.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, there was another tragic story of a 14-year old--a \n14-year old runaway from Las Vegas. Her parents did not know where she \nwas. She got mixed up in the wrong crowd. She was put in a car and \ntaken to Minot, ND. Her mother, desperate to find her, searched through \nher email records, found a connection to Backpage, and saw that her \ndaughter was being advertised on Backpage in Minot, ND. She called the \nlocal authorities. The local authorities were able to rescue her.\n  She was rescued with a 16-year-old and returned to Las Vegas. She is \nnow with her mother. The 16-year-old got off the plane and ran--got off \nthe plane and ran. There was no hope for her, no place to return that \nwas welcoming, no mother who searched for her on the Internet and found \nher.\n  As we work through these stories, I want you to think about what is \nthe common element, what is the common factor. You look behind these \nstories, and you will see in these stories of trafficking runaway and \nhomeless youth--runaway and homeless youth--vulnerable, on the street, \nsusceptible to a warm bed, susceptible to a hot meal, susceptible to \nany kind of love and comfort they can find, only to find out that it \nmight be their worst nightmare.\n  They are trapped, and where do they go? Where do they go if there is \nnot a program for runaway and homeless\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\nyouth? Where do they go if someone is not reaching out a hand? So what \nhas become a common recurring fact of these offenders or these victims \nis that they have been thrown away or they are runaways.\n  Forty percent, we estimate, of these children, identify themselves as \ngay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual youth.\n  If we pass an amendment that doesn't have protection for this \npopulation, that doesn't have protection for these children, what is \nthe message? The message is the message that has been reinforced their \nentire life, which is that they are not worthy of help, they are not \nworthy of being treated as all other children are.\n  So this Senate will reinforce the recurring message that is so \ntragically identified and so tragically delivered to these children \nevery day.\n  I urge my colleagues, I beg my colleagues to please recognize the \nworth of all children. Recognize the vulnerability of this population \nof children.\n  Vote with us to support the Leahy-Collins amendment. It is so \ncritical to sending the right message, so critical to giving the right \nservices, but so critical to sending the right message that all \nchildren matter and that we in the Senate do not see or discriminate. \nWhat we do is we help provide shelter to the most vulnerable among us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for her very, very \nstrong statement.\n  We sometimes talk about numbers and this and that. It is when you \ntalk about real cases that we understand what we are talking about \nhere. We are going to consider two amendments related to preventing \nhuman trafficking of runaway and homeless youth.\n  Senator Cornyn's amendment speaks to this effort, but it is not a \nmeaningful alternative to the comprehensive amendment that Senator \nCollins and I will offer. Our amendment No. 290, the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, has the support of 30 \nbipartisan cosponsors.\n  Senator Cornyn has said that no effort to end human trafficking can \nbe complete without addressing the needs of runaway and homeless youth. \nI agree and that is why amendment No. 290 is so important. In fact, \nwhen the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on this legislation last \nyear, it received the vote of almost every single member, including \nSenator Cornyn.\n  In our hearings since then, I have listened to the stories of \nsurvivors. Some have been in my office and some have been in the \noffices of other Senators, and they talked about this. So many of them \nbegin the same way. They are a homeless or a runaway teen, scared, \ndesperate for affection and a safe place to sleep, especially if they \nare somewhere in inclement weather.\n  Traffickers know this. They prey on that desperation. They know there \nare so very few places these children can turn to.\n  A recent survey found that one in four--now, think of this--homeless \nyouth had been victims of sex trafficking or they have traded sex for \nsurvival needs such as food or a place to sleep. Just think of this. \nThey are the age of our children or our grandchildren.\n  This is a human issue. In fact, a survey found that 50 percent of \nhomeless youth had been solicited for sex by an adult within 48 hours \nof leaving home. Just think of that--half of these homeless kids were \nsolicited by an adult within the first 2 days of leaving home.\n  I am talking about kids 12, 13, 14 years old. They have nowhere to \ngo, but we can at least, through this legislation, make sure they have \na safe place to turn. That is what our amendment does.\n  Senator Cornyn's amendment is not a good alternative. The amendment I \nam offering assures that homeless youth providers are specifically \ntrained to recognize victims of trafficking, address the unique trauma, \nand refer them to the appropriate care and services.\n  It also lengthens the time they can stay in shelters or receive \nservices. Look at what happens if they are forced back out of those \nshelters. How long does it take for traffickers to grab them?\n  The amendment includes important new efforts to encourage family \nreunification and allows the person to define the people they consider \nfamily. This is particularly important as runaway children are often \nestranged from their parents.\n  Senator Cornyn's amendment does not have the crucial \nnondiscrimination provision that is in my amendment. This language \nwould prevent the discrimination against youth based on their race, \ntheir color, their religion, their national origin, their sex, their \ngender identity, their sexual orientation, or their disability.\n  It is almost identical to a provision contained in the bipartisan \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which passed the \nSenate with 78 votes. It passed the Republican-controlled House \noverwhelmingly and was signed into law.\n  You may not like to think about this, but the reason this language is \nparticularly important is because a growing number of these homeless \nand runaway youth identify as LGBT.\n  Many, sadly, have been thrown out of their homes precisely for that \nreason. They have been rejected by their parents. No child should face \nthat kind of isolation or rejection--no matter what.\n  I am a parent. I am a grandparent. I find it heartbreaking that a \nchild could be turned out of their home and then turned away by a \nservice provider. We shouldn't allow organizations to take Federal \nfunds and then turn their backs against these kids because of their \nrace or their religion or whom they love. That is why I can't \nunderstand why the side-by-side amendment offered had the \nnondiscrimination protections for these children stripped from it.\n  I urge all Senators to support my bipartisan amendment.\n  I thank Senators Collins and Heitkamp for their steadfast and very \nstrong support. We have to support the efforts of dedicated service \nproviders. They make these programs work. We have to protect these \nkids. The most important thing is not being in a position where the \nonly time we can act or is after someone has been trafficked. Let's \nprevent them from being trafficked in the first place.\n  Prevention will cost money, but it is going to save lives, and it is \ngoing to prevent the far more costly effects of human trafficking. This \nis smart money--we ought to be able and ready to invest in our \nchildren. We have to include the Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act in our efforts to prevent more of our kids \nfrom becoming victims.\n  I have said it so many times on this floor that I almost grow weary \nof hearing myself saying it. I have prosecuted some of these cases. And \nit was nowhere near the problem, when I was a prosecutor, that it is \ntoday throughout this country.\n  I still have nightmares from what we saw. This Senator hopes that \nsomeday, under this legislation, if we work hard enough, none of us \nwill have these nightmares.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the question really comes down to this: \nDo we want provider services to homeless and runaway youth to be able \nto turn away at the door a 13-year-old girl simply because of her \nsexual orientation? That is what this comes down to, and I think the \nanswer is no if that provider is receiving Federal funds. It shouldn't \nmatter, and we should be willing to stand and say that we want to help \nall youth stay out of the clutches of these truly evil sex traffickers. \nThat is what this is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 290\n\n       (Purpose: To reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth \n     Act)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up amendment No. 290.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. \n     Heitkamp, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Merkley, \n     Mr. Schatz, Mr. Booker, and Ms. Klobuchar, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 290.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of March 11, 2015, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly in support of the \nremarks of the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Vermont.\n  The Cornyn approach on runaway and homeless youth excludes language \nthat would prohibit discrimination against the recipients of these \nservices because of their sexual orientation. How can we have reached \nthat point in the Senate?\n  Haven't we engaged in a national debate that centered on Indiana and \nother States? Haven't we decided in America that, regardless, we aren't \ngoing to allow discrimination against people because of sexual \norientation? Sadly, this Cornyn amendment excludes language that \nprohibits discrimination against LGBT youth.\n  Secondly, to fund a less than $1 billion a year program, the Senator \nfrom Texas is eliminating a $10 billion health prevention fund, which \nserves 50 States to deal with infectious disease and serious health \nissues.\n  This is, sadly, an effort to attack ObamaCare, and it shouldn't be \ndone in this important legislation. We have wasted 4 weeks on an \nextraneous issue. Let us stick to the basic issue before us.\n  Defeat the Cornyn amendment and support the amendment being offered \nby Senator Collins and Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1127\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1127.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH ACT REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       (a) Reauthorization.--Section 388(a) of the Runaway and \n     Homeless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5751(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``for fiscal year 2009,'' \n     and all that follows through the period and inserting ``for \n     each of fiscal years 2016 through 2020.'';\n       (2) in paragraph (3)(B), by striking ``such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and \n     2013.'' and inserting ``$2,000,000 for each of fiscal years \n     2016 through 2020.' ''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (4), by striking ``for fiscal year 2009'' \n     and all that follows through the period and inserting `` `for \n     each of fiscal years 2016 through 2020.''.\n       (b) Offset; Repealing Prevention and Public Health Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 4002 of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 300u-11) is repealed.\n       (2) Rescission of unobligated funds.--Of the funds made \n     available under such section 4002, the unobligated balances \n     are rescinded.\n       (3) Effective date.--This subsection takes effect on \n     October 1, 2015.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I could just say in the next 30 seconds \nor so that the first amendment we will vote on reauthorizes the Runaway \nand Homeless Youth Act, which is something that we all support, which \npermits treatment of victims of human trafficking without \ndiscrimination. It also happens to be paid for, something that the \nLeahy amendment is not.\n  Right now, most faith-based organizations, such as Catholic \nCharities, treat all victims of human trafficking without regard to \nsexual orientation, gender issues, and the like--as I am proud to say \nthey should.\n  But there is nothing--we have been told that the various faith-based \norganizations worry that the Federal Government is basically going to \nintervene and tell them whom they can hire and what their \nadministration and implementation practices must be. That is why almost \nuniformly, faith-based organizations that would be eligible for the \ngrants to help the victims of human trafficking say that this would \nrender this administration of this victims trafficking fund legislation \nunworkable.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Cornyn amendment, to vote against \nthe Leahy amendment, and let's get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining in opposition.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in opposition to the Cornyn amendment, let \nme say this. Up to forty percent of the overall homeless youth \npopulation identify as LGBT, and many have reported that they have been \nsubjected to service denial and discrimination by staff and providers \nbased on their sexual orientation. The Leahy-Collins alternative \nexpressly prohibits discrimination against youth because of their \nsexual orientation. That should be the gold standard.\n  Defeat the Cornyn amendment and vote for the bipartisan Collins-Leahy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1127, offered by the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, my bipartisan amendment to prevent human \ntrafficking includes important language to prohibit discrimination \nagainst homeless children.\n  The language should be familiar to most Senators here. It is nearly \nidentical to what we voted for overwhelmingly as part of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act reauthorization 2 years\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\nago. It shouldn't be controversial. We should reaffirm our commitment \nto nondiscrimination. All children--all children--deserve our \nprotection. We should not be picking and choosing, saying: This child \ndeserves protection, this one doesn't. They all deserve our protection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I urge a ``no'' vote on the Leahy \namendment.\n  I agree with the senior Senator from Vermont that all victims of \nhuman trafficking should be treated with the dignity they deserve \nwithout regard to sexual orientation or any discrimination. That is \nwhat the Cornyn amendment we just voted on would do.\n  What we are told by faith-based organizations that provide many of \nthese services is that the Leahy language would make rendition of those \nservices difficult, if not impossible. There is some debate whether it \nwould also intrude on hiring practices and whether people could \nactually be hired in faith-based organizations if they didn't agree \nwith some of the services that are rendered here.\n  Finally, the Leahy amendment would authorize $115 million of spending \nthat it is not paid for and thus would increase the deficit. A number \nof organizations, such as the Conference of Catholic Bishops, the \nNational Religious Broadcasters, National Association of Evangelicals, \namong other religious organizations, urge a ``no'' vote on the Leahy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the question before us is very clear: \nIf you believe runaway and homeless youth should receive services that \nare federally funded without regard to their sexual orientation, you \nshould vote yes on this amendment. The Cornyn amendment does not \nprohibit discrimination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To direct the Attorney General to increase the amount \nprovided under certain formula grants to States that have in place laws \n that terminate the parental rights of men who father children through \n                                 rape)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                 TITLE __--RAPE SURVIVOR CHILD CUSTODY\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Rape Survivor Child \n     Custody Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Covered formula grant.--The term ``covered formula \n     grant'' means a grant under--\n       (A) part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) (commonly \n     referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against Women Formula \n     Grant Program''); or\n       (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \n     (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``Sexual \n     Assault Services Program'').\n       (2) Termination.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, when used \n     with respect to parental rights, a complete and final \n     termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship \n     of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to require a State, in order to receive an \n     increase in the amount provided to the State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a \n     law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a \n     child through rape to support the child.\n\n     SEC. __03. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Men who father children through rape should be \n     prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children.\n       (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in \n     the United States.\n       (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their \n     child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face \n     custody battles with their rapists.\n       (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious \n     crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in \n     less than 5 percent of rapes.\n       (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most \n     common standard for termination of parental rights among the \n     50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia.\n       (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and \n     convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for \n     allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in \n     Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)).\n       (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape \n     survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights \n     of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the \n     child was conceived through rape.\n       (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the \n     survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which \n     can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and \n     can make it more difficult for her to recover.\n       (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely \n     negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child.\n       (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or \n     parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting \n     rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them.\n\n     SEC. __04. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to \n     a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with \n     this title if the State has in place a law that allows the \n     mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek \n     court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her \n     rapist with regard to that child, which the court is \n     authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of \n     rape.\n\n     SEC. __05. APPLICATION.\n\n       A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the \n     State under the covered formula grants shall include in the \n     application of the State for each covered formula grant such \n     information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, \n     including information about the law described in section \n     __04.\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\n     SEC. __06. GRANT INCREASE.\n\n       The amount of the increase provided to a State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not \n     more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of \n     funding provided to the State under the covered formula \n     grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State.\n\n     SEC. __07. PERIOD OF INCREASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title for a 2-year period.\n       (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title more than 4 times.\n\n     SEC. __08. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS.\n\n       The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the \n     amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants \n     under this title such that--\n       (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section __02(1)(A); and\n       (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section __02(1)(B).\n\n     SEC. __09. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 311, \noffered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, women who give birth to a child conceived \nthrough rape can often face intimidation from attackers who--believe it \nor not--pursue parental rights.\n  I was first moved to introduce this bill following the case of Ariel \nCastro in Cleveland. He was on trial for kidnapping, raping, and \nholding prisoner three women for a decade and then he asked the judge \nfor parental rights to visit the 6-year-old daughter who was conceived \nthrough his rape.\n  Madam President, the Brown-Ayotte-Shaheen-Gillibrand-Baldwin \namendment helps protect rape survivors by encouraging States to pass \nlaws allowing women to petition for the termination of their attacker's \nparental rights if there is clear and convincing evidence that the \nchild was conceived through the rape.\n  Madam President, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I thank Senator Brown. This is a very \nimportant amendment.\n  If you are for supporting victims, protecting life and children and \nagainst rapists, vote for this amendment. Unfortunately, rapists too \noften try to manipulate their victims by claiming custodial rights over \nchildren, and we need to stand with victims on this issue and allow \nStates to be incentivized to allow victims to terminate their parental \nrights should they choose to have a child and to raise that child \nwithout having the threat of a rapist over their shoulder.\n  I ask for support on this amendment, and I thank all of my \ncolleagues. This is a commonsense bill, and I thank Senator Brown for \nhis leadership.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 311, offered by the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the Democratic sponsor of this \namendment, I would like to thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for his leadership on this issue. The fact is, this amendment \nis essentially the same as the House stand-alone bill that passed \nunanimously.\n  Members, it is a fact that approximately 76 percent of sex \ntrafficking of underage girls takes place on the Internet--76 percent.\n  We know at least 19 Web sites that post ads for commercial sex acts \nwith children. They are paid for so doing.\n  The amendment essentially does two things. It adds the word \n``advertises'' as one of the sex trafficking offense verbs. Second, it \nclarifies that only the ``knowing'' intent and not the ``reckless \ndisregard of the fact'' intent applies to the new offense.\n  We have checked with the Department of Justice. We believe it meets \nconstitutional standards. We believe it is necessary and is long \noverdue. I urge an ``aye'' vote of all Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n273, as modified, offered by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 279, \nthe Mann Act cooperation amendment. This is a simple amendment with \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  I appreciate the cosponsors, Senators Murkowski, Ayotte, Heitkamp, \nand Gillibrand.\n  What this amendment will do, it will increase prosecutions of human \ntrafficking without an increase in cost. It allows and encourages \nFederal prosecutors to work with State officials to prosecute Mann Act \nviolations and increases transparency.\n  The key goal of this amendment is to enable the resources and \ncooperation between State and Federal prosecutors to ensure all cases \nof human trafficking are pursued and victims have justice.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1126\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the underlying \nbill. I thank the leadership on both sides for coming to a bipartisan \nagreement, and I thank the leadership for agreeing to take the Wicker \namendment by a voice vote.\n  My amendment does two things. Simply, it extends the statute of \nlimitations to allow child victims to file civil lawsuits against \nperpetrators up to 10 years after they reach the age of 18, rather than \n10 years after the cause of action arises. Secondly, my amendment \ncreates a Department of Justice data base for education and outreach. \nTrafficking is a complex issue, and it will take a comprehensive \napproach to facility adequate support for victims.\n  That is what the Wicker amendment does.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote when we take it by voice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1128\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express strong support for the \nunderlying bill and also my appreciation to the managers of the bill \nfor including the en bloc amendments. One I offered is entitled the \n``Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking,'' \npart of a larger bill we passed last year.\n  This one ensures all children who are sex-trafficked will be \nclassified as child abuse victims for purposes of the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act.\n  Currently, sex trafficking of a minor is not considered child abuse \nunless a parent or caregiver was directly involved in the child's \nexploitation. This amendment clarifies that a child victim of sex \ntrafficking is a victim of child abuse and, therefore, can be eligible \nfor the services as they recover.\n  Over the past couple of days, we have made some great progress, \nincluding putting aside partisan divides in coming together to combat \nhuman trafficking, a heinous criminal industry that all of us want to \nstop.\n  I am proud my bringing missing children home legislation with Senator \nSchumer, as well as my Combat Human Trafficking Act with Senator \nFeinstein is on the floor and have been included in the underlying \nbill. We have made a lot of progress, and we are a few steps closer to \nactually ending trafficking for once and for all.\n  I particularly congratulate Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar for \ntheir hard work in bringing this to the floor and doing something \nimportant to fight human trafficking.\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 296\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am speaking in favor of the \nKlobuchar-Cornyn amendment No. 296. This is a very important policy \namendment.\n  It basically encourages States across the country--we already have 15 \nStates doing this--not to prosecute victims of sex trafficking and to \ntreat them as victims--not as criminals--so they don't end up in jail.\n  It also sets forth a national sex-trafficking strategy. It also \nqualifies these victims for job training programs. Then, finally, it \nincludes a very important bill that Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nSessions had that helps Federal marshals to track down victims of sex \ntrafficking.\n  I thank my coauthor and all 26 cosponsors of this amendment. Senator \nCornyn--I know we will talk later about the underlying bill, but this \nis a bipartisan effort from beginning to end and a very important \npolicy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 308\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Cassidy-Peters \namendment.\n  I am a physician who has been working in a public hospital for 30 \nyears. I am aware the following is true: 90 percent of victims in a \nrecent survey saw a nurse or doctor or other health care professional \nwhile being held captive.\n  If those health care workers had the training and tools to identify \nthe signs and symptoms of those being trafficked, they can make the \nappropriate referral and help them escape that terrible existence.\n  This amendment will provide for the development of best practices to \nenable health care workers to recognize and assist victims of human \ntrafficking.\n  If passed today, this will help women and children in Louisiana, \nMichigan, and across the Nation rebuild their lives.\n  I thank Senator Peters for joining this effort, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 296\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I first of all want to thank Senator \nCornyn. We have been working on these bills for over 1 year. I want to \nthank Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley for their leadership on the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Murray for her work in negotiating this \nagreement and working with us, as well as so many other people who have \nbeen involved in working on this bill.\n  Through the last month, I think every so often people have forgotten \nwhat this really is about. This is about victims of sex trafficking, \nwith an average age of 12 years old--not even old enough to get their \nown driver's license, not even old enough to go to a high school prom. \nYet this is happening all over the country, from the oil patches of \nNorth Dakota to the suburbs of Minneapolis.\n  What this bill does and what this Senate is doing today is saying we \nwant to be there in our country for these victims. We are going to pay \nfor services. We are actually going to change some policies so that \nwhen we go to the rest of the world and look at something that is now \nthe third biggest international criminal enterprise in the world, when \nwe look at what Boko Haram is doing in Nigeria and in other countries, \nwe can hold our heads up high and say that in the Senate we are finally \ndoing something about this and our country is united across party lines \nagainst this practice.\n  Again, I thank Senator Cornyn for what he has done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Winston Churchill supposedly once said: \nThe Americans always do the right thing after they exhaust every other \npossibility. And you might say the same thing about the Senate when it \ncomes to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This has been a \nlong strange journey here to final passage, but here we are. And we \nhave kept our focus all along on the victims--typically, a girl of 12 \nto 14 years old who has been sex trafficked and who has been treated as \na common object and enslaved.\n  This is a terrible, heinous crime, but one that most of us don't see \nbecause it operates outside of our vision and our experience. We are \nthrowing a lifeline to these victims of human trafficking by providing \nthem real resources to help them--to help first to rescue them and then \nto help them heal.\n  This is a good day for the Senate because we are doing the right \nthing for people who have no voice. We are their voice, and we are \ngoing to get this done in a way that provides them some real help.\n  I want to thank all of our colleagues here on a bipartisan basis. It \nwas a rocky trip here. But we got here. That is what counts, because we \nare providing necessary and needed help for these victims of human \ntrafficking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the committee-\nreported substitute amendment, as amended, to S. 178 is agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill having been \nread the third time, the question is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Rape Survivor Child \n     Custody Act''.\n\n     SEC. 402. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Covered formula grant.--The term ``covered formula \n     grant'' means a grant under--\n       (A) part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) (commonly \n     referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against Women Formula \n     Grant Program''); or\n       (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \n     (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``Sexual \n     Assault Services Program'').\n       (2) Termination.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, when used \n     with respect to parental rights, a complete and final \n     termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship \n     of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to require a State, in order to receive an \n     increase in the amount provided to the State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a \n     law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a \n     child through rape to support the child.\n\n     SEC. 403. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Men who father children through rape should be \n     prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children.\n       (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in \n     the United States.\n       (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their \n     child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face \n     custody battles with their rapists.\n       (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious \n     crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in \n     less than 5 percent of rapes.\n       (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most \n     common standard for termination of parental rights among the \n     50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia.\n       (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and \n     convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for \n     allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in \n     Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)).\n       (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape \n     survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights \n     of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the \n     child was conceived through rape.\n       (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the \n     survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which \n     can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and \n     can make it more difficult for her to recover.\n       (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely \n     negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child.\n       (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or \n     parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting \n     rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them.\n\n     SEC. 404. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to \n     a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with \n     this title if the State has in place a law that allows the \n     mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek \n     court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her \n     rapist with regard to that child, which the court is \n     authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of \n     rape.\n\n     SEC. 405. APPLICATION.\n\n       A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the \n     State under the covered formula grants shall include in the \n     application of the State for each covered formula grant such \n     information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, \n     including information about the law described in section 404.\n\n     SEC. 406. GRANT INCREASE.\n\n       The amount of the increase provided to a State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not \n     more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of \n     funding provided to the State under the covered formula \n     grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State.\n\n     SEC. 407. PERIOD OF INCREASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title for a 2-year period.\n       (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title more than 4 times.\n\n     SEC. 408. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS.\n\n       The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the \n     amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants \n     under this title such that--\n       (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section 402(1)(A); and\n       (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section 402(1)(B).\n\n     SEC. 409. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019.\n\n                TITLE V--MILITARY SEX OFFENDER REPORTING\n\n     SEC. 501.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment \nthat I was pleased to include in the human trafficking legislation that \nwas passed earlier today. The amendment was based on the Human \nTrafficking Survivors Relief and Empowerment Act, which I introduced \nseveral weeks ago.\n  It has a simple purpose. It provides an incentive for States to enact \nlaws that allow human trafficking survivors to clear their criminal \nrecords of prostitution and other low-level, nonviolent crimes that \nthey can reasonably demonstrate were the result of being trafficked.\n  Many States, including my home State of New Hampshire, have vacatur \nlaws in place. However, we need to ensure that survivors of human \ntrafficking have access to these types of protections no matter where \nthey are rescued, or what State they were forced to commit crimes in.\n  When I first introduced this legislation, I shared the story of a \nyoung woman named Katie featured in a recent NPR story on vacatur laws. \nIn the story, she spoke about her heartbreaking experience as a \ntrafficking victim.\n  Katie talked about being raped at age 11, and at age 13 being forced \ninto commercial sex.\n  She talked about having her skull cracked and ribs broken, and about \nthe regular beatings that resulted in bruises and black eyes. She \ntalked about 7 years of the worst kinds of physical and emotional \ntorture, and being transported nearly 1,400 miles from her home.\n  But Katie also talked about her recovery--about rebuilding a life \nwith her family and young son, about working hard to make a better \nlife.\n  According to Katie, one of the most important things we can do for \nthese survivors, these brave young men and women, is to give them the \ntools to start over.\n  As Katie told NPR, ``I'm not ever going to forget what I've done, but \nat the same time, I don't want it thrown in my face every time I'm \ntrying to seek employment.''\n  Survivors of human trafficking are victims of a crime. Yet often it \nis the victims who are arrested, detained, prosecuted, and convicted.\n  Records of these crimes, can follow survivors for life. These records \nlimit access to safe housing and good jobs. They can even bar access to \ncar loans and educational opportunities. They leave trafficking \nsurvivors with few options, and in some cases drive individuals back to \nengaging in commercial sex.\n  Vacatur laws help victims start fresh. They are a critical part of \nrecovery and should be available in every State, and my amendment will \nhelp us achieve that goal.\n  I will close by sharing comments that Katie's mom recently sent to my \noffice. It think it clearly demonstrates what is possible when \nsurvivors are given the time and support they need to recover.\n  She wrote:\n\n       As a mother and as a woman watching all those years, being \n     totally overwhelmed by hopelessness AND helplessness, I can \n     see a positive . . . . I think the 11 year old girl I lost is \n     coming back to me . . . as a woman--a little battle weary but \n     stronger and happier and filled with so much hope.\n\n  We want this kind of new beginning for every victim of trafficking. \nAnd that is exactly what this provision will help accomplish. I want to \nthank my colleagues for their support, and hope this bill will move \nquickly through the House and to the President for signature into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2349-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide, widely recognized as the first \ngenocide of the 20th century.\n  April 24, 1915 marked the beginning of a horrific period in our \nworld's history and for the Armenian people. On this day, agents of the \nOttoman Empire rounded up and executed Armenian community leaders, \npoets, and intellectuals. What ensued was the systematic extermination \nof 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children at the hands of the \nOttoman Turkish government. From 1915 to 1923, the world witnessed the \nattempted destruction of the Armenian people for no reason other than \ntheir very existence.\n  Unfortunately, the events surrounding the Armenian genocide are \nfraught with denial. But the case is simple. When Raphael Lemkin coined \nthe term ``genocide'' in the 1940s, he had what happened to the \nArmenians in mind as a definitive example.\n  Those who perished experienced some of the worst aspects of humanity. \nBut the campaign to exterminate the Armenian people failed. And those \nwho survived embodied the best qualities of the human spirit: hope, \nresilience, perseverance, and love. Some survivors made their way to \nAmerica, and many of them built their new lives in Michigan. They have \ncreated thriving communities, built businesses, raised families, and \ncontributed to the fabric of what makes the State of Michigan so great. \nTheir descendants carry on these values, and the richness of their \nculture is part of what gives vibrancy to our State.\n  The Armenians in Michigan boast a community of well over 20,000. It \nis the largest in the Midwest, and I am proud to represent them. To \ncommemorate the 100th anniversary, Michigan's Armenian community has \norganized a number of events, lectures, art exhibits, concerts, and \nvigils to remember the victims of the genocide, to educate their \ncommunities, and to look to the future. I applaud their efforts to \npreserve their culture and identity.\n  Over the last century, the Armenians of Michigan erected churches, \nestablished community centers, and built a day school. They also \nfounded educational centers such as the Armenian Research Center at the \nUniversity of Michigan-Dearborn. International language and linguistics \ncourses at Wayne State University are located in Manoogian Hall, which \nwas named after the notable Detroit-Armenian philanthropist and \nbusinessman Alex Manoogian. These are just part of the Armenian \ncommunity's contributions to Michigan.\n  While Armenians have found prosperity in their new home, they have \nnot forgotten those who did not live to see what the future held for \ntheir people. Many of Michigan's Armenian community members have \nwritten books and recorded accounts of what happened to their families \nin 1915 in an effort to shed light and increase awareness. These \nstories will carry on for generations, and remind us all that if we do \nnot recognize the atrocities of the past we risk blinding ourselves to \nthe atrocities that could still occur today.\n  Charging toward a peaceful future requires making peace with the \npast. Denial does not serve our American values. Denial minimizes the \ngreat tragedy that fell upon the victims, the survivors, and their \ndescendants. Over 40 States have affirmed the Armenian genocide, \nincluding Michigan. I have called on, and will continue to call on, the \nPresident to formally recognize that the atrocities committed against \nthe Armenian people were in fact genocide.\n  Recognition of the Armenian genocide is long overdue. A crime like \nthis casts a long shadow. This shadow can be conquered only by light--\nthe light of truth that comes from fully acknowledging the full scale \nof the horror that the Armenians endured.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2349-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2349-S2351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today is Earth Day, and on Earth Day it is \nimportant for all of us to reflect not only on how human activity \nimpacts the environment but also how those impacts on the environment \naffect people.\n  Unfortunately, one of the impacts of climate change that is \nincreasingly being documented by the military and intelligence \ncommunities is that climate change is a threat to our national \nsecurity. This threat takes many forms. Perhaps the simplest \nmanifestation is the threat of sea level rise on the Pentagon's 700 \ncostal facilities. Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia is the largest \nnaval base in the world, but the station and the surrounding community \nis being inundated by coastal\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\nflooding from sea level rise. Norfolk is experiencing high tides 1\\1/2\\ \nfeet higher than it did a century ago. This has already caused the \nnaval base to have to abandon some piers, but perhaps the real worry is \nhow flooding could prevent sailors from reaching the base during a \nweather event. One local minister quipped to the Washington Post that \nthe local church that is now up for sale faced the prospect of putting \n``the tide chart on their Web site'' so people would know whether they \ncould get to church.\n  Norfolk and the Navy are exploring various solutions, including a \ncostly flood gate proposal, but the reality is that Naval Station \nNorfolk and U.S. Navy infrastructure around the world is at threat \naround the world, and in a time of tightening budgets, that can have \nreal impacts on military readiness.\n  A similar problem exists in my home State, in Annapolis, home to the \nU.S. Naval Academy. NOAA's 2014 ``Sea Level Rise and Nuisance Flood \nFrequency Changes Around the United States'' found that ``Annapolis and \nBaltimore, Maryland, lead the list with an increase in number of flood \ndays of more than 920 percent since 1960.'' NOAA goes on to conclude \nthat sea level rise in the waters of the Chesapeake Bay is the cause of \nthese ``nuisance flooding'' events.\n  On Monday, I visited the Patuxant River Naval Air Station in Southern \nMaryland on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. I raised the issue \nof how sea level rise is expected to affect the important work this \ninstallation does to ensure our Navy's defense preparedness and \naircraft testing and what sort of preparation and mitigation work they \nwere doing to meet these imminent challenges.\n  Critical to the function of Pax River's operations is that the base \nbe located at sea level, so if sea level is changing, even by just a \nfew feet, they have to account for these changes and essentially raise \nthe base. Fortunately, the Navy is already putting a lot of thought \ninto this issue; however, the infrastructure adaptation and mitigation \nprojects that are essential to keeping our military prepared are coming \nat the expense of the taxpayer.\n  Climate change is also a threat to national security because it can \nserve as a threat multiplier. For as long as there have been humans, \nthere has been conflict over resources, especially when those resources \nare scarce and essential. Many national security and defense experts \nhave commented on how climate change's impacts on food production, \nfreshwater resources, and the destruction of critical infrastructure is \ncontributing to political instability in a number of countries, \nparticularly in developing countries where political leadership is \nalready tenuous.\n  As former colonel and current Department of Defense consultant Pete \nNewell put it, ``As a precursor to conflict, lack of access to basic \nhuman needs is a major driver and it's only getting worse.''\n  Prolonged drought and other serious environmental disasters are also \nmade more likely in a warming world, and these kinds of conditions can \noverwhelm governments and cause government collapse.\n  The potential of conflict, radicalism, and terrorism are heightened \nwhen states fail.\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Michael Mullin, was \nquoted in the DOD's 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review:\n\n       The scarcity of and potential competition for resources . . \n     . compounded by the influx of refugees . . . creates \n     conditions of hopelessness that could lead to failed states \n     and make populations vulnerable to radicalization.\n\n  CNA Corporation's Military Advisory Board issued a 2014 report titled \n``National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change \n``calling for political leadership to address the causes and impacts of \nclimate change:\n\n       The national security risks of projected climate change are \n     as serious as any challenges we have faced . . . .Political \n     posturing and budgetary woes cannot be allowed to inhibit \n     discussion and debate over what so many believe to be a \n     salient national security concern for our nation.\n\n  Scholars at U.C. Santa Barbara and Columbia University have shown how \nSyria is an example of how climate change can help create conditions \nthat lead to conflict. The ongoing tragedy of ISIS cannot be explained \nby any one single cause, but studies are pointing to climate change as \nan important factor.\n  Between 2006 and 2010, Syria experienced its worst drought in \ndecades. Reportedly this caused crop failure on 60 percent of Syria's \narable land and the country lost 8o percent of its head of cattle.\n  Rural farmers had nowhere to go but to Syria's cities. Syria's \nGovernment, which was already dealing with 1 million displaced people \nfrom Iraq, was overwhelmed by an influx of 1 million people internally \ndisplaced by drought.\n  As we know all too well from recent history, failed states and the \nchaotic conditions within them are breeding grounds of terrorism and \nradicalism such as that practiced by ISIS.\n  Climate change helped create stresses on the Syrian Government it \ncould not handle, and its collapse has helped lead to the emergence of \nISIS.\n  Leaders and experts attribute other global conflicts to climate \nchange. Ban Ki-moon holds that violence in Darfur was sparked by a \ndecline in rainfall that devastated cattle herds. Others believe that \nthe 2011 Arab spring relates to heat waves that forced cereal-exporting \ncountries to take grain off the global market.\n  A severe drought in the Horn of Africa has starved off tens of \nthousands of Somalis, and many more are on the brink of starvation in \ncrowded refugee camps nearby. This displacement and desperation can \nonly compound other crises and issues, such as civil conflict, fragile \nsocieties, and underdevelopment.\n  Many Pacific Island nations, such as Kiribati and Tuvalu, are being \nswallowed up by the ocean.\n  While no single extreme weather event can be attributed to climate \nchange, and the Earth has certainly experienced hurricanes and cyclones \nsince the dawn of time, what is worth noting is the trend in increased \nintensity and frequency of extreme weather events is clear. Since 2000, \nthere have been 18 category 5 hurricanes and cyclones--18 storms in the \nlast 14 years. The previous 18 category 5 storms occurred over a 39-\nyear period from 1961 to 2000. In other words, the phenomenon is \nbecoming a more common occurrence in our world.\n  Last month, Cyclone Pam quite literally leveled the island nation of \nVanuatu in the South Pacific. An overwhelming majority of the island's \nstructures were destroyed. As the days went on and the media began to \nlose focus on the humanitarian crisis that was unfolding, access to \nfood and freshwater became increasingly difficult for the people of \nVanuatu. Foreign aid has slowly made its way to the stricken people of \nVanuatu. The World Health Organization has noted a rise in illnesses \nrelated to lack of access to safe drinking water and exposure to \nmosquito-borne diseases.\n  We must remain mindful of the pace and quality of recovery efforts in \nVanuatu. Cyclone Pam has created a situation that could very easily \ndestabilize the government if conditions on the ground in Vanuatu do \nnot continue to improve.\n  Extremist organizations feed on instability and chaos, and if the \npeople of Vanuatu feel their government is not adequately addressing \ntheir needs in a timely fashion, concerned nations need to be vigilant \nof what forces may take hold.\n  As climate change worsens, more countries may become vulnerable to \nits effects. Lack of food, water, and living space is displacing and \nkilling people.\n  To protect our national security, we need to listen to the Department \nof Defense and an emerging group of scholars who are showing the \nconnections between climate change and conflict. That means heeding the \nwarnings of humanitarian need, providing adequate aid to maintain \nstability during crises, and helping vulnerable countries build \nresilient infrastructure. But most fundamentally it means we need to \nfight climate change. Global warming pollution is harming our planet, \nharming nature, and endangering wildlife.\n  But Earth Day is not just about the Earth; it is also about the \npeople inhabit it. Let's remember the most severe human impacts of \nclimate, its impacts on our national security, and avert the worst \naffects of global warming.\n  Let's do justice to Earth Day and make fighting climate change a true \nnational priority.\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2351-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nRECOGNIZING THE SAINTS JOHN NEUMANN AND MARIA GORETTI HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS \n                            BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Saints John \nNeumann and Maria Goretti High School girls varsity basketball team \nfrom Philadelphia, PA. After an undefeated 2014-2015 season, the \nNeumann-Goretti Lady Saints achieved the No. 1 rank in the Nation and \nwere named the national champions of all high school basketball teams. \nThis remarkable achievement demonstrates the fortitude and talent of \nthe team, its leadership and the school.\n  Under head coach Andrea Peterson, the Lady-Saints dominated their \nregular season, securing their playoff berth when they earned their \nsecond consecutive Philadelphia Catholic League Championship. The Lady-\nSaints continued their streak, winning the PIAA District XII AA City \nChampionship and earning a top seed in the Pennsylvania State \ntournament.\n  After earning wins with large margins in all four rounds of the \nPennsylvania State tournament, the Neumann-Goretti team entered the \nState championship game against the Seton-LaSalle Rebels of Pittsburgh. \nDominating the game with a score of 79-34, the Lady Saints earned the \nPennsylvania State championship title. This monumental season resulted \nin national recognition by USA TODAY, ESPN, CBS MaxPreps, and Blue Star \nMedia. The team was also named team of the year for the Philadelphia \nand Southeastern Pennsylvania region by the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n  I am proud to join the city of Philadelphia in celebrating the \nperformance of senior players Ciani Cryor, Sianni Martin, A.J. Timbers, \nChristina Aborowa, Melanie Schoolfield, Kaschae Harris, and honorary \nteam member Amanda Brett. I also congratulate returning players Felicia \nAiyeotan, Erica Brown, Minika Glenn, Jabria Ingram, Alisha Kebbe, Jada \nRussell, Kamiah Smalls, Jaylen Durrett, Shayla Green, Daijah Parmley, \nand Chyna Wooten. I wish all of these players well as they continue \ntheir academic careers.\n  The Neumann-Goretti Lady-Saints, Head Coach Peterson, Assistant Coach \nKat Scanlan, Ms. Letty Santarelli and the entire Saints John Neumann \nand Maria Goretti High School should take great pride in this \nachievement. Their accomplishments are celebrated by the entire \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. I wish the team and the community every \nsuccess in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2351-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JOB CORPS 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nJob Corps program, which trains our Nation's young people to see and \ncreate a viable future. This year, they celebrate their 50th \nanniversary. In my State, Alaska, our Job Corps Center is now 20 years \nold. In that time, it has graduated over 5,000 students. At any of \nAlaska's hospitals, businesses, government offices, native \ncorporations, contractors, electrical or telecom companies, nursing \nfacilities, accounting firms, banks, water plants, and prestigious \nrestaurants, you will always find successfully employed Alaska Job \nCorps graduates. These former students are now taxpayers and so proud \nof their achievements. I stand with them, as their proud Senator. These \nalumni look favorably upon their time at Alaska's Job Corps Center as a \ntime that made an enormous difference in their lives; oftentimes the \ndifference between safety and danger, success and failure, and wealth \nand poverty. This program works. It has a heart that never stops \nbeating the supportive drumbeat of success and training for our young \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2351-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:22 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S.535.

A bill to allow the financing by United States persons of \nsales of agricultural commodities to Cuba; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today with my \nfriend from Arkansas, Senator Boozman, a bill which will increase our \nagricultural producer's competitiveness and exports into Cuba, a nation \njust 90 miles off our southern coast. This timely bill would make \nrelatively simple changes to our country's burdensome regulations and \nhelp make our agricultural exporters more competitive at a time in \nwhich expanding sales and supporting prices is incredibly important.\n  When people think of Cuba, they don't usually think of North Dakota, \nbut they should. When I traveled to Cuba with Senators Tester and \nSanders last year, I saw first-hand just how compatible North Dakota's \nagricultural production is with the diet of the Cuban people. There are \nincredible export opportunities for North Dakota's pulse producers, \nalong with exports of soybean products, corn, wheat, barley, beef, and \nmore. Unfortunately, under current regulations, our government is \npreventing North Dakota's producers from competing in a market in which \nwe should hold majority market share.\n  Yesterday, the Agriculture Committee held a hearing on opportunities \nand challenges for agricultural trade with Cuba. Aside from lifting the \nCuba embargo altogether, the number one barrier we heard about was the \nfact that our exporters are prohibited from offering credit for sales \ninto Cuba. Meanwhile, our competitors from Canada, Brazil, Vietnam, and \nEurope, are offering credit and pushing our farmers\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\nout of a market in which we should be dominant.\n  The Agricultural Export Expansion Act would remove that barrier and \nput our producers on a more level playing field with our competitors. \nIt modifies a provision of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \nEnhancement Act to allow for exporters and banks to offer private \ncredit for agricultural exports to Cuba. Let me be clear: this bill \ndoes not allow for involvement from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's export credit guarantee program or the Export-Import \nBank, and no taxpayer dollars will be at risk if Cuba were to default \non a deal. This bill simply allows the market and private industry to \ndictate the terms of sale, weighing all of the risks and benefits, like \nthey do with every other country in the world.\n  With the current low commodity prices, we should be doing everything \nwe can to support our agricultural producers, and to me this just makes \nsense. Even if Cuba were to buy all of their wheat from Kansas and \nsoybeans from Arkansas, a bushel sold is a bushel sold, and all of our \nproducers will benefit.\n  This bill is also good for the people of Cuba. Making trade more \nefficient and affordable will allow us to provide food to Cuba's \npopulation. Given our proximity and our agricultural industry's \nincredible diversity, we can support both the people of Cuba and our \nproducers by removing this one unnecessary regulation. I hope our \ncolleagues will join us in this important effort to help our producers \nbe more competitive into this natural market.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1051.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Health Service \n     Corps Expansion Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 332(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 254e(a)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``(including care \n     provided by a city or county health department to inmates of \n     a county or municipal jail)'' after ``county health \n     department''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``State correctional \n     institution'' and inserting ``State, country, or municipal \n     correctional institution''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1057. A bill to promote geothermal energy, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today on the 45th anniversary of Earth Day, \nI am proud to introduce a pair of bills, S. 1057 and S. 1058, to \npromote clean energy and fight climate change.\n  The first bill is the Geothermal Energy Opportunities Act, or GEO Act \nfor short. Clean, low-carbon geothermal energy can play a starring role \nin the fight against climate change, and this legislation encourages \nthe development of the geothermal resource in a number of important \nways.\n  The GEO Act helps prospective geothermal developers explore for and \ndevelop geothermal resources through a public-private grant program. As \npart of the partnership, developers report their findings, contributing \nto a nationwide map of geothermal potential that will reduce the risk \nand drive down the cost of geothermal energy for the future.\n  In many cases, Federal lands already under production for oil and gas \nalso have a geothermal resource, and the GEO Act allows for the oil and \ngas leaseholders to coproduce such geothermal energy without going \nthrough an additional competitive lease process. It also fully \nincorporates the bipartisan Geothermal Production Expansion Act that I \nintroduced with a number of my colleagues earlier this year. That \nprovision would streamline the Federal geothermal leasing program to \nprevent speculative bidders from unproductively driving up the price of \nleases for developers of geothermal ``hot spots'' that extend into \nlands directly adjacent to their existing geothermal lease.\n  The Bureau of Land Management, which manages geothermal projects on \nFederal land under lease agreements, estimates about 250 million acres \nof Federal land contains geothermal power potential. Geothermal energy \nprojects that are producing geothermal power under the BLM's management \nmake up about half of the total geothermal generating capacity in the \nUnited States. The GEO Act takes important steps to speed the \ndevelopment of this tremendous clean energy potential on public lands.\n  I am also introducing the Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy \nAct of 2015, along with my colleagues Senators Merkley, Schatz, and \nKing, to spur development of renewable electricity from the water power \nin oceans, rivers, and lakes. This bill reauthorizes the Department of \nEnergy's marine renewable energy programs, including the national \nmarine renewable energy research, development and demonstration centers \naround the country, one of which is run by Oregon State University in \nmy home state. The Department of Energy estimates that there is enough \npotential energy in these nontraditional forms of hydropower to one day \npower millions of homes.\n  These two pieces of legislation will each promote the production of \nclean, domestic energy resources and in doing so help the United States \nlead the world in the fight against climate change. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support both of them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Geothermal Energy \n     Opportunities Act'' or the ``GEO Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL GOALS FOR PRODUCTION AND SITE \n                   IDENTIFICATION.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, not later than 10 years \n     after the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Interior should seek to have \n     approved more than 15,000 megawatts of new geothermal energy \n     capacity on public land across a geographically diverse set \n     of States using the full range of available technologies; and\n       (2) the Director of the Geological Survey and the Secretary \n     of Energy should identify sites capable of producing a total \n     of 50,000 megawatts of geothermal power, using the full range \n     of available technologies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PRIORITY AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT ON FEDERAL LAND.\n\n       The Director of the Bureau of Land Management, in \n     consultation with other appropriate Federal officials, \n     shall--\n       (1) identify high priority areas for new geothermal \n     development; and\n       (2) take any actions the Director determines necessary to \n     facilitate that development, consistent with applicable laws.\n\n     SEC. 4. FACILITATION OF COPRODUCTION OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY ON \n                   OIL AND GAS LEASES.\n\n       Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. \n     1003(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Land subject to oil and gas lease.--Land under an oil \n     and gas lease issued pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act (30 \n     U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired \n     Lands (30 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) that is subject to an approved \n     application for permit to drill and from which oil and gas \n     production is occurring may be available for noncompetitive \n     leasing under this section to the holder of the oil and gas \n     lease--\n       ``(A) on a determination that--\n       ``(i) geothermal energy will be produced from a well \n     producing or capable of producing oil and gas; and\n       ``(ii) national energy security will be improved by the \n     issuance of such a lease; and\n       ``(B) to provide for the coproduction of geothermal energy \n     with oil and gas.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 144\n\n       Whereas in 2013, there were more than 6,000,000 victims and \n     survivors of violent crime and nearly 17,000,000 victims and \n     survivors of property crime in the United States;\n       Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on \n     individuals, families, schools, and communities by protecting \n     the rights of crime victims and survivors and ensuring that \n     resources and services are available to help rebuild the \n     lives of the victims and survivors;\n       Whereas despite impressive accomplishments between 1974 and \n     2015 in increasing the rights of, and services available to, \n     crime victims and survivors, and the families of the victims \n     and survivors, many challenges remain to ensure that all \n     crime victims and survivors, and the families of the victims \n     and survivors, are--\n       (1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect;\n       (2) offered support and services regardless of whether the \n     victims and survivors report crimes committed against them; \n     and\n       (3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, \n     juvenile, Federal, tribal, and civil justice systems in the \n     United States when the victims and survivors report crimes;\n       Whereas crime victims and survivors in the United States, \n     and the families of the victims and survivors, need and \n     deserve support and assistance to help cope with the often \n     devastating consequences of crime;\n       Whereas during each year between 1984 and 2014, communities \n     across the United States have joined Congress and the \n     Department of Justice in commemorating National Crime \n     Victims' Rights Week to celebrate a shared vision of a \n     comprehensive and collaborative response that identifies and \n     addresses the many needs of crime victims and survivors, and \n     the families of the victims and survivors;\n       Whereas Congress and the President agree on the need for a \n     renewed commitment to serving all victims and survivors of \n     crime in the 21st century;\n       Whereas the theme of 2015 National Crime Victims' Rights \n     Week, celebrated during the week of April 19 through April \n     25, 2015, is ``Engaging Communities. Empowering Victims.'' \n     and highlights the many challenges that confront crime victim \n     assistance, justice, and public safety;\n       Whereas engaging communities in victim assistance is \n     essential to promoting individual and public safety;\n       Whereas the United States must empower crime victims and \n     survivors by protecting their legal rights and by providing \n     them with quality, comprehensive services to help them in the \n     aftermath of crime; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States recognize and \n     appreciate the continued importance of--\n       (1) promoting the rights of, and services for, crime \n     victims and survivors; and\n       (2) honoring crime victims and survivors and individuals \n     who provide services for the victims and survivors: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the mission and goals of 2015 National Crime \n     Victims' Rights Week, which include increasing individual and \n     public awareness of--\n       (A) the impact of crime on victims and survivors, and the \n     families of the victims and survivors;\n       (B) the challenges to achieving justice for victims and \n     survivors of crime, and the families of the victims and \n     survivors; and\n       (C) the many solutions to meet such challenges; and\n       (2) recognizes that crime victims and survivors, and the \n     families of the victims and survivors, should be treated with \n     dignity, fairness, and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2357-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 145--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF APRIL 2015, AS \n                    ``PARKINSON'S AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 145\n\n       Whereas Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive \n     neurological disease and is the second most common \n     neurodegenerative disease in the United States;\n       Whereas there is inadequate data on the incidence and \n     prevalence of Parkinson's disease, but the disease affects an \n     estimated 500,000 to 1,500,000 individuals in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, Parkinson's disease is the 14th leading cause of \n     death in the United States;\n       Whereas every day Parkinson's disease greatly impacts \n     millions of individuals in the United States who are \n     caregivers, family members, and friends of individuals with \n     Parkinson's disease;\n       Whereas the economic burden of Parkinson's disease is an \n     estimated $14,400,000,000 each year, including indirect costs \n     to patients and family members of $6,300,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas although research suggests that the cause of \n     Parkinson's disease is a combination of genetic and \n     environmental factors, the exact cause and exact progression \n     of the disease remain unknown;\n       Whereas an objective test or biomarker for diagnosing \n     Parkinson's disease does not exist;\n       Whereas a cure or drug to slow or halt the progression of \n     Parkinson's disease does not exist;\n       Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from \n     person to person and include tremors, slowness of movement, \n     rigidity, difficulty with balance, swallowing, chewing, and \n     speaking, cognitive impairment, dementia, mood disorders, and \n     a variety of other non-motor symptoms;\n       Whereas volunteers, researchers, caregivers, and medical \n     professionals are working to improve the quality of life for \n     individuals with Parkinson's disease and the families of \n     those individuals; and\n       Whereas developing more effective treatments for \n     Parkinson's disease and providing access to quality care to \n     individuals with Parkinson's disease requires increased \n     research, education, and community support services: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2015, as ``Parkinson's Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``Parkinson's \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (3) continues to support research to develop more effective \n     treatments for Parkinson's disease and to ultimately find a \n     cure for the disease;\n       (4) recognizes the individuals with Parkinson's disease who \n     participate in vital clinical trials to advance the knowledge \n     of the disease; and\n       (5) commends the dedication of organizations, volunteers, \n     researchers, and millions of individuals in the United States \n     working to improve the quality of life for individuals with \n     Parkinson's disease and the families of those individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/22/senate-section/article/S2357-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2357-S2358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 146--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF THE \n   WEEK OF APRIL 13 THROUGH APRIL 17, 2015, AS ``NATIONAL ASSISTANT \n                           PRINCIPALS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Perdue, and Ms. Mikulski) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
