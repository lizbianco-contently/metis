Madam President, a few days ago, the majority leader was \nreported to have declared to a conservative talk-radio show that under \nhis leadership, the Republican Senate will shirk its constitutional \nduties by not continuing to confirm judges--period. He went on to say: \nWe may confirm a few that come from States where only Republicans give \nthe President the names, but other than that, we are going to do none.\n  I assume this is accurate. I hope it is not, but I assume that it is. \nIt would be a very stunning and disappointing declaration that the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, especially since he argued for the fair \nconsideration of President Bush's court nominees, would now switch his \nposition.\n  In July of 2008, here is what he said: ``Even with lameduck \nPresidents, there is a historical standard of fairness as to confirming \njudicial nominees, especially circuit court nominees.''\n  That is a direct quote from the majority leader. These are his words. \nNot a single word has been made up. That is what he said: ``Even with \nlameduck presidents, there is a historical standard of fairness as to \nconfirming judicial nominees, especially circuit court nominees.''\n  And the record is spread with many quotes he has given just the same. \nHe also said in that same year: ``No party is without blame in the \nconfirmation process, but what is going on now--or, more accurately, \nwhat is not going on--is yet another step backward in politicizing the \nconfirmation process--something we had all hoped that we would get \nbeyond.''\n  Earlier my friend from Kentucky said: ``Judicial nominations need to \nbe treated fairly and commitments need to be kept.'' And even earlier \nthan that, here is what he said: ``On the issue of judicial \nconfirmations, the majority leader and I discussed this matter publicly \nat the beginning of the Congress''--he is saying that he and I are \ntalking--``and we agreed that President Bush, in the last 2 years of \nhis term, should be treated as well as President Reagan, Bush 41, and \nPresident Clinton were treated in the last 2 years of their tenures in \noffice because there was one common thread, and that was that the \nSenate was controlled by the opposition party.''\n  So what he is saying there is that what he wanted was for Bush to be \ntreated the same way that Bush 1, President Reagan, and President \nClinton had been treated. He got that with large numbers of judges \nbeing appointed.\n  So we are here now with the statements ringing loudly that the \nmajority leader is intent on writing off the Senate's constitutional \nduty of offering our advice and consent now that President Obama is \nnominating individuals to the Federal bench.\n  The Republican leader is a student of the Senate. He says he is, and \nI believe that. I am confident that he understands that the Senate \ncannot and should not neglect the constitutional obligations we have. \nThe Senate cannot simply ignore critical vacancies in the last 2 years \nof any President's term--what a bad standard to set, especially with \nthe growth in certain communities. We have a number of judicial \nemergencies that have been determined.\n  It is all the more troubling that the majority leader wants to pick \nan unnecessary fight over judges just as Republican Senators are \nworking with the President to fill vacancies in their States. The \nmajority leader is essentially telling other Senators that their \njudicial recommendations simply don't matter--Democrats, Independents, \nRepublicans. The majority leader is telling the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee that regardless of the judicial nominations his \ncommittee continues to report out, they could be blocked on the Senate \nfloor.\n  But I do say this just as a caveat: The present Judiciary Committee \nis doing the same thing that was done by the present chairman of the \nFinance Committee when he was chair of the\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\nJudiciary Committee. He didn't have to worry about a lot of names on \nthe calendar because he simply held no hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee. The same situation is prevailing now. So we don't have a lot \nof people on the calendar because they are not having any hearings to \nspeak of in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have spoken here on the floor before about the nomination of Felipe \nRestrepo for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. After \nrepeated, repeated, and repeated delays, the committee is finally \nconsidering his nomination on Wednesday. He has been waiting for \nmonths. This is an incredibly qualified nominee who enjoys vast \nbipartisan support, including both Pennsylvania Senators, one a \nDemocrat and one a Republican. The Republican Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas said that Judge Restrepo would be a ``superb addition to the Third \nCircuit.''\n  In that case we have waited months to even have a hearing.\n  So it must have been shocking for the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania to learn that his judicial pick would face another delay--\na delay indefinitely, perhaps. This is a blatant rejection of the \nSenate's constitutional duties.\n  Just as Senator McConnell argued for fairness for President Bush's \nnominations, it is not unreasonable for Democrats to expect that same \nmeasure of fairness that President Bush got in the 110th Congress.\n  Regardless of whether a State had two Democrats, two Republicans or a \nsplit delegation, Senate Democrats brought President Bush's nominees up \nfor a vote. By this point in the seventh year of George W. Bush's \nPresidency, Senate Democrats confirmed 18 judges, including 3 circuit \ncourt judges.\n  In almost 6 months, the Republican Senate has only confirmed four \ndistrict court judges. To put this in perspective, during the \nPresidency of Bush, we confirmed four in 1 month.\n  So perhaps the majority leader's comments about a judicial slowdown \nwere just confirming what he has already done to block the President's \nnominees. I repeat. The committee is being run the same way that the \npresent chair of the Finance Committee did when he was chair of the \nJudiciary Committee--just holding no hearings. That way, there is \nnobody on the calendar--or very few.\n  The Republican Senate hasn't confirmed even a single circuit court \njudge--not even a consensus nominee such as Kara Stoll to the Federal \nCircuit. She was reported out of committee by a voice vote in April. \nNothing so far--they are not even having hearings, I repeat, on most \nnominees. Therefore, there is no one to report to the floor.\n  Actions speak louder than words, and the majority leader can \ndemonstrate that his remarks were misinterpreted--and I would certainly \nhope so--by scheduling a prompt vote on the Stoll nomination. We should \nschedule a vote on her nomination no later than this week. Kara Stoll \nis the only appeals court judge awaiting a vote before the Senate.\n  For the reasons I have just said, people have been in the pipeline, \nbut they won't hold hearings. Both of these nominations--Restrepo and \nStoll--need a vote now. Let's hope the majority leader will reflect \nupon his past statements about fair consideration of judicial nominees, \nin comparison to what he said on a talk show--I guess appealing to the \nrightwing even more than what has happened recently, and that is quite \na bit. Let's hope he does not treat judicial nominees as they have \nnever been treated before. Let's hope that the Senate will quickly \nconfirm at least these two qualified judges. We need a lot more, but \nthese two would be a step in the right direction.\n  I note there is no one on the floor, and I ask that the Chair \nannounce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3850-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I note with some interest over the \nweekend in the New York Times that ``Russia Wields Aid and Ideology \nAgainst West to Fight Sanctions.''\n  On the front page of the New York Times:\n\n       The war in Ukraine that has pitted Russia against the West \n     is being waged not just with tanks, artillery and troops. \n     Increasingly, Moscow has brought to bear different kinds of \n     weapons, according to American and European officials: Money, \n     ideology, and disinformation.\n\n  Yesterday and today in the Wall Street Journal: ``Iraqis Call for a \nDeeper Overhaul of Army.'' Also: ``Mistrust of military leadership \namong troops is widespread in crisis of confidence.''\n  Right below that: ``Airstrikes Kill Dozens as Fighting in Yemen \nIntensifies.''\n  The reporting of a world in turmoil, as described by my friend \nLindsey Graham as on fire, continues.\n  To top it all off, today, speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in \nGermany, President Obama said: ``We don't yet have a complete strategy \nabout how to combat ISIS.''\n  I would remind my colleagues that on August 28, 2014, nearly a year \nago, President Obama stated: ``We don't have a strategy yet to fight \nISIS in Iraq and in Syria.''\n  My friends, nearly a year after the President said we don't have a \nstrategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, he said again: We \ndon't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS.\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\n  I would like to see the incomplete strategy. I would like to see \nsomething. I would not like to see continue that 75 percent of the \ncombat missions that are flown in Iraq and Syria return to base without \nfiring a weapon because we don't have forward air controllers on the \nground.\n  When is this administration going to figure out that if we want to \ndestroy the enemy, we have to be able to identify the enemy, and that \nrequires forward air controllers on the ground and that means U.S. \ntroops.\n  I know that whenever I and some others say we need additional U.S. \ntroops, people recoil and say, Oh, no, here we go again. Well, what is \ngoing on now is ISIS is succeeding. Bashar Assad is hanging on. Iran is \non the move. They now dominate four countries: Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and \nLebanon. And the President of the United States says we don't yet have \na complete strategy.\n  Well, the Pentagon is a pretty big place. There are hundreds of \npeople who work for the National Security Advisor, and somehow, nearly \na year later, we don't yet have a strategy? Wow. ISIS goes from house \nto house in Ramadi with lists of names and they execute people and they \nkill 3-year-old children and they burn their bodies in the streets. And \nthe atrocities in Syria continue as Bashar Assad barrel-bombs innocent \nmen, women, and children--barrel bombs, by the way, supplied by Iran \nand Russia--and we don't yet have a ``complete strategy.''\n  Well, I have never seen the world in more crises, nor has Henry \nKissinger, nor have most other longtime observers of our Nation and the \nworld.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at a map of the Middle East from \nJanuary of 2009, when President Obama was sworn in as President of the \nUnited States, and look at that same map today and color in where there \nis ISIS, where there is Iranian domination, where there is conflict, \nand where there is a complete lack, except in the State of Israel, of \ndemocratization or the kinds of freedoms the United States of America \nstands for.\n  All I can say is one has to wonder whether this President just wants \nto wait out the next year and a half and basically do nothing to stop \nthis genocide, blood-letting, and the horrible things that are \nhappening throughout the Middle East, where, in the view of the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of the \nCIA, they say, as far as ISIS is concerned, they pose a threat to the \nsecurity of the United States. Why do they say that? Obviously, because \nthese thousands of young men who have gone to Syria and Iraq and are \nbeing radicalized and trained are going to go back to where they came \nfrom. Everybody knows that.\n  On the day Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, left our Camp Bucca--where \nhe spent 4 years along with about 25,000 others--he said to the \nAmericans: We will see you in New York. Mr. Baghdadi is not known for \nhis sense of humor.\n  What we are trying to do in this legislation that is before the \nSenate is to provide the means, the training, the equipment, the care \nfor the men and women, and the much needed reforms that I have been \nover and will continue to go over, whether it be in retirement, whether \nit be in acquisition, whether it be in a number of other areas of the \nDepartment of Defense and the way we defend this Nation. That is, in my \nview, long, long overdue. Now we see the President of the United States \nthreatening to veto this legislation, if it gets through the House and \nthe Senate, over the issue of OCO. That, as my colleagues know, is \noverseas contingency operations, which began with the conflicts in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq as a means of providing additional funds to pay \nfor and fund the operations in those countries as the name implies--\noverseas contingency operations.\n  I have opposed sequestration. I think it is a terrible thing to \ninflict on the men and women who are serving in the military, much less \non our national security. I agree with our uniformed leaders, every one \nof whom has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that \nif we continue sequestration, it puts the lives of the men and women \nwho are serving in the military at greater risk. I don't know of a \ngreater obligation that we have than to prevent putting the lives of \nthe young men and women who have volunteered to serve this country at \ngreater risk. But that has been lost on my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  So now we have the OCO, and it funds the defense of this country at \nthe levels the President requested. I don't like it. I don't like it \nbecause it can only give them 1 year of planning. What the military \nreally needs is to be able to plan for at least 5 years ahead of time. \nWe can't build new weapons and new ships and new airplanes on a year-\nto-year basis. But it is better than the sequestration, which, as I \nsaid, increases the threat to this Nation's security.\n  Last week, the White House issued a Statement of Administration \nPolicy threatening to veto this national security legislation. The \nthreat hardly comes as a surprise. After all, the President has \nthreatened to veto, for some reason or another, every Defense \nauthorization bill since 2011. The White House's compilation of \ncomplaints is long, but it is woefully short on substance.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy makes clear that the true \nbasis for the administration's veto threat has nothing to do with \ndefense. Objecting to the use of $38 billion in overseas contingency \noperation funds--or OCO--to meet the President's request of $612 \nbillion, the statement said the President ``will not fix defense \nwithout fixing nondefense spending.''\n  It is incomprehensible that as America confronts the most diverse and \ncomplex array of crises around the world since the end of World War II, \nthat a President of the United States, who has not yet been able to \ncome up with a ``complete strategy'' for the challenges we face, would \nveto funding for our military to prove a political point.\n  The threats we confront today are far more serious than they were a \nyear ago and significantly more so since the Congress passed the Budget \nControl Act in 2011. That legislation arbitrarily capped defense \nspending and established the mindless mechanism of sequestration which \nwas triggered in 2013. As a result, with worldwide threats rising, we \nas a nation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of defense \nspending over 10 years. Every single military and national security \nleader who has testified before the Armed Services Committee this year \nhas denounced sequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. \nThis legislation doesn't end sequestration, unfortunately. Believe me, \nour committee would have done so if the NDAA were capable of it, but it \nis not. The NDAA is a policy bill. This legislation is a policy bill. \nIt is the appropriators who deal with the money. It only deals with \ndefense issues, and it doesn't spend a dollar. It provides the \nDepartment of Defense and the men and women in uniform with the \nauthorities and support they need to defend the Nation. It fully \nsupports President Obama's budget request of $612 billion for national \ndefense, which is $38 billion above the spending caps established by \nthe Budget Control Act.\n\n  Let me repeat that. The legislation gives the President every dollar \nof budget authority he requested. The difference is that this \nlegislation follows the Senate budget resolution, which was voted on \ntime after time all night long and was agreed to by both Houses of \nCongress. It is the Senate budget resolution.\n  Now, this is not my preferred option, as I said. That is why the \ncommittee included a special transfer authority in this legislation \nthat allows the Department of Defense to transfer the additional $38 \nbillion from OCO to the base budget in the event legislation is enacted \nthat increases the statutory limits on discretionary defense and \nnondefense spending in proportionately equal amounts. This was the \nproduct of a bipartisan compromise, and it was the most we could do in \nthe Defense authorization bill to recognize the need for a broader \nphysical agreement without denying funding for our military right now.\n  Here on the floor we have heard a number of misconceptions about OCO \nfunding, many of which have been fed by this administration's rhetoric. \nWhile OCO is not the ideal way to budget our defense, technical and \nbudgetary consequences to using OCO funding have been greatly \nexaggerated. OCO is authorized and appropriated on an annual basis, \njust like base funding. OCO funding is allocated to the same\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\nDOD accounts as base funding. In fact, the Defense bill purposely \nplaced the additional $38 billion of OCO funding in the same accounts \nand activities for which the President himself requested the money. \nThese activities have historically had a large share of OCO funding, \nand the account has been designated by the President as OCO eligible in \nthe past, and there are no laws that make OCO funding expire any \ndifferently than base funding.\n  The White House threat to veto this legislation and the desire for \nincreases in nondefense spending are misguided and irresponsible. With \nglobal threats rising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense \npolicy bill--legislation that spends no money but is full of vital \nauthorities that our troops need--for a reason that has nothing to do \nwith national defense spending. The NDAA should not be treated as a \nhostage in budget negotiation. The political reality is that the Budget \nControl Act, which the President signed, remains the law of the land. \nSo faced with a choice between OCO money and no money, I choose OCO, \nand multiple senior military leaders testified before the Armed \nServices Committee this year that they would make the same choice for \none simple reason: This is $38 billion of real money that our military \ndesperately needs and without which our top military leaders have said \nthey cannot succeed.\n  The bottom line is this. The NDAA authorized $612 billion for \nnational defense. This is the amount requested by the President and \njustified by his own national security strategy. If the President and \nsome of my colleagues oppose the Defense bill due to concerns over \nnondefense spending, I suspect they will have a very difficult time \nexplaining and justifying that choice to Americans who increasingly \ncite national security as a top concern.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy raises specious concerns with \nthe sweeping defense acquisition reforms in the NDAA. For example, the \nWhite House asserted that transferring some acquisition authority back \nto the services is somehow inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense's \nexercise of authority, direction, and control over all of the \nDepartment of Defense's programs and activities. I could not disagree \nmore with that assertion. What this legislation does is merely switch \nwho does what in certain circumstances from different people who all \ndirectly report and serve under the authority, direction, and control \nof the Secretary of Defense. In this legislation, for a limited number \nof programs to start with, the Secretary of Defense will look to the \nservice Secretaries directly for management of these acquisition \nprograms rather than looking to the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition, Technology, and Logistics, or AT This is not usurpation \nof the Secretary of Defense's power. It is called streamlining of \nauthorities and reducing layers of unnecessary bureaucracy. There is a \nsection in the legislation that would allow the Secretary of Defense to \ncontinue to rely on more layers of management, if he chooses, but only \nif he certifies to Congress that this makes sense. There simply is not \nany undermining of the Secretary of Defense's authority in here.\n  Another concern raised has been that the transfer of milestone \ndecision authority to the services would reduce the Secretary of \nDefense's ability--through AT guard against unwarranted optimism \nin program planning and budget formulation. Unwarranted optimism is \nindeed a plague on acquisition, and there is not a monopoly of that in \nthe services. Nothing in this bill overrides a requirement to use \nbetter cost estimates from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program \nEvaluation. In fact, new incentives and real penalties imposed on the \nservices in this legislation are designed to put some of this optimism \nin check.\n  Some in the White House and the Department of Defense want to \nperpetuate the absurd fiction that the current system is working. Even \nafter a wave of 25 program cancellations by former Secretary Gates, all \nof the programs that are left under AT management have over $200 \nbillion in cost overruns.\n  I want to repeat that. Under the supervision of the Under Secretary \nof Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, there are \nprograms that have over $200 billion in cost overruns. AT is trying \nto have it both ways, claiming credit for the improvements in the \nacquisition system while blaming the services for its long list of \nfailures.\n  This is exactly the program this legislation is trying to address, \nblurred lines of accountability inside the Defense Acquisition System \nthat allow its leaders to evade responsibility for results. The reality \nis that in the modern world the AT management process takes too long \nand costs too much. For example, an Army study looked at the time it \nwould take to go through all of the AT reviews and buy nothing. I \nrepeat: To go through all those reviews and buy nothing. What was the \nanswer? Ten years--10 years to buy nothing. The Government \nAccountability Office looked at the much vaunted milestone reviews that \nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense is touting as a success. Just \none review takes on average 2 years. A similar review at the Missile \nDefense Agency takes about 3 months. Our adversaries are not shuffling \npaper. They are building weapons systems. It is time for us to do the \nsame.\n  I find it disappointing or maybe just outright laughable that the \nStatement of Administration Policy expressed concern about the Armed \nServices Committee's decision to downsize and streamline the \nbureaucratic overhead of the Pentagon, while at the same time \ncomplaining that we are not letting them downsize the fighting forces. \nLet me repeat. The administration wants to keep more Pentagon \nbureaucrats while drawing down our forces and cutting military \nequipment such as fighter aircraft.\n  Is there any Member of this Chamber who believes we should increase \nthe Army staff by 60 percent over a decade, and then turn around and \nslash our Army brigade combat teams from 45 to 32? Of course not.\n  The administration cites reductions already taking place in \nheadquarters activities, but ignores the fact that the Air Force is \ntrying to achieve those reductions by playing a shell game--creating \ntwo new organizations and shifting people around. Moving the deck \nchairs on the Titanic didn't keep the ship from sinking, and shifting \npeople around in a game of ``hide the headquarters staff'' will not \nkeep our national security from sinking under the weight of \nbureaucratic empires.\n\n  As the White House asks the Senate to preserve bloated staffs, the \nStatement of Administration Policy laments the Committee's effort to \naddress dangerous strike fighter capacity shortfalls across the \nservices. As deliveries of the F-35 have continued to fall short of \nprojections, the Air Force has continued to drain combat power. Senior \nAir Force officials have repeatedly testified to the alarming reality \nthat their service is the smallest in its history, with readiness at \nvery low levels, all while our airmen perform ongoing combat operations \nin the Middle East, theater support packages in Eastern Europe, \npresence and reassurance to our allies in the Asia-Pacific, and \nmaintain a strong strategic nuclear deterrence posture. The \nmisallocation of airpower resources over the past 6 years, coupled with \nthe mismanagement of very expensive aircraft weapons systems \nprocurement programs, places America's national security interests in \njeopardy and endangers the lives of our men and women in uniform.\n  Our military commanders know this is true. That is why, for example, \nthe Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps \nincluded in their unfunded priorities lists requests for 12 F-18 Super \nHornets for the Navy and 6 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters for the Marine \nCorps. The NDAA funds these requests because senior Navy and Marine \nCorps leaders have repeatedly testified to significant strike fighter \nshortfalls in the maritime services due to unanticipated increased \ncombat operations in the Middle East, aging and obsolete fighter \naircraft, and significant delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \ndelivery schedule. Bizarrely, the White House has apparently \ndisregarded that testimony and instead labels these requests for more \ncombat power from our military commanders as ``unnecessary.''\n  The Statement of Administration Policy opposes the strong oversight \nmeasures put in place by the NDAA on the Ford-class aircraft carrier \nprogram. The administration objects to a\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\nprovision in this legislation that reduces the cost cap for the USS \nJohn F. Kennedy by $100 million from $11.498 billion to $11.398 \nbillion. But in the budget request, the Navy estimated the cost of this \nship at $11.348 billion. In other words, the NDAA still provides a \nbuffer of $50 million. The provision simply locks in the savings the \nDepartment has advertised, which comes after more than $2 billion in \ncost growth--$2 billion in cost growth of one aircraft carrier. Unless \nthe budget request is misleading or inaccurate, this provision should \nnot result in reduced capability or a breach of the cost cap as the \nadministration claims.\n  It is also unfortunate that the administration doesn't recognize the \nimportance of conducting full-ship shock trials on the USS Gerald R. \nFord, known as CVN-78. With the abundance of new technology, including \nthe catapult, arresting gear, and radar, as well as the reliance on \nelectricity rather than steam to power key systems, there continues to \nbe a great deal of risk in this program. Testing CVN-78 will not only \nimprove the design of future carriers but also reduce the costs \nassociated with retrofitting engineering changes. Absent this \nprovision, the Navy will delay by up to 7 years full-ship shock trials \nand shift the test from the lead ship in the class to the second ship. \nThat poses the risk that CVN-78 will deploy and potentially fight \nwithout this testing, putting the lives of our sailors at risk.\n  The Statement of Administration Policy also raised objections to a \nnumber of provisions related to military personnel. For instance, the \nadministration bemoans the fact that the Committee did not adopt its \nplan to raise existing TRICARE fees and implement new fees for \nMedicare-eligible retirees and their family members. The so-called \nConsolidated Health Plans would not have created a modern, value-based \nhealth care system. The administration made no attempt at all to \nimprove access to care, quality of care or beneficiary satisfaction. \nThe NDAA, on the other hand, addresses those issues and more without \nraising enrollment fees or creating new fees.\n  The White House expressed concern about the provisions in the NDAA \nthat call for a plan to privatize commissaries and a 2-year pilot \nprogram at no fewer than five commissaries in the largest markets of \nthe commissary system to assess the feasibility and advisability of the \nplan. But the rationale is confusing. The administration claims that \n``there is an independent study underway to determine whether \nprivatization is a feasible option and we should wait for those results \nprior to making any policy changes.'' The bill did require a \ncomprehensive review in fiscal year 2015 by an independent organization \nof the management, food, and pricing options of the commissary system. \nBut in that section, there was no requirement to study the feasibility \nof privatization of the commissary system. It is also curious that the \nadministration warns against implementing a pilot program on \nprivatization before the results of an independent study, while at the \nsame time encouraging the Congress to adopt their own proposed pilot \nprogram.\n  The White House's policy statement reflects the President's feckless \npolicy towards Russia. Despite the advice of nearly every statesman and \npolicy expert who has appeared before the Armed Services Committee in \nrecent months--Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Madeleine Albright, \nZbigniew Brzezinski, and others--and against the advice of both the \nSecretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the President has refused \nto provide defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine. The President's \ncontinued inaction, for fear of provoking Russia, is seen by Putin as \nweakness and invites the very aggression we seek to avoid.\n  The Ukrainian people aren't asking for U.S. troops. They are simply \nasking for the right tools to defend themselves and their country, and \nthose are the tools that this legislation would provide.\n  We have seen Vladimir Putin commit aggression, draw back, commit more \naggression, draw back. We are now in the phase where any day now we \nwill see continued aggression and territory-grabbing by Vladimir Putin \nas he establishes his land bridge to Crimea and puts additional \npressures on Baltic countries and Moldova. Meanwhile, we refuse to give \nthe Ukrainians weapons with which to defend themselves.\n  This bill does not force the President to provide lethal assistance \nto Ukraine. Trust me, if there were a way to do that, it would be in \nthis bill. The President has a decision to make on providing lethal \nassistance to Ukraine. That decision has consequences far beyond \nwhether the President obligates the full amount of funds authorized in \na decision that is long overdue.\n  Making matters worse, the Statement of Administration Policy seeks \nflexibility to continue our Nation's dependence on Russian rocket \nengines. The NDAA would put an end to this dependence by 2019 and stop \nhundreds of millions of dollars from going to Vladimir Putin and his \ncronies. It eliminates a launch subsidy that the commander of Air Force \nSpace Command has stated impedes fair competition, and it directs the \nadministration to stop playing games, develop a domestic rocket \nengine--not a new rocket system--to replace the Russian RD-180.\n  The Russians are being paid billions of dollars for their rocket \nengines, and there is a ``middle man'' who has made tens of millions of \ndollars just by moving those rockets from Russia to the United States. \nThere is an individual who runs this outfit who has been sanctioned by \nthe U.S. Government, and we have elements in the Pentagon who still \nwant to deal with him for as long as possible.\n  In testimony before the Armed Services Committee in March, Gen. John \nKelly, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, testified: ``With the \namount of drugs and people that move across our southwest border, it \ndoesn't seem all that secure to me.'' General Kelly went on to state \nthat the threat of terrorists crossing our southern border is \n``extremely serious'' and that ``if a terrorist or almost anyone wants \nto get into our country, they just pay the fare.'' They just pay the \nfare.\n  That is why this bill would provide $45 million for Operation \nPhalanx, increasing border security operations by the National Guard \nalong the southern border, and boosting aerial surveillance of the \nregion by up to 60 percent. To date, Operation Phalanx has directly \ncontributed to more than 96,000 apprehensions along the border and the \ninterdiction of more than 282,000 pounds of drugs destined for our \ncommunities.\n  The legislation directs the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 \nmillion in additional assistance to Customs and Border Protection \noperations to secure the southern border, potentially including the \ndeployment of personnel, surveillance assets, and intelligence support \nfrom the U.S. military. The NDAA would authorize an additional $50 \nmillion to address U.S. Southern Command's unfunded priorities to \nincrease surveillance and interdiction operations in Central America--a \nprimary transit point for illicit trafficking into the United States.\n  Finally, I am disappointed by the administration's puzzling response \nto provisions in the NDAA related to the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay. The administration argues that this legislation's \nlimitations placed on Guantanamo Bay transfers are unnecessary and \nbeyond the scope of congressional authority. That is false. Congress \nhas long had constitutional authority over wartime detention matters, \nand there are good reasons for Congress to assert its authority in this \ninstance.\n  For over 6 years, the administration has stated that one of its \nhighest policy priorities is to close the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay. But for that same period of time, Members of the Senate \nhave repeatedly requested a plan that explains how the administration \nwill handle each of the detainees currently held there, and \nunfortunately, over the last 6\\1/2\\ years, the administration has \nconsistently failed to provide that plan.\n  As the terrorist threat continues around the world and grows and \nmetastasizes, the administration continues to demand that the facility \nbe closed while failing to explain how it will do so. There are serious \nlegal and security challenges inherent in moving this population to \nother locations, whether inside or outside of the United States. \nCongress is simply asking the executive branch to explain where it will \nhold those set for trial, how it will continue to detain dangerous \nterrorists pursuant to the laws of war, and how it\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\nwill mitigate the risks of moving this population. If the \nadministration can provide those answers to these basic questions to \nthe satisfaction of the American people, then congressional \nrestrictions on the movement of these detainees will be lifted and the \nplan can be implemented.\n  Now, Congress's need for answers is even more acute after the \nadministration transferred five senior Taliban detainees under secret \nagreement to Qatar without prior notification to Congress as required \nby law. The President of the United States blatantly violated the law--\nwhich required, before these five detainees were transferred to Qatar, \nthat Congress be notified 6 months ahead of time--using the rationale \nthat they were afraid the information might leak. Is that justification \nfor breaking the law? And isn't it understandable, the skepticism here \non both sides of the aisle about any plan they may have or may not \nhave? Isn't it reasonable that the Congress of the United States should \nbe presented with a plan, and shouldn't the Congress of the United \nStates express its approval or disapproval?\n  The notification standard was enacted into law to allow the President \nthe authority to implement his stated policy but with a good-faith \nunderstanding that the people's representative could weigh in on these \nimportant decisions before the transfers happened. The President's \nfailure to abide by the notification provisions undermined any trust \nCongress had in the process.\n  Now, as the Taliban continues to plot attacks against U.S. \nservicemembers in Afghanistan, the administration is scurrying to \nfigure out how to keep those five terrorists from the battlefield.\n  This is not congressional overreach; it is congressional oversight. \nThe President has decided that the security risks of keeping Guantanamo \nopen outweigh the security and legal risks of closing it. Congress is \nseeking information that will allow the American people and Congress to \nunderstand that decision.\n  The American people deserve an explanation for how the President \nplans to execute one of his most repeated policy goals. There is some \ndispute about what percentage of those who have been released from \ndetention in Guantanamo have reentered the fight. Some say it is as \nhigh as 30 percent, and some say it is as low as 7 or 8 percent. There \nis no debate that detainees who were released from Guantanamo have \nreentered the fight, placing the lives of American service men and \nwomen in jeopardy and in danger. Of course, the five who were released \nwere amongst the toughest, the worst, the hardest cases. Now there is \nsome question as to whether they will remain under strict supervision \nin Qatar.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying that the NDAA is far too important \nto be held hostage in a budget negotiation. For 53 consecutive years, \nthe Congress has passed a national defense authorization act. With \nthreats to our national security multiplying around the world, I would \nhope this year would be no different.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for all of the hard work he \nand his staff and Members on that side of the aisle have done in order \nto have legislation that passed overwhelmingly through the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I hope we can move forward on getting that \nlegislation through the Senate, in consultation and in compromise with \nthe House, and to the White House for the President's signature.\n  I would say again that I read carefully the administration's \nobjection to the legislation as it now stands. These are not valid in \nsome cases. In other cases, we would be glad to negotiate with the \nWhite House as we go to conference with the House after completing \nthis. I sincerely hope and pray that--there are so many provisions \nthere that are important to the lives of the men and women serving in \nthe military that I would hope the President would take into \nconsideration how important this is to the men and women who are \nserving, their lives and their welfare, their equipment, their \ntraining, and their ability to defend this Nation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford).\n  The clerk will call the roll\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Frances \nPerkins Center on the designation of the Frances Perkins Homestead, \nlocated in Newcastle, ME, as a National Historic Landmark. The Brick \nHouse was the home of the remarkable Frances Perkins, the first woman \nappointed to a Presidential cabinet. This is an honor that has been \ngiven to only 2,500 other historic places in the United States and I \napplaud the Frances Perkins Center for receiving this distinction.\n  Frances Perkins found that no matter where she lived during her life, \nher true home would always be in Maine. While she was born in Boston in \n1880, both of her parents were native Mainers. She grew up living in \nWorcester and spending summers with her grandmother on the family's \nsaltwater farm in Newcastle. Frances credited her own character to be a \ndirect result of her grandmother's influence and their time together in \nMaine.\n  Frances was a motivated and inquisitive person from a young age. She \nattended Classical High School in Worcester and, though it was uncommon \nat the time, she went on to Mount Holyoke College where she was a \nstandout student. Professors immediately noticed Frances' ambition and \nnatural intellect. Frances graduated from Mont Holyoke in 1902 with a \nmajor in physics and minors in chemistry and biology.\n  Throughout her life, Frances was devoted to improving the lives of \nAmerican workers. After college, Frances moved to Illinois, working as \na teacher and volunteering in settlement houses. She then received her \nmaster's degree from Colombia and subsequently began her extraordinary \ncareer in public service, working for the New York City Consumers \nLeague and then the New York State Industrial Commission.\n  The impressive work by Frances for the Industrial Commission led to \nnewly elected New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt to name her New \nYork State Commissioner of Labor. She received attention and admiration \nin this role for her ceaseless commitment to improving work conditions \nin New York. In February 1933, Roosevelt appointed Frances Secretary of \nLabor in his Presidential cabinet. Frances was the first female Federal \ncabinet official, which remains one of her most notable and outstanding \nachievements.\n  Frances' accomplishments as Secretary of Labor had, and continue to \nhave, a profound impact on American lives. Frances was the lead \narchitect in designing New Deal policies during the Great Depression; \nhowever, her work did not stop there. She was incredibly influential in \ncreating legislation for Social Security and establishing a 40-hour \nwork week. Frances is also known for her major role in prohibiting \nchild labor, enforcing worker's rights, and designing unemployment \ninsurance as well as workers' aid.\n  Frances' beliefs, values, and spirit grew from her strong connection \nto Maine. Frances regularly returned to her Maine home, especially when \nshe desired a haven to rest and remember her roots. She owned and \nmaintained the family farm in Newcastle from 1927 until she died on May \n14, 1965 at the age of 85. She is buried nearby the homestead.\n  I am thrilled at the nomination of the Frances Perkins Homestead as a \nNational Historic Landmark. Frances was a fearless leader who \nexemplified American values of hard work and determination. Frances' \nwork lives on as an essential benefit to countless American citizens. I \nam proud that her legacy is a part of Maine's history and I warmly \ncongratulate the Frances Perkins Homestead, and all those involved with \nachieving this accomplishment, on its dedication as a National Historic \nLandmark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3856-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA 103RD ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Girl Scouts \nof America on the occasion of their 103rd Anniversary. The Girl Scouts \nwere created in 1912 in the midst of the progressive movement by \nJuliette Gordon Low for the purpose of empowering young women and \ninstilling them with character, honesty, patriotism, and leadership \nskills. The independence and integrity that young women develop with \nthe Girl Scouts is a priceless resource for these girls later in life.\n  For 103 years, the Girl Scouts have influenced female leaders, and \nhave led the fight for equality and inclusiveness in leadership \npositions. The fact that former girl scouts make up 60 percent of the \nwomen in the House of Representatives and over 50 percent of current \nfemale business owners demonstrates the organization's ability to \ncultivate leaders. Through the Girl Scouts, girls have gained skills \nthat are essential tools to help women achieve equality in leadership \npositions.\n  The Girl Scouts have also developed and implemented programs to help \nmiddle and high school girls become financially literate and \nindependent. Indeed, the Girl Scout Cookie Program is the largest girl-\nled business in the world and is a hallmark program that helps girls \nacross the country develop the skills, such as money management, \ncustomer interaction, and business ethics, which are essential to life-\nlong success. They have also invested in science and mathematics \nprograms to empower young women who have an interest in those fields. \nThrough their continued efforts to develop girls' leadership abilities, \nconfidence, and worldly knowledge, the Girl Scouts have played an \nimportant role in helping young women reach their full potential.\n  Today, I mark the legacy and future of this invaluable organization. \nI applaud the Girl Scouts of Maine, and America, for the immeasurable \nimpact they have had on women's rights, and women themselves, over the \npast 103 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3856-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3856-S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL PETER W. OGDEN\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to honor the career of LTC \nPeter W. Ogden, who will retire this June as director of the Bureau of \nVeterans' Services. Peter has served in this role for the past 11 years \nand I am profoundly grateful for all that he has done for Maine and our \nesteemed veterans.\n  Peter began serving the Nation and the State of Maine long before his \nposition as director. He enlisted in the U.S Army Corps of Engineers in \n1967 and in the following years he completed two combat tours in \nVietnam. After graduating from Maine Military Academy as a \nDistinguished Graduate, Peter served in the Maine Army National Guard. \nIn total, Peter spent an impressive 28 years of his life dedicated to \nmilitary service.\n  Peter is an excellent example of a person who brings personal and \nselfless commitment to his career. As a veteran himself, Peter has a \ncomplete and thorough understanding of the challenges and issues \nveterans face on a regular basis. He has worked tirelessly to provide \nMaine veterans and their families with informational services, \nassistance programs, and strong representation. Through his work as \ndirector, Peter has improved the lives of countless Maine veterans and \nfamilies.\n  The programs and services Peter developed while director are \nessential to veterans as well as military men, women and families. I \nwas particularly impressed by Peter's work supporting\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\nGold Star families through projects such as House in the Woods. This \nproject continues to help both families and veterans cope with loss by \nproviding a close support network and outdoor-related experiences, from \nfishing to hiking.\n  I greatly value public servants like Peter and I have a high \nappreciation for the essential and high-quality service he has ensured \nfor Maine veterans during his time as director of the Bureau of \nVeterans' Services. I extend my sincerest congratulations and gratitude \nto Peter for all of his accomplishments and I wish him all the best in \nhis well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3857-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING SOUTHERN MAINE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I bring to the fore an \norganization that serves as a model for coordinated economic \ndevelopment and environmental responsibility. Later this month, the \nSouthern Maine Planning and Development Commission, or SMPDC, will \ncelebrate its 50th anniversary. This milestone is a testament not only \nto its longevity and breadth, but also to its ability to continually \ndevelop pertinent projects for southern Maine's economy. They are truly \nan inspiration for similar initiatives across the country and around \nthe globe.\n  SMPDC is a Council of Governments enabled by State statute that \nserves the southern part of our great State in 39 communities. As this \nregion forms the southern tip of Maine, it injects economic vitality to \nall corners of the State as the ``Gateway to Maine.'' It boasts 300 \nmiles of breathtaking coastline--with rocky points, quiet inlets, and \nsandy beaches. This coastline alone brings in thousands of tourists \neach year who wish to share the marvels of our distinct and special \nhome. This region also extends westward toward the White Mountains, an \narea dotted with numerous lakes, fertile lands, dense forests, and \ncrossed by the mighty Saco River. To help maintain this land for us and \nfor future generations, the folks at SMPDC offer comprehensive planning \nand ordinance revision to communities to ensure they achieve the \nappropriate growth while preserving the land and shoreline that so \ncharacterizes the Maine way of life.\n  Being the Gateway to Maine, and given the recent Federal gridlock \nover properly funding the Highway Trust Fund, I would be remiss not to \nmention the commission's work to assist municipalities throughout the \nregion in transportation project planning and management. They have \nrallied local leaders and first responders to address the emergencies \non the roads and made the veins of our economy safer through their \nTraffic Incident Management Group--which in 2007 was given the \nExcellence in Regional Transportation Award by the National Association \nof Development. Furthermore, with I-95 and Amtrak pouring resources and \nrevenue into the State, SMPDC has been essential to coordinating \ncommunity action to ensure we make the most of these assets.\n  And even while focusing on the largest arteries of transportation in \nthe area, the commission has not turned a blind eye to the scenic roads \nand healthy travel alternatives that encourage people to get outdoors \nand reaffirms access and economic prospects for Maine's vibrant eco-\ntourism industry. Teaming up with the Bicycle Coalition of Maine, SMPDC \nhas successfully implemented the York County Active Communities \nNetwork. This initiative explores the potential for improvements and \nfunding opportunities for those looking to bike or walk safely and \nfreely throughout their community. The group has also added further \neconomic vitality to Maine through its work with the Pequawket Trail \nScenic Byway, which winds its way through the White Mountains in \nwestern Maine and along the Saco River. This Corridor Management Plan \nfloods the scenic towns along it with visitors and economic opportunity \nfrom downtown Standish to historic Fryeburg.\n  Perhaps what the commission is most widely recognized for is their \nsuccess with the Brownfields Redevelopment Project, which is funded in \npart by the EPA's Brownfield and Land Revitalization Program. \nBrownfields are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial \nproperties that have some threat of environmental contamination, \nwhether it is real or perceived. Beginning in 2004, the Brownfield \nRedevelopment Project started funding ventures throughout southern \nMaine to rebuild old dams, mills, and other previously condemned \nfacilities to help reintroduce many of Maine's beautiful, historic \nbuildings to their communities. South Berwick now boasts a fantastic \nrenovated library and Kennebunk even retooled a gas station to create a \ncommunity ice rink, while the mills in Sanford and Biddeford are \nteeming with hundreds of new businesses. At an event earlier in the \nyear, the EPA cited SMPDC as one of the top 10 in the Nation for their \nwide ranging success with these projects. This work is truly exciting \nand a perfect demonstration of SMPDC's powerful impact on southern \nMaine.\n  As the Southern Maine Planning and Development Council ushers in \ntheir 50th anniversary on June 24, we should take time to reflect on \nthe countless dedicated public servants who have worked with unwavering \ncommitment to better their communities. I am deeply grateful for their \ncountless accomplishments, and look forward to the many more inspiring \nand productive projects they undertake in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3857-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         2015 WOMEN'S WORLD CUP\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ.

Despite being drawn into the so-called \n``group of death,'' this U.S. team enters the tournament as one of the \nfavorites, and I am confident that they will represent us well and make \nus all proud to be Americans.\n  While much of the world considers the U.S. to be a relative newcomer \nto the global soccer community on the men's side of the game, our \nwomen's team is unmatched in its esteem, having won two World Cup \ntitles since the tournament began in 1991 and never finishing below \nthird place. I hope that this U.S. team will build upon its rich \nhistory of success at the seventh Women's World Cup.\n  I believe that we will win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3857-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3857-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3857-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2578.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Washington urging the United States Congress to \n     support the conversion of the 81st Armored Brigade Combat \n     Team of the Washington National Guard into a Stryker Brigade \n     Combat Team with brigade units stationed in Washington, \n     Oregon, and California; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8008\n\n       Whereas, The opportunity exists to add a second Stryker \n     Brigade Combat Team to the Army National Guard's force \n     structure, and to locate this Brigade on the west coast; and\n       Whereas, There are a variety of practical and strategic \n     reasons which make the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team a \n     logical candidate for conversion; and\n       Whereas, A Stryker Brigade Combat Team stationed on the \n     west coast will strengthen our nation's defense by \n     maintaining Stryker capacity focused on the Asia-Pacific \n     Region, enhance Regular Army/Army National Guard partnership, \n     and provide a key domestic response capability; and\n       Whereas, Transitioning the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team \n     to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team strategically places \n     Strykers in Washington, Oregon, and California, and will save \n     taxpayers thirty million dollars over the course of an army \n     force generation cycle; and\n       Whereas, The 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team is \n     headquartered at Camp Murray, Washington, located just across \n     the street from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which is the United \n     States Army's Stryker Center of Excellence and is within \n     convoy range of the Yakima Training Center; and\n       Whereas, The extensive Stryker infrastructure available at \n     Joint Base Lewis-McChord and the Yakima Training Center \n     represents a great advantage in leveraging shared resources; \n     and\n       Whereas, Furthermore, this places the Stryker Brigade \n     Combat Team equipment sets brought back from overseas \n     contingencies into mission-ready use, and available for \n     overseas and domestic contingency response; and\n       Whereas, Strykers will also give the governors of \n     Washington, Oregon, and California a fast, durable, and \n     effective asset to save lives, protect property, maintain \n     peace, and ensure the continuity of government in times of \n     emergency;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that as \n     you consider force structure balance in this era of \n     constrained resources, coupled with the tactical, strategic, \n     and domestic needs of our nation, you will support the \n     conversion of the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the \n     Washington National Guard into a Stryker Brigade Combat Team \n     with brigade units stationed in Washington, Oregon, and \n     California.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, General Frank J.

The estimated annual cost to address \n     established populations of dreissenids in the Pacific \n     Northwest economic region is almost five hundred million \n     dollars annually; and\n       Whereas, The Water Resources Reform and Development Act was \n     signed in June 2014. It authorizes twenty million dollars for \n     Columbia River Basin dreissenid efforts through the Secretary \n     of the Army;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully request that \n     Congress expedite appropriation of these funds to \n     significantly enhance monitoring and prevention efforts and \n     to implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and \n     Development Act.\n       Be it resolved; That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States, Sally Jewell, Secretary of the Department of \n     the Interior, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-35. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress to \n     amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or take any other \n     appropriate action to ensure that the common raven is not a \n     protected species under the Act; to the Committee on \n     Environmental and Public Works.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, The greater sage grouse (Centrocercus \n     urophasianus) is a species of bird that inhabits much of the \n     sagebrush habitat in Nevada as well as other western states; \n     and\n       Whereas, The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has \n     determined that the greater sage grouse is warranted for \n     listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1531 et seq.; and\n       Whereas, Through the enactment of Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution No. 15, File Number 48, Statutes of Nevada 2005, \n     at page 3022, the members of the 73rd Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature found that the listing of the greater sage grouse \n     as an endangered or threatened species would have a \n     devastatingly negative impact on Nevada's land development, \n     land use, water use, mining, recreational activities and \n     local economies; and\n       Whereas, The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) is a \n     species of tortoise that inhabits the desert habitat of the \n     southwestern United States, including the Mojave desert \n     region of southern Nevada; and\n       Whereas, The desert tortoise is listed as a threatened \n     species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1531 et seq.; and\n       Whereas, The common raven (Corvus corax) is a species of \n     bird that inhabits Nevada and much of the western United \n     States, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia; and\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\n       Whereas, The International Union for Conservation of Nature \n     estimates the global population of the common raven as \n     greater than 16 million and trending upwards, thus \n     classifying it as a species of least concern; and\n       Whereas, A known cause of decline in the sage grouse \n     population is egg depredation by the common raven, and \n     research conducted at Idaho State University has suggested \n     that reductions in the raven population significantly \n     increase sage grouse nest success; and\n       Whereas, The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has \n     identified the common raven as the most highly visible \n     predator of hatchling and juvenile desert tortoises, and \n     research published by the Western Ecological Research Center \n     of the United States Geological Survey recommends controlling \n     certain raven populations to assist in the recovery of desert \n     tortoise populations; and\n       Whereas, The common raven is a protected species under \n     regulations adopted pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act \n     of 1918, 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1703 et seq., which drastically \n     curtails the ability of this State to manage the population \n     of the common raven in order to protect sage grouse nests and \n     desert tortoises: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada \n     Legislature urge the United States Congress to amend the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act or take any other appropriate \n     action to ensure that the common raven is not a protected \n     species under that Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the 78th Session of the \n     Nevada Legislature urge the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service to:\n       1. Work with the Nevada Department of Wildlife to decrease \n     common raven populations in this State; and\n       2. Adopt regulations allowing the State of Nevada to manage \n     the common raven population and reduce the number of common \n     ravens in this State; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, each member of the \n     Nevada Congressional Delegation, the Director of the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service, the President of the Nevada \n     Cattlemen's Association, the President of the Nevada Farm \n     Bureau Federation, the Chair of the Sagebrush Ecosystem \n     Council and the Executive Director of the Western Governors' \n     Association; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-36. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President \n     of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 refugee \n     visas for certain displaced individuals, with preference for \n     placement in Michigan; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, The United States has long been a safe harbor for \n     persecuted foreign nationals. Through the U.S. refugee visa \n     program, individuals and their families who are harassed, \n     oppressed, or have faced harassment or oppression at home \n     because of their race, religion, nationality, public opinion, \n     or social association can find relief in the U.S. When a \n     humanitarian crisis occurs, the U.S. may also grant eligible \n     individuals refugee visas. Once in the country, federal \n     resettlement agencies help match refugees with local \n     communities that can help support their needs; and\n       Whereas, The number of refugee visas available is \n     determined and set by the President of the United States. In \n     consultation with the cabinet and the House and Senate \n     committees on the judiciary, the President assesses all \n     concerns of humanitarian and national interest to determine \n     the number of visas that will be available for the upcoming \n     fiscal year; and\n       Whereas, The recent crisis in Syria and Iraq has forced \n     hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, largely from religious \n     minorities in the region--many of which are Assyrians, \n     Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis--from their hometowns that \n     have been ransacked by the Islamic State of Iraq and the \n     Levant (ISIL). Those displaced persons are unable to return \n     to their homes, and most do not have access to resources \n     needed to fulfill basic needs, including food, water, and \n     shelter. Moreover, these refugees face constant fear of \n     persecution due to nothing more than the faith they claim, \n     and their pronouncement of faith has led to violence as \n     explicit as crucifixions, beheadings, and slavery. Minimal \n     support has been offered to many of the more than three \n     million Iraqis refugees, two million of which were displaced \n     last year alone, and those fortunate to remain in temporary \n     shelters are overburdening and overcrowding neighboring \n     nations and communities who stand on constant guard for fear \n     that they will be the next target of ISIL. As this regional \n     conflict endures, the displacement and imminent migration and \n     persecution of refugees will continue; and\n       Whereas, Displaced Iraqi refugees must be offered relief \n     from this regional instability and granted entry into the \n     United States. Iraqi refugees have complemented our American \n     society with a proven history of contributing to the economic \n     and social well-being of this nation. In the Chaldean or \n     Catholic Iraqi community of Metro Detroit, which is the \n     largest concentration of Chaldeans outside of Iraq, 61 \n     percent of households founded their own business, and this \n     network of businesses is indispensable to the local economy. \n     Moreover, organizations like the Chaldean Community \n     Foundation offer resources to bind and strengthen the \n     community as well as welcome and support refugees, in part by \n     using community businesses to invest in new members and \n     encourage the advancement of the community; and\n       Whereas, The current allotment of refugee visas may not be \n     adequate to accommodate these individuals. When an unforeseen \n     emergency arises, the President has the flexibility to issue \n     emergency refugee visas for an affected group if the \n     remaining annual allotment is insufficient to assist these \n     displaced individuals, and\n       Whereas, The Chaldean Church and its bishop have garnered \n     support for this request and driven a body of people able and \n     willing to sustain and support the incoming refugees. The \n     community stands ready to assist persecuted Iraqis and \n     victims of war rebuild their lives in the U.S.: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     President of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 \n     refugee visas for displaced Iraqis, being the Assyrians, \n     Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis displaced because of their \n     faith; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge that these refugees be given \n     preference for placement in the state of Michigan; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3860-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive report of a nomination was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. VITTER for the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship.\n       *Douglas J.

and\n       (C) developed performance assistance plans to give \n     employees formal training, on-the-job training, counseling, \n     mentoring, and other assistance.\n       (2) The military components and Defense Agencies of the \n     Department are currently reviewing the proposed ``New \n     Beginnings'' performance management and workforce incentive \n     system developed in response to section 1113 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.\n       (3) The Department anticipates it will begin implementation \n     of the ``New Beginnings'' performance management and \n     workforce incentive system in April 2016.\n       (4) The authority in section 1113 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 provided the \n     Secretary, in coordination with the Director of the Office of \n     Personnel Management, flexibilities in promulgating \n     regulations to redesign the procedures which are applied by \n     the Department in making appointments to positions within the \n     competitive service in order to--\n       (A) better meet mission needs;\n       (B) respond to manager needs and the needs of applicants;\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\n       (C) produce high-quality applicants;\n       (D) support timely decisions;\n       (E) uphold appointments based on merit system principles; \n     and\n       (F) promote competitive job offers.\n       (5) In implementing the ``New Beginnings'' performance \n     management and workforce incentive system, section 1113 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \n     requires the Secretary to comply with veterans' preference \n     requirements.\n       (6) Among the criteria for the ``New Beginnings'' \n     performance management and workforce incentive system \n     authorized by section 1113 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, the Secretary is \n     required to--\n       (A) adhere to merit principles;\n       (B) include a means for ensuring employee involvement (for \n     bargaining unit employees, through their exclusive \n     representatives) in the design and implementation of the \n     performance management and workforce incentive system;\n       (C) provide for adequate training and retraining for \n     supervisors, managers, and employees in the implementation \n     and operation of the performance management and workforce \n     incentive system;\n       (D) develop a comprehensive management succession program \n     to provide training to employees to develop managers for the \n     Department and a program to provide training to supervisors \n     on actions, options, and strategies a supervisor may use in \n     administering the performance management and workforce \n     incentive system;\n       (E) include effective transparency and accountability \n     measures and safeguards to ensure that the management of the \n     performance management and workforce incentive system is \n     fair, credible, and equitable, including appropriate \n     independent reasonableness reviews, internal assessments, and \n     employee surveys;\n       (F) utilize the annual strategic workforce plan required by \n     section 115b of title 10, United States Code; and\n       (G) ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the \n     design, implementation, and administration of the performance \n     management and workforce incentive system.\n       (7) Section 1113 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2010 also requires the Secretary to develop a \n     program of training--to be completed by a supervisor every \n     three years--on the actions, options, and strategies a \n     supervisor may use in--\n       (A) developing and discussing relevant goals and objectives \n     with employees, communicating and discussing progress \n     relative to performance goals and objectives, and conducting \n     performance appraisals;\n       (B) mentoring and motivating employees, and improving \n     employee performance and productivity;\n       (C) fostering a work environment characterized by fairness, \n     respect, equal opportunity, and attention to the quality of \n     the work of employees;\n       (D) effectively managing employees with unacceptable \n     performance;\n       (E) addressing reports of a hostile work environment, \n     reprisal, or harassment of or by another supervisor or \n     employee; and\n       (F) allowing experienced supervisors to mentor new \n     supervisors by sharing knowledge and advice in areas such as \n     communication, critical thinking, responsibility, \n     flexibility, motivating employees, teamwork, leadership, and \n     professional development, and pointing out strengths and \n     areas of development.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should proceed with the \n     collaborative work with employee representatives on the ``New \n     Beginnings'' performance management and workforce incentive \n     system and begin implementation of the new system at the \n     earliest possible date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3885-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nPresiding Officer in the Chamber in allowing me to speak this late in \nthe day about issues that are vital to our national defense, which will \nbe addressed tomorrow and during the course of the week in votes on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  The task before the Senate in the National Defense Authorization Act \nis nothing less than to craft a sustainable, long-term strategy to \ndefend America. In fact, it is to sustain our global leadership in a \ntime of shifting alliances, significant challenges, and emerging \nthreats, while bringing a long-term balance and sustainability to our \nmilitary.\n  This defense measure is a solid start, but it must be made stronger \nto better meet the needs of our military men and women and our Nation \nas we enter this supremely perilous time. The danger to America has \nnever been greater. Our foes have never been more insidious and \npernicious, and many of the States opposing us have never been more \nwilling to take measures that fundamentally contravene not only our \nsecurity but our sense of moral right and wrong.\n  I approach the National Defense Authorization Act with this principle \nin mind. Neither the United States nor our troops, nor anyone involved \nin our national defense should ever face a fair fight. Our men and \nwomen in uniform should never be challenged in the air, on the sea or \non land with a fair fight. It should be one-sided and in our favor. \nThat is the basic principle. We must be superior in our military Armed \nForces.\n  I am grateful to the chairman of our committee, Senator McCain of \nArizona, an extraordinarily distinguished veteran and a partner in a \nnumber of amendments to this measure, and to the ranking member Senator \nJack Reed, also a public servant of extraordinary distinction and a \nveteran. I am grateful for their leadership in bringing us to this \npoint on a bill that attracted bipartisan support--overwhelming \nsupport--on the Armed Services Committee, where I am privileged to \nserve.\n  The provisions in this bill will enable us to remain the strongest \ncountry militarily in the world. At the end of the day, our values, our \nway of life, and our democracy give us our real strength, but the \nmilitary is necessary to defend those values and our quality and way of \nlife. The military defends our values and traditions and our \nfundamental rights and liberties, which we worked hard last week to \nuphold in the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I have filed a number of amendments that underscore the need for \ncontinuing improvement in this bill. They are forward-looking \namendments. One of them would modernize the National Guard's helicopter \nfleet by providing vital capabilities for the military as well as the \nsustainability and growth for Connecticut's dedicated defense industry.\n  To protect our heroes in uniform, I have also proposed an amendment \nthat would provide stronger legal tools against predatory lending and \nother abuses targeting our military men and women nearby the very bases \nthey are stationed.\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\n  Mr. President, I refer my colleagues to these two amendments, Nos. \n1820 and 1564.\n  I also joined Ranking Member Reed in cosponsoring his amendment, \nwhich will set forth a responsible and sustainable budget strategy by \nending sequestration in our military budget and allowing us to ensure \nthat all of our Nation's key security priorities are addressed.\n  Tomorrow, this body will vote on that amendment. It is a critical \nvote. It allows us to choose sides as to whether we will put close to \n$40 billion, in effect, on our national debt rather than in our budget \nor on our credit card rather than find a sustainable means to pay for \nit. Each of us will have to decide whether we want to end \nsequestration, which I am committed to ending, or instead whether we \nwill continue sequestration-and the very real harm it imposes on our \nnation-by putting an extra $40 billion in the overseas contingent \noperations account known as OCO. Sequestration cannot be allowed to \nbecome a permanent fixture. We must work together in a bipartisan \nmanner to end it.\n  In my time in the U.S. Senate, I have fought for our national defense \nfunding because I believe our troops in harm's way deserve our full, \nuncompromising, unyielding, and unstinting support. We owe them the \nbest equipment, the best training and supplies, as well as the best \ninstitutional support and health care that the world has to offer \nbecause they are the best fighting force that our world has ever seen. \nThey fight for a nation that is the best, strongest, and greatest in \nthe history of the world--not only in its military strength but in its \nfundamental values and freedom that allow us to speak as we wish in \nthis very Chamber, to criticize authority, to speak truth to those in \npower, to debate, to come together, as we did this past weekend to \nworship and gather together and say whatever we please and think as we \nwish.\n  I hope we will address this vital interest in making sure we provide \na sustainable source of funding by ending sequestration rather than \nrelying on the overseas contingency operation account, which is a form \nof borrowing. It increases the deficit; it doesn't reduce it. It \ndiminishes stable and sustainable funding; it doesn't enhance it. It \nsimply provides more uncertainty rather than a long-term strategy.\n  This measure, which I support, enhances our security by providing for \nthe construction of Virginia-class submarines--that are necessary. In \nfact, the NDAA provides $800 million in additional funding over what \nthe President requested, and it endorses equipping all future attack \nsubmarines within an enhanced payload capability.\n  Naval warfare, and particularly undersea warfare, is as relevant and \nimportant now as it ever was, and these submarines will do much to \nenhance our readiness, our nuclear deterrence, our special operations, \nand our surveillance. They are the stealthiest, strongest weapons \nplatform under the sea ever known to man. Likewise, the research and \ndevelopment in the Ohio replacement program will continue to go \nforward.\n  The bill provides for $1 billion for six additional Joint Strike \nFighter aircraft for the Marine Corps--this is profoundly significant--\nas well as $17 million in new military construction for the Connecticut \nNational Guard.\n  There are other measures, but apart from the hard work is an \nimportant step for fairness and keeping faith and dealing fairly with \nour men and women in uniform. This legislation provides for a 1.3 \npercent pay raise and $85 million to be directed toward improving \nfinancial literacy among our servicemembers. That is really the very \nleast we can do.\n  Our military men and women do not do this for the pay or the \nfinancial compensation, but for their families' sake, we need to deal \nwith them fairly and keep faith with them. In my role as ranking member \nof the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have paid special attention to \nensuring that this bill helps to ease the transition of military \npersonnel into civilian life by establishing a new ``Record of \nService'' card upon their separation that will help prevent identity \ntheft and financial fraud. I urge the DOD, as does the Armed Services \nCommittee, to discontinue its use of Social Security numbers on \nmilitary records. It will help prevent identity theft and the kinds of \nbreaches that put our servicemen and their families at risk \nfinancially, just as they are often at risk physically in combat.\n  The bill also directs DOD to stem the tide of opioid prescription \ndrug abuse, and it helps military retirees get smoking cessation \nassistance. I would go further and provide for stronger measures to \ndeal with over-prescription through education programs and drug \nformularies that provide alternatives, and that is one of the \namendments I will offer.\n  Finally, two principal amendments I propose are an amendment to \nprovide additional helicopters for the Army National Guard, which I \nwill speak on now and seek to make pending at a later point, and an \namendment improving consumer protections for military personnel and \ntheir families, which is currently pending.\n  First, we can greatly strengthen this bill by making a commitment to \nour National Guard to provide additional helicopters. The UH-60 Black \nHawk helicopter is one of the most versatile and heavily used aviation \ncapabilities in the Army National Guard, as well as by all the states \nin which they serve. The UH-60A is the oldest model Black Hawk in \nservice and is currently flown almost exclusively by the Army National \nGuard.\n  We can strengthen this bill by fulfilling our commitment to the \nNational Guard in providing 15 additional UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters \nthat are the workhorse of our warriors who serve in our National Guard, \nwarriors who have distinguished themselves not only in combat but also \nin emergencies and disasters at home. These helicopters will help them \nserve at home and abroad, which is one of the reasons that acquiring \nmore of these helicopters, M model Black Hawks, are one of the \npriorities of the National Guard Association.\n  I have listened to the National Guard leaders in Connecticut, and I \nhave listened to distinguished warriors and veterans of the National \nGuard from around the country, and I know these UH-60 Black Hawks are \nthe workhorses. They are important in medium-lift capability to the \nNational Guard in support of homeland defense and response to \nemergencies. The UH-60A models now lack onboard capabilities--modern \ncapabilities that would enable them to be deployed overseas in hostile \nenvironments without significant upgrades to others parts of their \nconfiguration. They need that upgrade to be configured properly. The \nnew aircraft would flow to states all across the country and ensure the \nNational Guard is ready to deploy both at home and abroad.\n  Under the Army's current budget projections, the Army National Guard \nwill not replace their aging UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters until 2025. \nWe need to do better, we need to do it more promptly, and that is why I \nam proposing amendment No. 1820.\n  The amendment is fully paid for by an offset from the Foreign \nCurrency Fund. The upside of a strengthening American dollar is that \nthe Army can put more funds towards buying American helicopters and \nspend less in foreign currency expenses.\n  The other principal amendment, which I have made pending to the bill, \nimproves the consumer protections afforded to our servicemembers and \ntheir families by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. On the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act, penalties, quite bluntly, are too low, \nand that is why I wish to thank my colleagues Ranking Member Reed as \nwell as Senators Durbin, Murray, and Whitehouse, all of whom have been \nworking tirelessly and have joined me in proposing stronger protections \nin the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act by doubling the penalties and \nmaking them as high as $110,000 for a first violation and $220,000 for \na second or subsequent violation. This legislation provides deterrents, \npunishment, and a stop to this kind of financial abuse that may take \nplace, literally, within sight of military bases.\n  Recently, the Department of Justice used this authority to obtain a \ncivil penalty against Capital One and Sallie Mae. We have seen \nfinancial abuse by Capital One, when it foreclosed improperly on \nservicemembers' homes. These practices can include these kinds of \nabuses involving foreclosure and other kinds of exploitation which \nSallie Mae, unfortunately, engaged in. ``Federal\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nlaw protects our servicemembers from having to repay loans under terms \nthat are unaffordable or unfair.'' Student lender Sallie Mae \nsidestepped requirements by charging excessive rates to borrowers who \nfiled documents proving they were members of the U.S. military. For \nover a decade Sallie Mae violated SCRA by failing to provide over \n60,000 military servicemembers with the 6 percent interest rate cap \nthey were entitled to on their student loans. This type of conduct is \nmore than just inappropriate, it is inexcusable, and it will not be \ntolerated.\n  In addition, my colleagues have been working to make other important \nimprovements to the SCRA. For example, Senator Reed has worked \ntirelessly to ensure servicemembers can terminate leases on rental \nproperties without early termination fees if they are assigned to, or \nrelocate to, government quarters. Senator Whitehouse has sought to make \npermanent a one-year post service protection from foreclosure for \nreturning servicemembers and Senator Durbin has been fighting to make \nsure our servicemembers with student loan debt can take advantage of \nthe protections of the SCRA. I appreciate my colleagues tireless \nadvocacy and look forward to working together to advance these \nimportant provisions.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for Senator Reed's amendment \ntomorrow. We face critical decisions ahead. This measure has \nextraordinary merit. We must keep faith with those who serve, and I \nhope we will when we vote this week on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/08/senate-section/article/S3887-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
