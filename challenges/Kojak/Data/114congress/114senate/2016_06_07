Mr. President, the Republican nominee of our great country \ncontinues to attack a Federal judge because of his Mexican heritage. \nThis is not only wrong, it is racist and un-American. It is also a \nfundamental attack on the American judiciary system.\n  When issues like these arise, the Nation has historically looked to \nthe Senate for leadership. In particular, throughout our history, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee has been a bastion of independence and \nbipartisanship. When Federal judges are under assault, we should expect \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee to rise above politics and \ncondemn racism--but not this Judiciary chairman who is now the chairman \nof the committee in the United States Senate, not the senior United \nStates Senator from Iowa.\n  Instead of a bold feat of bipartisanship, we are left with yet \nanother example of how he has become the most partisan Judiciary \nchairman in the history of America. Instead of rising above \npartisanship and condemning Trump's racist attacks on a highly \nqualified judge--by the way, who was born in Indiana--Senator Grassley \nkisses Trump's ring and toes the party line. Instead of condemning \nTrump, Grassley defended him.\n  His rationale is mind-boggling. Listen to this: Senator Grassley says \nthat Trump must respect the Judiciary because over the course of \nhundreds of lawsuits and years of litigation, Trump has actually won \nsome cases. I can't make up something like this.\n  For example, a quote from a newspaper article:\n\n       Grassley also suggested Trump's propensity for filing \n     lawsuits showed some level of respect for the judicial \n     branch.\n       ``He must respect the Judiciary,'' Grassley said. ``I've \n     seen statistics that he's won over 400 cases, only lost 30.''\n\n  How about that. I find it curious that the chairman doesn't have time \nto read Merrick Garland's questionnaire or give him a hearing, but he \nhas time to study Donald Trump's success rate in the courtroom. This \nsays a lot, and one of the things it says is what Senator Grassley's \npriorities are.\n  In spite of everything coming out of Donald Trump's mouth, Senator \nGrassley remains loyal to Donald Trump. According to an Iowa newspaper, \nthe Ames Tribune, Senator Grassley told his constituents on Friday: \n``He isn't concerned by any of the controversial or inflammatory \nrhetoric coming from the Trump campaign.''\n  I am a little disappointed, but--with what has happened the last \ncouple of months--not surprised. I believe no Member of the Senate has \ndone more for Donald Trump than the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  In January, when many Republicans were still trying to distance \nthemselves from Donald Trump, Senator Grassley introduced Trump at an \nIowa campaign event. Since then, despite dozens of editorials against \nSenator Grassley and pressure from his constituents, Senator Grassley \nhas done everything in his power to hold open a Supreme Court seat for \nDonald Trump to fill. I am surprised Senator Grassley has yet to \nacknowledge these racist attacks on Judge Curiel because these attacks \nare beyond the pale. Instead, Senator Grassley chose to further \nestablish himself as a Trump cheerleader, just like the Republican \nleader has done.\n  Last week Senator Grassley told his constituents:\n\n       He's building confidence with me.\n\n  Talking about Trump.\n\n       I've already said I'm going to vote for him. . . . I'd \n     campaign with him.\n\n  But this is not the beginning of Senator Grassley's campaign for \nDonald Trump. Senator Grassley's entire chairmanship the past 6 months \nhas been one big campaign push for Trump. His committee has become an \nextension of the Trump campaign. The Republican Judiciary Committee has \ndone everything to focus on boosting Trump but has neglected to do its \njob in the process.\n  Under Chairman Grassley, the committee is reporting out almost no \nbills,\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nfewer judicial nominations than any time in recent history, and because \nof this inaction by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate \nhas confirmed fewer judges than in decades. We heard the report \nyesterday of how the Federal system of courts in our country is in \ndisrepair. Why? Because the Judiciary Committee is processing none of \nthe appointments President Obama has made.\n  What has the Judiciary Committee done instead? It has spent its time \ncarrying out a political hit job on Secretary Clinton. Senator Grassley \nhas wasted countless dollars and staff time developing partisan \nopposition research that he hoped could be used to help Trump's \ncandidacy against Secretary Clinton. It hasn't helped, but it has \nshortened the pocketbook of the American people. Senator Grassley has \nbeen so desperate to drag Secretary Clinton's name through the mud that \nhe even encouraged the FBI to leak an independent review of Secretary \nClinton's use of email.\n  At every turn, the senior Senator from Iowa has used his committee \nfor partisan purposes that benefit only one person: Donald Trump. There \nis no better example than the current vacancy on the Supreme Court. \nRather than doing his constitutional duty and processing Merrick \nGarland's nomination, Chairman Grassley took his marching orders from \nTrump, and Trump said: Delay, delay, delay. And that is exactly what \nthe Senator from Iowa has done--delay, delay, delay.\n  Chairman Grassley is hoping to run out the clock. He is hoping \nPresident Trump gets to nominate the next Supreme Court Justice. That \nis why last month Senator Grassley said of Trump: ``I think I would \nexpect the right type of people to be nominated by [Trump] to the \nSupreme Court.''\n  After Donald Trump's latest attack on the Judiciary, does Senator \nGrassley really believe that Trump is the right man to pick nominees to \nthe Supreme Court or any court? Donald Trump said that a Federal judge \nshould be disqualified from presiding over a case because of his \nMexican heritage, even though he was born in Indiana. He said the same \nwould apply if the judge were Muslim. Does Senator Grassley believe \nTrump's comments were racist? This is a place for the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa to start his quest for fairness.\n  The Republican junior Senator from Nebraska agrees it was racist. \nThis is what he tweeted yesterday: ``Public Service Announcement: \nSaying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is \nthe literal definition of `racism.' '' The junior Senator from South \nCarolina, also a Republican, called Trump's remarks ``racially toxic,'' \nbut what does the senior Senator from Iowa say? Zero, nothing.\n  Does the chairman of the Judiciary Committee agree with Donald Trump? \nDoes Senator Grassley also believe judges should face a religious test? \nThe senior Senator from Iowa said he trusts Donald Trump's judgment. He \nsaid, and I repeat: ``He's building confidence with me.''\n  After everything we have heard from Donald Trump--all of his vile, \nunhinged rants--does Senator Grassley honestly have confidence that \nDonald Trump should pick the next Supreme Court Justice? I don't trust \nTrump to make that decision, the people of Iowa don't, and America \ndoesn't. Senator Grassley must stop using his committee to do Trump's \nbidding. He must stop using the once-proud Judiciary Committee as an \nextension of the Trump political campaign.\n  Instead of continuous delay, delay, delay, Chairman Grassley should \ngive Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote, but do it now. Waiting for \nDonald Trump to choose the ninth member of the Supreme Court is not the \nanswer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3473-5"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                  Cyber Security and Our Electric Grid\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, at 3:30 in the afternoon on December 23 of \nlast year, about a half hour before sunset, the lights started to go \nout in western Ukraine. The power started to go out. The operator in \none of the Ukrainian powerplants noticed, to his horror, that he no \nlonger controlled the cursor on his computer screen. The cursor moved \nof its own accord and started opening dialogue boxes and opening \nbreakers.\n  The operator tried frantically to get back into the computer, only to \nfind he was locked out and the password had been changed. At the same \ntime, the call center of this utility in Ukraine was blocked by \nthousands of fake calls, so the utility itself could not know what was \nhappening in the countryside. The backup generators around western \nUkraine also went down. Malware was installed on the operating \ncomputers and a system called KillDisk was installed, which wiped the \ndisks and rendered the computers useless.\n  As a final insult, the power in the power control system itself went \noff and the operators were literally left in the dark. This was the \nfirst major cyber attack of a public utility anywhere in the world. It \nwas sophisticated, it was well planned, and it was devastating. Within \na few minutes, 230,000 people in the country of Ukraine were without \npower.\n  That attack could have occurred in Kansas City, in San Jose, in New \nYork, or here in Washington. Ever since I have served in this body as a \nmember of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, I have heard \nrepeated warnings from every public official involved with intelligence \nand national security that an attack on our critical infrastructure is \nnot possible, it is likely.\n  How many shots across our bow, how many warning shots do we have to \nendure? Sony, the OPM, insurance companies, and now the nightmare \nscenario of an electric grid attack.\n  We can learn something from what happened in the Ukraine, and there \nis a piece of good news and a lesson for us. The attack, which left \n230,000 people without power, only persisted for about 6 hours. The \ninteresting part of the scenario of this development was that one of \nthe reasons they were able to get the power back on so fast was because \nthe Ukrainian grid was not up to modern--I hesitate to say \n``standards''--practices in terms of its interconnectedness and its \ndigitization. There were old-fashioned analog switches, and the most \nold-fashioned analog switch of all, a human being, who could actually \nthrow breakers and get the system back online.\n  However, in this country we are not so lucky, and I use that in a \nvery sort of backward way because we have the most advanced grid \nstructure in the world. We are more digital, we are more automated, we \nare more interconnected, but that makes us more vulnerable. That makes \nus more vulnerable. We are asymmetrically vulnerable because we are \nasymmetrically interconnected. We keep getting these warning shots. A \nlot is being done by our utilities and by our government agencies to \nwork on protecting this country from a devastating cyber attack. But I \nknow of no one who would assert that enough is being done and that we \nare ahead of this threat.\n\n  I introduced a bill yesterday, along with three cosponsors: Senator \nRisch from Idaho, Senator Collins from Maine, and Senator Heinrich from \nNew Mexico--all of whom, along with myself, are members of the \nIntelligence Committee, where we hear about these threats practically \nweekly. The bill is pretty straightforward. It tasks our great National \nLabs with working with the utilities over a 2-year period to determine, \nnot new software patches and new complexity, but if we can protect\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\nour grid by returning to, at least at critical points in the grid, the \nold-fashioned analog switches or good-old Fred, who has to go and throw \na breaker with his dog. It may be that going back to the future, if you \nwill--going back to the past and simplifying some of these critical \nconnection points may be the best protection we can have. The idea is \nfor the Labs to put their best people on this and for the utilities to \ndo the same on a voluntary basis.\n  I might add that there is nothing mandatory about this bill. We are \ntrying to work on finding some solutions that are implementable in the \nshort run to protect us from this grave threat. Once we get a report \nback, hopefully we will be able to implement this legislation across \nthe country.\n  I am tired of hearing warnings. It is really time for us to act, and \nthis is a straightforward bill that I hope can move through this body \nat the speed of a cyber attack so that we can then have the defense we \nhave to have.\n  An attack on our critical infrastructure--particularly the electric \ninfrastructure across this country--would, in fact, be devastating and \nwould undoubtedly involve a loss of lives. I do not want to be here on \na darkening winter afternoon and see the lights going off across \nAmerica--the power to hospitals, the power to our transportation \nsystem, the power that makes our lives what they are today. This is not \nan abstract threat. We know from the Ukraine that the capability exists \nto do exactly that and take down the grid. We must act expeditiously \nand directly to counteract that threat. If we do not do so, we are \nfailing our responsibility to the people of America, our constituents, \nand the United States.\n  I urge rapid consideration of this bill, and I look forward to its \nconsideration at the Energy Committee. Three of the four sponsors are \nalso members of the Energy Committee as well as the Intelligence \nCommittee, and I am hoping we can move this rapidly so we can begin the \nprocess of countering what is not an abstract threat but a direct, \nclear, and present danger to the future of this country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here this morning to urge my \ncolleagues to support an amendment that I have offered to the National \nDefense Authorization Act to extend the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa \nProgram, also known as the SIV Program.\n  The SIV Program gives Afghans who supported the U.S. mission in \nAfghanistan and now face grave threats because of their willingness to \nhelp our service men and women on the ground in Afghanistan the ability \nto come to the United States. To be eligible, new applicants must \ndemonstrate at least 2 years of faithful and valuable service. To \nreceive a visa, they must also clear a rigorous screening process that \nincludes an independent verification of their service and then an \nintensive interagency security review.\n  People may ask: Who are these Afghans? Let me give a few examples of \nthe extraordinary service they have provided.\n  The first person I will talk about--and I can't use his name for \nprivacy and security reasons--worked as an interpreter for U.S. Special \nOperations Command, SOCOM, from 2005 to 2016--11 years. He originally \napplied for a special immigrant visa in 2012 and continued to work for \nSOCOM during the interim. One of the applicant's direct supervisors, \nthe commander of 1st Battalion, Third Special Forces Group, stated that \nthe applicant's brother was murdered by extremists--probably Taliban--\ndue to the applicant's work for the U.S. Government, and the applicant \nhimself has been wounded several times while serving.\n  A second individual worked as the head interpreter for a provincial \nreconstruction team, or PRT team, for years. Because of his service, \nhis children can't go to school and the lives of his family members are \nin danger. The applicant's PRT commander was one of multiple direct \nDefense Department supervisors to submit letters of recommendations on \nhis behalf testifying to his loyal and valued service.\n  A third interpreter served the Defense Department from 2008 to 2015. \nHe left work in December following an IED attack which robbed him of \none eye and his vision in the other. He applied for his special \nimmigrant visa after being wounded and is in the beginning stages of \nthe extensive interagency vetting process.\n  Clearly, the service of these individuals has been critical to our \nsuccesses in Afghanistan, and in at least a handful of other cases, SIV \nrecipients' commitment to the U.S. mission was so strong that they \nfound ways to contribute even after they arrived in the United States. \nOne promptly enlisted in the Armed Forces and later worked as a \ncultural adviser to the U.S. military. Another graduated from Indiana \nUniversity and Georgetown and has worked as an instructor at the \nDefense Language Institute. A third, who worked as a senior adviser at \nthe U.S. Embassy, now serves on the board of a nonprofit, working to \npromote a safe and stable Afghanistan.\n  These contributions in Afghanistan and beyond help explain why senior \nU.S. military officers and diplomats are so supportive of the Afghan \nSIV Program.\n  Here is what the current commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, \nGeneral Nicholson, wrote recently about the need to reauthorize the SIV \nProgram:\n\n       These men and women who have risked their lives and have \n     sacrificed much for the betterment of Afghanistan deserve our \n     continued commitment. Failure to adequately demonstrate a \n     shared understanding of their sacrifices and honor our \n     commitment to any Afghan who supports the International \n     Security Assistance Force and Resolute Support missions could \n     have grave consequences for these individuals and bolster the \n     propaganda of our enemies. . . . Continuing our promise of \n     the American dream is more than in our national interest, it \n     is a testament to our decency and the long-standing tradition \n     of honoring our allies.\n\n  Last year, General Nicholson's predecessor, General Campbell, wrote a \nsimilar letter affirming his strongest support for the SIV Program and \nurging Congress to ``ensure that the continuation of the SIV program \nremains a prominent part of any future legislation on our efforts in \nAfghanistan,'' adding that the program ``is crucial to our ability to \nprotect those who have helped us so much.''\n  Their view is shared by senior diplomats as well. Ambassador Ryan \nCrocker, who served in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012, recently wrote \nthat ``taking care of those who took care of us is not just an act of \nbasic decency, it is also in our national interest. American \ncredibility matters. Abandoning these allies would tarnish our \nreputation and endanger those we are today asking to serve alongside \nU.S. forces and diplomats.\n  I see that my colleague Senator McCain is on the floor. I know my \ncolleague remembers, as I do, watching all of those Vietnamese holding \non to those helicopters that were leaving when America pulled out of \nVietnam because they knew what their fate was going to be once America \nleft that country. That is not something we can allow to happen in \nfuture conflicts. When we make a promise to those people who helped us \non the ground, we need to abide by that promise. We need to make sure \nthose people who helped our service men and women are able to get to \nthis country and are not killed by the Taliban and other enemies of the \nUnited States and Afghanistan.\n  Yet, despite these compelling cases and despite the persuasive \narguments of our senior military and civilian leaders, the Senate NDAA \ndoes not currently reauthorize and extend the SIV Program or allow for \nadditional visas because of the objections of some few in this body. \nThis is particularly problematic because we are going to issue all of \nthose unallocated SIVs by the end of this year even while there are \nthousands of Afghans at some stage in the application process and new \napplicants still beginning. In effect, this means that without \ncongressional action, the SIV Program will sunset around December and \nthousands of Afghans who have stood alongside our military and other \ngovernment personnel are at severe risk. I hope this body will decide \nthat this is unacceptable and that we have to make sure we support \nthose people who have supported our men and women on the ground and who \nhave, in fact, died to support our men and women on the ground.\n  I am happy to join Senator McCain and Senator Jack Reed, the chair \nand ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, in trying to pass \nthis\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\namendment and make sure we support those people who supported us.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her continued advocacy for \nthese individuals who literally placed their lives on the line to \nassist us in combating the forces we have been struggling against for \nnow these many years. These individuals deserve our thanks, but more \nimportantly, they deserve the ability to come to the United States of \nAmerica. According to our military leaders, their lives are in danger. \nThey are the first target of the enemy because the enemy wants revenge \nagainst those who helped Americans, and there is no doubt in the minds \nof our military leaders that these individuals literally saved the \nlives of the men and women who are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq on \nour behalf.\n  I believe we should actually have a voice vote, and if necessary, \nhave a vote if there is any controversy associated with this \nlegislation.\n  If America is going to seek the assistance of individuals who are \nwilling to help us and then abandon them, then we have a very serious \nmoral problem.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her continued advocacy. I \nhope we can get this issue resolved as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act \nbefore us is important for our troops, wounded warriors and veterans, \nand national security.\n  One way it will help keep Americans safe is by renewing clear \nprohibitions on President Obama's ability to move dangerous Guantanamo \nterrorists into our country or release them to unstable regions like \nLibya, Yemen, and Somalia.\n  Our country faces the most ``diverse and complex array of crises'' \nsince World War II, as Henry Kissinger observed last year, but \nPresident Obama nonetheless seems focused on pursuing a stale campaign \npledge from 2008. The President should spend his remaining months in \noffice working to defeat ISIS. He should work with us to prepare the \nnext administration for the threats that he is going to leave behind. \nHe should not waste another minute on his myopic Guantanamo crusade.\n\n  Just about every detainee that could feasibly be released from the \nsecure detention facility has already been released. Some have already \nreturned to the fight, just as we feared. Some have even taken more \ninnocent American life, according to the Obama administration. But the \nbottom line is this. The hard core terrorists who do remain are among \nthe worst of the worst--the worst of the worst.\n  Here is how President Obama's own Secretary of Defense put it:\n\n       [T]here are people in Gitmo who are so dangerous that we \n     cannot transfer them to the custody of another government no \n     matter how much we trust that government. I can't assure the \n     President that it would be safe to do that.\n\n  There is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind 9/11. He has \ndeclared himself the enemy of the United States. There is the 9/11 \ncoordinator who was planning even more strikes when he was captured. \nThere is Bin Laden's former bodyguard, the terrorist who helped with \nthe bombing of the USS Cole and trained to be a suicide hijacker for \nwhat was to be the Southeast Asia portion of the 9/11 attacks. These \nterrorists are among the worst of the worst. They belong at a secure \ndetention facility, not in facilities here in our own communities, not \nin unstable countries where they are liable to rejoin the fight and to \ntake even more innocent life.\n  Have no doubt, there are detainees who would almost certainly rejoin \nterrorist organizations if given that opportunity. Here is what the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence found in a report just \nthis year: ``Based on trends identified during the past 11 years, we \nassess that some detainees currently at [Gitmo] will seek to reengage \nin terrorist or insurgent activities after they are transferred.''\n  So, look, the next Commander in Chief, whether Democrat or \nRepublican, will assume office confronting a complex and varied array \nof threats. That is why we must use the remaining months of the Obama \nadministration as a year of transition to better posture the incoming \nadministration and our country. What we should not be doing is making \nit even more challenging for the next President to meet these threats.\n  Releasing hard core terrorists was a bad idea when Obama was \ncampaigning in 2008, and it is even a worse idea today. We live in a \ncomplex world of complex threats. The NDAA before us will renew clear \nprohibitions against administration attempts to transfer these \nterrorists to the United States on its way out the door. We don't need \nto close a secure detention center. We need to ensure the American \npeople are protected. Passing the legislation before us represents an \nimportant step in that direction. It will help position our military to \nconfront the challenges of tomorrow. It will help support the men and \nwomen serving in harm's way today.\n  I want to thank Chairman McCain of the Armed Services Committee for \nhis extraordinary work on this very important bill, and I thank Senator \nReed, the ranking member, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, do the math. A Federal prisoner held in a \nFederal prison in America today costs us about $30,000 a year. The most \nserious and dangerous criminal prisoners held in the Federal prison \nsystem are put in supermax facilities for $86,000 a year. That is the \ncost. Not a single prisoner has ever escaped from a supermax facility \nin the United States--ever. It costs $30,000 for routine prisoners and \n$86,000 for the most dangerous.\n  What does it cost us to incarcerate one detainee each year at \nGuantanamo? It costs $5 million apiece--$5 million for each detainee. \nThe budget to keep Guantanamo open is about $500 million a year, and we \nhave fewer than 100 detainees there, and there is a request for another \n$200 million in construction at Guantanamo. So when Senators come to \nthe floor and say we have got to keep Guantanamo open for fewer than \n100 detainees, one obviously has to ask the question: Is there another \nplace they can be held just as safely, just as securely, at \nconsiderably less cost? The answer is obvious. The answer is clear. The \nsupermax Federal prisons can hold anyone convicted of terrorism, serial \nmurder, or heinous crimes, and can hold them securely without any fear \nof escape.\n  The argument was made by the Senator from Kentucky: Well, if we are \ngoing to put terrorists in prisons across America instead of \nGuantanamo, that is a danger to the community. Really?\n  I represent the State of Illinois. We have the Marion Federal Prison \nin southern Illinois. We have a lot of good men and women who work \nthere. What are we doing? For $30,000 a year, we are holding convicted \nterrorists in the Marion Federal prison. I have been a Senator for \nIllinois for 20 years. How many times have I received complaints that \nterrorists were being incarcerated at the Marion Federal penitentiary? \nNone--not one, not one time.\n  So for the symbol of maintaining Guantanamo, we are going to continue \nto spend $5 million a year per detainee. This bill before us, the \nDefense authorization bill, will continue that.\n  If we are looking to save some money that taxpayers are giving to our \ngovernment and perhaps should be spent in better ways, let's start with \nGuantanamo. The President is right that if they are a danger to America \nand the world, they could be safely held in other prisons across the \nUnited States at a fraction of the cost of what we are spending at \nGuantanamo. Those who call themselves fiscal conservatives cannot \nignore that obvious argument.\n  Let me say a word. I support Senator Shaheen's provision when it \ncomes to the Afghans who helped us. It is a good provision. These men \nand women risked their lives for us and for the men and women in \nuniform. We need to allow them to come safely to the United States and \nbe in a position where they can have peace of mind that they are not \ngoing to be killed because they are friends of America. I think her \nprovision is a good one. I am anxious to support it.\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\n  Let me just say on the state of play on amendments that I have an \namendment that I consider to be very important. I offered it over a \nweek ago, so Members have had more than enough time to take a look at \nit. I will describe it in very simple terms, instead of going into a \nlong explanation, although I certainly have one ready.\n  Basically, within this bill--and S. 2943, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, is a big bill--there is about $524 billion in \nspending for our Department of Defense. I want America to always be \nsafe, always have the best, and I want us to invest in the men and \nwomen of our military because we believe in them, their families, and \nour veterans.\n  There is a provision in this bill, though, that troubles me greatly. \nIt is an effort to eliminate a program known as the Congressionally \nDirected Medical Research Programs. How big is this medical research \nprogram? It is $1.3 billion. It is less than two-tenths of 1 percent of \nthe total expenditure for the Department of Defense.\n  Is it important? I think it is very important. For 25 years, the \nDepartment of Defense medical research has come through with \nbreakthrough financing to eliminate concerns, and it gives hope to \nmembers of the military, their families, and to everybody living across \nAmerica.\n  I remember when it started. I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. It was 1992. One group came forward--the Breast Cancer \nCoalition. They said: We need a reliable place to turn for a steady \ninvestment in breast cancer research. That is what started the program.\n  It is true that breast cancer is not limited to the military. But it \nis also true that there is a higher incidence of breast cancer among \nwomen in our military than in the general population for reasons we \nstill don't understand. So is this an important issue to the military \nand the rest of America? Of course, it is. Over the last 25 years, we \nhave invested more than $3 billion in breast cancer research through \nthis program. Has it been worth it? I can tell you it has. Through \ntheir research, they developed a drug called Herceptin. The Department \nof Defense medical research developed this drug Herceptin to fight \nbreast cancer.\n  One of my colleagues here in the Senate told me this morning that the \nlife of his wife was saved by this drug, Herceptin. I was downstairs \nfor a press conference just a few minutes ago. Another woman came up to \nme and said that her life was saved. She was diagnosed with breast \ncancer, and Herceptin saved her life. That was a part of the investment \nin the Department of Defense medical research program that paid off. I \ncan go on--and I will later--about other investments that have paid \noff, not just for the members of the military and their families but \nfor all of America.\n  What is proposed in this bill is the largest cut in medical research \nsince sequestration in Congress. We asked the Department of Defense: If \nthe provisions of this bill that are being asked for are put in place, \nwhat impact will it have on medical research programs in the Department \nof Defense? They said it would effectively eliminate them.\n  This proposal in this bill will swamp medical research programs in \nthe Department of Defense with more redtape than they have ever seen. \nAn example of this is that this Department of Defense authorization \nbill calls for an annual audit of every entity applying for medical \nresearch grants from the Department of Defense. The audit requirements \nare the same as for the largest defense contractors in the United \nStates. We have never held other entities other than the largest \ndefense contractors to these standards. It will require an additional \n2,400 audits a year by the Department of Defense.\n  Well, does the agency that does the auditing have the extra \npersonnel? Do they have work that needs to be done? It turns out that \nthey have $43 billion in existing contracts that have not been audited, \nand this bill will pile on 2,400 more audits. It will slow down any \neffort to promote medical research, and it will dramatically increase \nthe overhead costs for that medical research.\n  Surely, there must be some scandal in this program that led to the \nconclusion that we need all this redtape. But the answer is no. The \nclose scrutiny and investigation of the Institute of Medicine and other \nentities have found that this program over the years has been a good \nprogram. It has had some mistakes, but only a handful when you look at \nthe thousands of medical research grants that have been given.\n  I am going to ask for an opportunity to offer this amendment to \nstrike the provisions which basically kill the Department of Defense \nmedical research program that is directed by Congress.\n  We don't earmark what entities are going to get the grants. It is a \ncompetitive, peer-reviewed process. I want to make sure this amendment \ngets a vote, and, after that vote, I will be more than happy to move \nforward on all the amendments on this bill. It is an important bill, \nand I hope we can pass it at the end of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me assure the Senator from Illinois \nthat we were trying to get the language of a companion amendment to his \namendment approved by that side of the aisle so that we can move \nforward with the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. Hopefully, we \ncan get that language as soon as possible so that we can take up the \nformal debate on his amendment.\n  In the meantime, in response to the comments of the Senator from \nIllinois, I have seen the latest polling data, and the approval of \nCongress is at about 14 percent--something like that. I have not met \nanyone lately from the 14 percent that approve of Congress.\n  One of the major reasons is, of course, that they believe we have \nwasted their defense dollars by the billions and have wasted their \ntaxpayer dollars by the billions. There is no greater example of that \nthan what has happened with the so-called medical research.\n  Every single one of these dollars probably goes to a worthy cause. \nUnfortunately, about 90 to 95 percent of that money has nothing to do \nwith defense.\n  Why would the Senator from Illinois and so many, overwhelmingly, take \nthe money that is earmarked for the men and women who are serving when \nthe effects of sequestration are causing our leadership in the military \nto say that we are on the ragged edge of our capability to defend the \nNation and when the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of \nStaff of the Army have said that we are putting the lives of Americans \nat greater risk because we don't have sufficient funding. Instead, we \nare taking $2 billion out of defense money and putting it into programs \nthat have nothing to do with defense. Why is that?\n  One would ask why would Congress take money from defense and put \nthose monies into programs that have nothing to do with defense? It is \ncalled the Willie Sutton syndrome. That is when the famous bank robber \nwas asked why he robbed banks. He said, ``That is where the money is.'' \nThat is exactly what we are seeing here.\n  We saw the Willie Sutton syndrome begin in 1992. In 1992, there was \n$25 million that was designated for medical research. That was $25 \nmillion in 1992. Today, we now are going to have almost--last year, the \nfunding increased by 4,000 percent, from $25 million in 1992 to $1 \nbillion last year. So if you ever have seen a graphic example of the \nWillie Sutton syndrome, it has to be this. Is there anyone who is \nopposed to breast cancer research? Is there anyone who is opposed to \nmedical research for so many important challenges to the health of our \nNation? Of course not. Of course not.\n  But what the Senator from Illinois and the appropriators have done, \nyear after year after year, is exactly this: OK. Here we go. There is \n$200 million. Here we are--reconstructive transplants, genetic studies \nof food allergies, cooperative epilepsy, chiropractic clinical trials, \nmuscular dystrophy, peer-reviewed vision, peer-reviewed Alzheimer's, \nbone marrow failure, multiple sclerosis, and on and on.\n  All of these are worthy causes. They have nothing to do with the \ndefense of this Nation. That is the problem with this. I will probably \nlose this vote. The Senator from Illinois will probably succeed because \nthere are so many special interests that are involved. But don't say \nthis is for the defense of this Nation. What it is all about is finding \nmoney from the largest single appropriations bill to put into causes \nthat,\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nby all objective observers, should be taken out of the Health and Human \nServices account.\n  Unfortunately, there is not enough money in the Health and Human \nServices account. So guess what. Take it out of defense. Meanwhile, we \ndon't have enough troops trained, and we don't have enough to pay for \ntheir deployments. In case you missed it, there are stories about the \nsquadron down in South Carolina--marines--where they are robbing parts \nfrom planes, where an Air Force squadron comes back with most of their \naircraft not capable of flying, with only two of our brigade combat \nteams able to be in the first category of readiness--only two--because \nthey don't have enough money for training and operations and \nmaintenance.\n  But we are going to take billions out, and we are going to give it to \nautism, lung cancer, ovarian cancer. All of those are worthy causes. \nNow we have lobbyists from all over the Nation coming up: Oh, they are \ngoing to take away money from ``fill in the blank.'' They are all \nangry. I am not trying to take the money from them. I am saying that \nthe money should not come out of defense. I am saying that to defend \nthis Nation, every single dollar is important to the men and women who \nare defending this Nation and fighting and dying as we speak.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Illinois as every year, just \nabout, the money for medical research has gone up from an initial $25 \nmillion in 1992 to $1 billion this year, a 4,000-percent increase. Let \nme repeat. Spending on medical research at DOD--nearly 75 percent--has \nnothing to do with the military, and it has grown 4,000 percent since \n1992.\n  Now we can talk to all the lobbyists who come in for these various \nand very important medical research projects and say: We took care of \nyou. I say to the Senator from Illinois: Take care of them from where \nit should come, which is not out of defending this Nation. In 2006, the \nlate Senator from the State of Alaska, Ted Stevens, under whose \nleadership the original funding for breast cancer was added, said that \nthe money would be ``going to medical research instead of the needs of \nthe military.'' During the floor debate on the annual Defense \nappropriations bill, Senator Stevens had this to say:\n\n       We could not have any more money going out of the Defense \n     bill to take care of medical research when medical research \n     is basically a function of the NIH. It is not our business. I \n     confess. I am the one--\n\n  I am quoting Senator Stevens now.\n\n       I confess, I am the one who made the first mistake years \n     ago. I am the one who suggested we include some money for \n     breast cancer research. It was languishing at the time. Since \n     that time, it has grown to $750 million. In the last bill we \n     had dealing with medical research, that had nothing to do \n     with the Department of Defense.\n\n  I want to emphasize again that I will support funding for every \nsingle one of these projects. I will support it when it comes out of \nthe right account and not from the backs of the men and women who are \nserving in the U.S. military. It has to stop. It has to stop. So this \nyear, the NDAA prohibits the Secretary of Defense and the service \nSecretaries from funding or conducting a medical research and \ndevelopment project unless they certify that the project would protect, \nenhance, or restore the health and safety of members of the Armed \nForces. It requires the medical research projects be open to \ncompetition and comply with DOD cost accounting standards.\n  It does not seem to me that that is an outrageous demand. I know my \ncolleagues are going to come and say: Oh, we need this money because of \n``fill in the blank,'' and this is vital to the health of America. I am \nall for that. But don't take it out of the ability of the young men and \nwomen to serve this Nation in uniform. That is what the amendment of \nthe Senator from Illinois does.\n  If this amendment passes, nearly $900 million in the defense budget \nwill be used for medical research that is unrelated to defense and was \nnot requested by the administration. One would think that if this is so \nvital, the administration would request it. They have not. They have \nnot.\n  If this amendment passes--and it will, I am confident--$900 million \nwill be taken away from military servicemembers and their families. If \nthis amendment passes, $900 million will not be used to provide a full \n2.1-percent pay raise for our troops. It will not be used to halt \ndangerous reductions in the size of our Army and Marine Corps. It will \nnot be used to buy equipment so that our airmen don't have to steal \nparts from airplanes in the boneyard in Arizona to keep the oldest, \nsmallest, and least ready Air Force in our history in the air.\n\n  As I said, many of the supporters of this amendment have opposed \nlifting arbitrary spending caps on defense unless more money is made \navailable for nondefense needs. So, the Senator from Illinois--if I get \nthis straight--wants to add nearly $1 billion in spending for medical \nresearch but is also opposed to increasing spending to a level of last \nyear for defense spending. That is interesting.\n  With these caps still in place, which we are going to try to fix \nlater on in this bill, the Senator wants to take nearly $1 billion of \nlimited defense funding to spend on nondefense needs. So I say to my \ncolleague, the Senator from Illinois: It is not that he is wrong to \nsupport medical research. No one is attacking that. I can guarantee \nyou, the first thing the Senator from Illinois is going to say: Well, \nwe are going to take this money away from medical research. I am not. I \nam saying that it shouldn't come from the backs of the men and women \nwho are serving this Nation.\n  I would ask him not to say that because it is not the case. If he \nwants to add that money into the Health and Human Services account, I \nwill support the amendment. I will support it. I will speak in favor of \nit. He has proposed the wrong amendment to support medical research. \nInstead of proposing to take away $900 million from our military \nservicemembers, he should be proposing a way to begin the long-overdue \nprocess of shifting the hundreds of millions of dollars of nonmilitary \nmedical research spending out of the Department of Defense and into the \nappropriate civilian departments and agencies of our government.\n  Let me be clear again. This debate is not about the value of this \nmedical research or whether Congress should support it. Any person who \nhas reached my age likely has some firsthand experience with the \nmiracles of modern medicine and the gratitude for all who support it. I \nam sure every Senator understands the value of medical research to \nAmericans suffering from these diseases, to the families and friends \nwho care for them, and all those who know the pain and grief of losing \na loved one.\n  But this research does not belong in the Department of Defense. It \nbelongs in civilian departments and agencies of our government. So I \nsay to my colleagues, the NDAA focuses the Department's research \nefforts on medical research that will lead to lifesaving advancements \nin battlefield medicine and new therapies for recovery and \nrehabilitation of servicemembers wounded on the battlefield, both \nphysically and mentally.\n  This amendment would harm our national security by reducing the \nfunding available for military-relevant medical research that helps \nprotect service men and women on the battlefield and for military \ncapabilities they desperately need to perform their missions. It would \ncontinue to put decisionmaking about medical research in the hands of \nlobbyists and politicians instead of medical experts where it belongs.\n  So what is happening right now as we speak? Phones are ringing off \nthe hook: We need this money for ``fill in the blank.'' We have to have \nthis money. It is the end of Western civilization unless we get it. I \nsupport every single one of these programs. There is not a single one \nthat I would not support funding for. But when you take it away from \nthe men and women who are serving in the military for nonmilitary \npurposes, I say it is wrong.\n  I will be glad to have the vote as soon as the other side clears our \namendment process. But, again, I ask my colleagues: Don't distort this \ndebate by saying we are trying to take away this medical research. What \nwe are trying to say with the bill is that we are trying to do \neverything we can to take every defense dollar and make sure that we \nhelp the men and women who are serving in conflicts that are taking \nplace throughout the world.\n  We are not against the reason it was adopted by the Armed Services \nCommittee--against this funding. We are\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\nagainst where it is coming from. So let's do something a little \ncourageous for a change around here. Let's say: No, we will not take \nthis money out of defense, but we will take it out of other accounts \nwhich are under the responsibility of the Senate and the Congress of \nthe United States. That is all I am asking for. That is all.\n  Obviously it probably will not happen. Every advocate for every one \nof those programs has now been fired up because they have been told \nthat we are going to take away their money. We are not going to take \naway their money; we want their money coming from the right place. I \nwould even support increases in some of this spending, but it is coming \nfrom the wrong place.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it is the Willy Sutton \nsyndrome, from $25 million in 1992 all the way up to here--all the way \nhere--now $1 billion, a 4,000-percent increase. So I am sure that \nSenator after Senator will come to the floor: Oh, no. We can't take \naway this money from ``fill in the blank.'' This is terrible for us to \ndo this. It is not terrible for us to do this.\n  The right thing to do is not to deprive the men and women who are \nserving in the military of $1 billion that is badly needed for \nreadiness and for operations to keep them safe. That is what this \ndebate is all about. I expect to lose it.\n  I congratulate the lobbyists ahead of time. I congratulate the \nSenator from Illinois ahead of time. But don't be surprised when the \nAmerican people someday rise up against this process where we \nappropriate $1 billion for something under the name of national defense \nthat has nothing to do with national defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Senator will never apologize for \nmedical research--never. I certainly understand the National Institutes \nof Health have the primary responsibility for medical research. I am \npleased to report that at this moment in the subcommittee, we are \nmarking up an increase of more than 5 percent in the funding for that \nimportant agency.\n  I thank Senator Blunt from the other side of the aisle and Senator \nMurray from our side of the aisle for finding the resources for that. \nBut to argue that because we are putting money into the National \nInstitutes of Health we can take money away from the Department of \nDefense ignores the obvious. We take money away from the Department of \nDefense medical research program at the expense of men and women in the \nmilitary, their families, and veterans.\n\n  Look at the example the Senator from Arizona used. He stood and he \npointed to his chart and he said: Well, there is even spending here for \nepilepsy and seizures. Now, why would that be? We have to spend money \non our military and their issues.\n  Well, let's take a look. Since the year 2000, over 300,000 Active-\nDuty servicemembers have experienced a traumatic brain injury. \nCurrently, the prevalence of post-traumatic epilepsy among those \nmembers who have suffered a brain injury is unknown. There are few risk \nfactors that are known to guide decisionmaking in diagnosing the \ntreatment of the disease. According to the American Epilepsy Society, \nover 50 percent of TBI victims--these are military members who have \nbeen exposed to traumatic brain injury with penetrating head injury \nfrom the Korean and Vietnam wars--have developed post-traumatic \nepilepsy. For the Senator from Arizona to point to this as one of the \nwasteful areas of medical research is to ignore the obvious: that \n300,000 of our men and women in uniform have suffered from traumatic \nbrain injury. And we know from past experience that many of them end up \nwith post-traumatic epilepsy. To argue, then, that this medical \nresearch into epilepsy and seizures has no application or value to \nmembers of the military is basically to ignore the obvious.\n  What we have tried to do in establishing this program is, first, we \ncannot earmark that any grant be given to any institution. All we can \ndo is suggest to the Department of Defense areas that we think have \nrelevance to our military. They then have to make the decision. Each \nand every grant has to pass a threshold requirement that it have \nrelevance to the military and their health.\n  Well, it turns out there are many things that are concerning. Would \nyou guess that prostate cancer is a major concern in the military as \nopposed to the rest of our population? You should because the incidence \nof prostate cancer among those who serve in the military is higher than \nit is in the general population. Why is that? Is it an exposure to \nsomething while they served? Is there something we can do to spare \nmilitary families from this cancer by doing basic research? I am not \ngoing to apologize for that, nor am I going to apologize for the breast \ncancer commitment that has been made by this Department of Defense \nmedical research program.\n  The Senator from Arizona is correct. Groups are coming to us and \nsaying: This Department of Defense medical research is absolutely \nessential.\n  I just had a press conference with the Breast Cancer Coalition. There \nhas been $3 billion invested in breast cancer research through the \nDepartment of Defense over the last 24 years. As I said earlier, it led \nto the development of a new drug that saved the lives of breast cancer \nvictims--Herceptin. The drug has saved lives. To argue that this money \nwas not well spent, should have been in another category, didn't apply \nhere and there--let's look beyond that. Let's consider the lives saved, \nnot just of men and women across America but of members of families of \nthose who have served our country.\n  The list goes on and on. I could spend the next hour or more going \nthrough every single one of them. The provision of the Senator from \nArizona in his own bill is designed to eliminate the medical research \nprograms at the Department of Defense. That is not my conclusion; that \nis the conclusion of the Department of Defense. He has put in so much \nredtape and so many obstacles and added so much overhead and so much \ndelay that he will accomplish his goal of killing off medical research \nat the Department of Defense directed by Congress. That would be a \nterrible outcome--a terrible outcome for people who are counting on \nthis research.\n  No apologies. I am for increasing the money at the National \nInstitutes of Health. I have said that already. And I am for increasing \nmoney at the Department of Defense. It has been money well spent and \nwell invested for the men and women of our military.\n  I might add and let me first acknowledge that my colleague from \nArizona has a distinguished record serving the United States in our \nU.S. Navy. We all know his heroic story and what he went through. So I \nam not questioning his commitment to the military in any way \nwhatsoever. But I will tell you that veterans organizations and others \nstand by my position on this issue. When we had the press conference \nearlier, it wasn't just the Breast Cancer Coalition; the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans was also there asking us to defeat this provision in \nthe bill that would put an end to the Department of Defense medical \nresearch programs.\n  For the good of these families, all of the members of these families \nin the military, as well as our veterans, let's not walk away from this \nfundamental research.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Illinois and I \nhave pretty well ventilated this issue, and once we get an agreement on \nvotes, we could schedule a vote on it. I think we are very well aware \nof each other's positions. I have been talking about this issue for \nquite a period of time, as I watch our defense spending go down and our \n``medical research'' go up.\n  The argument of the Senator from Illinois is that men and women in \nthe military are subject to all of these various health challenges, \nranging from arthritis to vascular malfunctions, et cetera, because \nthey are Americans, because they are human beings? Yes, we agree that \nmembers of the military are subject to all of these needs and earmarks \nfor various illnesses that affect Americans.\n  And by the way, traumatic brain injury causes a whole lot of things. \nSo to say that epilepsy is the result of traumatic brain injury, there \nare all kinds of things that are the result of traumatic brain injury, \nand I strongly support funding--and so have many others--for research \non traumatic brain injury. We know the terrible effects of\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nthat on our veterans. But there are, at least on this list, 50 \ndifferent diseases and medical challenges, and connecting that all to \ndefense takes a leap of the imagination and is, obviously, ridiculous. \nIt is ridiculous. Here we have pancreatic cancer, Parkinson's, and all \nof these. Veterans are subject to those, yes, but it should not be in \nthe Defense bill and it should not be taken out of defense money, \nparticularly in this period of need.\n  So if the Disabled American Veterans and every veteran organization \nis told they will not have funding for these programs, of course they \nare going to object to this provision in the bill. But if they are told \nthe truth--and the truth is that they should get this money but it \nshouldn't be taken out of defense--most of these veterans would like to \nsee it not taken out of defense; they would like to see it taken out of \nwhere it belongs.\n  So, as I say, I am sure there is press conference after press \nconference rallying all of these people because they are being told \nthey won't get the funding, and I can understand that, but that is not \nwhat this Senator wants and what America should have, which is the \nfunding taken out of the accounts of which there is the responsibility \nof the various committees and subcommittees in Congress and in the \nCommittee on Appropriations. That is what this is all about.\n  So all I can say is that, as I predicted, the Senator from Illinois \nraises the issue of all of these things that will lose money. It is not \nthat they will lose money. They will get the money if you do the right \nthing in the Committee on Appropriations, which is taking it out of the \nright accounts. To stretch the imagination to say that all of these are \nbecause of the men and women in the military is, at best, disingenuous.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the total for the Department of Defense \nmedical research programs we are discussing amounts to less than 0.2 \npercent of this total budget--less than two-tenths of 1 percent--and \nthe Senator from Arizona is arguing that we are wasting money that \ncould otherwise be spent in more valuable ways for our military. We are \nnot wasting money; we are investing in medical research programs that \nserve our military, their families, and our veterans, and I will never \napologize for that.\n  Yes, these groups are upset because they have seen the progress that \nhas been made with these investments, coordinating with the NIH and the \nInstitute of Medicine. They have done the right thing. They have found \ncures, they have relieved the problems and challenges facing our \nmilitary, their families, and the veterans who have served.\n  In terms of whether the amendment the Senator has already put into \nthe bill is going to have any negative impact on Department of Defense \nmedical research, let me quote the Department of Defense and what they \nsaid about the language from Chairman McCain: These changes would \ndrastically delay the awards, risking the timely obligation of funds, \nsignificantly increase the effort and cost for both the recipients and \nthe Federal Government. With the additional audit services needed, \ndocumentation that recipients would be required to provide, changes to \nrecipients' accounting systems, the scientific programs would be \nseverely impacted. Massive confusion would follow. Most likely, \nrecipients would not want to do business with the Department of \nDefense. These issues would lead to the failure of the Congressionally \nDirected Medical Research Program.\n  If the Senator wanted to come and just say ``Put an end to it,'' that \nwould be bold, that would be breathtaking, but it would be direct and \nit would be honest. What he has done is cover it in redtape. I am in \nfavor of research, not redtape. There is no need to kill off these \ncritical medical research programs for our military and our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MANCHIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think I have precedence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just want to say again that there are \nvarious accounts in the appropriations process that are directly \nrelated to the issues that have now been inserted in the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. That is what this is all about, and that is \nall it is all about.\n  We can talk about all of the compelling needs and the terrible \nstories of people who have been afflicted by these various injuries and \nchallenges to their health, but the fact is, it is coming from the \nwrong place, and that is what this is all about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I just want to say that after listening \nto both my colleagues, who are passionate about this issue, they are \nboth right. They are both right. If we had a tax plan--a competitive \ntax plan--that took care of our priorities based on our values, they \nwould both be funded properly. That is what we have to get to. We have \nto get past picking and choosing and basically take care of the values \nwe have as Americans, so I hope we can come together on that.\n\n\n                            Opioid Epidemic\n\n  Mr. President, I am rising today because we have reached another \ncrisis point in our country. In 2014 we had almost 19,000 people die \ndue to opioid prescription drug overdose. These are legal \nprescriptions. These are by companies that basically developed products \nlegally. We have the FDA that basically said that we should use it, \nthat it is good for us, and our doctors were saying this is what we \nshould do. So basically we have an epidemic on our hands from products \nwe all believed were going to help us. We had 16 percent more people \ndie in 2014 than in 2013. We have lost 200,000 Americans since 1999--\n200,000. If that is not an epidemic, I don't know what is. I really \ndon't know.\n  Unfortunately, a major barrier to those suffering opioid addiction--\nthese are legal prescription drugs--is insufficient access to substance \nabuse treatment centers. Between 2009 and 2013, only 22 percent of \nthose who were suffering from addiction could find treatment--only 22 \npercent.\n  For so long, we kind of put our heads in the sand and basically \nthought that this was a crime, that it wasn't basically an illness--an \nillness that we now have come to understand needs treatment. We are way \nbehind the scale on this.\n  In my State of West Virginia, 42,000 West Virginians, including 4,000 \nyouth--these are kids younger than 16 years of age--sought treatment \nfor legal abuse but failed to find it. Think about this: If you are a \nparent or a grandparent and your kids are begging for help, the only \nway they can find any help today is to get them arrested, get a felony \non them, and then the judge will send them to drug court. That is it. \nThat is the alternative. That is not a solution we as Americans should \nbe settling for.\n  The largest long-term facility in West Virginia with more than 100 \nbeds is Recovery Point. It is run by all former addicts. These were \npeople whose lives were basically destroyed. They got together and \nsaid: We can help people. We can save them. There is mentoring. They \nbring them in, and it is a yearlong program. It has the greatest \nsuccess rate of anything else we have in our State.\n  In 2014 about 15,000 West Virginians got some sort of treatment for \ndrug or alcohol abuse, but nearly 60,000 people went untreated because \nthey couldn't find it or couldn't afford it. Based on conversations \nwith our State police and all law enforcement in the State of West \nVirginia, 8 out of every 10 calls they are summoned to for some kind of \ncriminal activity is due to drugs, some form of drugs.\n  All of our young students here will be able to identify with this and \nthe people who have problems.\n  These people recognize they need help and they have been turned away.\n  I have introduced a piece of legislation with quite a few of my \ncolleagues. I would hope all of my colleagues in this body would look \nat it very seriously. It is called LifeBOAT. LifeBOAT basically simply \nsays this: We need to have a fee on all opiates. The reason for this \nwas that in the 1980s, we were told this was a wonder drug. It will \nrelieve us of pain 24 hours--not addictive at all. Well, we know what \nhappened there. That wasn't effective and it wasn't accurate.\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\n  What we are asking for is one penny, one penny per milligram on all \nopiate prescriptions, just one penny. That one penny will give \ncontinuous funding for treatment centers around the country. That will \nbring in about $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year. I would hope it \nwouldn't bring in anything. That would mean we wouldn't have rampant \naddictions as we have throughout the country.\n  This is the LifeBOAT. We would hope people would get on board. I have \nasked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is not a tax. \nIt is basically a treatment plan. We have fees we charge for alcohol. \nWe have a fee for cigarettes--nothing for opiates. This is destroying \nas many, if not more, lives. All of this is a commonsense approach \nforward.\n  I say to all of my colleagues, there will not be a Democratic or a \nRepublican family who will hold it against you for trying to find a \ntreatment program for their child or a loved one or someone in their \nfamily.\n  I have come to the floor every week to read letters from people who \nhave been affected and their lives have been changed. I have one from \nmy State of West Virginia, and she writes:\n\n       In Elementary school (I believe 4th grade) my daughter \n     became a cheerleader for Pop Warner Football.\n       Then 6th through 8th she cheered for the Middle School. Her \n     Senior year she cheered for High School as well. She also \n     played Volleyball for the High School and with an adult \n     league, and Basketball for a Jerry West league.\n       She had excellent grades in school, many friends and a \n     great personality. To say she was well rounded is pretty \n     accurate.\n       I am not quite sure where things went wrong. How we have \n     ended up where we are today.\n       Today, and for several years now, my daughter is a drug \n     addict. At one time she was prescribed antidepressants, then \n     nerve pills, then she broadened to her own choices. She has \n     tried many drugs but her choice is opiates.\n\n  Legal prescription opiates.\n\n       She is the mother of our first 2 grandbabies that are now \n     in the custody of family members due to her drug use.\n\n  The home is unfit for the children to be raised in. Continuing:\n\n       She is also a sister, aunt, granddaughter, cousin, niece \n     and friend to many. And the wife of an addict. She has been \n     in and out of jail, court and community corrections several \n     times.\n       I have lost many nights of sleep waiting for a knock at our \n     door or a phone call to tell me I need to identify my \n     daughter. Thankfully, I am a lucky one so far that has not \n     had to do that. Others have not been as fortunate.\n       She has been homeless and sleeping in her car for almost a \n     year except for the nights I could beg for her to come stay \n     with us.\n       Her husband has stole from my family and is not allowed on \n     any of our properties. She feels obligated into staying by \n     his side.\n\n  I don't know why.\n\n       She has had several seizure episodes that were drug \n     related. One time she was at a local grocery store with our \n     granddaughter. She was transported by an ambulance after her \n     4 year old daughter screamed for help.\n\n  A 4-year-old daughter screaming for help for a mother who has had an \noverdose and addiction. Continuing:\n\n       She went to a 10-day detox. Which ended up being a waste--\n\n  We know that 10 days or a month doesn't do a thing--\n\n     because there was not a place for her to go for rehab after \n     that.\n       One time she got out of jail and thought she could kick \n     this habit on her own. She couldn't, and back to jail she \n     went.\n       Right now she is in a grant funded long term facility.\n\n  If you talk to any people in addiction treatment, it takes a minimum \nof 1 year to get them through.\n\n       She has been there almost a month. My heart and hopes are \n     high.\n       I pray for her and those like her on a daily basis. \n     Addiction is such a cruel and punishing way of life. It \n     leaves scars inside and out.\n\n  All I am asking for is this LifeBOAT piece of legislation that will \ngive us a lifeboat to help families who are desperately in need. I \nwould hope everyone would consider this. It is not a burden on anybody. \nIt is not a burden on people taking normal prescriptions. It is only 1 \npenny per milligram on opiates produced, used, and consumed in the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we are \nworking on trying to set up a series of a few amendments, including the \nDurbin amendment and others. Hopefully, we will have that resolved \nwithin half an hour or so, so we can then schedule votes for today.\n  I know my colleagues are aware that tomorrow the first part of the \nday is for the joint meeting, with an address by the Prime Minister of \nIndia, so that even shortens our time. We want to try to get as many \namendments done as we can today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I speak on amendment No. 4260 to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, which would elevate U.S. Cyber \nCommand to a combatant command.\n  In 1986, Congress passed a law elevating and establishing U.S. \nSpecial Operations Command to address the rapidly growing need for \nspecial operators and to unify our forces. Think about that. Today they \nare now leading the effort against ISIS. There is another force quietly \nleading a battle against ISIS, and it is on a completely new \nbattlefield. U.S. Cyber Command is one of our most important elements \nin the fight against terrorism today and tomorrow.\n  I stand today with eight bipartisan cosponsors to my amendment, \nincluding the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I thank them \nfor their support. This includes Senators Warner, Bennet, Murkowski, \nCardin, and Blumenthal, as well as Senators Gardner and Ernst.\n  The Commander of Cyber Command recently testified before the Armed \nServices Committee, stating that an elevation to a combatant command \n``would allow them to be faster, generating better mission outcomes.''\n  At a time when ISIS is rapidly recruiting online and developing \ntechnology like self-driving cars packed full of explosives, the United \nStates needs to ensure that cyber and technology warfare is at the top \nof our priorities. U.S. Cyber Command needs to be able to react quickly \nand to engage the enemy effectively. Our troops need to be as effective \nonline as they are in the air, in the land or at sea. To do all of \nthat, we need to elevate them to a combatant command, where they will \nbe reporting directly to the President of the United States through the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I have provided for a plan in this year's Defense appropriations bill \nto fund this in the future, and I am committed to ensuring the \nelevation of Cyber Command is successful. In the long run, we need to \nensure that they have increased access to training, to top equipment, \nand to ensure their other commands are able to integrate the forces \nsuccessfully.\n  Right now as we debate the National Defense Authorization Act, we \nneed to ensure that we give them the authority to defeat our \nadversaries, and that means elevation to a combatant command. The \nthreat of a cyber attack is one of the fastest growing threats facing \nour Nation, and we cannot stand by as the Department of Defense delays \nto act on this urgent need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment No. 4260, which will \nelevate U.S. Cyber Command to a combatant command.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, with regard to the previous discussion, I \nwant to point out to my colleagues, on this whole issue of a billion \ndollars that is being taken out of defense, the appropriate \nsubcommittee on the Appropriations Committee and the authorizing \ncommittee is Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related \nAgencies. Certainly, as I mentioned before--and taken out of the \nNational Institutes of Health account, for which a lot of money was \nalready being appropriated. So there is an appropriate vehicle for \nthese expenditures of funds of nearly $1 billion, and it is not the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                             Texas Flooding\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, my home State of Texas is strong and \nresilient. Texans aren't people who tire easily, and we certainly don't \ngive up when the going gets tough, but that doesn't mean the State of \nTexas hasn't faced its share of adversity.\n  Over the last few weeks, the resolve of our great State has been \ntested with historic flooding that has taken at least 16 lives across \nTexas. Among those 16 are 9 young soldiers at Fort Hood, 9 soldiers \nwhose truck was overturned while crossing a flooded creek.\n  Their lives were ended in that flooding. Their families have been \ntorn asunder, not by combat losses far away. When brave young men and \nwomen sign up to defend this country, they expect--they understand the \nthreat that enemies abroad might endanger them, but they shouldn't be \nlosing their lives here at home in a sudden and unexpected accident \nthat took the lives of nine soldiers in an instant. Those nine soldiers \nshould be remembered: SPC Yingming Sun, SSG Miguel Angel Colonvazquez, \nSPC Christine Faith Armstrong, PFC Brandon Austin Banner, PFC Zachery \nNathaniel Fuller, Private Isaac Lee Deleon, Private Eddy Raelaurin \nGates, Private Tysheena Lynette James, and Cadet Mitchell Alexander \nWiney.\n  All of us should remember those soldiers and every one of the \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who risk their lives for us \ndaily.\n  Just yesterday on a plane flight from Texas, I had the pleasure of \nagain meeting a young lieutenant whom I had met in the hospital at Fort \nHood in 2014. He had been shot in the chest with a .45 in that tragic \nshooting that occurred. I must say it was so inspirational to see this \nyoung lieutenant healed, mobile, proudly serving our country, and \nenergized. That is the spirit of our Armed Forces, and we should never \nforget their commitment to freedom.\n  Heidi and I right now, along with millions of Americans, are lifting \nup in prayer those Texans who have lost their lives, who have lost \ntheir homes, and the families who are suffering due to this flooding. \nWe are also lifting up the first responders who so bravely risk \neverything to keep us safe.\n  In particular, I want to take a moment of praise for the Red Cross. I \nhad the privilege yesterday of speaking with the CEO of the Red Cross \nto thank them directly for their efforts on the ground, helping people \nwho are suffering, helping people who have lost their homes and who are \nstruggling.\n  She and I shared what we have seen in tragedy after tragedy after \ntragedy, which is that, in the face of disaster and in the face of \nadversity, Texans and Americans come together. There is a spirit of \nsolidarity, a spirit of unity that the worse the tragedy, the more we \ncome together and help our friend and neighbor, help our sister and \nbrother. During these difficult times, Texans demonstrate that sharing \nspirit, and we are thankful to Americans across the country who are \nlifting us up in prayer.\n  As the waters continue to recede and the wreckage is being cleared, \nmy office will continue to work very closely with the local and State \ngovernment officials, along with the entire Texas delegation, to help \nensure a smooth recovery process, including offering--as I already \nhave--my full support and assistance when Governor Abbott requests \nFederal aid for those afflicted by this disaster.\n  While Texas continues to rebound from these torrential floods, our \nNation is also flooded with circumstances that require the very same \nstrength and resolve that we face in the face of tragedy. This week, \nthe Senate continues debating the National Defense Authorization Act. \nThis legislation reflects our Nation's military and national security \npriorities. The decisions we make today will affect not only our lives \nbut those of future generations.\n  We face serious times as a Nation. Our constitutional rights are \nunder assault. We have economic stagnation, young people yearning for \nemployment opportunities only to find none, and government regulations \nthat crush innovations. Abroad and at home, the threat is growing each \nand every day of radical Islamic terrorists. In order to best ensure \nthe future of our Nation, we must make sure America is secure.\n  The most important constitutionally mandated responsibility of the \nFederal Government, the one authority that it must--not merely can--\nexercise is to provide for the common defense. There is no better \nexample of how egregiously we have strayed from our core function than \nthe way in which our spending on defense has been held hostage year \nafter year to the ever-increasing appetite for domestic spending by \nPresident Obama and his political allies. The programs they are forcing \non the American people aren't necessary to protect our lives and \nsafety. But funding our Nation's security is necessary, and it is in \nthis spirit that I have approached my work on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. I look forward to continuing this debate with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  My goal for the NDAA is simple. We need to make sure our military is \nstrong, our homeland is secure, and our interests abroad are protected. \nThe NDAA shouldn't be a vehicle to further an agenda that has nothing \nto do with actually defending America.\n  On the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was proud to work with my \ncolleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, in introducing and getting \nadopted 12 amendments--12 amendments that were included in this \nlegislation that cover the range of policy issues from strengthening \nour ability to protect ourselves through missile defense, to improving \nour ability to stand with allies such as the nation of Taiwan, to \nimproving our ability to deal with the growing threats from nations \nlike Russia and China, to prohibiting joint military exercises with \nCuba, to preventing the transfer of terrorists from Guantanamo to \nnations that are on the State Department's watch list. All of those \nwere done working closely with colleagues, Republicans and often many \nDemocrats. Yet there are still many issues I believe should be \naddressed in this legislation, and I want to highlight three of those \nissues--three amendments that I hope this full body will take up.\n  The first is an amendment to increase spending on Israeli missile \ndefense. This is an amendment on which I have been working very, very \nclosely with the senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham.\n  The second is an amendment to stop the Obama administration's plan to \ngive away the Internet, to empower our enemies over the Internet. On \nthis, I have been working closely with Senator Lee from Utah and \nSenator Lankford from Oklahoma.\n  The third amendment I want to address is an amendment to strip the \ncitizenship from any Americans who take up arms and join ISIS or other \nterrorist organizations waging jihad against the United States of \nAmerica. In this, I have worked with a number of Senators, including \nChairman Grassley of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Each of these amendments addresses different policy components of our \nNation's security. But they all share the ultimate objective of \nensuring that America remains the strongest nation the world has ever \nknown.\n  The first amendment I have submitted and that I would urge this body \nto take up would increase funding for our cooperative missile defense \nprogram with Israel to ensure that our ally--our close friend--can \nprocure the necessary vital assets and conduct further mutually \nbeneficial research and development efforts. This has been an ongoing \npartnership between Israel and the United States of America and yet, \nunfortunately, the Obama administration, in its request submitted to \nCongress, zeroed out procurement for David's Sling, Arrow 2, and Arrow \n3, vital elements of Israeli missile defense. This is at a time when \nthe threats are growing, and the administration decided that zero was \nthe appropriate level. Respectfully, I disagree. This amendment would \nfully fund procurement for Israeli missile defense.\n  Now, much of this missile defense is done in partnership working \nclosely with American corporations producing jobs here at home. But it \nis also vital to our national security, as we see a proliferation of \nthreats across the world. The technology of intersecting incoming \nthreats and intersecting incoming missiles before they can take the \nlives of innocents is all the more important. Yet we are at a time when \nthe administration has funneled hundreds of millions--and headed to \nbillions--of dollars to Iran and their despotic regime.\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\n  The administration knows and they acknowledge that substantial \nportions of those funds will be used to fund radical Islamic \nterrorists, will be used to fund efforts to murder Israelis and to \nmurder Americans. Yet, nonetheless, it is U.S. taxpayer dollars and \ndollars under the control of our government--billions--that are going \nto the Ayatollah Khamenei, who chants and pledges ``Death to America'' \nand ``Death to Israel,'' as a result of the fecklessness of our foreign \npolicy.\n  Our closest ally in the Middle East remains in a deeply troubling and \nprecarious position. Israel must be prepared to defend against Hamas \nand Hezbollah rocket stockpiles that are being rebuilt and improved, \nwhile also being forced to counter an increasingly capable adversary in \nthe nation of Iran, which is intent on the destruction of Israel. We \nmust not fail in our obligation to stand with Israel. It is my hope \nthat, if and when this body takes up this amendment, we will stand in \nbipartisan unity, standing with Israel against the radical Islamic \nterrorists who seek to destroy both them and us. In doing so, we will \nfurther both Israeli national security and the safety and security of \nthe United States of America.\n  In addition to working to provide for our common defense and protect \nour sovereignty, I have also introduced an amendment that would \nsafeguard our country in a very different way. I have submitted an \namendment that would prohibit the Obama administration from giving away \nthe Internet. This issue doesn't just simply threaten our personal \nliberties. It also has significant national security ramifications. The \nObama administration is months away from deciding whether the U.S. \nGovernment will continue to provide oversight over the core functions \nof the Internet and continue to protect it from authoritarian regimes \nwho view the Internet as a way to increase their influence and suppress \nthe freedom of speech.\n  Just weeks ago, the Washington Post--hardly a bastion of conservative \nthought--published an article entitled: ``China's scary lesson to the \nworld: Censuring the Internet works.'' We shouldn't take our online \nfreedom for granted. If Congress sits idly by and allows the \nadministration to terminate U.S. oversight of the Internet, we can be \ncertain authoritarian regimes will work to undermine the new system of \nInternet governance and strengthen the position of their governments at \nthe expense of those who stand for liberty and freedom of speech.\n  This prospect is truly concerning, given the proposal submitted by \nthe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as \nICANN. ICANN is a global organization, and its latest proposal \nunquestionably decreases the position of the United States while it \nincreases the influence of over 160 foreign governments within ICANN in \ncritical ways--foreign governments like China, foreign governments like \nRussia. Additionally, this proposal has the potential to expand ICANN's \nhistorical core mission by creating a potential gateway to content \nregulation, and it would only further embolden ICANN's leadership, \nwhich has a poor track record of acting in an unaccountable manner and \na proven unwillingness to respond to specific questions posed by the \nSenate.\n  Relinquishing our control over the Internet would be an irreversible \ndecision. We must act affirmatively to protect the Internet, as well as \nthe operation and security of the dot-gov and dot-mil top-level \ndomains, which are vital to our national security.\n  For whatever reason, the Obama administration is pursuing the \ngiveaway of the Internet in a dogged and ideological manner. It is the \nsame naive foolishness that decades ago led Jimmy Carter to give away \nthe Panama Canal. It is this utopian view that, even though we built \nit, we should give it to others whose interests are not our own. We \nshould not have given away the Panama Canal, and we should not be \ngiving away the Internet. If the Obama administration succeeds in \ngiving away the Internet--which is, No. 1, prohibited by the \nConstitution of the United States, which specifies that property of the \nUnited States Government cannot be transferred without the authority of \nCongress--this administration is ignoring that constitutional \nlimitation and is ignoring the law. But if the Obama administration \ngives away the Internet, it will impact freedom, it will impact speech \nfor you, for your children, and your children's children.\n  I would note that one of the things this body is good at is inertia--\ndoing nothing. Right now, that is what this body is doing to stop it. \nMy amendment would say that control of the Internet cannot be \ntransferred to anyone else without the affirmative approval of the \nUnited States Congress. If it is a good idea to give away the Internet \nthat we built, that we preserve, that we keep free, that we protect \nwith the First Amendment--and I can't imagine anyone reasonably \nobjective believing it is, but if it is--we ought to debate it on this \nfloor. A decision of that consequence should be decided by Congress and \nnot by unaccountable bureaucrats in the Obama administration. So it is \nmy hope that colleagues in this body will come together, at the very \nminimum, to say not whether or not the Internet should be given away \nbut simply that Congress should decide that. There was a time when this \nbody was vigorous in protecting its constitutional prerogatives. It is \nmy hope that this body will rediscover the imperative of doing so.\n  The third amendment I have submitted on the NDAA that I want to \naddress is the Expatriate Terrorist Act, a bill I introduced over a \nyear ago and that I have now filed as an amendment to the NDAA.\n  As we all know, radical Islamic terrorists have been waging war \nagainst the United States since--and, indeed, well before--9/11, and \nyet the President cannot bring himself to identify the enemy, \npreferring instead to use meaningless bureaucratic terms like violent \nextremists. The President naively believes that refraining from calling \nthe threat what it is--radical Islamic terrorism--will somehow assuage \nthe terrorists and discourage them from making war against us and our \nallies. But that hasn't stopped ISIS from promising to strike America \nover and over and over, nor did it dissuade the radical Islamic \nterrorists here in the United States who have committed attacks against \nAmericans since this President first took office--the terrorist attack \nin Fort Hood, which the administration inexplicably tried to \ncharacterize as ``workplace violence,'' the Boston Marathon bombing, \nthe terrorist attack on military recruiters in Little Rock and \nChattanooga, and, most recently, the horrific attack in San Bernardino.\n  The question for us in Congress is whether we have given the \ngovernment every possible tool, consistent with the Constitution, to \ndefeat this threat. I do not believe we have, which is why I have \nintroduced the Expatriate Terrorist Act.\n  Over the years, numerous Americans, like Jose Padilla, Anwar al-\nAwlaki and Faisal Shahzad, just to name a few, have abandoned their \ncountry and their fellow citizens to go abroad and join radical Islamic \nterrorist groups. Intelligence officials estimate that more than 250 \nAmericans have tried or succeeded in traveling to Syria and Iraq to \njoin ISIS or other terrorist groups in the region. This amendment \nupdates the expatriation statute so that Americans who travel abroad to \nfight with radical Islamic terrorists can relinquish their citizenship. \nThis will allow us to preempt any attempt to reenter the country and \nlaunch attacks on Americans or to otherwise hide behind the privileges \nof citizenship. In this more and more dangerous world, it would be the \nheight of foolishness for the administration to allow known \nterrorists--radical Islamic terrorists affiliated with ISIS, Al Qaeda, \nor other Islamist groups--to travel back to the United States of \nAmerica using a passport to carry out jihad and murder innocent \nAmericans.\n\n  This legislation should be bipartisan legislation. This legislation \nshould be legislation that brings all of us together. We might disagree \non the questions of marginal tax rates as Democrats and Republicans. We \nmight disagree on a host of policy issues. But when it comes to the \nsimple question of whether an Islamic terrorist intent on killing \nAmericans should be allowed to use a U.S. passport to travel freely and \ncome into America, that answer should be no, and that ought to be an \nissue of great agreement.\n  Today I call upon my colleagues to join me in supporting these \namendments and coming together. Together\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nthese amendments strengthen our Nation both at home and abroad. We are \nstronger than the obstacles we face. And by the grace of God, we will \nsucceed. The stakes are too high to quit, and we will stand together \nand continue to strengthen this exceptional Nation, this shining city \non a hill that each and every one of us loves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Texas, who just \nmade a moving commentary, would consider in the future standing \ntogether and voting for the Defense authorization bill rather than \nvoting against it.\n  We stood together on the committee with only three votes against the \nDefense authorization bill, and he voted against it last year as well. \nSo I would look forward to working with the Senator from Texas and \nmaybe getting him--instead of being one or two in the bipartisan effort \nof the committee--to vote for the Defense authorization bill.\n  I might tell him also that with his agenda, as he described it, I \nwould be much more agreeable to considering that agenda if he would \nconsider voting for the defense of this Nation--which is that thick--\nwhich we worked for months and months with hearings, meetings, and \ngatherings, and he decided to vote against the authorization bill. So I \nlook forward to working with him, and perhaps next time he might \nconsider voting for it rather than being 1 of 3 out of some 27 in the \ncommittee who voted for it in a bipartisan fashion, of which I am very \nproud.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would briefly respond to my friend from \nArizona. As he is aware, this NDAA contains one provision that in the \nhistory of our country is a radical departure. For the first time ever, \nthis NDAA would subject women to Selective Service and potentially the \ndraft.\n  Was this change done through open debate? Was this change done in \nfront of the American people? Was this change done reflecting their \nviews? No. It was inserted by committee staff in the committee draft. \nIt is a radical change that is attempting to be foisted on the American \npeople.\n  I am the father of two daughters. Women can do anything they set \ntheir mind to, and I see that each and every day. But the idea that we \nshould forcibly conscript young girls into combat, in my mind, makes \nlittle to no sense. It is, at a minimum, a radical proposition. I could \nnot vote for a bill that did so, particularly that did so without \npublic debate.\n  In addition to that, I would note that in previous years, I have \njoined with Senator Lee and others in pressing for an amendment that \nwould protect the constitutional rights of all Americans against \nunlimited detention of American citizens on American soil. The chairman \nis well aware, because I have told him this now 4 years in a row, that \nif the Senate would take up and pass the amendment protecting the \nconstitutional due process rights of American citizens--the Bill of \nRights actually matters--then I would happily vote for the bill. Yet \nthe Senate has not taken up that amendment, so I have had no choice but \nto vote no at the end of the day.\n  I can tell you right now that if this bill continues to extend the \ndraft to women--a radical change, much to the astonishment of the \nvoters, being foisted on the American people not just by Democrats but \nby a lot of Republicans--then I will have no choice but to vote no \nagain this year. But I can say this: I would be thrilled to vote yes if \nwe focused on the vital responsibilities of protecting this country \nrather than focusing on extraneous issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas has the unique \ncapability of finding a provision in a bill that thick to base his \nopposition on with a strong moral stand. The fact is that every single \nmilitary leader in this country--both men and women, members of the \nmilitary uniformed leadership of this country--believes it is simply \nfair, since we have opened up all aspects of the military to women in \nthe military, that they would also be registering for Selective \nService.\n  I would also point out that every single member of the committee--\npeople such as Senator Ayotte, Senator Shaheen, Senator McCaskill, all \nof the female members of the committee--also finds it a matter of \nequality. Women I have spoken to in the military overwhelmingly believe \nthat women are not only qualified but are on the same basis as their \nmale counterparts.\n  Every uniformed leader of the U.S. military seems to have a different \nopinion from the Senator from Texas, whose military background is not \nextensive. I believe it was indefinite detention last time, which \nobviously is an issue but, in my view, not a sufficient reason because \nit was not included. The bill last year did not address that issue, but \nbecause we didn't address the issue to the satisfaction of the Senator \nfrom Texas, then he voted against the bill. This year it is Selective \nService.\n  The vote within the committee was overwhelming. The opinion of men \nand women in the military--every one of our military leaders believes \nthat.\n  The Senator from Texas is entitled to his views, but to think that \nsomehow that is sufficient reason for him to continue to vote against \nthe bill--even though he does not respect the will of the majority--in \nmy view, that is not sufficient reason to continue to oppose what is a \nbipartisan bill that was overwhelmingly voted for in committee and at \nthe end of the day, in previous years, was voted for overwhelmingly in \nthe Senate.\n  I respect the view of the Senator from Texas. Too bad that view is \nnot shared by our military leadership--the ones who have had the \nexperience in combat with women in the military.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Standing Together As One Nation\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thought long and hard about giving \nthis speech, and I don't come to the floor lightly, but as the senior \nLatino in this Chamber, I felt I had to speak, for those who do not \nrecall the past are destined to repeat it, and I don't want to let this \nopportunity pass without speaking out.\n  The remarks of the presumptive Republican nominee for President about \nJudge Gonzalo Curiel are taking this Nation and the Republican Party \ndown a dark and slippery slope. The road to some of the darkest moments \nof history have been paved with the rants of petty demagogues against \nethnic minorities for centuries. And now, again in this century, Donald \nTrump is echoing those same racist rants and by doing so threatening to \ntake this Nation to a dangerous place.\n  While Donald Trump's racist themes throughout his campaign are a new \nlow for one of America's major political parties, they are not unique \nin history. This is page one on the dark chapters of history: Separate \nus from them. Tyrants and dictators have incited hatred against ethnic \nand religious minorities for centuries in order to consolidate power \nfor themselves. Increasingly radical-thinking Republicans are not \nblameless in creating the environment that has led to this disaster, \nthat has led to a new McCarthyism that calls out people not for their \nbeliefs but for their ethnicity.\n  We have governed from crisis to crisis over the past 8 years, not \nbecause we cannot find solutions to our problems but because of \npolitical decisions to delegitimize the process and the President. They \nhave fed into the ranks of a petty demagogue and now struggle to find \nsafe ground. They have given quarter to snake oil salesmen and \nconspiracy theorists.\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\n  Now we have the head of a major U.S. political party attacking a \nFederal judge because of his parentage. This isn't a reality TV show or \nreal estate deal; this is an attack on our independent judiciary. We \nare talking about a Presidential candidate tearing the fabric with \nwhich we enforce our laws and help citizens protect themselves from \ninjustice.\n  In every aspect of her life, my mother believed in being treated \nfairly. What she did not believe is that being treated fairly meant she \nwould always get what she wanted and that if she did not get it, it \nwould be proof that the process of the system was corrupt, unfair, and \nout to get her.\n  To my mother and to me, lashing out when we don't get what we want--\nas Donald Trump seems to do so often--can be described only as \nremarkably childish, thin-skinned, surprisingly egocentric, and \nfrankly, for someone who aspires to lead this Nation, dangerously \nundemocratic, if not outright demagogic, threatening the very \nsafeguards our Founders put in place to protect us from those, like Mr. \nTrump, whose only view of the world seems to be in a mirror. His only \nresponse to adversity is to blame someone else and turn people against \neach other. The fact is, leaders don't turn people against each other; \nthey bring them together in common cause. Mr. Trump needs to learn that \nthere is not always someone else to blame for defeat. The fact that you \nlost doesn't imply unfairness, it only indicates that you lost, and he \nshould get used to it, although it is a difficult concept for someone \nraised to believe there would be no losing and if there were, it must \nbe a mistake that can be rectified with power, money, or a lawsuit. \nApparently, in Mr. Trump's mind, if he loses, it must be someone else's \nfault: It is he. It is they. It is those people. He isn't American. He \ndoesn't have a birth certificate. He is a Muslim. It is all of them. He \nis a Mexican judge, and I want to build a wall, so he is being unfair \nto me.\n\n  That attitude may be childish and pathetic in a schoolyard bully, but \nin an American President and Commander in Chief, it is downright \ndangerous.\n  I have traveled my State and this Nation and listened to people who \nwonder, as many of us do, how our political dialogue has become so \ndangerously coarse and brash and blatantly racist and how we seem to \nhave reduced the greatness of this country to its lowest common \ndenominator. We are talking about electing a President--a man or woman \nwho will hold the nuclear code and will decide matters of war and peace \nand whether to send our sons and daughters into harm's way. The stakes \nare too high to allow a megalomaniac to pound his chest over a \nlegitimate decision ordered by a judge who was confirmed unanimously by \nthis Senate.\n  Many of my colleagues have tried to distance themselves from the \ncomments of the nominee, but in many cases they have not gone far \nenough. They have not called him out as they should, politics aside, \nfor the threat he poses to this Nation if he is elected.\n  Many of my colleagues must recognize, as I do, that a Federal judge \nborn in Indiana, which is part of these great United States, with a \nMexican family background whose parents became U.S. citizens is not a \nMexican judge but is an American judge, just as a U.S. Senator like \nthis one--born in New York, raised in New Jersey, from a Cuban family \nbackground--is a U.S. Senator. To imply otherwise and ask Judge Curiel \nto recuse himself from a case because of where his parents were born is \non its face racist.\n  They need to come to the floor and denounce the comments of their \nnominee. In fact, all Americans should denounce this kind of blatant \nracism. The tone of the Trump campaign and his statements, actions, and \ndemeanor threaten to send us down a slippery slope. He doesn't seem to \nbe able to stop himself. He has doubled down and said that it is \nimpossible, for example--that a judge of Muslim descent might not be \nable to render a favorable decision in a Trump v. Whomever case because \nof the candidate's policy to ban Muslims from entering this country. \nAnyone who won't stand up and call this blatant racism has decided to \nput partisan politics ahead of our country. This is how a new \nMcCarthyism comes to America, sold by a reality TV show host, aided and \nabetted by a political party without the courage to stand up to racism \nin its most cynical form.\n  I have watched this campaign, like most of my colleagues, incredulous \nat what I heard, shocked, in disbelief, and with a deep concern at the \nlevel of discourse that has degenerated into name calling and out-and-\nout racism. Many of my Republican colleagues and friends are pulling \ntheir punches, not going far enough to denounce the racist rants of \ntheir nominee.\n  This is not the American political system that I know or grew up \nwith, it is not how we run campaigns, and it should make us all feel \nuncomfortable. But it is not good enough to simply be uncomfortable \nwith what the presumptive Republican nominee says. We can't just turn a \ndeaf ear and a blind eye to someone like Donald Trump and where he \nthreatens to take this Nation should he be elected. We cannot wait \nuntil it is too late, and I believe my colleagues know it but have not \nyet found a way to articulate it.\n  We as a nation have to face the ugliness of what he has said and what \nhe has no doubt yet to say. We as a people must immediately and \nunconditionally condemn and reject the type of blatant racism we heard \nover the last few days. Those who do not stand up to intolerance and \nhatred only encourage it and sow the seeds of bigotry that will \nultimately divide us as a nation and a people.\n  I urge all of my Republican colleagues and all Americans to reject \nthe politics of settling scores and grudges and work toward changing \nthe hateful rhetoric we continue to hear.\n  We are a nation of immigrants--all of us. We all know the reality of \nwhat it means to work hard, get an education, build a career, and find \nour way to this Chamber or the Federal bench. Many of us grew up in \nimmigrant neighborhoods, like Judge Curiel, having to navigate many \nobstacles, the veiled or not-so-veiled insults, the derogatory \ncomments, the finger-pointing and racial stereotypes, while always \nremaining rational and logical enough to take the long view and see \nbeyond the mirror and beyond ourselves so we can make the best \ndecisions we can and take what comes and in doing so become part of the \nlarger whole, no longer a stranger but members of something larger than \nourselves.\n  When Donald Trump says ``There's my African American'' at a political \nrally, we see only a fellow American, a citizen, one of us, not one of \nthem.\n  Today we are all Judge Gonzalo Curiel, and today we stand together as \none Nation, indivisible, no matter how hard someone tries to divide us.\n  I repeat: The road to some of the darkest moments in history have \nbeen paved with the rants of petty demagogues against ethnic minorities \nfor centuries, and Donald Trump is echoing those same racist rants, \nthreatening to take this Nation to a dangerous place. Let's all of us \nspeak out before it is too late.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr Cruz). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                     The President's Foreign Policy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as we enter the final stretch of the Obama \nadministration, many have began analyzing the President's tenure and \ndebating what legacy he will leave. People are asking: Are we better \noff? Are we safer? Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that the answer \nto both of those questions is no.\n  As we look around the world right now, we see more and more unrest \nand insecurity, and the foreign policy failures of the President and \nhis administration are partly responsible. Again and again, when it has \ncome time for the President to lead, he has chosen instead to sit on \nthe sidelines. His failure to act has emboldened our enemies and \nalienated our allies.\n  Take the situation in Syria. I am not blaming the start of the Syrian \ncivil war on President Obama, but when a redline was drawn and crossed \nand the President ignored it, we lost our credibility and our ability \nto influence President Assad. As we retreated from a position of \nstrength, turmoil and unrest erupted in Syria.\n  The President's reluctance to act must have looked familiar to \nforeign leaders like Vladimir Putin. It doesn't make the front pages of \nthe papers anymore, but we must remember that Russia invaded the \nsovereign country\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nof Ukraine and annexed Crimea while the President did nothing. After \nthat, it is no surprise that Russia felt free to involve itself in \nSyria or that it continues to occupy and influence parts of eastern \nUkraine as if it were a colony and not a free nation.\n  Recently, we have also seen Russian jets buzzing U.S. Navy ships. I \ncan think of few other Presidents who would have stood for Russia's \nbehavior, but this passiveness now defines President Obama's approach \nto foreign policy. The now-infamous Russian reset promoted by President \nObama and Secretary Clinton will go down in history as a strategic \nfailure of this administration.\n  In the Pacific, which was intended to be a key focus of the \nPresident's foreign policy, China has gone largely unchallenged, \nespecially in the South China Sea. The noticeable absence of the United \nStates over the last 7 years has led to China building an island and \nstanding up an airfield in some of the most disputed waters in the \nworld--an island, Mr. President. Can you imagine if a country tried to \nbuild an island near the United States and then to militarize it? It is \nno surprise that our allies in Southeast Asia are growing increasingly \nnervous with the rising military power making such aggressive claims on \ntheir doorsteps.\n  Then there is the situation in Iraq. During his campaign, the \nPresident promised to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, which he then \nproceeded to do on a publicly announced timetable. Military planners \nand congressional Republicans warned that telegraphing our plans to \ninsurgents will encourage them to bide their time and wait for our \ntroops to leave before preying upon an underprepared Iraqi military. \nBut it was evident that President Obama and Secretary Clinton didn't \nwant to see our obligation to the Iraqis through; they were more \ninterested in keeping an ill-advised campaign promise no matter what \nthe cost to security in Iraq.\n  The President proceeded with his plans to withdraw our troops without \npressing former Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki on the importance of making \nsure his country was stable and secure before we withdrew. Everyone \nknows what happened next: The lack of American troops left a gaping \nhole in Iraq security and ISIS rolled in to fill the gap. Once called \nthe JV team by President Obama, ISIS quickly established itself as \narguably the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world. From \nits safe haven in Iraq, ISIS has spread terror across the Middle East \nand into Europe, destroying peaceful communities and cultural relics \nalike in its pursuit of a caliphate.\n  My heart especially breaks for the Christians and other religious \nminorities in the region in this time of darkness. Their experience \nunder ISIS has been one of relentless persecution and suffering--\ngenocide, Mr. President.\n  ISIS's spread has only made the situation in Syria more dire, as well \nas extended terror beyond the Middle East to Europe. It may have also \ninfluenced a mass shooting here in the United States.\n  Even the President's supposed leadership triumphs have demonstrated \nhis unwillingness to stand up to our Nation's enemies. As the days \npass, buyer's remorse from Democrats for the Iran deal continues to \ngrow. The President negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran that will not \nonly fail to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, but it will \nactually make it easier for Iran to acquire advanced nuclear weapons \ndown the road. This deal will jeopardize the security of the United \nStates and our allies for many years to come.\n  Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes has admitted to creating \n``an echo chamber'' of falsehoods to sell the deal. We have also \nlearned that a firm that helped push the deal also funded positive \nmedia coverage. Not only was this a bad deal that will make it easier \nfor Iran to acquire advanced nuclear weapons down the road, the \nadministration was disingenuous in how it sold the deal. It pulled a \nfast one over Congress, the American people, and our partners around \nthe world, all in the name of burnishing the President's legacy, not \nbecause it was the will of the people. This is another instance of the \nPresident's missteps that sends troubling signals to our allies--in \nthis case, Israel, our closest and most reliable ally in the region.\n  I make these points because it is against this backdrop of growing \ninternational instability and lessening U.S. influence that the Senate \nis now considering the National Defense Authorization Act. This \nlegislation authorizes the funding necessary to equip our troops with \nthe resources they need to carry out their missions.\n  As we look beyond the failures of the Obama administration to the \nchallenges that lie ahead, it is even more important that when it comes \nto our military, we get things right. It is not America's strength that \ntempts our adversaries, it is our weakness. That is why we need to \nensure that our military is well-equipped and trained to meet the \nchallenges of rising powers through high-tech capabilities, while also \nbeing agile and versatile to combat increased unconventional threats \nfrom nonstate actors.\n  We sleep at night in peace and safety because our military stands on \nwatch around the globe. As threats multiply around the world, we must \nensure that the military has every resource it needs to confront the \ndangers facing our Nation. We need to support essential forward-looking \nweapons systems, such as the B-21 long-range strategic bomber and high-\ntech drones to deter and defeat future threats.\n  We must ensure that detainees stay at Guantanamo, instead of \nreturning to the fight. We must ensure that our troops and their \nfamilies at home have the support they need and deserve. This bill will \naccomplish all that.\n  As we continue to debate the National Defense Authorization Act, I am \nsure there are some contentious issues that will come up, but while \nthere may be some disagreement, we must pass this essential legislation \nwithout delay. Playing politics with funding for our troops, as the \nPresident did by vetoing the National Defense Authorization Act last \nsummer, is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to join me to advance \nthis essential legislation to provide for our troops to ensure the \nsafety and defense of America and to help restore America's position of \nstrength.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n    Hazardous Materials Rail Transportation Safety Improvement Bill\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, rural Oregonians who have long worried \nabout trains rumbling through our treasured Columbia River Gorge had \ntheir fears realized last Friday when a mile-long oil train derailed \nand caught fire in the heart of one of our State's crown jewels, the \nColumbia River Gorge.\n  Our State is rich with breathtaking places, and we believe the \nColumbia River Gorge is right at the top of the list. Local tribes \nconsider the area sacred ground, and it took the breath away from \nMeriwether Lewis, who wrote in his journal of ``beautiful cascades \nwhich fell from a great height over stupendous rocks. . . .''.\n  In addition to being a haven for wildlife, the gorge is the lifeblood \nfor tens of thousands of residents in the Pacific Northwest, a critical \ntransportation corridor, and a center for outdoor recreation and \ntourism. Those who visit the gorge do so to windsurf, kiteboard, and \nparasail, fish, hike, and camp. It boasts the most visited recreation \nsite in the Pacific Northwest, the thundering Multnomah Falls that \nMeriwether Lewis wrote about.\n  In this pristine area, trains carrying flammable liquids barrel \nthrough the gorge on tracks that were built in the first half of the \n20th century. On Friday, just a stone's throw from our region's \nlifeblood, the Columbia River, one of those trains fell off the tracks. \nSixteen cars hauling crude oil crashed within view of a community \nschool in the small town of Mosier. Three tank cars caught fire, one \ncar leaked oil, and one experienced what is known as a thermal tear, \nsending a column of flames shooting into the air.\n  We can see from the photo next to me just how close this fiery crash \nwas to that school. People within a mile of the crash site were \nevacuated. The evacuation zone included Interstate 84, which was closed \nfor 12 hours, and at least 100 nearby households. Some of these folks \nhave yet to return to their homes. The sewer system was damaged badly \nenough that it was taken offline. Firefighters were forced to use so \nmuch water to put out the fire that the town's main well was depleted. \nAs a result, residents who remain have been\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nforced to drink bottled and boiled water. This has all been taking \nplace in the middle of a heat wave at home.\n  Here is the point about the reality I just described. A lot of \nOregonians are telling me that we got lucky with the oil train accident \nin Mosier, and they are right. This crash has left Oregonians wondering \nwhat unlucky would have looked like. I can tell you it doesn't take a \nlot of imagination. The Mosier crash could have been much worse if the \ntrain had been going faster and with more cars derailing. It could have \nbeen worse if the crash had happened on Thursday, when winds were \nclocked above 30 miles an hour and the fire would have spread to the \nnearby tree line. If the crash had happened a mile east, it would have \nbeen on the edge of the river, causing a potentially catastrophic spill \nin the middle of a salmon run. If it had happened 60 miles west, it \nwould have been in downtown Portland or in one of the suburbs.\n  Oregon has been lucky a lot, and at some point that luck is going to \nrun out. What people in small communities in Oregon want to know, and \nwhat they deserve to know, is what happens next. What is Congress going \nto do to start fixing the problem?\n  I am here this morning with my friend and colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Merkley, to talk about what specifically we are going to do to \nget this fixed. More than a year ago, I introduced legislation with \nSenator Merkley, Senator Schumer, and five other Senators called the \nHazardous Materials Rail Transportation Safety Improvement Act. Since \nthen, four more Senators have signed on. Among the bill's lead \nsupporters are the International Association of Firefighters and the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs.\n  Our bill reduces the chance of accidents in the first place by \nproviding funding for communities to relocate segments of track away \nfrom highly populated areas and for States to conduct more track \ninspections. Next, it helps communities prepare for a possible accident \nby paying for training for first responders before the next accident. \nFinally, the bill provides market incentives to use the safest tank \ncars to transport hazardous materials, which lowers the chance of a \nspill or a fire in the event of an accident.\n  On Monday I talked with Union Pacific's CEO, Mr. Fritz. He committed \nto work with me and the Senate sponsors on this legislation. He \nindicated there were parts of the bill that the company can support. I \nthink knowing that the company is willing now to follow up is a bit of \nconstructive news and an encouraging development, but much more needs \nto be done.\n  Yesterday, Senator Merkley and I, with our Governor, Congressman \nBlumenauer, Congressman Bonamici, called for a temporary moratorium on \noil train traffic through the Columbia River Gorge. Yesterday, when I \ntalked to the CEO of Union Pacific, Mr. Fritz, he committed that the \nUnion Pacific will not ship Union trains of oil through the gorge until \nthere are three developments: No. 1, the cause of the accident has been \ndetermined, No. 2, Union Pacific ensures that an accident will not \nhappen again, and the company sits down and works out concerns that are \nobviously of enormous importance to the residents of Mosier.\n  These commitments are helpful, and we are going to monitor them \nclosely. The company has to do everything possible to help get \nresidents in the town back on their feet. That includes getting the \nsewage system up and running and getting people back in their homes so \nthey can get about their everyday lives.\n  In my view, it would be hard, after a very close call like the one in \nMosier on Friday, for anybody to just walk away and say, well, there \nprobably will not be another accident, because while the people of \nMosier work to get back to their normal lives, the threat of another \ncrash is going to linger. Our people are talking about it. They are \ntelling the newspapers they are nervous. They are nervous about the \nprospect of another accident, which is lingering in the minds of folks \nacross my State.\n  It has been clear for years that more needs to be done to protect our \ncommunities and prevent the next accident from ever occurring. It is \ntragic that Mosier has now joined a long and growing list of both small \ntowns and big cities that have experienced an oil train accident, \nincluding: Casselton, ND; Lynchburg, VA; Aliceville, AL; New Augusta, \nMS; LaSalle, CO; Galena, IL; Watertown, WI; and Philadelphia, PA.\n  More needs to be done to ensure that transportation systems used to \nhaul crude oil and other flammable liquids are up to par. I hope \nMembers of this body on both sides of the aisle will join me and \nSenator Merkley and nine other Senators. We already have over 10 \npercent of the Senate. I hope they will join us in our effort to \nprotect communities everywhere from the next oil train accident. This \nhas nothing to do with Democrats and Republicans. What this has to do \nwith is whether we are going to take commonsense steps to prevent these \naccidents and ensure that in particular we do everything we can to have \nthe kind of trains that are not as likely to be part of accidents in \nthe future.\n  My colleague Senator Merkley has been a terrific partner in this \neffort. We have been talking about how we are going to tackle this \nurgent issue for the people we represent, and he is going to have \nimportant remarks about Friday's accident in Mosier as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor and look forward to Senator Merkley's \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague \nSenator Wyden to draw attention to the dangerous oil train derailment \nthat occurred in Oregon last Friday and the urgency to protect \ncommunities around our Nation with stronger safety regulations for \nthese rolling explosion hazards.\n  The folks in the Columbia Gorge have experienced a proliferation of \ntrains carrying coal and carrying oil. They have been concerned about \nthe length of the trains and how these trains roll through, dividing \ntheir communities and the challenges they have. There is one concern \nthey have above everything else; that is, that a train full of \nexplosive Bakken crude would derail in their community. That happened \nlast Friday.\n  It is the very scenario communities have dreaded. This oil train was \ntraveling through the Cascade Mountains along the Columbia Gorge on its \nway to Tacoma, WA, with 97 cars loaded with flammable, explosive Bakken \ncrude. Sixteen tank cars went off the tracks. One car ruptured, and \nwhen it ruptured, it spewed oil. The oil created an inferno, and the \ninferno started to heat up the adjacent cars. The adjacent cars had \npressure relief valves that as they got hot, started spewing oil out of \nthese pressure relief valves, spreading the fire to three cars. This \nhappened near the town of Mosier, OR, which is just 70 miles east of \nPortland.\n  We were fortunate. We thank our lucky stars no one was injured in the \nincident, but it could have been different, as my colleague from Oregon \npointed out. The proximity of Mosier resulted in an evacuation of over \n100 nearby residents and the nearby grade school with over 200 \nchildren. An air quality warning occurred for vulnerable residents from \nthe thick plumes of black smoke. We were fortunate, and we are happy \nthat no human life was taken and no injury occurred.\n  Let's take a look at what that inferno looked like in this photo. We \ncan see the massive plume of burning Bakken crude rising into the \nair. We see here the fire in the adjacent cars. We see the proximity to \nthe Columbia River. There could have been a massive release of oil into \nthe Columbia River as well. Again, we were fortunate in this regard. \nThe Columbia Gorge is a very special place, but as its narrow channel \nthrough the Cascade Mountain occurs, these trains run through the \nmiddle of virtually every community along the way. They represent a \nrolling time bomb. Citizens are right to have grave concerns.\n\n  I don't think the citizens along the Columbia Gorge are mollified by \nthinking, well, it could have been worse; we were fortunate this time. \nInstead, what the citizens of Mosier are thinking and citizens in \ncommunities all along the gorge are thinking is, our concerns about \nthese rolling explosion hazards are confirmed, and we need to take \nserious measures so that one of these trains does not blow up in our \ncommunity in the future.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\n  Now there are inspections that take place. The track was reportedly \ninspected on May 31. A track detector vehicle used laser and other \ntechnology to inspect the track within the last 30 days.\n  But what happened? Why did this occur along this stretch of track? It \nis reported that a bolt or multiple bolts sheared. Why did they shear? \nWas it temperature differentials between day and night in our unusually \nwarm spring? Was it because of the weight of these trains rolling \nthrough? Was it the volume of the traffic? Was it the speed they were \ntraveling?\n  We have to understand every detail so that we respond and make sure \nthis does not happen again. That is why it is so disturbing that the \nNational Transportation Safety Board declined to investigate. In its \nmission, the NTSB is supposed to investigate accidents that result in \nthe ``release of hazardous materials''--well, that certainly was the \ncase--and that ``involve problems of a recurring nature''.\n  There have been recurring derailments that involve significant \nproperty damage. There was significant damage here. This derailment \nsent oil into Mosier's wastewater treatment plant. The plant has been \nclosed down, a major challenge for the city to cope with. There has \neven been a pause in the drinking water because of the modest oil sheen \nin the river. It was uncertain where it was coming from and whether it \nwould get into the intake for the drinking water.\n  So let's hereafter not have a situation where there is a significant \ncrash and we don't have the investigation to learn everything about it \nso we can apply those lessons into the future.\n  Senator Wyden has been leading the charge to make sure that we \nunderstand accidents, that we have the right set of precautions in \nplace: braking standards on the brakes and speed standards on the \ntracks and upgraded railroad tanker cars that are far less likely to \nrupture. I thank him for his leadership on this. I am a full-square \npartner in this effort.\n  The tank car that ruptured was not one that met the new standards. It \nwas what was referred to by the president of Union Pacific as kind of a \n``medium safety''--not the worst car, not the oldest car. It did have \nsome upgrades on it but certainly not the new cars that we have been \nsetting and aspiring to have; that is, a stronger car with more \nprotections, minimizing the chance of a rupture.\n  This is an issue we must take on seriously and urgently. Let's \nrecognize that it is one accident after another. In July 2013, a \nrunaway Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway train spilled oil and caught \nfire inside the town of Lac-Megantic in Quebec. Forty-seven people were \nkilled. Thirty buildings burned in the town center.\n  In December of that year, a fire engulfed tank cars loaded with oil \non a Burlington Northern Santa Fe train after a collision about a mile \nfrom Casselton, ND. Two thousand residents were evacuated as emergency \nresponders struggled with the intense fire.\n  In January 2014, a 122-car Canadian National Railway train derailed \nin New Brunswick, Canada. Three cars containing propane and one car \ncontaining crude from western Canada exploded after the derailment, \ncreating intense fires that burned for days.\n  In April of that year, 15 cars of a crude oil train derailed in \nLynchburg, VA, near a railside eatery and a pedestrian waterfront, \nsending flames and black smoke into the air. Thirty thousand gallons of \noil spilled into the James River.\n  The list goes on. In February of 2015----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator allow an interruption so that I can be \nrecognized for a unanimous consent request, and he then will regain the \nfloor?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I would be honored to yield for your unanimous consent \nproposal.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oregon yield to me for a unanimous consent request without losing \nhis right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMMITMENT TO THE REPUBLIC OF \n                   PALAU.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Republic of Palau is comprised of 300 islands and \n     covers roughly 177 square miles strategically located in the \n     western Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and the United \n     States territory of Guam.\n       (2) The United States and Palau have forged close security, \n     economic and cultural ties since the United States defeated \n     the armed forces of Imperial Japan in Palau in 1944.\n       (3) The United States administered Palau as a District of \n     the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands \n     from 1947 to 1994.\n       (4) In 1994, the United States and Palau entered into a 50-\n     year Compact of Free Association which provided for the \n     independence of Palau and set forth the terms for close and \n     mutually beneficial relations in security, economic, and \n     governmental affairs.\n       (5) The security terms of the Compact grant the United \n     States full authority and responsibility for the security and \n     defense of Palau, including the exclusive right to deny any \n     nation's military forces access to the territory of Palau \n     except the United States, an important element of our Pacific \n     strategy for defense of the United States homeland, and the \n     right to establish and use defense sites in Palau.\n       (6) The Compact entitles any citizen of Palau to volunteer \n     for service in the United States Armed Forces, and they do so \n     at a rate that exceeds that of any of the 50 States.\n       (7) In 2009, and in accordance with section 432 of the \n     Compact, the United States and Palau reviewed their overall \n     relationship. In 2010, the two nations signed an agreement \n     updating and extending several provisions of the Compact, \n     including an extension of United States financial and program \n     assistance to Palau, and establishing increased post-9/11 \n     immigration protections. However, the United States has not \n     yet approved this Agreement or provided the assistance as \n     called for in the Agreement.\n       (8) Beginning in 2010 and most recently on February 22, \n     2016, the Department of the Interior, the Department of \n     State, and the Department of Defense have sent letters to \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro \n     Tempore of the Senate transmitting the legislation to approve \n     the 2010 United States Palau Agreement including an analysis \n     of the budgetary impact of the legislation.\n       (9) The February 22, 2016, letter concluded, ``Approving \n     the results of the Agreement is important to the national \n     security of the United States, stability in the Western \n     Pacific region, our bilateral relationship with Palau and to \n     the United States' broader strategic interest in the Asia-\n     Pacific region.''\n       (10) On May 20, 2016, the Department of Defense submitted a \n     letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the \n     congressional defense committees in support of including \n     legislation enacting the agreement in the fiscal year 2017 \n     National Defense Authorization Act and concluded that its \n     inclusion advances United States national security objectives \n     in the region.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) to fulfill the promise and commitment of the United \n     States to its ally, the Republic of Palau, and reaffirm this \n     special relationship and strengthen the ability of the United \n     States to defend the homeland, Congress and the President \n     should promptly enact the Compact Review Agreement signed by \n     the United States and Palau in 2010; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should immediately seek a \n     mutually acceptable solution to approving the Compact Review \n     Agreement and ensuring adequate budgetary resources are \n     allocated to meet United States obligations under the Compact \n     through enacting legislation, including through this Act.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4031\n\n       (Purpose: To impose sanctions with respect to foreign \n     persons responsible for gross violations of internationally \n     recognized human rights)\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of May 18, 2016, under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4169\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the discharge by warrant officers of \npilot and other flight officer positions in the Navy, Marine Corps, and \n        Air Force currently discharged by commissioned officers)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, in February of 2015, on Valentine's Day, \na 100-car Canadian National Railway train hauling crude oil and \npetroleum distillates derailed in Ontario, Canada. The blaze burned for \ndays.\n  Two days later, a 109-car CSX oil train derailed and caught fire near \nMount Carbon, WV, leaking oil into a Kanawha River tributary and \nburning a house to its foundation. The blaze burned for weeks.\n  In November of last year, a dozen cars loaded with crude oil derailed \nfrom a Canadian Pacific Railway train, causing the evacuation of dozens \nof homes near Watertown, WI.\n  Let's take a look at this chart. In all, there have been 32 crashes \ninvolving oil trains since 2013. So in less than 4 years, there have \nbeen 32 crashes. I just highlighted a few of them. We see a massive \nincrease of crude oil transported by rail. Therefore, there is a \ncorresponding concern because of the explosive nature of this product \nand the derailments resulting in explosions and infernos.\n  Senator Wyden and I have been calling for reform. We are going to \nkeep pressing. We need better information for first responders on the \nscheduling of these trains. We need better knowledge of where the foam \nthat can be used to respond is stored. We need more foam stored in more \nplaces. We need faster implementation of the brake standards and faster \nimplementation of the speed standards and faster implementation of the \nrailcar tanker standards.\n  But we have to understand what happened in every one of these wrecks. \nLet's take the same diligence to this that we take to aviation. We \nstudy every plane crash to understand what went wrong so we can take \nthese lessons and diminish the odds of it happening again. The result \nis, we have incredibly safe aviation. Shouldn't we have the same \nstandards when it applies to transportation across America with trains \nfull of explosive oil running through the middle of our towns, not just \nin Oregon but all across this country? Haven't we learned in crash \nafter crash after crash that these are not one-time isolated incidents, \nbut something that happens with considerable regularity? Can't we do \nmore?\n  Yes, we can. Yesterday, when I talked to the president of Union \nPacific, I told him we were going to call for a moratorium, and Senator \nWyden and Governor Brown and Representatives Blumenauer and Bonamici \nhave joined in this effort. He heard our voice. He understands the \nchallenge to these communities and the concerns that until the mess is \ncleaned up and until we understand and address the fundamental problems \nthat contributed to this crash, no more oil should roll through the \nColumbia Gorge.\n  That is what we have called for. That is what we are going to keep \npersisting in. Let's stop this process of having oil train crash after \noil train crash, explosion after explosion, inferno after inferno. The \ndamage has gone up dramatically as the transportation of this oil has \ngone up dramatically. Incidents resulted in $30 million in damage last \nyear, up from one-fourth of that the previous year.\n  So let's act. Let's act aggressively. Let's act quickly. Senator \nWyden's act would take us a powerful stride in the right direction.\n\n  Let's not look to our citizens and towns with rail tracks across this \ncountry and simply shrug our shoulders. Instead, let's say we know we \nhave a major problem and we are going to be diligent and aggressive in \nsolving it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 4204.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4204.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the pilot program on \n            privatization of the Defense Commissary System)\n\n         Strike section 662.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors to the Inhofe-Mikulski amendment No. \n4204: Sessions, Rubio, Shelby, Moran, Warren, Peters, and Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have been here before. The same \nlanguage that is in the base bill right now was in a year ago. On the \nfloor last year, we passed the Inhofe-Mikulski amendment, requiring a \nSecretary of Defense report on commissary benefits. It passed by \nunanimous consent with 25 bipartisan sponsors and cosponsors, and it \nwas supported by 41 outside organizations and by the administration. It \nrequired a study on the impact of privatization of commissaries on \nmilitary families before a pilot program on privatizing could be \nimplemented that was to look at modifications to the commissary system.\n  I am sending the language now, which I will get to in a minute. It \nrequired a Comptroller General assessment of the plan no later than 120 \ndays after submittal of the report.\n  Here is the situation. The House passed the fiscal year 2017 NDAA, \nand it doesn't include privatization language. The Senate version has \nthe same language as last year, which would authorize a pilot program \nto privatize five commissaries on five major military bases. But only \nyesterday, we received the report from the Secretary of Defense. We \nhave not yet received the Comptroller General's review.\n  Congress asked for this study because of concerns about the impact \nthat privatization could have on our servicemembers and the commissary \nbenefit. It seems as if we are taking away benefits. We are working \nthese guys and gals harder than we ever have before, and this is one \nvery significant benefit that is there.\n  Senator Mikulski and I, along with our now 38 cosponsors--last year \nit was 25--and with the support of 42 outside organizations are \noffering a simple amendment that strikes the privatization pilot \nprogram, allowing Congress to receive and vet the Secretary of Defense \nreport and the valuation of the Comptroller.\n  This is not the first time this was done. The January 2015 report by \nthe Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission \ndetermined that commissaries were worth preserving, and they did not \nrecommend privatization. That report took place almost 2 years ago.\n  When surveyed in 2014, 95 percent of the military members were using \ncommissaries and gave them a 91-percent satisfaction rate.\n  According to the Military Officers Association of America, the \naverage family of four who shops exclusively at commissaries sees a \nsavings of somewhere between 30 percent to 40 percent.\n  Mr. President, I have six testimonials from military members about \nusing commissaries that I wish to enter into the Record. They said the \nfollowing:\n\n       ``Our family needs the commissary! We wouldn't be able to \n     afford a decent amount of groceries for our family if we had \n     to shop off post!''\n       ``My husband is currently active duty AF, and I drive 30 \n     one way just to be able to shop at the commissary. We are \n     stationed at a base in the middle of nowhere and if I were to \n     shop at our local store, I would pay nearly twice as much. \n     And, I know that a vast majority of those stationed where we \n     are use the commissary for the same reason. And please \n     consider those stationed overseas and in other rural \n     locations. If the commissaries were privatized, they could \n     increase the prices and without competition, our grocery bill \n     would be significantly higher.''\n       ``Whether I am in the states or overseas I use my benefits \n     of lower food cost. I've been in the military for 22 years, \n     I've seen a lot of changes. But this should not be one. If \n     anyone from your office wants more information feel free to \n     contact me.''\n       ``While there are some items that may be found at a lower \n     individual price on the economy the total combined savings \n     remains constant.''\n       ``When I went out in town and we tried to get the same \n     amount, we got about half of the groceries that we could \n     afford at the Commissary.''\n       ``If you want to keep an all-volunteer military, you must \n     keep the benefits that are in place as of today and for the \n     future. All that are serving and have served depend on the\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\n     commissary and exchange for low-cost goods. If the Commission \n     does not recommend a pay increase, all benefits are extremely \n     needed.''\n\n  Commissaries are required to operate in remote areas. A lot of these \nobjections are from commissaries in remote areas where people don't \nhave any other place to actually make their purchases.\n  At a time when thousands of junior servicemembers and their families \nuse food stamps, we should not be making changes that could increase \ncosts at the checkout line.\n  The commissary benefit encourages people to reenlist, preserving a \nwell-trained, dedicated military. It ensures that training investments \nare well spent, saving the expense of retraining the majority of the \nforce every few years. The commissary savings and proximity and the \nconsistency of the commissaries also encourage spouses, whose opinions \nmay be a deciding factor in reenlistment decisions.\n  I know this is true. Just last Friday I was at Altus Air Force Base. \nI went into the commissary and talked to someone who was reconsidering. \nIt was the wife of a flyer. Right now one of the biggest problems we \nhave in the Air Force is the pilot shortage. They said that would be a \nmajor determining the factor. So it is the right thing to do.\n  It also provides jobs for families of servicemen. Sixty percent of \nthe commissary employees are military related. The greatest benefit is \nthat their jobs are transferable. If they are transferred from one \nplace to another, they are already trained and ready to go.\n  As I said, the Department of Defense delivered their report only \nyesterday and no one has had a chance to really go over it. The \nmandated GAO review of this plan is now under way. Of course, it could \nbe up to 120 days after this for the next step to become completed.\n  The report supports section 661 of the Senate bill regarding \noptimization of operations consistent with business practices, but it \ndoesn't affect 662. That is the section where we had the pilot program.\n  We have addressed this before, but the report also acknowledges that \nprivatization would not be able to replicate the range of benefits, the \nlevel of savings, and geographic reach provided by DeCA while achieving \nbudget neutrality.\n  It states that the Department of Defense--and I am talking about the \nreport from the Department of Defense--is continuing its due diligence \non privatization by assessing the privatization-involved portions. They \nare already doing that right now. In fact, some things have already \nbeen privatized, such as the delis, the bakeries. They have been \nprivatized already in those areas and that is actually working.

The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bipartisan \nInhofe-Mikulski amendment to the National Defense Act. What does our \namendment do? It stops the privatization of commissaries, which are an \nearned benefit for our military and their families.\n  Every year when the Senate debates this bill, we talk about how we \nlove our troops and how we always want to support our military \nfamilies. But if we really love our troops, we need to make sure our \ntroops have the support they need. One of the earned benefits that does \nthat is the commissaries. And if we love our troops, why would we want \nto proceed in this direction of privatization? Our troops don't view \ncommissaries as a subsidy; they view them, as do I, as an earned \nbenefit. I am fighting here to preserve this piece of the earned \nbenefit compensation package.\n  What are the commissaries? Since 1826, military families have been \nable to shop at a network of stores that provide modestly priced \ngroceries. The commissary system is simple: If you are an Active-Duty, \nReserve, National Guard, retired member, or a military family member, \nyou have access to more than 246 commissaries worldwide. They give \nmilitary members and their families affordability and accessibility to \nhealth foods.\n  Senator Inhofe spoke earlier about where these commissaries are. Some \nare located in our country, and some in remote areas, and over 40 \npercent are either in remote areas or overseas.\n  Last year Senator Inhofe and I stood up for military family benefits \nto stop privatization. Congress adopted our amendment, but in doing so \nrequired a DOD study assessing privatization, which would affect \ncommissaries. We needed to understand how privatization would affect \nlevels of savings, quality of goods, and impact on families. DOD \nfinally gave us the report on June 6, 2016. So they dropped the report \non D-day. And guess what. It reaffirms what Senator Inhofe and I have \nbeen saying: We should not privatize commissaries without additional \nstudy. The report is simple and straightforward: We should not proceed \nwith the privatization or a pilot on privatization until further study.\n  First, DOD has demonstrated that privatization cannot replicate the \nsavings the current commissary system provides. Second, privatization \nsignificantly reduces the benefits available to commissary patrons. And \nprivatization would dramatically reduce the workforce, which is where \nso many military families work. The DOD cannot move\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nforward with privatization with a large number of unknowns.\n  We must honor the DOD request and fully evaluate the implications of \nprivatization before we make drastic changes that hurt our military \nfamilies. That is why everyone should support the Inhofe-Mikulski \namendment. Our amendment is straightforward.\n  It strikes bill language authorizing a pilot program privatizing \ncommissaries. It is supported by 41 organizations--the American \nLogistics, the National Guard Association, the National Military Family \nAssociation.\n  Privatizing commissaries is penny wise and pound foolish. If we care \nabout the health of our troops, we must reject this.\n  I have been to the commissaries in Maryland. Go to the one at Fort \nMeade. Fort Meade is a tremendous place. We might not deploy troops the \nway Fort Bragg or Camp LeJeune does, but what we do there is \nphenomenal. There are 58,000 people who work at Fort Meade. We are in \nthe heart of Maryland, which has such a strong military presence, both \nArmy and Navy. If you came to the commissary with me, you would see it \nas a nutritional settlement house. You would really like it because you \nsee people there, first of all, of all ranks and ages mingling \ntogether. You might see a young woman who is married to an enlisted \nmember of the military, and she is learning a lot about food and \nnutrition. She is getting advice, and she is getting direction, in \naddition to saving money. Also, if you go there, you would see \noldtimers, who--although they are counting their pennies, they are \ncounting their blessings that they have this commissary to be able to \ngo to.\n  When I say a settlement house, it is a gathering to learn about food, \nabout nutrition, about a lot of things. It often offers healthier food \nat cheaper prices.\n  When I talked with our garrison commander about something he and I \nworked on together called the Healthy Base Initiative, he said that \nwhat we were doing there was so phenomenal. We worked to bring in \nthings like salad bars and some of the more modern kinds of things. \nThis was just phenomenal.\n  So, first, we need commissaries. Second, if we are looking at how to \nmake the budget neutral, and I don't argue with that point, the DOD \nstudy itself says we need to explore two things: other ways of \nachieving budget neutrality--and they had some suggestions--and also \nexplore with the private sector who would be interested in \nprivatization whether it would result in cost savings without costing \nthe benefits, meaning what is really sold there in nutrition. There are \na lot of new and wonderful ideas. My father ran a small grocery store. \nHe would be amazed at what grocery stores are now. But things like \ngoing to private labeling, better management--the DOD has some other \ntoolkits to do before we go off on this approach to privatizing without \nanalyzing. So I am for analyzing and then looking at the next step.\n  The report this year just arrived. I know the authorizing committee \ndidn't have the benefit of it. So I hope we will stick with Senator \nInhofe and me, reject this amendment, look out for our troops, and \nlet's explore other ways to achieve budget neutrality, but let's not \njust arbitrarily single out this earned benefit for cost savings.\n  Mr. President, the chair of the Armed Services Committee looks like \nhe is eager to speak, but I also want to say that I support the Durbin \namendment we will be voting on later on this afternoon. I am a strong \nsupporter of DOD's Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program. I \nwas very concerned about the bill language. I understand the need for \nregulation but not strangulation. What is proposed in this bill would \nbe so onerous, I am worried it would stop this research altogether. We \ncan't let that happen, and Senator Durbin's amendment would ensure that \nthis program is allowed to continue its lifesaving discoveries. This \ncongressionally mandated research has done so much good in so many \nareas, and we have large numbers of groups--from the Breast Cancer \nCoalition to the disabled veterans themselves--who support the Durbin \namendment.\n  I have been supporting this program for more than 25 years. It all \nstarted in 1992 when the breast cancer community was looking to create \na new research program. And by the way, the breast cancer advocates \nwere just as organized, mobilized, and galvanized back then as they are \ntoday. The advocates knew that DOD ran the largest health system in the \ncountry and envisioned a new research program that was peer-reviewed \nand included input from not just scientists but also advocates. This \nwas a new concept at the time that the needs of a community affected by \ndisease would be considered when determining research priorities.\n  So we started with breast cancer in 1992 and quickly expanded to look \nat other illnesses and conditions. Since 1992, Congress has provided \nmore than $11.7 billion to fund more than 13,000 research grants. Today \nDOD's medical research program studies prostate cancer, ALS, traumatic \nbrain injury, multiple sclerosis, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, autism, \namputation research, and many others. And I am so proud that research \nis conducted at Fort Detrick in Maryland, Johns Hopkins, and the \nUniversity of Maryland.\n  Almost immediately, Congress's investment in DOD's medical research \nprogram paid off--and with dividends. Breast cancer research led to the \ndevelopment of Herceptin, a standard care for the treatment of breast \ncancer. Lung cancer research led to creation of the first lung cancer \nbio-specimen repository with clinical and outcome data available to all \nresearchers studying lung cancer. Traumatic brain injury research led \nto the development of two FDA-cleared devices to screen for and \nidentify TBI in military members. Amputee care research led to the \ndevelopment of amputee trauma trainer, a device which replicates blast \ninjuries from IEDs in war zones. It trains physicians to better respond \nto war injuries. Some of the DOD's regenerative medical breakthroughs \nare so astonishing you would think you were reading science fiction. \nThe Department's medical program supported the first ever double hand \ntransplantation on a combat-wounded warrior. Wow--so proud that this \nground-breaking procedure was developed and performed at Johns Hopkins. \nThis is just a snapshot. The list of successes are as long as they are \ninspiring.\n  For years, opponents of DOD's medical research program have argued \nagainst this program. They say, ``Oh, this research is duplicative. Oh, \nthis research should only benefit active military.'' Well, I say ``no'' \nto both arguments.\n  First, DOD's research is complementary to NIH's research but is not \nduplicative or redundant. In fact, the Department's research grants are \npeer-reviewed by doctors, scientists, advocates, and Federal agencies \nto ensure there is not duplication in efforts. The Institute of \nMedicine has reviewed DOD's program and found it to be efficient and \neffective.\n  Second, we know the diseases studied by DOD affect both active \nmilitary and their families. Imagine if we refused to allow DOD to \nstudy breast cancer in 1992 simply because there were fewer woman \nserving? We wouldn't have the advances that we do today saving lives \nand improving lives. Taking care of military families is an essential \npart of our promise to our men and women in uniform.\n  We have an opportunity to block this misguided language in the \nunderlying bill that would have terrible consequences for medical \nresearch. The discoveries and treatments speak for themselves. I urge \nmy colleagues to support Senator Durbin's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we will probably discuss this some more--\nthis issue of the privatization--later on before we actually vote on \nthe amendment, but this is a classic example of a distortion of an \nissue which could save the taxpayers $1 billion that we subsidize the \ncommissary system. It is not privatizing, I say to the Senator from \nMaryland; it is a pilot program of five--count them, five--military \nbases. There are companies and providers of food and services that are \nready to try to establish on bases. We are not taking away a single \ncommissary. We are not closing a single one--not one. But what we are \ntrying to do is--if you want to have a hamburger at Burger\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nKing or McDonald's or Dunkin' Donuts or use UPS, you can go on a \nmilitary base and they will provide you that service. The government \ndoesn't do it. They don't make hamburgers. They don't carry mail. All \nof a sudden, now we have to have more studies. The real study would be \na pilot program which proves successful.\n  By the way, if you ask the men and women who are in the military \n``Would you like to shop at Walmart or Safeway or one of these others \nif it is convenient?'' do you know what the answer is? ``Of course. \nYes.'' Because there is more variety and there are lower prices.\n  Does my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, know that we are \nspending over $1 billion of taxpayer money on these commissaries every \nyear, when we could probably do it for nothing or even charge these \ngroups or commercial enterprises that would like to come, in a pilot \nprogram, to a military base? This is crazy. Fort Belvoir Commissary \nright here, the highest grossing store in the system, loses 10 cents on \nevery dollar of goods it produces and sells, and guess who covers those \nlosses. The taxpayers of America.\n  It is not an attempt to take away the commissary benefits; it is an \nattempt to see if the men and women in the military and all their \ndependents around the bases might get a better product at a lower \nprice. That is what five--count them, five--privatizations are \nattempting to try.\n  Yesterday, we received the Department of Defense report on its plan \nto modernize the commissary and exchange systems. In that report, DOD \nstated that private sector entities are ``willing to engage in a pilot \nprogram.'' DOD has told us that at least three major private sector \nentities are interested in testing commissary privatization. This has \nled DOD to publish a request for information to industry to give \nfeedback on how a privatization pilot program could work. So why would \nmy colleague support an amendment that would delay what needs to be \ndone?\n  This is really all about an outfit called the grocery brokers. That \nindustry has been working overtime to stop this pilot program because \nif it is successful, privatization would destroy their successful \nbusiness model because they wouldn't have to use the grocery brokers. \nThat is what this is all about, my friends.\n  So rather than paying over $1 billion a year to be in the grocery \nbusiness, privatization might provide--I am not saying it will, but it \nmight provide the Department of Defense with an alternative method of \ngiving the men and women in the military and our retirees high-quality \ngrocery products, higher levels of customer satisfaction, and discount \nsavings, while reducing the financial burden on taxpayers. We need to \nhave a pilot program for sure.\n  Five pilot programs is not the end of civilization as we know it. It \nis not a burden on the men and women who are serving. I have talked to \nhundreds of men and women who are serving. I said ``How would you like \nto have Safeway on the base? How would you like to have Walmart?'' and \nthey said ``Gee, I would really like that'' because they get a wider \nand diverse selection from which to choose--not to mention, although it \ndoesn't seem to matter around here, it might save $1 billion for the \ntaxpayers. But what is $1 billion? We are going to spend a couple \nbillion dollars just on medical research--which the Senator from \nMaryland obviously is in favor of--calling it in the name of defense, \nwhen it absolutely should be funded by other branches of the \nAppropriations Committee, rather than the Willie Sutton syndrome and \ntaking it out of defense.\n  All I can say to the Senator from Maryland is that all we are talking \nabout is giving it a try in five places. Let's not go to general \nquarters about an attempt to see if we can save the taxpayers $1 \nbillion a year. We are not going to close any commissaries in any \nremote bases. We are not doing anything but a five-base pilot \nprogram. That is all there is to this amendment, and to portray it as \nanything else is a distortion of exactly what the legislation has \nclearly stated its intent to be.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, despite what was just said, I am not in \nthe pocket of something called grocery brokers. I am not here showing \nfor something called grocery brokers. I am here to stand up for \nmilitary and military families. I want the record to show that. I don't \neven know what grocery brokers are. I know what a grocery store is \nbecause my father ran one, I worked in one and learned a lot from the \nkind of values my father ran his business on.\n  Let's talk about the DOD-mandated report that we did last year when \nwe discussed this. The report acknowledges that privatization would not \nbe able to replicate the range of benefits, the level of savings, and \nthe geographic reach provided by the commissaries while achieving \nbudget neutrality. DOD is continuing its due diligence on \nprivatization. It is still assessing the privatization of all or \nportions of the commissary system.\n  What I worry about is cherry-picking. ``Oh, we are going to \nprivatize.'' They are going to do it in the lucrative markets, in the \nBaltimore-Washington corridor, but right now our commissaries, owned by \nthe United States of America for the troops defending the United States \nof America, are required to operate where the servicemembers are, even \nwhen it would not be economically beneficial from a commercial \nstandpoint. Go ahead with this privatization myth, fantasy, or delusion \nthat they are not going to cherry-pick.\n  More than two-thirds of the commissaries serve military populations \nliving in locations that are not profitable for private sector grocers. \nThese commissaries are made possible by the appropriated funds subsidy \nand by operating efficiencies and volumes of the large statewide \nstores. It is not only taxpayers they are subsidizing. Over 40 percent \nof commissaries' appropriated budget provide commissary services \noverseas and in remote locations. Do you think they are going to be \npart of privatization? They are going take what they want, where they \ncan make money, and then these others are going to be defunded because, \nyes, you might talk about what the taxpayers subsidize, but at large, \nmore profitable commissaries are also a cross-subsidy to those that are \nin the more remote areas or overseas.\n  Commissaries provide a benefit to servicemembers in the form of \nsavings, proximity, and consistency that in some ways the commercial \ngrocery sector, which must operate for profit, might find difficult to \nsustain.\n  Business is business. We know how the defense contractor game works. \nWe know how the contractors are. They go where they can make money. \nThat doesn't necessarily mean they go where they serve the Nation. I \nhave great respect for our defense contractors. Many of them are either \nheadquartered in Maryland or serve Maryland, but let's face it, their \nbusiness is to make money, not necessarily to serve the troops. If they \ncan make money serving the troops, they will make money and want to \nhave stores where they can make money. That doesn't deal with the \nremote area. Let's hear it from our Alaskan people, let's hear it from \nthe overseas people, and so on.\n  All I am saying is, while we continue on the path to explore either \ncomplete budget neutrality or to achieve budget neutrality, the \nDepartment of Defense says it needs more analysis on what it can do \nwith itself and what the private sector is talking about.\n  There are three major private sector companies that have expressed \ninterest. I would want to know, are they going to cherry-pick or are \nthey going to be like Little Jack Horner waiting to get their hands on \na plum? I am for the whole fruit stand, and I want it at the \ncommissaries.\n  This has been a good exchange, and I respect my colleague from \nArizona in the way he has stood up for defense. I know he wants to \nserve the troops as well. So let's see where the votes go, and we look \nforward to advancing the cause of the national security for our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. I \nalways enjoy spirited discussion with her. She is a wonderful public \nservant, and I am going to miss her in this institution because she has \nan honorable record of outstanding service, and I always enjoy doing \ncombat.\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n                                Hear Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Constitution convened a hearing on a piece of \nlegislation I introduced with several of my colleagues called the \nHolocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act, or the HEAR Act. This bill is \nlong overdue, and like most pieces of good legislation, it is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  During the Holocaust, Nazis regularly confiscated private property, \nincluding artwork, adding one more offense to their devastating reign. \nToday, the day after the anniversary of D-day and decades after World \nWar II ended, there are still families who haven't been able to get \ntheir stolen artwork or family heirlooms back.\n  The HEAR Act will support these victims by giving them a chance to \nhave their claims decided on the merits in a court of law and hopefully \nfacilitate the return of artwork stolen by Nazis to their rightful \nowners. That is why we called the hearing ``Reuniting Victims with \nTheir Lost Heritage.'' It is true that Hitler's final solution in World \nWar II was not just the extermination of the Jewish people but erasing \ntheir culture. This was part of the overall plan in Hitler's final \nsolution. This legislation will help those who had vital pieces of \ntheir family and cultural heritage stolen to find justice.\n  This legislation is also consistent with our country's diplomatic \nefforts and longstanding congressional policy. I am grateful to my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Cruz, as well as the senior Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer, and Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, for joining \nme in introducing this bipartisan piece of legislation. I hope the \nSenate Judiciary Committee will mark this up soon and the full Chamber \nwill consider it soon.\n  Mr. President, separately, as we continue our work on the Defense \nauthorization bill, I want to talk for a moment about how important \nthat is. Yesterday I spent some time talking about the threats not only \nto our troops overseas who are in harm's way but threats that those of \nus here at home are experiencing as a result of a more diversified \narray of threats than we have ever seen in the last 50 years. I say \n``50 years'' because the Director of National Intelligence, James \nClapper, has served in the intelligence community for 50 years, and \nthat is what he said--we have a more diverse array of threats today \nthan he has seen in his whole 50-year career. That includes here at \nhome because it is not just people traveling from the Middle East to \nthe United States or people coming from the United States over to the \nMiddle East training and then coming back. It is also about homegrown \nterrorists--people who are inspired by the use of social media and \ninstructed to take up arms where they are and kill innocent people in \nthe United States and, unfortunately, as we have seen in Europe as \nwell.\n  As we think about the legacy of this President and his administration \nwhen it comes to foreign policy, I am reminded of the comments by \nformer President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, commenting on another \nDemocratic President's foreign policy. When he was asked, he candidly \nadmitted and said: I can't think of a single place in the world where \nthe United States is better off or held in higher esteem than it was \nbefore this administration. He called the impact of President Obama's \nforeign policy minimal. I would suggest that is awfully generous, if \nyou look around the world, the threats of a nuclear-armed North Korea, \nwhich has intercontinental ballistic missiles it has tested in creating \nan unstable environment there with our ally and friend to the south, \nSouth Korea, if you look at what is happening in Europe as the newly \nemboldened Putin has invaded Crimea and Ukraine with very little \nconsequences associated with it. I have said it before and I will say \nit again, weakness is a provocation. Weakness is a provocation to the \nworld's bullies, thugs, and tyrants, and that is what we see in spades.\n  In the Middle East, President Obama talked about a red line in Syria \nwhen chemical weapons were used, but then when Bashar al-Assad saw that \nthere was no real followthrough on that, it was a hollow threat and \nindeed he just kept coming, barrel-bombing innocent civilians in a \ncivil war which has now taken perhaps 400,000 lives. Then, we have seen \nit in the South China Sea, where China, newly emboldened, is literally \nbuilding islands in the middle of the South China Sea--one of the most \nimportant sealanes to international commerce and trade in Asia.\n  I will quote on North Korea again. Former Secretary of Defense Leon \nPanetta said: ``We're within an inch of war almost every day in that \npart of the world,'' talking about Asia, with the threat of China in \nthe South China Sea, North Korea. As far as North Korean aggression is \nconcerned, this administration has basically done nothing to counter \nthat aggression.\n  Under the President's watch, this regime has grown even more hostile \nand more dangerous because it is so unstable. In fact, when she was \nSecretary of State, Secretary Clinton testified in her confirmation \nhearing that her goal was ``to end the North Korean nuclear program.'' \nThat is what Secretary Clinton said. Her goal was to end the North \nKorean nuclear program. She even promised to embark upon a very \naggressive effort to that effect.\n  We know what happened. Instead, she adopted what was later \neuphemistically called strategic patience. That is just another way of \nsaying doing nothing. In other words, this more laid-back approach is \nsimply lost on tyrants like we see in North Korea, and it certainly \ndidn't punish the North Korean leadership for its hostilities.\n  We can't continue down the reckless path of ignoring challenges \naround the world or retreating where people are looking for American \nleadership. That is why it is so critical that we demonstrate our \ncommitment to our men and women in uniform by passing this important \nDefense authorization bill this week.\n  We have an all-volunteer military, and that is a good thing. We have \nmany patriots who join the military, train, and then are deployed all \naround the world, as directed by the Commander in Chief, but the idea \nthat we would not follow through on our commitment to make sure they \nhave the resources they need is simply unthinkable.\n  I hope we will continue to make progress on the Defense authorization \nbill and make sure we provide the resources, equipment, and \nauthorization they need in order to defend our country. Let's get the \nNDAA, the Defense authorization bill, done this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while we are waiting for others to speak \non the floor, I think it is important to take a moment to talk about \nthe lead editorial in this morning's Washington Post, which describes \nthe events transpiring in Syria, as we speak. The lead editorial says:\n\n       Empty words, empty stomachs. Syrian children continue to \n     face starvation as another Obama administration promise falls \n     by the wayside.\n\n  This is a devastating and true story.\n\n       It's been nearly six months since the U.N. Security Council \n     passed a resolution demanding an end to the bombing and \n     shelling of civilian areas in Syria and calling for immediate \n     humanitarian access to besieged areas. It's been four months \n     since Secretary of State John F. Kerry described the sieges \n     as a ``catastrophe'' of a dimension unseen since World War II \n     and said that ``all parties of the conflict have a duty to \n     facilitate humanitarian access to Syrians in desperate \n     need.''\n\n  Those were the words of Secretary of State John Kerry back in \nFebruary.\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       By Monday, there still had been no food deliveries to \n     Darayya in the Damascus suburbs, the al-Waer district of Homs \n     or several of the other 19 besieged areas, with a population \n     of more than 500,000, identified by the United Nations. Nor \n     had there been airdrops. None have been organized, and U.N. \n     officials say none are likely in the coming days. Another \n     deadline has been blown, another red line crossed--and \n     children in the besieged towns are still starving.\n\n  This is heartbreaking. It is heartbreaking. It is heartbreaking. \nChildren in besieged towns are still starving.\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       Over the weekend, Russian and Syrian planes--\n\n  Our allies, the Russians--\n\n     heavily bombed civilian areas in rebel-held areas of Aleppo \n     and Idlib. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 500 \n     civilians, including 105 children, had been killed in 45 \n     consecutive days of bombing in Aleppo. The ``cessation of \n     hostilities'' negotiated by Mr. Kerry in February, which was \n     never fully observed by Russia and Syria, has been shredded.\n       And the Obama administration's response? It is still \n     waiting patiently for the regime of Bashar al-Assad to stop \n     dropping barrel bombs from helicopters on hospitals and allow \n     passage to aid convoys. It is still asking politely for \n     Russia to stop bombing Western-backed rebel units and to \n     compel the Assad regime to follow suit. ``We expect the \n     regime to live up to its commitments,'' said a State \n     Department statement Monday. ``We ask Russia to use its \n     influence to end this inhumane policy.'' As for airdrops, \n     ``that's a very complex question,'' said a spokeswoman.\n       The promise of air delivery, it turns out, was entirely \n     rhetorical. On May 26, two senior U.N. officials publicly \n     warned that a U.N. air bridge could not be established \n     without permission from the Assad regime--the same regime \n     that was blocking food deliveries by land. They called on the \n     United States and Russia to ``find a way'' to begin the \n     operation. But neither the United States nor Britain, the \n     original proponent of the airdrops, acted to make an \n     operation possible. Instead, they issued appeals to the \n     Russian government--the same government that is \n     systematically bombing civilian neighborhoods of Aleppo and \n     Idlib.\n       The British ambassador to the United Nations hinted on \n     Friday that if the Assad regime kept preventing land and air \n     raid deliveries, his government ``will consider other \n     actions.'' The French ambassador to the United Nations said \n     ``the Syrian regime is continuing to systematically starve \n     hundreds of thousands of civilians. These are war crimes . . \n     . There is a strong momentum here in the Security Council . . \n     . to say `enough is enough.' ''\n       Strong words. Those are a Kerry specialty, too. People in \n     the besieged towns are ``eating leaves and grass or animals \n     of one kind or another that they can manage to capture,'' Mr. \n     Kerry declared. Humanitarian access, he said, ``has to happen \n     not a week from now . . . it ought to happen in the first \n     days.'' That was on February 2.\n\n  On February 2, the Secretary of State declared humanitarian access \nwhere 500,000 people were starving. On February 2, he said that the \nhumanitarian access ``has to happen not a week from now . . . it ought \nto happen in the first days.'' It is shocking and disgraceful. We \nshould all be ashamed. By the way, the people who we are training to \nfight against ISIS are prohibited from fighting against the guy who is \nbarrel-bombing and killing these thousands of men, women, and \nchildren--Bashar al-Assad. It is insanity. History will judge this \nadministration and its actions not only with anger but with \nembarrassment. This is a shameful chapter in American history.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there an order of business that has \nbeen agreed to by unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 4 p.m. is equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I find it hard to understand why anyone \nwould want to eliminate funding for militarily relevant defense medical \nresearch--research that offers families hope and improves and saves \nlives--especially now. When you look at the body of medical research \nacross all Federal agencies, we are getting closer to finding cures for \ncertain cancers, closer than ever to understanding how to delay the \nonset of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, closer \nthan ever to developing a universal flu vaccine. Now is the time to be \nramping up our investment in medical research, not scaling it back. \nYet, there are two provisions in this Defense authorization bill that \nwould effectively end the Department of Defense medical research \nprogram. These two provisions are dangerous. They cut medical research \nfunding, which will cost lives--military lives and civilian lives. That \nis why I filed a bipartisan amendment, together with Senator Cochran, \nthe Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which \nwill be considered by the Senate this afternoon.\n  My legislation would remove Chairman McCain's provisions so that \nlifesaving research at the Department of Defense can continue. Senator \nMcCain's two provisions, found in sections 756 and 898, work hand in \nhand to end the Department of Defense medical research program.\n  His first provision requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that \neach medical research grant is ``designed to directly promote, enhance, \nand restore the health and safety of members of the Armed Forces''--not \nveterans, not retirees, not spouses of military members, and not \nchildren of military families. In my view, they are all part of our \nnational defense, and they should all be covered by the DOD health care \nsystem and research.\n  Senator McCain's second provision, section 898, would require that \nmedical research grant applicants meet the same accounting and pricing \nstandards that the Department requires for procuring contracts. This is \na dramatic change in the law. It is the imposition of miles of redtape \non every medical research grant. The regulations that he has subjected \nthem to apply to private companies that sell the Department of Defense \ngoods and services, such as weapon systems and equipment. Among other \nthings, it would require the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, to \nconduct at least one, and probably several, audits on each grant \nrecipient. Do you know what that means? It means there will be 2,433 \nmore audits each year by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. How are \nthey doing with their current workload? They are behind on $43 billion \nworth of goods and services that is being procured by the Department of \nDefense, and Senator McCain would send them at least 2,433 more audits \nnext year.\n  Taxpayers deserve to know that their money is well spent. The \nexisting system does just that. A grant application now is carefully \nscrutinized, and throughout the 24-year history of this Defense \nresearch program, there have only been a handful of instances where \nserious questions have risen. No grant makes it through this process \nwithout first showing clear military relevance. If an applicant fails \nthat test, it is over. If they clear it, they will be subject to a host \nof criticism and scrutiny by researchers, and then representatives from \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs sit down and measure each grant against existing research. \nThese rules are in place to protect taxpayers' dollars, and they do. \nSenator McCain is now seeking to add miles of redtape to a program in \nthe name of protecting it. His provisions go too far.\n  The Coalition for National Security Research, which represents a \nbroad coalition of research universities and institutes, wrote: ``These \nsections''--referring to Chairman McCain's sections--``will likely \nplace another administrative burden on the DOD scientific research \nenterprise and slow the pace of medical innovation.''\n  When we asked the Department of Defense to give us their analysis of \nChairman McCain's provisions, they concluded--after looking at all of \nthe redtape created by Senator McCain--that these issues would lead to \nthe failure of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program. \nThat is clear and concise, and, sadly, it is accurate.\n  What Senator McCain has proposed as a new administrative bureaucratic \nburden on medical research at the Department of Defense is not fiscally \nresponsible, it doesn't protect taxpayers, and it is not in pursuit of \nsmall government by any means. These provisions are simply roadblocks.\n  Let's talk for a minute about the medical research funded by the \nDepartment of Defense. Since fiscal year 1992, this program has \ninvested $11.7 billion in innovative research. The U.S. Army Medical \nResearch and Materiel Command determines the appropriate research \nstrategy. They looked for research gaps, and they want to fund high-\nrisk, high-impact research that other agencies and private investors \nmay be unwilling to fund.\n  In 2004, the Institute of Medicine, an independent organization \nproviding objective analysis of complex health issues, looked at the \nDOD medical research program, and they found that this program ``has \nshown that it has been an efficiently managed and scientifically \nproductive effort.'' The Institute of Medicine went on to say that this \nprogram ``concentrates its resources on research mechanisms that \ncomplement rather than duplicate the\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\nresearch approaches of the major funders of medical research in the \nUnited States, such as industry and the National Institutes of \nHealth.'' This has been a dramatically successful program.\n  I would like to point to a couple of things that need to be noted in \nthe Record when it comes to the success of this program. This morning \nSenator McCain raised a question about funding programs that relate to \nepilepsy and seizures when it comes to the Department of Defense \nmedical research program. In a recent video produced by the Citizens \nUnited for Research in Epilepsy, they share heartbreaking stories of \nveterans suffering from post-traumatic epilepsy and the recovery \nchallenges they face. They shared the story of retired LCpl Scott \nKruchten. His team of five marines, during a routine patrol, drove over \nan IED. He was the only survivor. He suffered severe brain injury. \nLance Corporal Kruchten suffered a seizure inside the helicopter while \nthey were transporting him to Baghdad for surgery. He has been on \nmedication ever since. In fact, seizures set back all of the other \nrehabilitation programs that injured veterans participate in and \ngreatly slow their recovery.\n  Since the year 2000, over 300,000 Active-Duty military servicemembers \nhave experienced an incident of traumatic brain injury. Many of them \nare at risk of developing epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy comprises \nabout 20 percent of all symptomatic epilepsy. According to the American \nEpilepsy Society, over 50 percent of traumatic brain injury victims \nwith penetrating head injury from Korea and Vietnam developed post-\ntraumatic epilepsy. The research we are talking about is relevant to \nthe military. It is relevant to hundreds of thousands who have faced \ntraumatic brain injury. I don't know why Chairman McCain pointed that \nout this morning as an example of research that is unnecessary to the \nDepartment of Defense. It is clearly necessary for the men and women \nwho serve our country.\n\n  Let me say a word about breast cancer too. In 2009, after serving the \nAir Force for over 25 years, SMSgt Sheila Johnson Glover was diagnosed \nwith advanced stage IV breast cancer which had spread to her liver and \nribs. She said breast cancer cut her military career short. She was \ntreated with Herceptin, a drug developed with early support from the \nDepartment of Defense medical research funding. According to Sheila, \n``It is a full circle with me, giving 25 years of service in the DOD \nand the Department of Defense giving me back my life as a breast cancer \npatient.''\n  Sheila is not alone; 1 out of every 8 women is at risk of developing \nbreast cancer in her lifetime and 175,000 women are expected to be \ndiagnosed with the disease each year. With more than 1.4 million \nActive-Duty females and female spouses under the Federal military \nhealth system, breast cancer research is directly related to our \nmilitary and our military community.\n  Breast cancer research started this medical research program in the \nDepartment of Defense. It was given a mere $46 million at the start. \nOver the span of the life of medical research programs at the \nDepartment of Defense, a little over $11 billion has been spent. Almost \none-third of it has gone to breast cancer research, and they have come \nup with dramatic, positive results, such as the development of this \ndrug Herceptin.\n  The point I am getting to is this. If you believe the military \nconsists of more than just the man or woman in a uniform but consists \nof their families and those who have served and who are now veterans, \nif you believe their medical outcomes are critically important to the \nfuture of our military, then you can understand why medical research \nprograms such as this one, which would be virtually eliminated by \nChairman McCain's language, is so important for the future strength of \nour men and women in uniform and the people who support them.\n  Let me tell you about a constituent who wrote me last month. This \nphoto shows Linda and Al Hallgren. Al is a U.S. veteran, survivor of \nbladder cancer. Linda wrote to me and said:\n\n       When my husband was originally diagnosed in 2013, our only \n     options were bladder removal followed by chemotherapy. \n     Prognosis based on his cancer was months to a year or so. \n     There were so many questions that came to mind, primarily \n     around, ``How did I get this?''\n\n  But as she pointed out to me, Al is a fighter, a survivor. Two years \nlater, here they are, the two of them, enjoying a ride on a motorcycle.\n  When she passed along this photo, here is what she said: ``We \ncontinue to fight the battle and take moments out to enjoy life to the \nfullest one day at a time.''\n  She noted in her letter that there are many risks with bladder cancer \nassociated with military service. Smoking is the leading cause. The \nincidence of smoking among our military members is entirely too high.\n  The Institute of Medicine also took a look at the use of Agent Blue \nfrom 1961 to 1971 in the Vietnam war and its linkage to bladder cancer. \nIt is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among veterans but only \nthe 27th highest recipient of Federal research. So the story of this \nfamily and what they have been through raises an important question. Do \nwe have an obligation to this individual who served our country, served \nit honorably, came home and suffered a serious medical illness? Do we \nhave an obligation, through medical research, to try to find ways to \nmake his life better, to make sure we spare him the pain that is \nassociated with many of the things that are linked to his service in \nour military? Of course, we do. So why do we go along with this \nlanguage that the chairman put in his authorization bill to eliminate \nthese medical research programs?\n  I mentioned earlier the advancements that were made in breast cancer \nresearch. In 1993, the Department of Defense awarded Dr. Dennis Slamon \ntwo grants totaling $1.7 million for a tumor tissue bank to study \nbreast cancer. He began his work several years earlier with funding \nfrom the National Cancer Institute, but researchers still lacked the \nregular source of breast tissue from women. That is when the DOD \nfunding made a difference. Dr. Slamon's DOD-funded work helped to \ndevelop Herceptin, which I mentioned earlier.\n  At lunch just a few minutes ago, we heard from Senator Barbara \nMikulski. She told about the lonely battle which she fought for years \nfor women to get medical research. Sadly, the National Institutes of \nHealth and other places were doing research only on men. Thank goodness \nSenator Mikulski and others spoke up. They spoke up and NIH started \nchanging its protocols. Then they went to the Department of Defense and \nsaid: We want you to focus on breast cancer, if you will, for the \nemerging role of women in our military, and they did with dramatic \nresults. Now comes a suggestion from Chairman McCain that we are to put \nan end to this research. We should burden it with more redtape. I don't \nthink it makes sense. It certainly doesn't make sense for the men and \nwomen serving in the military and the spouses of the men who serve in \nthe military who certainly understand the importance of this research.\n  DOD-funded research developed a neurocognitive test for diagnosing \nParkinson's disease. The Department of Defense research also identified \nadditional genetic risk factors for developing the disease, including \ntwo rare variants that we now know connect the risk for Parkinson's \nwith traumatic injury to the head. What we find when we look at the \nlist of research, such as Parkinson's disease, and question why that \nhas any application to the military, it is that they knew there was an \napplication, they knew there was a connection, and it was worth \nseeking.\n  Here is the bottom line. People have lived longer and more productive \nlives because of DOD-funded medical research, and we have an \nopportunity to help even more people if my amendment passes and we \ndefeat the language that is in this Defense authorization bill.\n  Sixty-three Senators from 41 States, both sides of the aisle, \nrequested increases in medical research for our next fiscal year. We \ncan't earmark where that research is going to take place--that goes \nthrough a professional process--but you can certainly point out to the \nDepartment of Defense areas where they might have some interest, and \nthey make the final decision.\n  If the McCain provisions become law, they put an end to research \nprograms requested by a supermajority of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used and how much time currently \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). There is 22\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield the floor at this point to see if others are \nseeking recognition.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 minutes remaining for the \nmajority.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If it is OK with the Senator, I will make a few comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. 1, when it comes to Senator Durbin, there is no \nstronger voice for medical research in the Senate and he should be \nproud of that.\n  Senator Durbin and I are cochairing the NIH caucus, the National \nInstitutes of Health, to make sure we take the crown jewel of our \nresearch at the Federal level and adequately fund it, to try to make it \nmore robust, and in times of budget cuts, sequestration across the \nboard, I want to compliment Senator Blunt and Senator Durbin and others \nfor trying to find a way to increase NIH funding. I think we will be \nsuccessful, and a lot of credit will go to Senator Durbin.\n  As to the military budget, we are on course to have the smallest Army \nsince 1940. We are on course to have the smallest Navy since 1915 and \nthe smallest Air Force in modern times. Modernization programs are very \nmuch stuck in neutral. The wars continue, and they are expanding. By \n2021, if we go back into a sequestration mode, we will be spending half \nof normally what we spend on defense in terms of GDP.\n  So to those who want to reform the military, count me in. This will \nbe one of the most reform-minded packages in the history of the \nDepartment of Defense. We are trying to address the top-heavy nature of \nthe military, where general officer billets have exploded, and make \nsure we have a leaner military at the top and put our emphasis on those \nout in the field fighting the war.\n  We are dealing with the explosion of contractors. We are looking at \nour medical delivery systems anew. It has all been bipartisan. Senator \nReed deserves a lot of credit with his Democratic colleagues to find \nways to reform the military, not only to save money but to improve the \nquality of life of those in the military.\n  There is an obligation on all of us who are considered defense hawks \nto make sure the military works more efficiently. This bill drives \ncontracting away from cost-plus to fixed price. We see a lot of \noverruns in terms of big-ticket items--billions of dollars over what \nwas projected in terms of costs of the F-35 and aircraft carriers. One \nof the ways to change that problem is to have the contractor have skin \nin the game by having a fixed price rather than cost-plus contracting.\n  I want to compliment Senators McCain and Reed for looking at the way \nthe military is being run and trying to make it more efficient, \nunderstanding that reform is necessary.\n  Having said that, 50 percent of the military's budget, for the most \npart, goes into personnel, and I believe we need more people in the \nArmy, not less. So we can reform the military to save money, and we \nshould. We can bring better business practices to the table, and we \nshould. We can modernize the way we deliver health care to get outcomes \nrather than just spending money, and we should. We can look at every \npart of the military and put it under a microscope and make it more \nefficient and make sure it is serving the defense needs of the country.\n  Having said that, given the number of ships we are headed toward, \n278--420,000 people in the Army--we need more people to defend this \nNation, and we have an obligation to the people defending the Nation to \ngive them the best equipment and take care of their families. I am not \nlooking for a fair fight. I want to rebuild the military and make sure \nour military has the weapons systems that would deter war, and if you \nhad to go to war, to win it as quickly as possible.\n  That gets us to medical research. There is about $1 billion spent on \nmedical research within the Department of Defense. What we are \nsuggesting is that we look at this account anew. What the committee has \ndecided to do--Senator McCain--is to say the Secretary of Defense has \nto certify that the money in the medical research budget in the \nDepartment of Defense is actually related to the defense world. There \nare a lot of good things being done in the Department of Defense in \nterms of medical research, but the question for us is, in that $1 \nbillion, how much of it actually applies to the military itself because \nevery dollar we spend out of DOD's budget for things not related to \ndefense hurts our ability to defend the Nation.\n  It is not a slam on the things they are doing. I am sure they are all \nworthwhile. The question is, Should that be done somewhere else and \nshould it come out of a different pot of money?\n  So the two measures we are proposing--to continue medical research in \nthe future, the Secretary of Defense would have to certify that the \nmedical research program in question is related to the Department of \nDefense's needs, and there is a pretty broad application of what \n``need'' is--traumatic brain injury and all kinds of issues related to \nveterans. Of the $1 billion, using the criteria I have just suggested \nwhere there is a certification, some of the money will stay in the \nDepartment of Defense, but some of it will not because if we look at \nthat $1 billion, a lot of it is not connected to what we do to defend \nthe Nation.\n  The second requirement is that if they are going to get research \ndollars, they have to go through the same process as any other \ncontractor to get money from the Department of Defense. That means they \nare in the same boat as anybody else who deals with the Department of \nDefense. If that is a redtape burden, then everybody who deals with the \nDepartment of Defense will share that burden. So rather than just \nwriting a check to somebody, there is a process to apply for the money \nand the contracting rules will apply. These are the two changes--a \ncertification that the money being spent on medical research benefits \nthe military, the Department of Defense, and in order to get that money \none has to go through the normal contracting procedures to make sure \nthere is competition and all the i's are dotted and t's are crossed. I \nthink that makes sense.\n  I think some of the money we are spending under the guise of military \nDepartment of Defense research has nothing to do with the Department of \nDefense, and we need every dollar we can find to defend the Nation. \nMany of these programs are very worthwhile, I am sure, and I would be \nwilling to continue them somewhere else. I am supporting a dramatic \nincrease in NIH funding. I am very much for research, but if we are \ngoing to bring about change in Washington, and if people like me who \nwant a stronger military are going to advocate for a bigger military, I \nthink we have an obligation to have a smarter, more reformed system.\n  I am not trying to have it both ways. I am looking at how the \nPentagon works at every level, along with Senator McCain, and we are \nbringing structural changes that are long overdue.\n  I want to compliment Senator Reed, who has been a great partner to \nSenator McCain. We don't always agree, but I think Senator Reed has \nbought into the idea that the Pentagon is not immune from being \nreformed and the status quo has to change.\n  So with all due respect to Senator Durbin, I think the provisions \nSenator McCain has crafted make sense to me. To get research dollars in \nthe future, the Secretary of Defense has to certify that the money in \nquestion helps the Department of Defense, and if one is going to bid \nfor the business, they must go through the normal contracting process \nto make sure it is done right. Those are the only two changes.\n  Those programs that will be knocked out of the Department of Defense, \nI am certainly willing to keep them funded somewhere else. I think that \nis a long-overdue reform.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend from \nSouth Carolina. We are friends. We have worked on a lot of things \ntogether. I hope we will continue to do so in the future. We clearly \nsee this issue differently today.\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\n  Two-tenths of 1 percent of the Department of Defense appropriations \nwill go for medical research--about $1 billion in a budget of $524 \nbillion. It is not an outrageous amount. We are not funding medical \nresearch at the expense of being able to defend America. Hardly anyone \nwould argue that, but a small percentage would. I can make an \nargument--and I have tried effectively here--that when it comes to the \nmedical research that is being done through the Department of Defense, \nit is extraordinary.\n  We have achieved so much for a minimal investment in so many \ndifferent areas. I could go through the list--and I will--of those \nareas of research that have made such a big difference. I also want to \nsay that there are 149 universities, veterans organizations, and \nmedical advocacy groups that support the amendment that I offered \ntoday. The reason they support it is that what has been suggested--that \nthis is not just another procedural requirement being placed in front \nof these institutions that want to do medical research--really \nunderstates the impact it will have.\n  The Department of Defense itself, after analyzing the McCain language \nthat comes to us on this bill, said it will create a burden, a delay, \nadditional overhead costs. The one thing we have not heard from \nChairman McCain or anyone on his side of the issue is what is the \nreason for this? Why are we changing a process that has been used for \n24 years? Has there been evidence of scandal, of waste, of abuse?\n  Out of the thousands and thousands of research grants that have been \ngiven, only a handful have raised questions, and very few of those go \nto the integrity of the process. It has been a question about the \nmedical procedure that was used. If we are going to impose new \nbureaucracies, new redtape, new requirements, new audits, why are we \ndoing it? If there is a need for it, I will stand up with everyone here \nand protect the taxpayers' dollars. But that is not really what is at \nstake here.\n  This morning on the floor, Chairman McCain made it clear. He just \ndoes not want medical research at the Department of Defense. He wants \nit limited strictly to certain areas and not to be expanded to include \nthe families of those serving in our military--our veterans--through \nthe Department of Defense. That is his position. He can hold that \nposition. I certainly disagree with it.\n  If we take an honest look at this, what we have done in creating this \nnew bureaucracy and redtape is simply slow down the process and make it \nmore expensive. For one thing, each one of these universities and each \none of these organizations has to go through an annual audit--at least \none. The agency within the Department of Defense responsible for those \naudits is currently overwhelmed, before this new McCain requirement \ncomes in for even more audits.\n  So it means the process slows down. Research does not take place in a \nmatter of months; it might be years. Do you want to wait for years in \nsome of these instances? I don't. I want timely research to come up \nwith answers to questions that can spare people suffering and spare \nexpense to the families as well as to the Department of Defense. When I \ngo through the long list of things that have been done through these \ndefense research programs, it is amazing how many times they have \nstepped up and made a serious difference.\n  Let me give you one other illustration. The incidence of blast \ninjuries to the eye has risen dramatically among servicemembers of Iraq \nand Afghanistan due to explosive weapons such as IEDs. Current \nprotective eye equipment--glasses, goggles, and face shields--are \ndesigned to protect mainly against high-velocity projectiles, not blast \nwaves from IEDs.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, upward of 13 percent of all injuries were \ntraumatic eye injuries, totaling more than 197,000. One published study \ncovering 2000 to 2010 estimated that deployment-related eye injuries \nand blindness have cost a total of $25 billion. Notably, eye-injured \nservicemembers have only a 20-percent return-to-duty rate compared to \nan 80-percent rate for other battle trauma.\n  Since 2009, $49 million in this Department of Defense medical \nresearch program has gone to research for the prevention and treatment \nof eye injury and disease that result in eye degeneration and \nimpairment or loss of vision. From the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts, \na published study covering 2000 to 2010 estimated that these injuries \nhave cost a total of $25 billion. Eye-injured soldiers have only 20-\npercent return-to-duty rates.\n  Research at Johns Hopkins, where they received grants to study why \neye injuries make up such a high percentage of combat casualty, found \nthat the blast wave causes eye tissue to tear, and protections like \ngoggles can actually trap blast reverberations. University of Iowa \nresearchers developed a handheld device to analyze the pupil's reaction \nto light as a quick test for eye damage.\n  So you look at it and say: Well, why would we do vision research at \nthe Department of Defense? Here is the answer: What our men and women \nin uniform are facing with these IEDs and the blast reverberations--\ndamage to their eyesight and even blindness--wasn't being protected \nwith current equipment. Is this worth an investment by the U.S. \nGovernment of less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the Department of \nDefense budget? I think it is. I think it is critically important that \nwe stand behind this kind of research and not second guess people who \nare involved.\n  We are not wasting money in this research; we are investing money in \nresearch to protect the men and women in uniform and make sure their \nlives are whole and make sure they are willing and able to defend this \ncountry when called upon.\n  This idea of Chairman McCain--of eliminating this program with new \nbureaucracy and redtape--is at the expense of military members, their \nfamilies, and veterans. We have made a promise to these men and women \nwho enlisted in our military that we will stand by them through the \nbattle and when they come home. That should be a promise we keep when \nit comes to medical research as well.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking Senator \nDurbin, Senator Cochran, and all my colleagues here today for their \nwork to support critical investments in medical research at the \nDepartment of Defense. I am proud to stand with them, but frankly, I am \nalso really disappointed that we have to be here.\n  For decades, investments in medical research by the Department of \nDefense have advanced improvements in the treatment of some of our \ntoughest diseases. DOD medical research funding has led to the \ndevelopment of new risk assessment tools that help evaluate the \nlikelihood of breast cancer recurrence, as well as new tests to \ndetermine the potential spread of a primary tumor. It has helped \nadvance research that could lead to treatment for the debilitating and, \nto-date, incurable disease ALS. It is supporting ongoing research into \nimprovements in cognitive therapy and access to treatment for children \nwith autism. And I could go on.\n  DOD medical research programs have had such an impact on the lives of \ntens of millions of servicemembers and their families, as well as \npatients across the country. These programs certainly don't deserve to \nbe on the chopping block, so it is very concerning to me that the \ndefense authorization bill we are currently debating would severely \nrestrict the scope of DOD research and undermine critical DOD support \nfor research efforts on everything from breast cancer, to MS, to lung \ncancer, and much more.\n  If you are serving your country and have a child struggling with \nautism or if you are a veteran with severe hearing loss or if you are \none of the many patients across the country waiting and hoping for a \ntreatment or cure that hasn't been discovered yet, I am sure you would \nwant to know that your government is doing everything it can to support \nresearch that could make all the difference.\n  I am proud to be supporting the amendment that we are discussing \ntoday, which would ensure that groundbreaking, and in some cases \nlifesaving, medical research at the Department of Defense can continue, \nand I urge all of my colleagues to join us. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in this promising time, there are no \nresources too great to contribute to\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\ngroundbreaking medical research. Key discoveries, new technologies and \ntechniques, and tremendous leaps in our knowledge and understanding \nabout disease and human health are being made every day.\n  Biomedical research conducted by the Defense Department has been a \ncritical tool in combatting rare diseases here in the United States and \nacross the world. Since 1992, the Department of Defense's \nCongressionally Directed Medical Research Program, CDMRP, has invested \nbillions of dollars in lifesaving research to support our \nservicemembers and their families, veterans, and all Americans. I am \nproud to have been involved with starting this program, and I have \nfought year in and year out to support it. As the Senate continues to \ndebate this year's National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, I am \nconcerned that the Senate's bill includes two harmful provisions that \nwould undermine medical research in the CDMRP and erode these paths to \nvital progress, taking hope away from millions of Americans.\n  The CDMRP has long led to advancements in the field of medicine. From \nthe development of early-detection techniques for diagnosing cancer and \nimproving ways to restore mobility to patients suffering from \nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS, to advancing treatments for \ntraumatic brain injury and progressing the approval of drugs to treat \nprostate and breast cancer. For more than two decades, this valuable \nmedical research program has invested over $11 billion in the health of \nour servicemembers and their families and developed techniques to \ncombat various cancers and the many rare and debilitating diseases \nfaced by so many Americans.\n  I was proud to be there from the start of the CDMRP. Those efforts \nevolved from linking a bill I coauthored in 1992 to create a national \nnetwork of cancer registries to assist researchers in understanding \nbreast cancer, with an effort led by former Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, \nmyself, and several others, to redirect military funds to breast cancer \nresearch. With the help of the late Pat Barr of the Breast Cancer \nNetwork of Vermont and the many others who were the driving force \nbehind national breast cancer networks, the CDMRP received its first \nappropriations of $210 million for breast cancer research in the 1993 \ndefense budget. Since then, the program has invested $3 billion in \nbreast cancer research, leading to exponential nationwide reductions in \nthe incidence of the disease. It was due to these investments that Pat \nBarr herself was able to enjoy an active and fulfilling life for \ndecades after her own diagnosis and was able to spend so many years \nfiercely fighting for the research that has touched, improved or saved \nmillions of lives.\n  The structure of the CDMRP has always advanced biomedical research \nfor servicemembers and their families, as well as the public at large. \nIt is shortsighted and frustrating that two needless provisions have \nbeen dropped into this year's NDAA, which would bar the Department of \nDefense from researching the medical needs of military families and \nveterans and require grant applications to comply with weapon system \nacquisition rules instead of the carefully peer-reviewed applications \nprocess from which all good science grows.\n  To redefine the definition of who can benefit from lifesaving \ntreatment and research to cancer and other diseases is misguided and \ncounterproductive. If we are to advance medicine in one population, \nthese tools should be made available to everyone. If we change the \nscope of these long fought efforts, we deny researchers the knowledge \nthey need to carry out science that saves lives. It hinders medical \nprogress for our children and grandchildren.\n  Whereas proponents of these provisions claim they will bring cost \nsavings in the long term, we all know this is simply not true. Disease \ndoes not discriminate between servicemember, family member, veteran, or \ncivilian. When it comes to medical research, we shouldn't either. That \nis why I am proud to support the bipartisan Durbin amendment to strike \nthese unnecessary and hindering provisions from the bill, which would \nneedlessly block access to innovative discoveries in these burgeoning \nfields of medicine.\n  Biomedical research is a proven tool that brings us closer every day \nto finding cures and expanding treatments for debilitating conditions \nacross the world. We cannot allow this year's defense authorization \nbill to deny our veterans, the families of our servicemembers, and \nother Americans victimized by ravaging disease the promise of such \ngroundbreaking medical knowledge. I urge all Senators to join me in \nsupporting Senator Durbin's amendment and in defeating any provisions \nin the bill that threaten the continued success of the CDMRP. We must \nnot lose sight of the progress we have made in the fight against breast \ncancer and other debilitating conditions. This valuable medical \nresearch program has paved the way for so many, and we must keep it \nstrong for generations to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 22 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will just take a couple of minutes to keep everybody \nawake.\n  The history of this program is pretty interesting. In 1992, by \nmandate, the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program began \nwithin the Department of Defense with an earmark of $20 million for \nbreast cancer. So, back in 1992, somebody came up with the idea that we \nshould put some money regarding breast cancer research into the \nDepartment of Defense bill.\n  Everybody I know of wants to defeat breast cancer and fund research \nat an appropriate level. Why did they do it in the Defense bill? \nBecause the Defense bill was going to pass. It is the one thing around \nhere that we all eventually get done because we have to defend the \nNation. So that idea of a $20 million earmark for breast cancer--fast \nforward from 1992 to now--is $900-something million of research at the \nDepartment of Defense. It went from $20 million to $900 million. It has \nbeen about $1 billion a year for a very long time.\n  The reason these programs are put in the Department of Defense--some \nof them are related to the Department of Defense and veterans; many of \nthem are not, and the ones that can make it in this bill are going to \nget their funding apart from their traditional research funding--is \nthat the Department of Defense will get funded.\n  All we are saying is that, given the budget problems we have as a \nnation and the constraints on our military due to defense cuts and \nshrinking budgets, now is the time to reevaluate the way we do \nbusiness. It is not that we are against medical research in the Defense \nDepartment's budget; we just want it to be related to defense. I know \nthat is a novel idea, but it makes sense to me.\n  All the things that Senator Durbin identified as being done in the \nDepartment of Defense--I am sure most of them are very worthy. Let's \njust make sure they are funded outside of the Department of Defense \nbecause the money is being taken away from defending the Nation. Taking \nmoney out of the Defense Department to do research is probably not a \nsmart thing to do now if it is not related to defending the Nation, \ngiven the state of the world and the state of the military.\n  So this is business as usual, even if it is just $900 million, which \nis still a lot of money. I think it is time to relook at the way we \nfund the Defense Department and how it runs and try to get it in a spot \nthat is more sustainable. So what have we done? We have said: You can \nstill do research at the Department of Defense, but the Secretary of \nDefense has to certify it is related to our defense needs--and a pretty \nliberal interpretation of that.\n  If you are going to do research, you have to go through the normal \ncontracting procedures that everybody else has to go through. Those two \nchanges really make sense to me.\n  Here is the point: If you apply the test that it has got to be \nrelated to defending the Nation in a fairly liberal interpretation, \nprobably two-thirds or three-fourths of this account would not pass \nthat test. So that means there is going to be $600 million or $700 \nmillion--maybe more--that will go to defense needs, not research needs.\n  That doesn't mean that we don't need to spend the money on research. \nMost of it we probably do. The person delivering this speech is also \nthe cochairman of the NIH, which is the part\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\nof the government that does medical research. I want to increase that \nbudget tremendously because the dividends to the taxpayers and to our \noverall health are real. I just don't want to continue to use the \nDefense Department as a way to do research unrelated to the defense \nneeds of this country because I don't think that is the right way to do \nit.\n  When you are this far in debt and the military is under this much \npressure, it is time for change. That is all this is--making a \ncommonsense change to a practice that started at $20 million and is now \nalmost $1 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost 16 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend from South \nCarolina. I keep giving examples of medical research in this program \nthat relate directly to members of the military and their families and \nto veterans. All I hear back in return is: Well, we ought to be doing \nthis research someplace else. Why? Don't we want the research to be \ndone by the Department that has a special responsibility to the men and \nwomen in uniform and their families as well as veterans?\n  Let me give you another example that I think really helps to tell \nthis story of research that is jeopardized by the McCain language in \nthis authorization bill. Joan Gray graduated from West Point in the \nfirst class that included women. She was commissioned in the U.S. Army \nas a platoon leader, commander, staff officer. After 5 years of \nservice, she sustained a spinal cord injury in a midair collision \nduring a nighttime tactical parachute jump. Joan Gray's wounds required \n12 vertebral fusions. She is now an ambulatory paraplegic and a member \nof the Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n  Spinal injuries sustained from trauma impact servicemembers deployed \noverseas and in training. Over 5 percent of combat evacuations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan were for spinal trauma. Spinal cord injuries require \nspecialized care and support for acute injury, disability adjustment, \npain management, quality of life.\n  Since 2009, Congress has appropriated in this account--which is going \nto be eliminated by this amendment--over $157 million to research the \nentire continuum of prehospital care, treatment, and rehab needs for \nspinal cord injury. The amount and extent of bleeding within the spinal \ncord can predict how well an individual will recover from a spinal cord \ninjury.\n  Researchers at Ohio State University and the University of Maryland \nat Baltimore examined why some injuries cause more or less bleeding. \nThey studied early markers of injury and found an FDA-approved diabetes \ndrug that proved to reduce lesion size and injury duration in spinal \ncord injuries. At the University of Pennsylvania, researchers have \nstudied how to facilitate surviving nerve axons to grow across an \ninjury site after spinal cord trauma to improve nerve generation and \nfunctionality.\n  Is this research important? I would say it is. It is certainly \nimportant to those who serve us. It is important to their families as \nwell. It should be important to all of us. Why are we cutting corners \nwhen it comes to medical research for our military and our veterans? \nWhy is this account, which is less than two-tenths of 1 percent of this \ntotal budget, the target they want to cut? Medical research for the \nmilitary and the veterans--every single grant that is approved has to \ngo through the test of military relevance.\n  It isn't a question of dreaming up some disease that might have an \napplication someplace in the world. A panel looks at the research that \nis requested and asks: Does this have relevance today to our military \nand their families and veterans as well? If it doesn't pass this test, \nit is finished. That is why I am fighting to protect this money. So \nmuch has come out of this that it is of value to the men and women in \nuniform and veterans. Putting this new procedure in here making them go \nthrough the procurement requirements that we have for the largest \ndefense contractors in America is unnecessary, burdensome, and will \ndelay this process and make it more expensive.\n\n  I would like to hear from the other side one example of abuse in \nthese research grants that would justify changing the rules that have \nbeen in place for 24 years. Come up with that example. You are going to \nbe hard-pressed to find it. After more than 2,000 of these grants a \nyear for years--it has gone on for 24 years--I am waiting for the first \nexample.\n  What I think is really at stake here is an effort to make it more \ndifficult, more cumbersome, and less appealing to the universities to \ndo this kind of research, and we will be the lesser for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed 9 minutes and that Senator Johnson then be allowed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time be for \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, would you please let me know when 8 \nminutes has elapsed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator will be notified.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Johnson pertaining to the \nintroduction of S.J. Res. 34 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to first inquire how much is \nremaining on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the two pending \namendments.\n  I will begin by thanking my colleague from South Carolina for his \nthoughtful and kind words about the collaboration we have both \nwitnessed on the committee as we brought this bill to the floor under \nthe leadership of Chairman McCain.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  First, with respect to the Inhofe-Mikulski amendment, I share their \nconcerns about the quality of commissaries. It is an essential service \nfor military personnel. In fact, it is really in the fabric of military \nlife, being able to go to a commissary. It is an important benefit, \nparticularly for junior members, those who aren't as well paid as more \nsenior members of the military. But both the chairman and my colleagues \non the committee--many of them recognize the need to look for alternate \napproaches for delivering services to military families but doing so in \na way that can save resources that could be used for operations and \nmaintenance, for training, equipment--all the critical needs we are \nseeing much more clearly at this moment.\n  So we have proposed--and I support the chairman's proposal--to try a \npilot program for commissaries that would be run by commercial \nentities. I think there is merit to this proposal. I want to emphasize \nthat it is a pilot program. It is not a wholesale replacement of the \ncommissary system. It is designed to test in real time whether a \ncommercial entity can effectively use the resources and the operation \nof the commissary to better serve military personnel.\n  We have come a long way from years ago when the commissary was \npractically the only place a servicemember could get groceries or get \nthe supplies they need for their home. Today, go outside any military \nbase and you will see a Target, a Walmart, and every other combination \nof stores. Frankly, our young soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \nare used to going there. They are used to going to both places looking \nfor bargains. They are used to the service. This is no longer the \nisolated military of decades ago where literally the only place you \ncould shop was the commissary, and I think we have to recognize that.\n  The other thing we have to recognize is that there is now an interest \nby many grocery chains to test this model, to see if, in fact, they can \ndeliver better services to military personnel.\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\n  I think that test should be made. That is the essence of the proposal \nwithin the Armed Services Committee mark. There is an ongoing study of \nthis by the Department of Defense which I think is helpful. Part of the \nconclusion is this: ``The Department is critically assessing the \nprivatization of all portion(s) of the commissary system.'' I will \nemphasize that this amendment does not support the privatization of all \ncommissary systems at this time; they are looking at that issue. \n``Initial conversations with interested business entities informed the \nDepartment of private sector willingness to engage, which is leading to \nmore thorough market analysis, including a more formal Request for \nInformation.'' This request was issued in May, just a few weeks ago.\n  I think we are now positioned to move forward and test this model, \nand that is what we are asking for--a pilot test. It is sensible. It is \nlimited. We will learn quite quickly and very effectively whether this \nmodel works and what its potential is. I think in that process, too, we \ncan conduct it in such a way that we will be able to structure, if it \nis a valuable enterprise, relationships between commercial entities \nthat not only protect military personnel but enhance their experience \nat the commissary. That is the goal. It is not just to save dollars--\nthat is important--but also to make sure that their experience in the \ncommissary is both adequate and, in effect, more than adequate.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to Senator Durbin's amendment very \nquickly. I support this amendment. The reason I do is not only because \nof the eloquence of the Senator from Illinois about the success of this \nprogram. But how we got here, as described by my colleague, to me, is a \ncrucial point. It is a combination of history, of rules, of budgeting \n20-plus years ago. But in the interim we have been able to create a \nuseful medical research enterprise which I think will be dismantled--\nnot intentionally. That is not the intent of the chairman or of any of \nthe supporters of this provision in the bill. In fact, as the chairman \nsaid, he would stand up and support reallocating these funds someplace \nelse. My colleague from South Carolina suggested, I believe, NIH. But \nif we look at how difficult it is to fund the Health and Human Services \nbudget here--and this is what drives it--the reality is if these funds \nare taken out of this bill, they will not reappear, even through the \nbest and sincere efforts of many of my colleagues, elsewhere. We will \nlose this funding, and we will lose hugely valuable resources.\n  As to the whole issue with certification by the Secretary of Defense, \nif we step back, this research has been so effective, and there is a \nlinkage to every military member. It might not be as dramatic as a \nprosthesis to fix someone who lost their limb in combat, but certainly \ntheir wife, their child--pediatric diseases--may be affected. This \nresearch affects every American.\n  For those reasons, I am going to support Senator Durbin's amendment. \nHe has stated the case very well about unintended overhead caused by \nthe certification process and all of the related issues. But I think \nthe essence here is we have a valuable national resource that through \nthe history and the bureaucratic and congressional procedures and \npolicies has been embedded in the Defense Department. If we do not \nsupport Senator Durbin's amendment, we will lose that. We won't \nrecapture it elsewhere in another spending bill or in another \nauthorization bill. I just think it is too much to lose.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 5 minutes, and the majority \nhas 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reed for his comments in \nsupport of my amendment. This is about medical research, and if I have \na passion for the subject, I do. Certainly, I believe most of us do.\n  There comes a point in your life where you get a diagnosis or news \nabout someone you love, and you pray to goodness that there has been \nsome research to develop a drug or a procedure or a device which gives \nthem a chance for life.\n  Do I want to invest more money in medical research so that there are \nmore chances for life? You bet I do. And I believe our highest priority \nshould be the men and women in uniform and their families and our \nveterans. That is why I will stand here today and defend this \nDepartment of Defense medical research program for as long as I have \nbreath in my lungs. I believe it is essential that once we have made \nthe promise to men and women in uniform, we stand by them and we keep \nour word, and our word means standing by medical research.\n  Some have made light of issues being investigated under medical \nresearch--not anyone on the floor today, but others.\n  Prostate cancer. What are they doing investigating prostate cancer at \nthe Department of Defense? Servicemembers are twice as likely to \ndevelop prostate cancer as those who don't serve in the military. Why? \nI don't know the answer. Is it worth the research to answer that \nquestion? Of course it is.\n  Alzheimer's and Department of Defense medical research. For the men \nand women who served our country and have experienced a traumatic brain \ninjury, their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is much higher. \nFor those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, the risk is \nalso higher. So, as to Alzheimer's research at the Department of \nDefense, here is the reason.\n  Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS. We sure know that one; don't we? \nAccording to the ALS Association, military veterans are twice as likely \nto be diagnosed with ALS relative to the general population. Why? \nShould we ask the question? Do we owe it to the men and women in \nuniform to ask this question about ALS? We certainly do.\n  Lung cancer. Of course there is too much smoking in the military and \nthat is part of the reason, but the incidence is higher.\n  Gulf war illness. It wasn't until the Department of Defense initiated \nits research that we finally linked up why so many gulf war veterans \nwere coming home sick. Now we are treating them, as we should.\n  There is traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, epilepsy, and \nseizure. The list goes on. To walk away from this research is to walk \naway from our promise to the men and women in uniform, their families, \nand our veterans. I am not going to stand for that. I hope the majority \nof the Senate will support my effort to eliminate this language that \nhas been put into the Department of Defense authorization bill, and say \nto the chairman, once and for all: Stop this battle against medical \nresearch. There are many ways to save money in the Department of \nDefense. Let's not do it at the expense of medical research and at the \nexpense of the well-being of the men and women who serve our country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 34 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as to the Durbin amendment, I want people \nto understand what we are trying to do.\n  There is $900 million spent on medical research in the Department of \nDefense. All we are asking is that the money being spent be related to \nthe defense needs of this country. Of that $900 million, probably two \nthirds of the research money will not pass the test of being related to \nthe Defense Department.\n  If you care about the men and women in uniform--which we all do--that \nis probably $600 million or $700 million to help a military that is in \ndecline.\n  In terms of research dollars, I have worked with Senators Durbin, \nAlexander, and Blunt to increase NIH funding. This idea of taking money \nout of the Defense Department's budget to do medical research unrelated \nto the defense needs of this country needs to stop because the military \nis under siege. We have the smallest Navy since 1915 and the smallest \nArmy since 1940. If we really want to reform the way things are done up \nhere, this is a good start.\n  To those programs that don't make the cut in DOD, we will have to \nfind another place. If they make sense, I will help you find another \nplace. To those medical research items that survive the cut, they are \ngoing to have to\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\ngo through the normal contracting procedure to make sure we are doing \nit competitively.\n  I don't think that is too much to ask. If you want things to change \nin Washington, somebody has to start the process of change. It is long \noverdue to stop spending money in the Department of Defense's budget \nfor things unrelated to the Department of Defense, even though many of \nthem are worthy.\n  The point we are trying to make is that our military needs every \ndollar it can get, and we need to look at the way we are doing business \nanew. That is exactly what this bill does, and Senator Durbin takes us \nback to the old way of doing it.\n  Finally, the whole idea of medical research in the Department of \nDefense budget started with a $20 million earmark for breast cancer \nthat is now $900 million. Why? Because if you can make it into DOD's \nbill, you are going to get your program funded. It is not about medical \nresearch. It is about the power of somebody to get the medical research \nprogram in the budget of the Department of Defense. It is not a merit-\nbased process. It needs to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will conclude.\n  I would just say to my friend from South Carolina that I have gone \nthrough a long list of research projects at the Department of Defense \nand their medical research program, and each and every one of them I \nhave linked up to medical families and peculiar circumstances affecting \nour military. That is why I think this Department of Defense medical \nresearch is so critical.\n  I have yet to hear the other side say that one of these is wasteful, \nand they can't. If our men and women in uniform are suffering from gulf \nwar illnesses, of course we want the Department of Defense or any other \nmedical research group to try to find out what is the cause of the \nproblem and what we can do about it.\n  When it comes to the incidents of cancer being higher among veterans, \nare you worried about that? I sure am. Why would it be? Should we ask \nthat question? Of course we should. And we do that through legitimate \nmedical research.\n  Here is what the Institute of Medicine said about this medical \nresearch program: It ``has shown that it has been an efficiently \nmanaged and scientifically productive effort and that it is a valuable \ncomponent of the nation's health research enterprise.''\n  This is not wasted money. This is medical research for the men and \nwomen in uniform, their families, and the veterans who served this \ncountry. I will stand here and fight for it every minute. To those who \nsay we will strengthen our military if we do less medical research on \nbehalf of the men and women in uniform and veterans, that doesn't make \nus a stronger military.\n  Let us keep our word to the men and women in uniform and to the \nveterans. We have told them we would stand behind them when they came \nhome, and we have to keep our word.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of 147 organizations that support \nthe Durbin amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n    groups opposing sections 756/898 & supporting durbin amdt #4369\n\n       Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Action to Cure Kidney \n     Cancer, Adult Congenital Heart Association, Alliance for \n     Lupus Research/Lupus Research Institute, ALS Association, \n     Alzheimer's Association, American Academy of Dermatology \n     Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \n     Association for Cancer Research, American Association for \n     Dental Research, American Association of Clinical Urologists, \n     American Brain Tumor Association, American Cancer Society \n     Cancer Action Network, American Congress of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists, American Dental Association, American Diabetes \n     Association, American Gastroenterological Association, \n     American Heart Association, American Lung Association, \n     American Psychological Association.\n       American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, American \n     Society of Nephrology, American Thoracic Society, American \n     Urological Association, Aplastic Anemia and MDS International \n     Foundation, Arthritis Foundation, Association of American \n     Cancer Institutes, Association of American Medical Colleges, \n     Association of American Universities, Association of Public \n     and Land-grant Universities, Asbestos Disease Awareness \n     Organization, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, \n     Autism Speaks, AVAC: Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention, \n     Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network, Cancer Support Community, \n     Caring Together New York, Children's Heart Foundation, \n     Children's Tumor Foundation, Citizens United for Research in \n     Epilepsy (CURE), Coalition for National Security Research \n     (CNSR), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Colon Cancer Alliance, \n     Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, CureHHT.\n       Debbie's Dream Foundation: Curing Stomach Cancer, Digestive \n     Disease National Coalition, Duke University, Duke University \n     School of Medicine, Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, \n     Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Endocrine \n     Society, Esophageal Cancer Action Network, Inc., Fight \n     Colorectal Cancer, FORCE: Facing Our Risk of Cancer \n     Empowered, Foundation for Women's Cancer, Foundation to \n     Eradicate Duchenne, Georgetown University, GBS/CIDP \n     Foundation International, Hartford HealthCare Center, \n     Hepatitis Foundation International, HIV Medicine Association, \n     Hydrocephalus Association, Indiana University, Infectious \n     Diseases Society of America, International Foundation for \n     Functional GI Disorders, International Myeloma Foundation.\n       Interstitial Cystitis Association, Johns Hopkins \n     University, Kidney Cancer Association, LAM Foundation, \n     Lineberger Clinic Cancer Center at the University of North \n     Carolina, Littlest Tumor Foundation, Living Beyond Breast \n     Cancer, Lung Cancer Alliance, Lupus Foundation of America, \n     Lymphangiomatosis & Gorham's Disease Alliance, Lymphoma \n     Research Foundation, Malecare Cancer Support, Melanoma \n     Research Foundation, The Michael J.

Mr. President, due to a prior commitment, I regret \nI was not present to vote on Senate amendment No. 4369, offered by \nSenator Durbin. I am a cosponsor of this amendment, and had I been \npresent, I would have voted in support of the amendment. The CDMRP has \nproduced breakthroughs in treatment for a variety of diseases and \nmedical conditions, and it deserves our continued support.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, in relation to the Inhofe amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a year ago, when we were considering this \nsame bill, the language of the bill that was presented to us had a \npilot program that would temporarily look at privatizing five \ncommissaries. We elected not to do that.\n  We had an amendment at that time with 25 cosponsors, and it was not \nnecessary to actually have a rollcall vote, and it overwhelmingly was \npassed that we would not do that until we had a study of DOD with an \nassessment by GAO on privatization. That has not happened yet. The \ninitial report came out from GAO and it is negative on having the \nprivatization language at this point.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the key aspect of this legislation that \nwas included in the committee mark is that it is a pilot, and I \nbelieve, along with the chairman, this is the best way to evaluate the \nmerits or demerits of privatization of commissaries.\n  It will allow an evaluation that is not theoretical, not a report but \nan actual company actively engaged in running a facility. The goal is \nnot just to maintain the commissaries, the goal is to enhance the value \nof service to men and women. I think, along with the chairman, this \napproach is an appropriate approach and would do just that.\n  I urge rejection of the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 7 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have 40 cosponsors. I advise each \nSenator to look at the cosponsors before voting on this. However, I \nwould have no objection to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the Inhofe amendment No. 4204.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 70, nays 28, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 91 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--70\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Barrasso\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Booker\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Capito\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Cornyn\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gardner\n     Gillibrand\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Inhofe\n     Kaine\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Lankford\n     Leahy\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Peters\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Sullivan\n     Tester\n     Tillis\n     Udall\n     Vitter\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--28\n\n     Carper\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Corker\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Ernst\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Graham\n     Hoeven\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     King\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Paul\n     Perdue\n     Portman\n     Reed\n     Risch\n     Sasse\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Sanders\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 4204) was agreed to.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, due to a prior commitment, I regret \nI was not present to vote on Senate amendment No. 4204, offered by \nSenator Inhofe. I am a cosponsor of this amendment, and had I been \npresent, I would have voted in support of the amendment. It would be \nimprudent for Congress to authorize this privatization, possibly \njeopardizing an important benefit for our military men and women, their \nfamilies, as well as retired servicemembers, before receiving the \nthorough study on the potential impacts as requested in last year's \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that we are \ntrying to set up the amendment and second-degree amendment on the \nincrease of an authorization of $17 billion. It is my understanding \nthere will also be a second-degree amendment.\n  I just want to say a few words about the amendment which is pending. \nWe\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nwere trying to reach an agreement as to when we will have debate and \nvote on both the second degree and the amendment itself.\n  I would point out that the unfunded requirements of the military \nservices total $23 billion for the next fiscal year alone. \nSequestration threatens to return in 2018, taking away another $100 \nbillion from our military. The amendment would increase defense \nspending by $18 billion.\n  I will be pleased to go through all of the programs where there is \nincreased spending, but I would point out that those increases were in \nthe 5-year defense plan but were cut because of the authorization of \n$17 billion--the President's request of $17 billion from what we had \nlast year.\n  From a quick glance around the world, I think we can certainly make \none understand that the world is not a safer place than it was last \nyear. We are cutting into readiness, maintenance, and all kinds of \nproblems are beginning to arise in the military.\n  My friend from Rhode Island and I will be discussing and debating \nboth the second-degree amendment and the amendment, and hopefully we \nwill have votes either tomorrow or on Thursday, depending on \nnegotiations between the leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I thank and commend the chairman. As he \nindicated, he has proposed an amendment, and he is also allowing us to \nprepare a second-degree amendment, which I would like to offer as soon \nas it is ready and then conduct debate on a very important topic; that \nis, investing in our national security in the broadest sense and doing \nit wisely and well. Then, I would hope again--subject to the \ndeliberations of the leaders on both sides--that we could have a vote \non both the underlying amendment and the second-degree amendment \ntomorrow or the succeeding day.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for not only bringing this issue to the \nfloor but also for giving us the opportunity to prepare an appropriate \namendment.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I understand that the Senator from \nOklahoma and the Senator from New Mexico are interested in getting \nnoncontroversial legislation up and completed. I am more than pleased \nto yield time from our discussion of the Defense authorization bill for \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator would yield, I would appreciate that very \nmuch. We are talking about the TSCA bill, and it is one that is almost \na must-pass type of bill. We have support on both sides--I think almost \ntotal support. If we could have another 10 minutes to talk to a couple \nof people, I would like to make that motion.\n  If you could, go ahead and talk about the Defense bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. When he gets ready, we \nwill obviously be ready to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for \nconsideration of that important legislation.\n  In the meantime, I would like to point out that, as part of this \npackage of $18 billion, it increases the military pay raise to 2.1 \npercent. The current administration's budget request sets pay raises at \n1.6 percent.\n  It fully funds troops in Afghanistan at 9,800. The budget request of \nthe President funds troop levels at 6,217.\n  It stops the cuts to end strength and capacity. It restores the end \nstrength for Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. For example, it \ncancels the planned reduction of 15,000 active Army soldiers. If the \nplanned reduction actually was implemented, we would have one of the \nsmallest armies in history, certainly in recent history.\n  It funds the recommendations of the National Commission on the Future \nof the Army. It includes additional funding for purchasing 36 \nadditional UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, 5 AH-64 Apaches, and 5 CH-47 \nChinook helicopters. I would point out that all of those were in \nkeeping with the recommendations of the National Commission on the \nFuture of the Army.\n  It adds $2.2 billion to readiness to help alleviate problems each of \nthe military services are grappling with. Of the $23 billion in \nunfunded requirements received by the military services, almost $7 \nbillion of it was identified as readiness related.\n  It addresses the Navy's ongoing strike fighter shortfall and the U.S. \nMarine Corps aviation readiness crisis by increasing aircraft \nprocurement. It addresses high priority unfunded requirements for the \nNavy and Marine Corps, including 14 F/A-18 Super Hornets and 11 F-35 \nJoint Strike Fighters.\n  It supports the Navy shipbuilding program, and it provides the \nbalance of funding necessary to fully fund the additional fiscal year \n2016 DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. It restores the cut of the \none littoral combat ship in fiscal year 2017.\n  It supports the European Reassurance Initiative with the \nmanufacturing and modernization of 14 M1 Abrams tanks and 14 M2 Bradley \nfighting vehicles.\n  There is also increased support for Israeli cooperation on air \ndefense programs of some $200 million.\n  What this is is an effort to make up for the shortfall that would \nbring us up to last year's number--last year's. Again, I want to point \nout--and we will talk more about it--we have all kinds of initiatives \ngoing on. We have an increase in troops' presence in Iraq and Syria; we \nare having much more participation in the European reassurance program; \nand there is more emphasis on our rebalancing in Asia. At the same \ntime, we are cutting defense and making it $17 billion lower than the \nmilitary needed and planned for last year.\n  I hope that my colleagues would understand and appreciate the need, \nparticularly when we look at the deep cuts and consequences of \nreductions in readiness, training, and other of the intangibles that \nmake the American military the great organization--superior to all \npotential adversaries--that it is.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at what we are proposing for tomorrow. \nI know the other side will have a second-degree amendment as well. I \nhaven't seen it, but I would be pleased to give it utmost \nconsideration, depending on its contents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, after Memorial Day and a day after the \n72nd anniversary of D-day and at a time when we live in a more and more \ndangerous world with threats from North Korea, China, Russia, and ISIS, \nit is appropriate that we are on the floor talking about our military, \ntalking about helping our troops, and doing so by strengthening our \nmilitary.\n  Senator McCain, who is the chairman of the committee, just talked \nabout the fact that there is a pay raise here. There is also an \nassurance to our military that we are not going to have the kind of end \nstrength that puts us in more peril.\n  I applaud him and I applaud Senator Reed for their work on this bill. \nI intend to support this bill, and I hope we continue to make progress \nthis week on it.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Madam President, I am up today to talk about something different. It \nis another fight that we have, and that is with this terrible epidemic \nof heroin and prescription drugs. We now have a situation where 129 \npeople on average are dying every single day. We have in my home State \nof Ohio and around the country epidemic levels not just of heroin and \nprescription drugs but now fentanyl, which is a synthetic form of \nheroin. It is affecting every community and every State.\n  This is the eighth time I have come on the floor to talk about this \nissue since the Senate passed their legislation on March 10--every week \nwe have been in session since then. Initially, I came to encourage the \nHouse to act and urge them to move on it. They did that a couple weeks \nago. Now I am urging the House and the Senate to come together because \nwe have some differences in our two approaches to this, but for the \nmost part we have commonality. There is common ground on how to deal \nwith this issue: more prevention and education, better treatment and \nrecovery, helping our law enforcement to be able to deal with it.\n  My message is very simple. We know what is in the House bill. We know \nwhat is in the Senate bill. We are starting to work together to find a \nway to come together. That is good. We need\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\nto do that as soon as possible. This isn't like other issues we address \non the floor, with all due respect. This is an emergency back home. \nThis is one we know the Federal Government can be a better partner with \nState and local governments and with nonprofits. The Presiding Officer \nhas been very involved in this issue over time. When we go home, we \nhear about it. This affects every single State. That is why we had a \n94-to-1 vote in this Chamber. That never happens around here. We were \non the floor for 2\\1/2\\ weeks, and by the end of the debate practically \nevery single Senator who voted said this is a key issue back home. I \nlike this bill because it is comprehensive, it is common sense. We need \nto support it. There is a real crisis out there, and this is a \ngenuinely comprehensive solution to the crisis. We have the common \nground. We need to move forward and do so soon.\n  In 88 days, since the Senate passed the legislation on March 10, more \nthan 10,000 Americans--10,000 Americans--have died of drug overdoses \nfrom opioids. That doesn't include the hundreds of thousands of others \nwho have not died from an overdose but are casualties. They have lost a \njob. They have broken their relationship with their family, with loved \nones. They have been driven to pay for drugs by going to crime. They \nhave lost hope. There are now an estimated 200,000 in Ohio who are \nsuffering from addiction to heroin and prescription drugs. That is the \nsize of the city of Akron, OH, a major city in my State. It is urgent. \nPeople understand it. There is a new poll showing that 3 in 10 Ohioans \nknow someone struggling with an opioid addiction. They know people--\ntheir family members, their friends, their coworkers, their fellow \nparishioners, their neighbors--who are experiencing the consequences we \ntalked about a moment ago: a lost job, time in prison, broken \nrelationships, communities being devastated. All they have to do is \nopen the newspaper to be reminded of it. Every day the headlines tell \nthe story of families torn apart because of addiction.\n  Since my last speech on the floor about 2 weeks ago, there is more \nbad news from my State of Ohio. Two weeks ago, a 41-year-old man and \nhis 19-year-old daughter, both from Ohio, were arrested together buying \nheroin. The same day, a 26-year-old man was found dead of an overdose \nnear a creek in Lemon Township in Butler County. Last Thursday, in \nSteubenville, police seized 100 grams of heroin from one man. I told \nthe story 2 weeks ago of Annabella, a 14-month-old from Columbus who \ndied at a drug house after ingesting her mother's fentanyl-laced \nheroin. Last Thursday, a 29-year-old man in Columbus was sentenced to 9 \nyears in prison after his 11-month-old son, Dominic, ingested his \nfather's fentanyl and died.\n  Ohioans know this is happening, and we are taking action back home. \nState troopers in Ohio will soon be carrying naloxone with them, which \nis a miracle drug that can actually reverse the effects of an overdose. \nOur legislation provides more training for naloxone, also called \nNarcan. It also provides more grant opportunities for law enforcement. \nIt is one reason the Fraternal Order of Police has been very supportive \nof our legislation and provided us valuable input as we were crafting \nit. In Ohio, last year alone, first responders administered Narcan \n16,000 times, saving thousands of lives.\n  Our Governor, John Kasich, is conducting an awareness campaign in \nOhio called ``Start Talking.'' The National Guard is helping out. They \nare conducting 113 events across Ohio, reaching more than 30,000 high \nschool students to talk about drugs and opioid addiction. I am told 65 \nNational Guard members have partnered with 28 law enforcement agencies \non counterdrug efforts. They have helped confiscate more than $6 \nmillion in drugs already, including 235 pounds of heroin, 20 pounds of \nfentanyl, and 26 pounds of opiate pills.\n  CARA would create a national awareness campaign--we think this is \nincredibly important--including making this connection between \nprescription drugs, narcotic pain pills, and heroin. Four out of five \nheroin addicts in Ohio started with prescription drugs. This is not \nincluded in the House-passed legislation, as one example of something \nwe want to add, but I think it is critical we include it in the final \nbill we ultimately send to the President's desk and ultimately out to \nour community so this message can begin to resonate to let people know \nthey should not be getting into this addiction--this funnel of \naddiction--that is so difficult.\n  We are taking action in Ohio, but back in Ohio they want the Federal \nGovernment to be a better partner, and we can be through this \nlegislation. In Cleveland, the Cuyahoga county executive, Armond \nBudish, and the County medical examiner, Dr. Thomas Gilson, last week \nasked the Federal Government to be a better partner with them. I agree \nwith them. They support our legislation. So do 160 of the national \ngroups--everybody who has worked with us over the years to come up with \nthis nonpartisan approach. It is based on what works. It is based on \nactual evidence of the treatment that works, the recovery programs that \nwork, the prevention that works.\n  In Cleveland, OH, it is not hard to see why. One hundred forty people \nhave died of fentanyl overdoses so far this year--record levels. \nFentanyl is even more potent than heroin. Depending on the \nconcentration, it can be 50 or more times more powerful than heroin. \nForty-four people died of opioid overdoses in Cleveland in just the \nmonth of May--44 in 1 month, just 1 month, in one city. That includes \none 6-day span when 13 people died of overdoses; 18 of those 44 lived \nin the city of Cleveland, 26 lived in the suburbs. This knows no ZIP \nCode. It is not isolated to one area. It is not isolated to rural or \nsuburban or inner city. It is everywhere. No one is immune, and no one \nis unaffected by this epidemic.\n  People across the country are talking about it more in the last \ncouple weeks. One reason we are talking about it is because of the \npremature death of Prince, a world-renowned recording artist whose 58th \nbirthday would have been celebrated yesterday. Based on the autopsy of \nPrince, we now know he died of a fentanyl overdose.\n  Fentanyl is driving more of this epidemic every day. As I said, in \n2013, there were 84 fentanyl overdose deaths in Ohio. The next year it \nwas 503. Sadly, this year it is going to be more than that. The new \ninformation about the overdose that took Prince's life has surprised \nsome. After all, Prince had it all: success, fame, talent, and fortune. \nHe was an amazingly talented musician, but as Paul Wax, the executive \ndirector of the American College of Medical Toxicology, put it, ``This \nepidemic spares no one. It affects the wealthy, the poor, the \nprominent, and the not prominent.'' He is exactly right. This epidemic \nknows no limits.\n  In a way, as this becomes known, it may help get rid of the stigma \nattached to addiction that is keeping so many people from coming \nforward and getting the treatment they need as people understand it is \neverywhere. It affects our neighbors and friends regardless of our \nstation in life or where we live. It happens to grandmothers. It \nhappens to teenagers who just had their wisdom teeth taken out. It \nhappens to the homeless, and it happens to the rich and famous.\n  Prince is hardly the first celebrity case of opioid addiction. \nCelebrities like Chevy Chase and Jamie Lee Curtis have been brave \nenough to open up and talk about their struggles, and I commend them \nfor that. The former Cleveland Browns wide receiver, Josh Cribbs, \nrecently told ESPN:\n\n       I grew up in the football atmosphere, and to me it's just \n     part of the game. Unfortunately, it's ingrained within the \n     players to have to deal with this, and it's almost as if \n     that's part of it. After the game, you are popping pills to \n     get back to normal, to feel normal. The pills are second \n     nature to us. They're given to us just to get through the \n     day. . . . The pills are part of the game.\n\n  I am hopeful that if any good can come out of tragedies like Prince's \npremature death, it can be that we raise awareness about this epidemic \nand prevent new addictions from starting. Prevention is ultimately \ngoing to be the best way to turn the tide.\n  The House-passed legislation does not include CARA's expanded \nprevention grants, which address local drug crises and are focused on \nour young people, but I am hopeful again that ultimately that will be \nincluded in the bill we send to the President's desk and to our \ncommunities.\n  I know the scope of this epidemic can feel overwhelming at times, but \nthere is hope. Prevention can work, treatment can work, and it does \nwork.\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n  Think about Jeff Knight from the suburbs of Cleveland. He was an \nentrepreneur. He started a small landscaping business when he was just \n21 years old. The business grew and grew. He was successful. He had \nmore than a dozen employees. Then, at age 27, he was prescribed \nPercocet. Percocet. He became addicted. His tolerance increased so he \nswitched to OxyContin. When the pills were too expensive or he couldn't \nfind enough pills, he switched to heroin because it was less expensive \nand more accessible. He started selling cocaine and Percocet to buy \nmore heroin. The drugs became everything, which is what I hear from so \nmany of our recovering addicts. The drugs became everything, pulling \nthem away from their families, their job, and their God-given purpose \nin life.\n  Within 3 years, Jeff Knight lost everything. He lost his business, he \nlost his relationship with his family, and he was arrested, but there \nhe got treatment, and through a drug court program he got sober. He \nmoved into a sober-living facility where there was supervision, \naccountability, and support from his peers. Again, as we are looking at \nthese programs around the country and we are holding up those best \npractices, we want to fund those best practices that have that kind of \nsupport, not just the treatment but the strong recovery programs.\n  Jeff has now been clean for 3 years. He still has that same \nentrepreneurial spirit, and he is using it now to help others. He \nactually has bought several houses in Cleveland, which he has now \nturned into sober housing for men who are addicted--all because he got \ntreatment and he was in a good recovery program, which he is now \npermitting others to appreciate.\n  Nine out of ten of those who need treatment aren't getting it right \nnow, we are told. CARA--the Senate-passed bill--and the House bills \nboth provide more help for the type of treatment programs and recovery \nthat work. If we can get a comprehensive bill to the President, we can \nhelp more people who are struggling to get treatment, and we can give \nthem more hope. It is time to act, and act quickly, to find common \nground and get a comprehensive bill in place now so we can begin to \nhelp the millions who are struggling.\n  Again, I appreciate the Presiding Officer's efforts in this regard. I \nask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to promote our \nleadership to move forward, get this conference resolved, get it to the \nPresident's desk, and begin to help our constituents back home, all of \nwhom deserve our attention on this critical issue and this epidemic \nthat is affecting every community.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Federal Chemical Regulation Legislation\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, Milton Friedman once said that if you give \nthe Federal Government control of the Sahara Desert, within 5 years \nthere will be a shortage of sand. I tend to agree, and it worries me \nanytime a consensus builds to federalize anything.\n  I have spent the last week reading this bill, this sweeping Federal \ntakeover of chemical regulations, and I am now more worried than I was \nbefore I read the bill. Most worrisome, beyond the specifics, is the \ncreeping infestation of the business community with the idea that the \nargument is no longer about minimizing regulations but about making \nregulations regular. Businesses seem to just want uniformity of \nregulation as opposed to minimization of regulation.\n  A good analogy is that of how businesses respond to malingerers who \nfake slip-and-fall injuries. Some businesses choose to limit expenses \nby just paying out small amounts, but some brave businesses choose to \nlegally defend themselves against all nuisance claims. Federalizing the \nchemical regulations is like settling with the slip-and-fall \nmalingerers and hoping he or she will keep their extortion at a \nreasonable level.\n  In the process, though, we have abandoned principle. We will have \ngiven up the State laboratories where economic success and regulatory \nrestraint are aligned. It is no accident that regulatory restraint \noccurs in States that host chemical companies and ensures that State \nlegislatures will be well aware that the economic impact of overbearing \nregulation will be felt in their State. As a consequence, there is a \nback-and-forth and consideration both of the environment and health of \nthe economy.\n  Federalization of regulations separates the people who benefit from a \nsuccessful chemical industry from the unelected bureaucrats who will \nwrite the regulations. Once you sever the ties, once there is no \nincentive, once nobody cares about the jobs anymore, the tendency is to \nregulate and to overregulate. Once that tie is severed, the joint \nincentive to minimize regulation is lost. In fact, this legislation \nexplicitly bans the consideration of a regulation's economic cost when \ndeciding whether chemicals will be put into a high-risk category. Once \na chemical has been labeled ``high risk,'' the legal liability and \nstigma that will attach will effectively ban the substance without the \neffect on the economy ever being considered. Regardless of what the \nfinal regulations actually say, the subsequent public reaction and \nlawsuits will have the effect of driving the chemical out of the market \nif it is considered to be a high-risk chemical.\n\n  If we are to ignore the cost of regulations, if we are to ignore the \nrelationship between regulations and job loss, there is basically no \nlimit to the fervor and ferocity that will be unleashed by bureaucrats \nwhose perpetual mandate is to regulate.\n  I always thought we needed more balance, not less, in deciding on new \nregulations. I always thought we should balance the environment and the \neconomy. Instead of balancing the economic effects and the \nenvironmental effects, this bill explicitly says to regulators that \ntheir goal is to regulate, period. This bill explicitly states that the \neconomic impact of regulations is only considered after the EPA has \ndecided to regulate, after a substance has been categorized as high \nrisk. Is this really the best we can do?\n  Sometimes I wonder if we deserve the government we get. When the \nbusiness community gets together and seeks Federal regulations, I \nwonder: Have they not paid any attention to what is going on in \nWashington? Are they unaware of the devastating explosion of Federal \nregulations? Are they unaware that today's overbearing regulations were \nyesterday's benign advisories? Everything starts out nice and easy: We \nare not going to overregulate you. But it never goes down; it always \nratchets up. Are they unaware that the most benign and well-intended \nregulations of the 1970s are now written and rewritten by a President \nmad with regulatory zeal?\n  For those who are unaware of the devastation the EPA has wreaked upon \nour people, I request that you come and visit us in Eastern Kentucky. \nCome and visit us in West Virginia. The EPA's War on Coal has spread a \ntrail of despair amongst a proud people. Many of these counties have \nunemployment over twice the national average.\n  The regulations that are crippling and destroying our jobs in \nKentucky were not passed by Congress; these job-killing regulations are \nmonsters that emerged from the toxic swamp of Big Government \nbureaucrats at the EPA. The Obama-Clinton War on Coal largely came from \nregulations that were extensions of seemingly bland, well-intended laws \nin the early 1970s, laws like the Clean Water Act that were well-\nintended, legislating that you can't discharge pollutants into a \nnavigable stream. I am for that, but somehow the courts and the \nbureaucrats came to decide that dirt was a pollutant and your backyard \nmight have a nexus to a puddle that has a nexus to a ditch that was \nfrequented by a migratory bird that once flew from the Great Lakes, so \nyour backyard is the same as the Great Lakes now. It has become obscene \nand absurd, but it was all from well-intentioned, reasonable \nregulations that have gotten out of control. Now the EPA can jail you \nfor putting dirt on your own land. Robert Lucas was given 10 years in \nprison for putting dirt on his own land.\n  Now, since that craziness has infected the EPA, we now have the Feds\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\nasserting regulatory control over the majority of the land in the \nStates.\n  Will the Federal takeover of the chemical regulations eventually \nmorph into a war on chemical companies, similar to what happened to the \ncoal industry? I don't know, but it concerns me enough to examine the \nbill closely.\n  Anytime we are told that everyone is for something, anytime we are \ntold that we should stand aside and not challenge the status quo, I \nbecome suspicious that it is precisely the time someone needs to look \nvery closely at what is happening.\n  I also worry about Federal laws that preempt State laws. Admittedly, \nsometimes States, such as California, go overboard and they regulate \nbusinesses out of existence or at least chase them to another State. \nHowever, California's excess is Texas's benefit.\n  I grew up along the Texas coast. Many of my family members work in \nthe chemical industry. Texas has become a haven because of its location \nand its reasonable regulations.\n  Because Texas and Louisiana have such a mutually beneficial \nrelationship with the chemical industry, it is hard to imagine a time \nwhen the Texas or the Louisiana Legislature would vote to overregulate \nor to ignore the cost of new regulations. It is not in their best \ninterest. But it is much easier to imagine a time when 47 other States \ngang up on Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma to ratchet up a Federal \nregulatory regime to the point at which it chokes and suffocates \nbusinesses and their jobs. Think it can't happen? Come and visit me in \nKentucky. Come and see the devastation. Come and see the unemployment \nthat has come from EPA's overzealous regulation.\n  How can it be that the very businesses that face this threat support \nthis bill, support the federalization of regulation? I am sure they are \nsincere. They want uniformity and predictability--admirable desires. \nThey don't want the national standard of regulations to devolve to the \nworst standard of regulations. California regulators--yes, I am talking \nabout you. Yet the bill before us grandfathers in California's \noverbearing regulations. It only prevents them from getting worse.\n  But everyone must realize that this bill also preempts friendly \nStates, such as Texas and Louisiana, from continuing to be friendly \nStates. As Federal regulations gradually or quickly grow, Texas and \nLouisiana will no longer be able to veto the excesses of Washington. \nRegulations that would never pass the Texas or Louisiana State \nLegislature will see limited opposition in Washington. Don't believe \nme? Come and see me in Kentucky and see the devastation the EPA has \nwrought in my State.\n  So why in the world would businesses come to Washington and want to \nbe regulated? Nothing perplexes me more or makes me madder than when \nbusinesses come to Washington to lobby for regulations. Unfortunately, \nit is becoming the norm, not the exception. Lately, the call to \nfederalize regulations has become a cottage industry for companies to \ncome to Washington and beg for Federal regulations to supersede \ntroublesome State regulations. It seems like every day businesses come \nto my office to complain about regulatory abuse, and then they come \nback later in the day and say: Oh, and by the way, can you vote for \nFederal regulations on my business because the State regulations are \nkilling me? But then a few years later, they come back--the same \nbusinesses--and they complain that the regulatory agencies are \nratcheting up the regulations.\n  Food distributors clamor for Federal regulations on labeling. \nRestaurants advocate for national menu standards. Now that we have \nFederal standards, lo and behold, we also have Federal menu crimes. You \ncan be imprisoned in America for posting the wrong calorie count on \nyour menu. I am not making this up. You can be put in prison for \nputting down the wrong calorie count. We have to be wary of giving more \npower to the Federal legislature.\n  With this bill, chemical companies lobby for Federal regulations to \npreempt State legislation. None of them seem concerned that the Federal \nregulations will preempt not only aggressive regulatory States, such as \nCalifornia, but also market-oriented States, friendly States, such as \nTexas and Louisiana. So the less onerous Federal regulations may \ninitially preempt overly zealous regulatory States, but when the \nFederal regulations evolve into a more onerous standard, which they \nalways have, there will no longer be any State laboratories left to \nexercise freedom. Texas and Louisiana will no longer be free to host \nchemical companies as the Federal agencies ratchet higher.\n  Proponents of the bill will say: Well, Texas and Louisiana can opt \nout; there is a waiver. Guess who has to approve the waiver. The head \nof the EPA. Anybody know of a recent head of the EPA friendly to \nbusiness who will give them a waiver on a Federal regulation? It won't \nwork.\n  The pro-regulation business community argues that they are being \noverwhelmed by State regulations, and I don't disagree. But what can be \ndone short of federalizing regulations? What about charging more in the \nStates that have the costly regulations? In Vermont, they have mandated \nGMO labeling, which will cost a fortune. Either quit selling to them or \njack up the price to make them pay for the labeling. Do you think the \nSocialists in Vermont might reconsider their laws if they have to pay \n$2 more for a Coke or for a Pepsi to pay for the absurd labeling?\n  What could chemical companies do to fight overzealous regulatory \nStates? What they already do--move to friendly States. If California \ninappropriately regulates your chemicals, charge them more and by all \nmeans, move. Get the heck out of California. Come to Kentucky. We would \nlove to have your business.\n  What these businesses that favor federalization of regulation fail to \nunderstand is that the history of Federal regulations is a dismal one. \nWell-intended, limited regulations morph into ill-willed, expansive, \nand intrusive regulations. What these businesses fail to grasp is that \nwhile States like California and Vermont may pass burdensome, expensive \nregulations, other States, like Texas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, are \nrelative havens for business. When businesses plead for Federal \nregulations to supersede ill-conceived regulations in California and \nVermont, they fail to understand that once regulations are centralized, \nthe history of regulations in Washington is only to grow. Just witness \nregulations in banking and health care. Does anyone remember ever \nseeing a limited, reasonable Federal standard that stayed limited and \nreasonable?\n  It is not new in Washington for businesses to lobby to be regulated. \nSome hospitals advocated for ObamaCare and now complain that it is \nbankrupting them. Some small banks advocated for Dodd-Frank \nregulations, and now they complain the regulators are assaulting them \nas well.\n  The bill before us gives the Administrator of the EPA the power to \ndecide at a later date how to and to what extent he or she will \nregulate the chemical industry. In fact, more than 100 times this bill \nleaves the discretionary authority to the EPA to make decisions on \ncreating new rules; 100 times it says the Administrator of the EPA \nshall at a later date decide how to regulate. That is a blank check to \nthe EPA. It is a mistake.\n  Does anyone want to hazard a guess as to how many pages of \nregulations will come from this bill? The current Code of Federal \nRegulations is 237 volumes and more than 178,000 pages. If ObamaCare is \nany guide, it will be at least 20 pages of regulations for every page \nof legislation. Using the ObamaCare standard, this bill will give us \nnearly 2,000 pages of regulations. ObamaCare was about 1,000 pages. The \nregulations from ObamaCare have morphed into nearly 20,000 pages. It is \nnot hard to see how this bill, which requires review of more than \n85,000 chemicals now on the market, could quickly eclipse that lofty \ntotal.\n  No one disputes that this bill increases the power of the EPA. This \nis an important point. No one disputes that this bill increases the \npower of the EPA. No one disputes that this bill transfers power from \nthe States to the Federal Government. The National Journal recognizes \nand describes this bill as granting extensive new authority to the \nEPA. If you don't think that is a problem, come to Kentucky and meet \nthe 16,000 people in my State who have lost their jobs because of the \noverregulatory nature of the EPA. Ask them what they think of Hillary \nClinton's plan to continue putting coal\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nminers out of business in my State. Ask them what they think of \ngranting extensive new authority to the EPA. Look these coal miners in \nthe face and tell them to trust you and that your bill will not \nincrease EPA's power. Tell them to trust you.\n\n  Is there anything in the recent history of regulatory onslaught that \nindicates a reasonable Federal standard will remain reasonable? When \nstarting out, everybody says that they are going to preempt these \nterrible States like California. It is going to preempt California and \nVermont and all of these terrible liberal States, and it will be a low \nlevel. Business was involved so business has made it a low and easy \nstandard for chemicals. It will be ratcheted up because regulations \nnever get better; they always get worse.\n  I rise today to oppose granting new power to the EPA. I wish we were \nhere today to do the opposite--to vote to restrain the EPA and make \nsure that they balance regulations and jobs. I wish we were here today \nto vote for the REINS Act that requires new regulations to be voted on \nby Congress before they become enforceable. Instead, this legislation \nwill inevitably add hundreds of new regulations.\n  I rise today to oppose this bill because it preempts the \nConstitution's intentions for the Federal Government.\n  I rise today to oppose this bill because the recent history of the \nEPA is one that has shown no balance, no quarter, and no concern for \nthousands of Kentuckians they have put out of work.\n  I rise today to oppose this bill because I can't in good conscience, \nas a Kentuckian, vote to make the Federal EPA stronger.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am prepared to make a unanimous consent \nrequest. I don't have the wording yet, but I will momentarily, so I \nwill not take the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, if I might make an inquiry about the order. \nSenator Whitehouse and I were about to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my colleague, the \nSenator from Rhode Island, to discuss one of the most important issues \nfacing future generations in our world, which is climate change, an \nissue that also directly affects both of our coastal and low-lying \nStates.\n  Many may know Delaware's status as the first State to ratify the \nConstitution, but I think few of my colleagues are aware that Delaware \nis also our country's lowest lying State. We have the lowest mean \nelevation. This status comes with certain challenges, especially with \nnearly 400 miles of exposed shoreline. That means no part of our State \nis more than 30 miles from the coast, so the good news is that no \nmatter where you live in my home State, it takes less than 30 minutes \nto get to sun and sand. But the challenge is that we are particularly \nvulnerable to the increasing effects of climate change.\n  In recent years, we have seen how flooding can devastate homes and \ncommunities up and down our State. Low-lying neighborhoods often don't \nhave the resources to cope with steadily increasing flooding. A \ncommunity such as Southbridge in Wilmington--pictured to my right--has \nbeen disproportionately affected.\n  Environmental justice has long been a concern of mine and of Senator \nWhitehouse. We had the opportunity to visit the neighborhood of \nSouthbridge. Southbridge is significantly flooded every time it rains \nmore than an inch or two. With subsidence, the steady sinking of the \nland, and with sea level rise acting in combination in my State, we \nwill simply see more and more challenges from severe flooding due to \nsea level rise around the globe and in my home State.\n  It is not just houses and neighborhoods that are threatened by sea \nlevel rise; it also affects businesses and entire industries. There is \na broad range of long-established industries and businesses in my State \nthat are placed in coastal areas because of the history of our \nsettlement and development. Somewhere between 15 and 25 percent of all \nthe land used for heavy industry in my State will likely be inundated \nby sea level rise by the end of the century, and that doesn't even \ninclude all of the other productive land use for agriculture and \ntourism that contribute to jobs and revenue in my home State.\n  Despite our small size and our significant exposure, we also punch \nabove our weight when it comes to tackling the challenges of climate \nchange. In places like Southbridge, our communities have come together \nat the State and local level to find creative solutions to cope with \nthe flooding that is increasingly caused by climate change. This image \ndemonstrates a plan that has been developed for the South Wilmington \nwetlands project. Senator Whitehouse may describe his visit to the \nState of Delaware in more detail, but I wanted to open simply by \ndescribing this community response to the flooding that we saw in the \nprevious slide. We have come together as a community to plan a cleanup \nof a brownfield area to create a safe and attractive park for the \nneighborhood and to improve water quality and drainage in a way that \nalso creates new ecosystems, new opportunities for recreation, and a \nnew future for a community long blighted and often under water.\n  That is not the only example of the many actions that have been taken \nby my home State of Delaware. Delaware also participates in RGGI, the \nRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a collection of nine mid-Atlantic \nand northeastern States, including Rhode Island, that have joined \ntogether to implement market-based policies to reduce emissions.\n  Since 2009, the participating States have reduced our carbon \nemissions by 20 percent while also experiencing stronger economic \ngrowth in the rest of the country, which I view as proof that fighting \nclimate change and strengthening our economy are not mutually exclusive \nexchangeable goals.\n  In fact, over the past 6 years, Delaware has reduced its greenhouse \ngas emissions more than any State in the entire United States. We have \ndone that by growing our solar capacity 6,000 percent through multiple \nutility-scale projects and distributed solar. We have also done our \nbest to adapt to climate change through community and State-led \nplanning. Our Governor Jack Markell and former Delaware Secretary \nCollin O'Mara led a fantastic bottom-up, State-wide level planning \neffort to address the impacts of climate change on water, agriculture, \necosystems, infrastructure, and public health. In December of 2014, \nthey released their climate framework for Delaware--an impressive \nstatewide effort to be prepared for what is coming before it is too \nlate.\n  I believe Delaware is an example of how communities that are most \nvulnerable to climate change can work together across public and \nprivate sectors to meet the challenges of climate change head-on. That \nis why I invited my friend and colleague Senator Whitehouse. He is a \ntrue leader in the work to address climate change, not only in his home \nState of Rhode Island but across our country, and he has paid a visit \nto my State.\n  Every week, Senator Whitehouse gives a speech on a different aspect \nof climate change, and I was proud to participate today in his weekly \nspeech on the topic and thrilled to welcome him to my home State in May \nas part of his ongoing effort.\n  Before I yield the floor to Senator Whitehouse, I just want to talk \nabout one other stop on our statewide tour--a stop in Prime Hook, one \nof Delaware's two national wildlife refuges. The beach in Prime Hook \nover the last 60 years has receded more than 500 feet. Over the last \ndecade, storms have broken through the dune line several times, \nflooding 4,000 acres of previously freshwater marsh.\n  When Hurricane Sandy hit this already fragile shoreline, leaving this \ncoastline battered, as we can see here, it broke through completely and \npermanently flooded and destroyed the freshwater marsh. The storm \ndeepened\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nand widened the beach from 300 feet to about 1,500 feet and exacerbated \nroutine flooding on local roads used by the community to access the \nbeach.\n  For a delicate ecosystem like this wildlife refuge, this type of \nsevere weather and flooding can be devastating. Over the last 3 years, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has worked in tandem with other \nFederal agencies, State partners, and NGOs to restore this highly \ndamaged fragile ecosystem and rebuild the beach's defenses.\n  It is a long story, but you can see the punch line here. As of 2016, \nconstruction of a newly designed, resloped, redeveloped barrier has \nbeen completed. Senator Whitehouse has also had the opportunity to \nvisit this area. The finished project will be a saltwater marsh that I \nam confident will contribute significantly to a durable, resilient, and \nlong-term ecosystem.\n  This is just one example of the creative things we are doing in \nDelaware to address the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. \nIn some ways I think the most important and exciting was the last stop \nin our statewide visit.\n  With that I will turn it over to Senator Whitehouse to discuss in \nmore detail his visit to Delaware and our last visit to the \nsouthernmost part of my home State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am really grateful to the junior \nSenator from Delaware for inviting me to his home State and for joining \nme here today for my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech No. 139.\n  Senator Coons and I spent a terrific day touring the Delaware shore. \nYou can say whatever you want about us, but on that day we were the two \nwettest Members of the U.S. Senate. I can assure you of that.\n  This is Capitol Hill Ocean Week, and Wednesday is World Oceans Day, \nso it is a good time to consider the effects of global climate change \nin our oceans. The oceans have absorbed one-third of all carbon dioxide \nproduced since the industrial revolution and over 90 percent of the \nexcess heat that has resulted. That means that by laws of both physics \nand chemistry, the oceans are warming, rising, and acidifying.\n  Rhode Island is the Ocean State, but give Delaware credit. From the \nlast report in 2013, it generated around $1 billion and over 23,000 \njobs from the ocean based in tourism, recreation, shipping, and \nfishing. Like Rhode Island, Delaware sees its sea level rise at a rate \nof 3\\1/3\\ millimeters per year along the Delaware shore, 13 inches up \nover the last 100 years. Delawareans care about this issue. Over a \nquarter have reported personally experiencing the effects of sea level \nrise, two-thirds worry about the effects of sea level rise, and over 75 \npercent called on the State to take immediate action to combat climate \nchange and sea level rise.\n  I did enjoy our visit in South Wilmington, and I enjoyed the visit to \nPort Mahon, where the roads had to be built up with riffraff to protect \nagainst sea level rise. But the real prize and the prime reason I went \nwas Port Mahon's avian connection. Among the sandpipers, ruddy \nturnstones, and gulls we saw on the shore was a bird called the rufa \nred knot. Red knots stand out from other shore birds on the beach not \nonly for their colorful burnt orange plumage but also for the amazing \nstory that accompanies their arrival in Delaware each spring. This is a \nstory to love, and I guess you would have to say a bird to admire.\n  They have only about a 20-inch wingspan at full growth, and the body \nis only about the size of a teacup, but each spring these red knots \nundertake an epic 9,000-plus mile voyage from Tierra del Fuego on the \nsouthern tip of South America up to the Canadian Arctic. After spending \nthe summer nesting in the Arctic, they make the return trip south to \nwinter in the Southern Hemisphere. This little bird has one of the \nlongest animal migrations of any species on Earth.\n  How does Delaware come into this? Well, the red knots fly straight \nfrom Brazil to Delaware Bay. As you can imagine, when they get there, \nthey are hungry. They have lost as much as half their weight. We were \ntold they start to ingest their own organs toward the end.\n  Delaware Bay is the largest horseshoe crab spawning area in the \nworld. Each May, horseshoe crabs lay millions of eggs. Nearly 2 million \nhorseshoe crabs were counted in Delaware Bay in 2015, and a female can \nlay up to 90,000 eggs per spawning season. Do the math. That is a lot \nof eggs.\n  The red knots come here timed just so by mother nature to bulk up on \nthe nutritious horseshoe crab eggs to replenish their wasted bodies \nfrom the long flight to Delaware Bay and to fuel up for the 2,000 \nfurther miles of journey to the Canadian Arctic.\n  I wanted to see this before it ends. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService has listed the red knot as threatened under the Endangered \nSpecies Act because ``successful annual migration and breeding of red \nknots is highly dependent on the timing of departures and arrivals to \ncoincide with favorable food and weather conditions in the spring and \nfall migratory stopover areas and on the Arctic breeding grounds.'' \nClimate change can bollix up that timing.\n  We are already seeing that in a different subspecies of red knots \nthat migrate north along the West African coast. A study published in \nthe journal Science last month found that the earlier melt of Arctic \nsnow is accelerating the timeline for the hatching of insects in \nspring, leading to smaller birds. The chicks, being less strong, begin \nto weaken and can't feed as successfully, and it cascades through an \narray of further difficulties.\n  You actually have to love this unassuming and astounding little bird, \nbut its survival relies on a cascade of nature's events to line up just \nright. Nature throws a long bomb from Tierra del Fuego, where these \nbirds start, and off they go. Months later they arrive in Delaware Bay \ntimed to this 450 million-year-old creature, the horseshoe crab, \nemerging from Delaware Bay to spawn. If one environmental event comes \ntoo early or too late or if one food source becomes too limited, the \nspecies could collapse.\n  We got ahead of that in the 1990s when horseshoe crabs became rare \nbecause they were overfished. As their numbers went down, the red knot \nfell in accord. If the changes we are so recklessly putting in motion \non the planet disturb nature's fateful planning, the red knot could pay \na sad price.\n\n  Some people may snicker and say: There he goes again. Now he is on \nthe Senate floor talking about some stupid bird. But I say this: When \none sees the voyage that this bird has to make, a little shore bird \nused to running along the shore making this epic voyage every year--one \nof them has been measured, because of a tag on its ankle, to have flown \nthe distance from here to the moon and halfway back in its life--if one \ncan't see the hand of God in that creature, I weep for their soul.\n  So I thank my colleague from Delaware for his staff and the experts \nhe brought along to help us learn about this. Like Rhode Island, \nDelaware has been proactive in planning for the risks that we face in a \nwarmer and wetter future.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished junior Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. With that, Mr. President, I want to conclude by commenting \nthat our day together began and ended with citizen science. The very \nfirst thing we did was to visit Delaware's national park to participate \nin a bio blitz, where volunteers from all over the country were \nidentifying species and categorizing the threats to them from climate \nchange. The very last thing we did was to count horseshoe crabs along \nthe Cape Henlopen shore. I must say that my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, even though there was driving rain and there were difficult \nconditions, was passionate and determined to do everything we could to \ncontribute to the counting effort of the horseshoe crabs that day. It \nwas a terrific opportunity to see a State that is engaged in planning \nand preparation and to witness one of the most remarkable migrations \nacross our globe.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Senator Whitehouse for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COONS. The Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Were we, indeed, the two wettest Senators that day?\n  Mr. COONS. We were, indeed, the most persistently wet Senators in the \nentire country by the end of a very wet\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\nand very fulfilling day up and down the State of Delaware.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3492-2"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3511-S3525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TSCA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate \nthe message to accompany H.R. 2576.\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the bill (H.R. 2576) entitled ``An Act to modernize \n     the Toxic Substances Control Act, and for other purposes.'' \n     with an amendment to the Senate amendment.\n\n\n                            Motion to Concur\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment to \nthe Senate amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there now be 45 minutes of debate on the \nmotion, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nvote on the motion to concur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. For the information of Senators, this will allow us to \npass this bill tonight by voice vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for that 45 minutes of \ndebate, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, be recognized for 10 \nminutes; followed by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter; and then \ngo back and forth in 5-minute increments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to \nmake a little clarification.\n  Senator Udall has asked for 10 minutes. If we could use our time, \nallowing this Senator 10 minutes, and then after Senator Vitter's time, \nwe would go to Senator Udall for 10 minutes and then back to the other \nside. Then Senator Markey wanted 5 minutes and Senator Whitehouse \nwanted 5 minutes as well--if it would go in that order as stated, with \n10 for myself, 10 for Senator Udall, 5 for Senator Markey, and 5 for \nSenator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I believe that adds up to our 45 minutes, and I will just \nnot speak until after the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to modifying the request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. There would be 5 minutes left, if that is all right.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will amend my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to start off by thanking my dear \nfriend, Senator Inhofe. We have had a wonderful relationship when it \ncomes to the infrastructure issues. We have not worked terribly well \ntogether on environmental issues, but because of both of our staffs and \nthe Members of our committee on both sides of the aisle, we were able \nto tough it out and come up with a bill that I absolutely believe is \nbetter than current law.\n  I will be entering into the Record additional views by four leading \nDemocratic negotiators--myself, Senator Udall, Senator Merkley, and \nSenator Markey.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical \nSafety for the 21st Century Act. I spoke at length about this before, \nso I won't go on for a long time. But I do want to reiterate that the \njourney to this moment has been the most complicated journey I have \never had to take on any piece of legislation, and I have been around \nhere for a long time.\n  It was a critical journey. When naming a bill after Senator \nLautenberg, who fought for the environment all his life, the bill must \nbe worthy of his name, and, finally, this bill is.\n  It didn't start out that way. I used every prerogative I had, every \ntool in my arsenal to bring it down until it got better, and it is \nbetter. It is better than current law.\n  Asbestos, for example, is one of the most harmful chemicals known to \nhumankind, and it takes 15,000 lives a year. It is linked to a deadly \nform of lung cancer called mesothelioma. People can breathe in these \nfibers deep into their lungs where they cause serious damage. We have \naddressed asbestos in this bill. We didn't ban it on this bill, which I \nsupport--and I have stand-alone legislation to do that--but we have \nmade asbestos a priority in this bill.\n  Flame retardants are another category of dangerous chemicals. They \nhave been linked to a wide array of serious health problems, including \ncancer, reduced IQ, developmental delays, obesity, and reproductive \ndifficulties. These harmful chemicals have been added to dozens of \neveryday items such as furniture and baby products. So when we are \ntalking about TSCA reforming the toxic laws, we are not just talking \nabout a conversation, we are not just talking about a theory, we are \nnot talking about something you would address in a classroom. We are \ntalking about our families.\n  Now, the negotiations have been challenging. Many organizations in \nmany States stood strong despite the pressure to step back, and I am so \ngrateful to them for their persistence. I especially want to thank the \n450 organizations that were part of the Safer Chemicals, Healthy \nFamilies coalition that worked with me, as well as the Asbestos Disease \nAwareness Organization for their efforts. Without them, I would not \nhave had the ability to negotiate important improvements.\n  Let me highlight briefly a few of the most important changes in the \nfinal bill. I can't go one more minute without thanking the two people \nwho are sitting right behind me, Bettina Poirier, who is my chief of \nstaff on the committee and chief counsel, and Jason Albritton, who is \nmy senior adviser. They worked tirelessly--through the night \nsometimes--with Senator Inhofe's staff. Without their work, we never \nwould have gotten to this point, and we never would have gotten to a \nbill worthy of Frank's name, and it means a great deal to me.\n  The first major area of improvement is the preemption of State \nrestrictions on toxic chemicals. In the final bill, we were able to \nmake important exceptions to the preemption provisions.\n  First, the States are free to take whatever action they want on any \nchemical until EPA has taken a series of steps to study a particular \nchemical. Second, when EPA announces the chemicals they are studying, \nthe States still have up to a year and a half to take action on these \nparticular chemicals to avoid preemption until the EPA takes final \naction.\n  Third, even after EPA announces its regulation, the States have the \nability to get a waiver so they can still regulate the chemical, and we \nhave made improvements to that waiver to make it easier for States to \nact.\n  For chemicals that industry has asked EPA to study, we made sure that \nStates are not preempted until EPA issues a final restriction on the \nchemical, and for that I really want to thank our friends in the House. \nThey put a lot of effort into that.\n  The first 10 chemicals EPA evaluates under the bill are also exempted \nfrom preemption until the final rule is issued. Also, State or local \nrestrictions on a chemical that were in place before April 22, 2016, \nwill not be preempted.\n  So I want to say, as someone who comes from the great State of \nCalifornia--home to almost 40 million people and which has a good \nstrong program--we protected you. Would I rather have written this \nprovision myself? Of course, and if I had written it myself I would \nhave set a floor in terms of this standard and allowed the States to \ntake whatever action they wanted to make it tougher. But this was not \nto be. This was not to be. So because I couldn't get that done, what we \nwere able to get done were those four or five improvements that I \ncited.\n  The States that may be watching this debate can really gear up and \nmove forward right now. There is time. You can continue the work on \nregulations you passed before April. You can also have a year and a \nhalf once EPA announces the chemical, and if they don't announce \nanything, you can go back to doing what you did before. An EPA that is \nnot funded right, I say to my dearest friend on the floor today, is not \ngoing to do anything. So the States will have the ability to do it. I \nwould hope we would fund the EPA so we have a strong Federal program \nand strong State programs as well. But we will have to make sure that \nthe EPA doesn't continually get cut.\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\n  The second area of improvement concerns asbestos. I think I have \ntalked about that before. It is covered in this bill.\n  The third area of improvement concerns cancer clusters. This one is \nso dear to my heart and to the heart of my Republican colleague, \nSenator Crapo. We wrote a bill together called the Community Disease \nCluster Assistance Act, or ``Trevor's Law.'' Trevor's Law provides \nlocalities that ask for it a coordinated response to cancer clusters in \ntheir communities.\n  What Trevor taught us from his experience with a horrible cancer is \nthat sometimes these outbreaks occur and no one knows why. Yet it is \nconsidered a local issue. Now, if the local community requests it--if \nthey request it--they will get help.\n  Fourth, we have something called persistent chemicals. Those are \nchemicals that build up in your body. You just don't get rid of them. \nThey are a priority in this legislation.\n  Fifth, another one that is dear to my heart and dear to the heart of \nSenator Manchin and Senator Capito is this provision that ensures that \ntoxic chemicals stored neared drinking water are prioritized. This \nprovision was prompted by the serious spill that contaminated the \ndrinking water supplies in West Virginia in 2014, causing havoc and \ndisruption. They didn't know what the chemical was. It got into the \nwater. They didn't know what to do. As we all remember, it was a \nnightmare for the people there--no more. Now we are going to make sure \nthat the EPA knows what is stored near drinking water supplies.\n  The sixth is very important and is something that got negotiated in \nthe dead of night. I want to thank Senator Inhofe's staff for working \nwith my staff on this. The bill enables EPA to order independent \ntesting if there are safety concerns about a chemical, and these tests \nwill be paid for by the chemical manufacturer. I also want to thank \nMembers of the House who really brought this to us.\n  Finally, even the standard for evaluating whether a chemical is \ndangerous is far better than in the old TSCA. The bill requires EPA to \nevaluate chemicals based on risks, not costs, and considers the impact \non vulnerable populations. This is really critical. The old law was \nuseless. So all of these fixes make this bill better than current \nFederal law.\n  Looking forward, I want to make a point. This new TSCA law will only \nbe as good as the EPA is good. With a good EPA, we can deliver a much \nsafer environment for the American people--safer products, less \nexposure to harmful toxics, and better health for our people. With a \nbad EPA that does not value these goals, not much will get done. But, \nagain, if a bad EPA takes no action, States will be free to act.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 30 additional seconds, and I will wrap this \nup.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, we do have this down with \nfive people.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds. I am just going \nto end with 30 seconds, and I will add 30 seconds to your side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the States: You are free to act with a bad EPA. \nCompared to where we started, we have a much better balance between the \nStates and the Federal Government. It is not perfect. The bills I \nworked on with Frank did not do this. They did not preempt the States. \nBut because of this challenging journey, we respected each other on \nboth sides, we listened to each other on both sides, and today is a day \nwe can feel good about.\n  We have a decent bill, a Federal program, and the States will have a \nlot of latitude to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise also to laud a really significant \nachievement that we are going to finalize tonight with the final \npassage of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century \nAct.\n  This much needed bill will provide updates that have been due \nliterally for decades to the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, \nknown as TSCA for short, which has been outdated and overdue for \nupdating since almost that time. Now, getting to where we are tonight, \nabout to pass this by an overwhelming vote, following the 403-to-12 \nvote in the House a few weeks ago, did not happen overnight. In fact, \nit took about 5-plus years.\n  In 2011 I started discussions with a broad array of folks, certainly \nincluding Senator Lautenberg. That is when I first sat down with Frank \nand started this process in a meaningful way and when we agreed that we \nwould try to bridge the significant differences between our two \nviewpoints and come up with a strong bipartisan bill.\n  That same year I also sat down with John Shimkus of Illinois to let \nhim know that Frank and I were going to put in a lot of effort to come \nup with this framework, and we wanted him to be a full and equal and \ncontributing partner. Over the next year and a half, we slogged through \nthat process of trying to come up with a strong bipartisan bill. It \nwasn't easy. Between Senator Lautenberg and myself and our staffs and \nother staffs, there was an often brutal stretch of difficult \nnegotiations and challenging times, testing everybody's patience.\n  Several times we walked away to come back together again. Finally, it \ndid come together. In early 2013, that really started taking shape. \nToward the end of April 2013, we were far enough along to lock a small \ngroup of staff and experts in a room to finalize that first bipartisan \nbill. There were folks like Bryan Zumwalt, my chief counsel then; \nDimitri Karakitsos, who is my counsel and is now a key staffer who \ncontinues on the EPW Committee; Senator Lautenberg's chief counsel, Ben \nDunham; and his chemical adviser, Brendan Bell.\n  That led finally to this first bipartisan bill that we introduced on \nMay 23, 2013. Now, that wasn't the end of our TSCA journey. \nUnfortunately, in many ways, the most difficult segment of that journey \nwas soon after that introduction on May 23, because on June 3, just a \nfew weeks later, Frank passed. The single greatest champion of \nreforming how chemicals are regulated died at 89 years of age.\n  That was heartbreaking. But it was a moment when all of us who had \nbeen involved only redoubled our commitment to following this through \nto the end. Soon after Frank's unfortunate passing, our colleague Tom \nUdall really stepped up to the plate in a major way to take Frank's \nrole as the Democratic lead in this effort. We had a quiet dinner one \nnight here on Capitol Hill to talk about our commitment to carry on \nthis fight and get it done. We formed a partnership and a friendship \nthat was really built around this work with an absolute commitment to \nget that done. I will always be so thankful to Tom and his partnership \nand also to his great staff, including their senior policy adviser, \nJonathan Black.\n  As with most major undertakings, we had a lot of other help all along \nthe way. Early on, at that stage of the process, Senators Crapo and \nAlexander were extremely helpful. Also, a little later on, Senators \nBooker, Merkley, and Markey did a lot to advance the ball and refine \nthe product. Of course, at every step of the way, I continued to meet \nand talk with Congressman John Shimkus. He was a persistent and a \nreliable partner in this process, as was his senior policy adviser, \nChris Sarley.\n  Throughout this process, staff was absolutely essential and \nmonumental. They did yeoman's work in very, very difficult and trying \ncircumstances. I mentioned Bryan Zumwalt, my former chief counsel. He \nwas a driving force behind this. I deeply appreciate and acknowledge \nhis work, as well as someone else I mentioned, Dimitri Karakitsos, who \ncontinues to work as a key staffer on the committee and who is seeing \nthis over the goal line.\n  Let me also thank Ben Dunham, the former chief counsel to Senator \nLautenberg. I think in the beginning, particularly, Ben, Bryan, and \nDimitri gave each other plenty of help but worked through very \ndifficult negotiations to get it done.\n  Also, I want to thank Jonathan Black and Drew Wallace in Senator \nUdall's office and Michal Freedhoff and Adrian Deveny in Senator \nMarkey's office.\n  On the outside, there are a lot of experts from all sorts of \nstakeholders across the political spectrum, certainly including \nindustry representatives with the American Chemistry Council.\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nI want to thank Mike Walls, Dell Perelman, Rudy Underwood, Amy DuVall, \nRobert Flagg, and, of course their leader, Cal Dooley.\n  Finally, there is one enormous figure who is owed a great debt of \ngratitude and a lot of credit for seeing this over the goal line \ntonight; that is, Frank's better half--and I say that with deep respect \nand admiration to Frank, but surely his better half--Bonnie Lautenberg. \nShe has been called the 101st Senator, particularly on this issue. She \nwas devoted to seeing Frank's work completed. I thank her for her \nrelentless effort reaching out to Members in the House and Senate and \nstakeholders to make sure this happened.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning, this is long overdue. All \nstakeholders across the political spectrum agreed for decades that this \naspect of the law needed to be updated. We needed to fully protect \npublic health and safety, which we all want to do. We also needed to \nensure that American companies, which are world leaders today in \nscience, research, and innovation remain so and do not get put behind a \nregulatory system which is overly burdensome and unworkable.\n  This TSCA reform bill, properly named after Frank Lautenberg, \nachieves those goals. It is a positive, workable compromise in the best \nsense of that term, so that we will achieve public health and safety. \nIt ensures that our leading American companies, great scientists, great \ninnovators, and great world leaders in this sector remain just that and \nthat they remain the world leaders we want and need them to continue to \nbe.\n  So I thank all of those who have contributed to this long but \nultimately successful and worthwhile effort. With that, I look forward \nto our vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me just initially, while Senator Vitter \nis still on the floor here, thank him so much. He was a great partner \nin terms of working on this piece of legislation thoroughly through the \nprocess over 3 years. We met, I think, about 3 years ago and had a \ndinner and decided, after Frank Lautenberg had died--he did a lot of \nwork on the bill--that we would pick it up and make it happen. He has \nbeen a man of his word, and it has been a real pleasure working with \nhim.\n  Let me just say about Chairman Inhofe that what they say in the \nSenate is that if you have a strong chairman, you can get a bill done. \nHe has been remarkable in terms of his strength and his perseverance in \nterms of moving this bill. So we are at a very, very historic point \ntoday. I think I would call it a historic moment. I thank the Senator. \nIt has been a pleasure working with the Senator. I enjoined working \nwith the Senator when I was on the committee, and I am going to enjoy \nworking with Chairman Inhofe in the future in terms of many other \nissues that come before us in the Senate.\n  I don't have any doubt that this is a historic moment several years \nand Congresses in the making. For the first time in 40 years, the \nUnited States of America will have a chemical safety program that works \nand that protects our families from dangerous chemicals in their daily \nlives. This is significant. Most Americans believe that when they buy a \nproduct at the hardware store or the grocery store, that product has \nbeen tested and determined to be safe. But that is not the case.\n  Americans are exposed to hundreds of chemicals from household items. \nWe carry them around with us in our bodies and even before we are born. \nSome are known as carcinogens, others as highly toxic. But we don't \nknow the full extent of how they affect us because they have never been \ntested. When this bill becomes law, there will finally be a cop on the \nbeat.\n  Today, under the old TSCA, reviewing chemicals is discretionary. When \nthis bill is law, the EPA will be required to methodically review all \nexisting chemicals for safety, starting with the worst offenders. \nToday, the old law requires that the EPA consider the costs and \nbenefits of regulation when studying the safety of chemicals. Very \nsoon, EPA will have to consider only the health and environmental \nimpacts of a chemical. If they demonstrate a risk, EPA will have to \nregulate.\n  Very soon, it will be enshrined in the law that the EPA most protect \nthe most vulnerable people--pregnant women, infants, the elderly, and \nchemical workers. Today, the old TSCA puts burdensome testing \nrequirements on the EPA. To test a chemical, the EPA has to show a \nchemical possesses a potential risk, and then it has to go through a \nlong rulemaking process.\n  Very soon, EPA will have authority to order testing without those \nhurdles. Today, the old TSCA allows new chemicals to go to market \nwithout any real review, an average of 750 a year. Very soon, the EPA \nwill be required to determine that all chemicals are safe before they \ngo to the market.\n  Today, the old TSCA allows companies to hide information about their \nproducts, claiming it is confidential business information, even in an \nemergency. Very soon, we will ensure that companies can no longer hide \nthis vital information.\n  States, medical professionals and the public will have access to the \ninformation they need to keep communities safe. Businesses will have to \njustify when they keep information confidential. That right will expire \nafter 10 years. Today, the old TSCA underfunds the EPA so it doesn't \nhave the resources to do its job.\n  Very soon, there will be a dedicated funding stream for TSCA. It will \nrequire industry to pay its share, $25 million a year. In addition, \nthis new law will ensure victims can get access to the courts if they \nare hurt. It will revolutionize unnecessary testing on animals, and it \nwill ensure that States can continue to take strong action on dangerous \nchemicals.\n  The Senate is about to pass this legislation. It is going to the \nPresident, and he will sign it. Over the past several days, I have \ngotten the same question over and over: What made this legislation \ndifferent? Why was the agreement possible when other bills stalled? I \nthought about it quite a bit. It wasn't that the bill was simple. This \nwas one of the most complex environmental pieces of legislation around. \nIt certainly wasn't a lack of controversy. This process almost fell \napart many times. It certainly wasn't a lack of interest from \nstakeholders. Many groups were involved, all with strong and passionate \nviews and some with deep distrust. We faced countless obstacles, but I \nthink what made this possible was the commitment and the willpower by \neveryone involved to see good legislation through and endure the slings \nand the arrows. I say a heartfelt thank-you to everyone involved.\n\n  I remember having dinner with Senator Vitter one evening early on \nwhen I was trying to decide whether I would take up Frank Lautenberg's \nwork on this bill. There was already plenty of controversy and concern \nabout the bill. Senator Vitter and I were not used to working with each \nother. In fact, we have almost always been on opposite sides. But I \nleft that dinner with the feeling that Senator Vitter was committed, \nthat he wanted to see this process through and was willing to do what \nit would take. For 3 years, I never doubted that. Both of us took more \nthan a little heat. We both had to push hard and get important groups \nto the table and make sure they stayed at the table. I thank Senator \nVitter. He has been a true partner in this process.\n  There are many others to thank, and I will, but before I do that, I \nwant to say a few words about this bill's namesake. Frank Lautenberg \nwas a champion for public health and a dogged, determined leader for \nTSCA reform. He cared so much for his children and grandchildren that \nhe wanted to leave a better, healthier, safer environment for them. He \nalways said that TSCA reform would save more lives than anything he \never worked on.\n  This is a bittersweet moment for all of us because Frank isn't here \nto see this happen, but I have faith that he is watching us and he is \ncheering us on. His wife Bonnie has been here working as the 101st \nSenator. She has been a force and inspiration, keeping us going, \npushing us when we needed it. She helped us fulfill Frank's vision.\n  In the beginning, we thought the bill might not ever get introduced \nin the Senate. We entered this Congress after the Republicans took the \nmajority. Many felt that strong environmental legislation was \nimpossible. They urged us to wait. But many of us felt that 40 years \nwas already too long to wait. We knew we could do it, make it better, \nand get it passed.\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\n  Senator Carper was one of those key members on the Environment \nCommittee. He gave us legs to get out of the gate. He and Senators \nManchin and Coons were among our original cosponsors. They recognized \nthat we had a great opportunity before us, and I thank them all.\n  They say that in order to get things done in Washington, you need a \ngood, strong chairman, and Chairman Inhofe fits that description. I \nthank Chairman Inhofe and especially his staff, Ryan Jackson and \nDimitri Karakitsos. Chairman Inhofe's team was instrumental in moving \nthings forward and working with me to ensure that we built the broadest \npossible support. They knew that with broad support, we could do better \nthan get it out of committee, we could get it across the finish line.\n  There are days when we all feel discouraged by gridlock here in \nWashington, but Chairman Inhofe and Senator Vitter rose above that. \nThey saw the value of working together across party and across House \nand Senate.\n  Senators Booker, Merkley, and Whitehouse all understood that we could \nwork together. I thank them, too, for sticking with this bill and \nworking through differences. As a result of their efforts, the bill \ngives States stronger protections, it helps reduce unnecessary testing \non animals, and it includes a number of other improvements. Their \nstaff--Adam Zipkin, Adrian Deveny, and Emily Enderle, among others--\nwere key.\n  A strong bipartisan vote of 15 to 5 out of the committee set us up \nfor action on floor. As many of you know, floor time is valuable and \nhard to come by and subject to nonpertinent issues. We needed to work \nto ensure the broadest possible support. We did that with Senators \nDurbin and Markey, our 59th and 60th cosponsors of our legislation. I \nthank them and their staff members, Jasmine Hunt and Michal Freedhoff, \nfor their important work to improve key aspects of the Federal program, \nsuch as fees and implementation dates, and to ensure that we could pass \nthis bill through the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. UDALL. Thank you very much.\n  Let me just say that I am going to stay over. I thank the two \nSenators. I am going to stay with Senator Inhofe and thank additional \npeople because I think it is that important, but we have this time \nagreement, and we need to move on.\n  I yield to Senator Markey for 5 minutes, and then we are going to \nSenator Whitehouse for 5 minutes unless there is a Republican to \nintervene. Chairman Inhofe, is that correct?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is right.\n  I would also say that I will forgo my remarks in order to give them \nmore time until after the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. UDALL. I yield time to--the agreement, as I understand it, is \nthat Senator Markey will speak for 5 minutes and Senator Whitehouse for \n5 minutes and then back to the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, that is already a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today Congress stands ready to reform the \nlast of the core four environmental statutes. It may do so with a \nstronger bipartisan vote than any other major environmental statute in \nrecent American history.\n  For a generation, the American people have been guinea pigs in a \nterrible chemical experiment. Told that all the advances in our \nchemistry labs would make us healthier, happier, and safer, American \nfamilies have had to suffer with decades of a law that did nothing to \nensure that was true. That is because when the industry successfully \noverturned the EPA's proposed ban on asbestos, it also rendered the \nToxic Substance Control Act all but unusable. Children shouldn't be \nunwitting scientific subjects. Today we have a chance to protect them \nby reforming this failed law.\n  As ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee of jurisdiction, I was \none of a handful of Members who participated in an informal conference \nwith the House. With Senators Udall, Boxer, and Merkley, I have \nprepared a document that is intended to memorialize certain agreements \nmade in the bicameral negotiations that would typically have been \nincluded in a conference report.\n  In our work with the House, we truly did take the best of both bills \nwhen it came to enhancing EPA's authority to regulate chemicals.\n  The degree to which States will be preempted as the Federal \nGovernment regulates chemicals has been a source of considerable debate \nsince this bill was first introduced. I have always been a very strong \nsupporter of States' rights to take actions needed to protect their own \nresidents. For many of us, accepting preemption of our States was a \ndifficult decision that we only made as we also secured increases to \nthe robustness of the EPA chemical safety program.\n  I am particularly pleased that efforts I helped lead resulted in the \nassurance that Massachusetts' pending flame retardant law will not be \nsubjected to pause preemption and that there is a mechanism in the bill \nto ensure that States' ongoing work on all chemicals can continue while \nEPA is studying those chemicals.\n  The fact that the bill is supported by the EPA, the chemical \nindustry, the chamber of commerce, and the trial lawyers tells you \nsomething. The fact that a staggering 403 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives voted for this TSCA bill--more than the number who \nagreed to support the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, or the Safe \nDrinking Water Act amendments when those laws were reauthorized--tells \nyou something. What it tells you is that we worked together on a \nbipartisan and bicameral basis to compromise in the way Americans \nexpect us to.\n  Although there are many people who helped to create this moment, I \nwish to thank some whose work over the past few months I especially \nwant to recognize.\n  I thank Bonnie Lautenberg. On behalf of her husband Frank, she was \nrelentless.\n  Senator Inhofe and his staffers, Ryan Jackson and Dimitri Karakitsos, \nremained as committed to agreements they made about Senate Democratic \npriorities as they were to their own commitment priorities throughout \nthis process. I couldn't have imagined a stronger or more constructive \npartnership.\n  I would like to thank Senator Udall and his staffers, Drew Wallace \nand Jonathan Black, whose leadership--especially during these \nchallenging moments--was very important.\n  I also thank Senator Merkley and his staff, Adrian Deveny, whose \ncreativity often led us to legislative breakthroughs, especially when \nit came to crafting certain preemption compromises.\n  My own staff, Michal Freedhoff, has done little but this for 1 \nconsecutive year. This is her 20th year on my staff. With her Ph.D. in \nbiochemistry--it was invaluable in negotiating with the American \nChemistry Council and all other interests.\n  I want to thank many other Members: Senator Boxer; Senator Whitehouse \nand his staff, Bettina, along with Barbara Boxer; Senator McConnell; \nSenator Reid; Senator Durbin--all central players in making sure this \nlegislation was here today.\n  I thank the spectacular and hard-working EPA team, all of whom \nprovided us with technical assistance and other help, often late at \nnight and before the dawn.\n  I thank Gina McCarthy, Jim Jones, Wendy Cleland-Hamnet, Ryan Wallace, \nPriscilla Flattery, Kevin McLean, Brian Grant, David Berol, Laura \nVaught, Nicole Distefano, Sven-Erik Kaiser, and Tristan Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I also thank Ryan Schmit, Don Sadowsky, and Scott \nSherlock.\n  I want to thank Stephenne Harding and Andrew McConville at CEQ, whose \nday-to-day engagement helped us, especially in these last few weeks.\n  There are some outside stakeholders who worked particularly closely \nwith\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nmy staff and with me, including Andrew Rogers, Andrew Goldberg, Richard \nDenison, Joanna Slaney, Mike Walls, Rich Gold, and Scott Faber.\n  I have enjoyed meeting, working with, and partnering with each one of \nthese outstanding people over the last year.\n  This is a huge bill. It is a historic moment. It is going to make a \ndifference in the lives of millions of Americans. It is the most \nsignificant environmental law passed in this generation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MARKEY. The old law did not work. This one is going to protect \nthe American people.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as the song said, it has been a long, \nstrange trip getting here, and it has had its share of near-death \nexperiences, as Senator Udall is intimately aware of. I was involved \nwith Senator Merkley and Senator Booker in one of those near-death \nexperiences. If this was a rocket with stages, one of the major stages \nwas the Merkley-Booker-Whitehouse effort in the committee. I just \nwanted to say it was the first time the three of us worked together as \na triumvirate. They were wonderful to work with. They were truly a \npleasure. We had a lot on our plates. We made about a dozen major \nchanges in the bill.\n  I want to take just a moment to thank Emily Enderle on my staff, who \nwas terrific through all of the negotiations and renegotiations and \ncounternegotiations in that stage. But this was obviously a rocket that \nhad many more stages than that one.\n  I thank Chairman Inhofe and his staff for their persistence through \nall of this.\n  Ranking Member Boxer was relentless in trying to make this bill as \nstrong as she could make it through every single stage, and it is \nmarked by that persistence.\n  Senator Vitter and Senator Udall forged the original notion that this \ncompromise could be made to happen, and they have seen it through, so I \ncongratulate them.\n  The House had a rather different view of how this bill should look. \nBetween Senator Inhofe, Senator Udall, Representative Pallone, and \nRepresentative Upton, they were able to work out a bicameral as well as \na bipartisan compromise that we all could agree to.\n  There are a lot of thanks involved, but I close by offering a \nparticular thank-you to my friend Senator Udall. In Greek mythology \nthere is a Titan, Prometheus, who brought fire to humankind. His \npenalty for bringing fire to humankind was to be strapped to the rock \nby chains and have Zeus send an eagle to eat his liver every single \nday. It is an image of persisting through pain. I do have to say \nSenator Vitter may have had his issues on his side--I do not know how \nthat looked--but I can promise on our side Tom Udall persisted through \nmonths and months of pain, always with the view that this bill could \ncome to the place where this day could happen.\n\n  There are times when legislation is legislation, and there are times \nwhen legislation has a human story behind it. This is a human story of \ncourage, foresight, persistence, patience, and willingness to absorb a \nconsiderable number of slings and arrows on the way to a day when \nslings and arrows are finally put down and everybody can shake hands \nand agree we have, I think, a terrific victory. While there is much \ncredit in many places, my heart in this is with Senator Tom Udall of \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today, while the Nation has been focused \non the final six primaries across the Nation, the final six State \nprimaries across the Nation, something extraordinary is unfolding here \non the floor of the Senate. The Senate is taking the final \ncongressional act to send the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for \nthe 21st Century Act to the President's desk.\n  This is landmark legislation that honors the legacy of our dear \ncolleague Frank Lautenberg. This is landmark legislation that will make \na real difference for the health and safety of every American. This is \nthe first significant environmental legislation to be enacted by this \nChamber in 25 years.\n  This bill--this extraordinary bill--brought Democrats and Republicans \ntogether to take action to protect public health. I have been honored \nto be a part of this coalition as we have worked toward a final bill \nfor over a year. It hasn't been easy, but things worth doing are rarely \neasy.\n  A huge thank-you to Senators Udall and Vitter, who cosponsored this \nbill, lead the way; Senators Boxer and Inhofe, the chair and ranking \nmember of the Environment Committee; and Senators Markey, Whitehouse, \nand Booker for their leadership and contributions throughout this \nentire process.\n  Also, a special thank-you to the staff who worked day and night. I \nknow I received calls from my staff member Adrian Deveny at a variety \nof hours on a variety of weekends as he worked with other staff members \nto work out, iron out the challenges that remained, so a special thank-\nyou to Adrian Deveny.\n  Just a short time ago, I had the chance to speak to Bonnie \nLautenberg, Frank Lautenberg's wife. She would have loved to have been \nhere when we took this vote, but she is going to be down in the Capitol \nnext week with children and grandchildren. I hope to get a chance to \nreally thank her in person for her husband's leadership but also for \nher leadership, her advocacy that we reached this final moment. She \nsaid to me: It appears it takes a village to pass a bill. Well, it \ndoes. This village was a bipartisan village. This was a bicameral \nvillage. It has reached a successful conclusion.\n  In the most powerful Nation on Earth, we should not be powerless to \nprotect our citizens from toxic chemicals in everyday products. Today \nmarks a sea shift in which we finally begin to change that. For too \nlong, we have been unable to protect our citizens from toxic chemicals \nthat hurt pregnant women and young children, chemicals that hurt our \nchildren's development, chemicals that cause cancer.\n  The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act will \ntremendously improve how we regulate toxic chemicals in the United \nStates--those that are already in products and should no longer be used \nand those new chemicals that are invented that should be thoroughly \nexamined before they end up in products--and make sure that toxic \nchemicals don't find their way into our classrooms, into our bedrooms, \ninto our homes, into our workplaces. Now the Environmental Protection \nAgency will have the tools and resources needed to evaluate the \ndangerous chemicals and to eliminate any unsafe uses.\n  My introduction to this issue began with a bill in the Oregon State \nLegislature about the cancer-causing flame retardants that are in our \ncarpets and our couches and the foam in our furniture that should not \nbe there. This bill gives us the ability to review that and to get rid \nof those toxic chemicals.\n  It was enormously disturbing to me to find out that our little babies \ncrawling on the carpet, their noses 1 inch off the ground, were \nbreathing in dust from the carpet that included these cancer-causing \nflame retardants. It should never have happened, but we did not have \nthe type of review process that protects Americans. Now we will.\n  So, together, a bipartisan team has run a marathon, and today we \ncross the finish line. In short order, this bill will be sitting in the \nOval Office, on the President's desk, and he will be putting ink to \npaper and creating this new and powerful tool for protecting the health \nof American citizens. That is an enormous accomplishment.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Boxer, the printing cost of the \nstatement of additional views with respect to H.R. 2576, TSCA, will \nexceed the two-page rule and cost $2,111.20.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer statement of additional views \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\n  \n\n\n  Detailed Analysis and Additional Views of Democratic Members on the \nMotion to Concur in the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to the \n  Bill H.R. 2576 Entitled ``An Act to Modernize the Toxic Substances \n           Control Act, and for Other Purposes'' June 7, 2016\n\n       As the lead Senate Democratic negotiators on H.R. 2576, \n     (hereinafter referred to as the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical \n     Safety for the 21st Century Act), we submit the following \n     additional views that describe the intent of the negotiators \n     on elements of the final bill text.\n\n\n                          1. ``Will Present''\n\n       Existing TSCA as in effect before the date of enactment of \n     Frank R Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act \n     includes the authority, contained in several sections (see, \n     for example, section 6(a)), for EPA to take regulatory \n     actions related to chemical substances or mixtures if it \n     determines that the chemical substance or mixture ``presents \n     or will present'' an unreasonable risk to health or the \n     environment.\n       The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st \n     Century Act includes language that removes all instances of \n     ``will present'' from existing TSCA and the amendments \n     thereto. This does not reflect an intent on the part of \n     Congressional negotiators to remove EPA's authority to \n     consider future or reasonably anticipated risks in evaluating \n     whether a chemical substance or mixture presents an \n     unreasonable risk to health or the environment. In fact, a \n     new definition added to TSCA explicitly provides such \n     authority and a mandate for EPA to consider conditions of use \n     that are not currently known or intended but can be \n     anticipated to occur:\n       `(4) The term `conditions of use' means the circumstances, \n     as determined by the Administrator, under which a chemical \n     substance is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be \n     manufactured, processed, distributed in commerce, used, or \n     disposed of'';\n\n\n                              2. Mixtures\n\n       In section 6(b) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, EPA is \n     directed to undertake risk evaluations on chemical substances \n     in order to determine whether they pose an unreasonable risk \n     to health or the environment. Some have questioned whether \n     the failure to explicitly authorize risk evaluations on \n     mixtures calls into question EPA's authority to evaluate the \n     risks from chemical substances in mixtures.\n       The definition of 'conditions of use' described above \n     plainly covers all uses of a chemical substance, including \n     its incorporation in a mixture, and thus would clearly enable \n     and require, where relevant, EPA to evaluate the risks of the \n     chemical substance as a component of a mixture.\n\n\n                            3. New Chemicals\n\n       While existing TSCA does not preclude EPA from reviewing \n     new chemicals and significant new uses following notification \n     by the manufacturer or processor, it does not require EPA to \n     do so or to reach conclusions on the potential risks of all \n     such chemicals before they enter the marketplace. EPA has \n     authority to issue orders blocking or limiting production or \n     other activities if it finds that available information is \n     inadequate and the chemical may present an unreasonable risk, \n     but the burden is on EPA to invoke this authority; if it \n     fails to do so within the 90-180 day review period, \n     manufacture of the new chemical can automatically commence. \n     This bill makes significant changes to this passive approach \n     under current law: For the first time, EPA will be required \n     to review all new chemicals and significant new uses and make \n     an affirmative finding regarding the chemical's or \n     significant new use's potential risks as a condition for \n     commencement of manufacture for commercial purposes and, in \n     the absence of a finding that the chemical or significant new \n     use is not likely to present an unreasonable risk, \n     manufacture will not be allowed to occur. If EPA finds that \n     it lacks sufficient information to evaluate the chemical's or \n     significant new use's risks or that the chemical or \n     significant new use does or may present an unreasonable risk, \n     it is obligated to issue an order or rule that precludes \n     market entry or imposes conditions sufficient to prevent an \n     unreasonable risk. EPA can also require additional testing. \n     Only chemicals and significant new uses that EPA finds are \n     not likely to present an unreasonable risk can enter \n     production without restriction. This affirmative approach to \n     better ensuring the safety of new chemicals entering the \n     market is essential to restoring the public's confidence in \n     our chemical safety system.\n\n\n                          4. Unreasonable Risk\n\n       TSCA as in effect before the date of enactment of the Frank \n     R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 2lst Century Act \n     authorized EPA to regulate chemical substances if it \n     determined that the chemical substance ``presents or will \n     present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the \n     environment.'' In its decision in Corrosion Proof Fittings vs \n     EPA, the U.S. Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit overturned EPA's \n     proposed ban on asbestos, in part because it believed that\n       ``In evaluating what is ``unreasonable,'' the EPA is \n     required to consider the costs of any proposed actions and to \n     ``carry out this chapter in a reasonable and prudent manner \n     [after considering] the environmental, economic, and social \n     impact of any action.'' 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2601(c).\n       As the District of Columbia Circuit stated when evaluating \n     similar language governing the Federal Hazardous Substances \n     Act, ``[t]he requirement that the risk be `unreasonable' \n     necessarily involves a balancing test like that familiar in \n     tort law: The regulation may issue if the severity of the \n     injury that may result from the product, factored by the \n     likelihood of the injury, offsets the harm the regulation \n     itself imposes upon manufacturers and consumers.'' Forester \n     v. CPSC, 559 F.2d 774 789 (D.C.Cir.1977). We have quoted this \n     language approvingly when evaluating other statutes using \n     similar language. See, e.g., Aqua Slide, 569 F.2d at 839.''\n       The Frank R Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century \n     Act clearly rejects that approach to determining what \n     ``unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment'' \n     means, by adding text that directs EPA to determine whether \n     such risks exist ``without consideration of costs or other \n     nonrisk factors'' and, if they do, to promulgate a rule that \n     ensures ``that the chemical substance no longer presents such \n     risk.'' In this manner, Congress has ensured that when EPA \n     evaluates a chemical to determine whether it poses an \n     unreasonable risk to health or the environment and regulates \n     the chemical if it does, the Agency may not apply the sort of \n     ``balancing test'' described above.\n\n\n                           5. Prioritization\n\n       Section 6(b) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg \n     Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, defines high-\n     priority chemical substances and low-priority chemical \n     substances as follows:\n       ``(i) HIGH-PRIORITY SUBSTANCES.--The Administrator shall \n     designate as a high-priority substance a chemical substance \n     that the Administrator concludes, without consideration of \n     costs or other nonrisk factors, may present an unreasonable \n     risk of injury to health or environment because of a \n     potential hazard and a potential route of exposure under the \n     conditions of use, including an unreasonable risk to a \n     potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified \n     as relevant by the Administrator.\n       ``(ii) LOW-PRIORITY SUBSTANCES.--The Administrator shall \n     designate a chemical substance as a low-priority substance if \n     the Administrator concludes, based on information sufficient \n     to establish, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk \n     factors, that such substance does not meet the standard \n     identified in clause (i) for designating a chemical substance \n     a high-priority substance.''\n       The direction to EPA for the designation of low-priority \n     substances is of note in that it requires such designations \n     to be made only when there is ``information sufficient to \n     establish'' that the standard for designating a substance as \n     a high-priority substance is not met. Clear authority is \n     provided under section 4(a)(2)(B), as created in the Frank R \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, to \n     enable EPA to obtain the information needed to prioritize \n     chemicals for which information is initially insufficient. \n     The bill text also goes on to state that if ``the information \n     available to the Administrator at the end of such an \n     extension [for testing of a chemical substance in order to \n     determine its priority designation] remains insufficient to \n     enable the designation of the chemical substance as a low-\n     priority substance, the Administrator shall designate the \n     chemical substance as a high-priority substance.''\n       These provisions are intended to ensure that the only \n     chemicals to be designated low-priority are those for which \n     EPA both has sufficient information and, based on that \n     information, affirmatively concludes that the substance does \n     not warrant a finding that it may present an unreasonable \n     risk.\n\n\n                    6. Industry Requested Chemicals\n\n       Sec. 6(b)(4)(E) sets the percentage of risk evaluations \n     that the Administrator shall conduct at industry's request at \n     between 25 percent (if enough requests are submitted) and 50 \n     percent. The Administrator should set up a system to ensure \n     that those percentages are met and not exceeded in each \n     fiscal year. An informal effort that simply takes requests as \n     they come in and hopes that the percentages will work out \n     does not meet the requirement that the Administrator \n     ``ensure'' that the percentages be met. Also, clause (E)(ii) \n     makes clear that industry requests for risk evaluations \n     ``shall be'' subject to fees. Therefore, if at any point the \n     fees imposed by the Frank Lautenberg Act (which are subject \n     to a termination in section 26(b)(6)) are allowed to lapse, \n     industry's opportunity to seek risk evaluations will also \n     lapse and the minimum 25 percent requirement will not apply.\n\n\n   7. Pace of and long-term goal for EPA safety reviews of existing \n                               chemicals\n\n       Existing TSCA grandfathered in tens of thousands of \n     chemicals to the inventory without requiring any review of \n     their safety. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the \n     21st Century Act sets in motion a process under which EPA \n     will for the first time systematically review the safety of \n     chemicals in active commerce. While this will take many \n     years, the goal of the legislation is to ensure that all \n     chemicals on the market get such a review. The initial \n     targets for numbers of reviews are relatively low, reflecting \n     current EPA capacity and resources. These targets represent \n     floors, not ceilings, and Senate Democratic negotiators \n     expect that as EPA begins to collect fees, gets procedures \n     established and gains experience, these targets can be \n     exceeded in furtherance of the legislation's goals.\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                   8. ``Maximum'' extent practicable\n\n       Several sections of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety \n     for the 21st Century Act include direction to EPA to take \n     certain actions to ``the extent practicable'', in contrast to \n     language in S 697 as reported by the Senate that actions be \n     taken to ``the maximum extent practicable.'' During House-\n     Senate negotiations on the bill, Senate negotiators were \n     informed that House Legislative Counsel believed the terms \n     ``extent practicable'' and ``maximum extent practicable'' are \n     synonymous, and ultimately Congress agreed to include \n     ``extent practicable'' in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical \n     Safety for the 21st Century Act with the expectation that no \n     change in meaning from S 697 as reported by the Senate be \n     inferred from that agreement.\n\n\n                  9. Cost considerations in rulemaking\n\n       Section 6(c)(2) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act lists \n     what is required in analysis intended to support an EPA rule \n     for a chemical substance or mixture:\n       ``(2) REQUIREMENTS FOR RULE.--``(A) STATEMENT OF EFFECTS.--\n     In proposing and promulgating a rule under subsection (a) \n     with respect to a chemical substance or mixture, the \n     Administrator shall consider and publish a statement based on \n     reasonably available information with respect to--\n       ``(i) the effects of the chemical substance or mixture on \n     health and the magnitude of the exposure of human beings to \n     the chemical substance or mixture;\n       ``(ii) the effects of the chemical substance or mixture on \n     the environment and the magnitude of the exposure of the \n     environment to such substance or mixture;\n       ``(iii) the benefits of the chemical substance or mixture \n     for various uses; and\n       ``(iv) the reasonably ascertainable economic consequences \n     of the rule, including consideration of--\n       ``(I) the likely effect of the rule on the national \n     economy, small business, technological innovation, the \n     environment, and public health;\n       ``(II) the costs and benefits of the proposed and final \n     regulatory action and of the 1 or more primary alternative \n     regulatory actions considered by the Administrator; and\n       ``(III) the cost effectiveness of the proposed regulatory \n     action and of the 1 or more primary alternative regulatory \n     actions considered by the Administrator.\n       The language above specifies the information on effects, \n     exposures and costs that EPA is to consider in determining \n     how to regulate a chemical substance that presents an \n     unreasonable risk as determined in EPA's risk evaluation.\n       Senate Democratic negotiators clarify that sections \n     6(c)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) do not require EPA to conduct a second \n     risk evaluation-like analysis to identify the specified \n     information, but rather, can satisfy these requirements on \n     the basis of the conclusions regarding the chemical's health \n     and environmental effects and exposures in the risk \n     evaluation itself.\n       The scope of the statement EPA is required to prepare under \n     clauses (i)-(iv) is bounded in two important respects. First, \n     it is to be based on information reasonably available to EPA, \n     and hence does not require new information collection or \n     development. Second, EPA's consideration of costs and \n     benefits and cost-effectiveness is limited to the \n     requirements of the rule itself and the 1 or more ``primary'' \n     alternatives it considered, not every possible alternative. \n     The role of the statement required under subparagraph \n     (c)(2)(A) in selecting the restrictions to include in its \n     rule is delineated in subparagraph (c)(2)(B). Under this \n     provision, EPA must ``factor in'' the considerations \n     described in the statement ``to the extent practicable'' and \n     ``in accordance with subsection (a).'' As revised, subsection \n     (a) deletes the paralyzing ``least burdensome'' requirement \n     in the existing law and instructs that EPA's rule must ensure \n     that the chemical substance or mixture ``no longer \n     presents''' the unreasonable risk identified in the risk \n     evaluation. Thus, it is clear that the considerations in the \n     statement required under subparagraph (c)(2)(A) do not \n     require EPA to demonstrate benefits outweigh costs, to \n     definitively determine or select the least-cost alternative, \n     or to select an option that is demonstrably cost-effective or \n     is the least burdensome adequately protective option. Rather, \n     it requires only that EPA take into account the specified \n     considerations in deciding among restrictions to impose, \n     which must be sufficient to ensure that the subject chemical \n     substance no longer presents the unreasonable risk EPA has \n     identified. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the \n     21st Century Act clearly rejects the regulatory approach and \n     framework that led to the failed asbestos ban and phase-out \n     rule of 1989 in Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA 947 F.2d 1201 \n     (5th Cir. 1991).\n\n\n                 10. ``Minimum'' labeling requirements\n\n       Section 6(a) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R Lautenberg \n     Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, ensures that the \n     requirements EPA can impose to address an unreasonable risk \n     to health or the environment include requiring ``clear and \n     adequate minimum'' warnings. The addition of the word \n     ``minimum'' was intended to avoid the sort of litigation that \n     was undertaken in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555 (2009), when \n     a plaintiff won a Supreme Court decision after alleging that \n     the harm she suffered from a drug that had been labeled in \n     accordance with FDA requirements had nevertheless been \n     inadequately labeled under Vermont law. This ensures that \n     manufacturers or processors of chemical substances and \n     mixtures can always take additional measures, if in the \n     interest of protecting health and the environment, it would \n     be reasonable to do so.\n\n\n                      11. Critical Use Exemptions\n\n       Section 6(g) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R Lautenberg \n     Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, authorizes EPA to \n     exempt specific conditions of use from otherwise applicable \n     section 6(a) rule requirements, if EPA makes specified \n     findings. Section 6(g)(4) in turn requires EPA to include in \n     such an exemption conditions that are ``necessary to protect \n     health and the environment while achieving the purposes of \n     the exemption.'' It is Congress' intent that the conditions \n     EPA imposes will protect health and the environment to the \n     extent feasible, recognizing that, by its nature, an \n     exemption will allow for activities that present some degree \n     of unreasonable risk.\n\n\n                       12. Regulatory Compliance\n\n       Several sections of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety \n     for the 21st Century Act clarify the Congressional intent \n     that compliance with federal EPA standards, rules or other \n     requirements shall not preclude liability in circumstances \n     where a reasonable manufacturer or processor or distributor \n     of a chemical substance or mixture could or should have taken \n     additional measures or precautions in the interest of \n     protecting public health and the environment.\n\n\n 13. TSCA as the Primary Statute for the Regulation of Toxic Substances\n\n       EPA's authorities and duties under section 6 of TSCA have \n     been significantly expanded under the Frank R. Lautenberg \n     Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, now including \n     comprehensive deadlines and throughput expectations for \n     chemical prioritization, risk evaluation, and risk \n     management. The interagency referral process and the intra-\n     agency consideration process established under Section 9 of \n     existing TSCA must now be regarded in a different light since \n     TSCA can no longer be construed as a ``gap-filler'' statutory \n     authority of last resort. The changes in section 9 are \n     consistent with this recognition and do not conflict with the \n     fundamental expectation that, where EPA concludes that a \n     chemical presents an unreasonable risk, the Agency should act \n     in a timely manner to ensure that the chemical substance no \n     longer presents such risk. Thus, once EPA has reached this \n     conclusion, Section 9(a) is not intended to supersede or \n     modify the Agency's obligations under Sections 6(a) or 7 to \n     address risks from activities involving the chemical \n     substance, except as expressly identified in a section 9(a) \n     referral for regulation by another agency which EPA believes \n     has sufficient authority to eliminate the risk and where the \n     agency acts in a timely and effective manner to do so.\n       Regarding EPA's consideration of whether to use non-TSCA \n     EPA authorities in order to address unreasonable chemical \n     risks identified under TSCA, the new section 9(b)(2) merely \n     consolidates existing language which was previously split \n     between section 6(c) and section 9(b). It only applies where \n     the Administrator has already determined that a risk to \n     health or the environment associated with a chemical \n     substance or mixture could be eliminated or reduced to a \n     sufficient extent by additional actions taken under other EPA \n     authorities. It allows the Administrator substantial \n     discretion to use TSCA nonetheless, and it certainly does not \n     reflect that TSCA is an authority of last resort in such \n     cases. Importantly, the provision adds a new qualification, \n     not in original TSCA, that the required considerations are to \n     be ``based on information reasonably available to the \n     Administrator'' to ensure that such considerations do not \n     require additional information to be collected or developed. \n     Furthermore, none of these revisions were intended to alter \n     the clear intent of Congress, reflected in the original \n     legislative history of TSCA, that these decisions would be \n     completely discretionary with the Administrator and not \n     subject to judicial review in any manner.\n\n\n          14. Disclosure of Confidential Business Information\n\n       S. 697 as passed by the Senate included several \n     requirements as amendments to sections 8 and 14 of existing \n     TSCA that direct EPA to ``promptly'' make confidential \n     business information public when it determines that \n     protections against disclosure of such information should no \n     longer apply. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the \n     21st Century Act instead directs EPA to remove the \n     protections against disclosure when it determines that they \n     should no longer apply. Because EPA informed Senate \n     negotiators that its practice is to promptly make public \n     information that is no longer protected against disclosure, \n     we see no difference or distinction in meaning between the \n     language in S. 697 as passed and the Frank R. Lautenberg \n     Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, and expect EPA to \n     continue its current practice of affirmatively making public \n     information that is not or no longer protected from \n     disclosure as expeditiously as possible.\n       Subsection 14(d)(9) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, further \n     clarifies the Congressional intent that any information \n     required pursuant to discovery, subpoena, court order, or any \n     other judicial process is always allowable and discoverable \n     under State and Federal law, and not protected from \n     disclosure.\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                         15. Chemical Identity\n\n       Section 14(b)(2) of the bill retains TSCA's provision \n     making clear that information from health and safety studies \n     is not protected from disclosure. It also retains TSCA's two \n     existing exceptions from disclosure of information from \n     health and safety studies: for information where disclosure \n     would disclose either how a chemical is manufactured or \n     processed or the portion a chemical comprises in a mixture. A \n     clarification has been added to the provision to note \n     explicitly that the specific identity of a chemical is among \n     the types of information that need not be disclosed, when \n     disclosing health and safety information, if doing so would \n     also disclose how a chemical is made or the portion a \n     chemical comprises in a mixture. This clarification does not \n     signal any Congressional intent to alter the meaning of the \n     provision, only to clarify its intent.\n\n\n                         16. ``Requirements'''\n\n       Subsection 5(i)(2) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act clarifies \n     the Congressional intent to ensure that state requirements, \n     including legal causes of action arising under statutory or \n     common law, are not preempted or limited in any way by EPA \n     action or inaction on a chemical substance.\n       Subsection 6(j) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, \n     clarifies the Congressional intent to ensure that state \n     requirements, including legal causes of action arising under \n     statutory or common law, are not preempted or limited in any \n     way by EPA action or inaction on a chemical substance.\n\n\n                     17. State-Federal Relationship\n\n       Sections 18(a)(1)(B) and 18(b)(1) of TSCA, as amended by \n     the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century \n     Act, refer to circumstances under which a state may not \n     establish or continue to enforce a ``statute, criminal \n     penalty, or administrative action'' on a chemical substance. \n     Section 18(b)(2) states that ``this subsection does not \n     restrict the authority of a State or political subdivision of \n     a State to continue to enforce any statute enacted, criminal \n     penalty assessed, or administrative action taken''. In an \n     email transmitted by Senate Republican negotiators at 11:45 \n     AM on May 23, 2016, the Senate requested that House \n     Legislative Counsel delete the word ``assessed,'' but this \n     change was not made in advance of the 12 PM deadline to file \n     the bill text with the House Rules Committee. The Senate's \n     clear intent was not to change or in any way limit the \n     meaning of the phrase ``criminal penalty'' in section \n     18(b)(2).\n       Section 18(d)(I) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, \n     references ``risk evaluations''' on chemical substances that \n     may be conducted by states or political subdivisions of \n     states with the clear intent to describe the circumstances in \n     which such efforts would not be preempted by federal action. \n     The term ``Risk Evaluation'' may not be universally utilized \n     in every state or political subdivision of a state, but \n     researching each analogous term used in each state or \n     political subdivision of a state in order to explicitly list \n     it was neither realistic nor possible. The use of this term \n     is not intended to be in any way limiting.\n       Section 18(d)(1)(A)(ii) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, fully \n     preserves the authority of states or political subdivisions \n     of states to impose ``information obligation'' requirements \n     on manufacturers or processors with respect to chemicals they \n     produce or use. The provision cites examples of such \n     obligations: reporting and monitoring or ``other information \n     obligations.'' These may include, but are not limited to, \n     state requirements related to information, such as companies' \n     obligations to disclose use information, to provide warnings \n     or to label products or chemicals with certain information \n     regarding risks and recommended actions to reduce exposure or \n     environmental release.\n       Section 18(d)(2) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, \n     specifies that nothing in this section shall modify the \n     preemptive effect of any prior rule or order by the \n     Administrator prior to the effective date, responding to \n     concerns that prior EPA action on substances such as \n     polychlorinated biphenyls would be potentially immunized from \n     liability for injury or harm.\n       Section 18(e) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, \n     grandfathers existing and enacted state laws and regulatory \n     actions, and requirements imposed now or in the future under \n     the authority of state laws that were in effect on August 31, \n     2003.\n       Section 18(f) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, provides \n     discretionary and mandatory waivers which exempt regulatory \n     action by states and their political subdivisions from any \n     federal preemptive effect. In particular, Subsection \n     18(f)(2)(B) specifies that, where requested, EPA shall grant \n     a waiver from preemption under subsection (b) upon the \n     enactment of any statute, or the proposal or completion of a \n     preliminary administrative action, with the intent of \n     prohibiting or otherwise restricting a chemical substance or \n     mixture, provided these actions occur during the 18-month \n     period after EPA initiates the prioritization process and \n     before EPA publishes the scope of the risk evaluation for the \n     chemical substance (which cannot be less than 12 months after \n     EPA initiates the prioritization process).\n       Section 18(g) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R Lautenberg \n     Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, specifies that no \n     preemption of any common law or statutory causes of action \n     for civil relief or criminal conduct shall occur, and that \n     nothing in this Act shall be interpreted as dispositive or \n     otherwise limiting any civil action or other claim for \n     relief. This section also clarifies the Congressional intent \n     to ensure that state requirements, including legal causes of \n     action arising under statutory or common law, are not \n     preempted or limited in any way by EPA action or inaction on \n     a chemical substance. This section further clarifies \n     Congress' intent that no express, implied, or actual conflict \n     exists between any federal regulatory action and any state, \n     federal, or maritime tort action, responding to the perceived \n     conflict contemplated in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., \n     529 U.S. 861 (2000) and its progeny.\n\n\n                                18. Fees\n\n       Fees under section 26(b), as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, are \n     authorized to be collected so that 25% of EPA's overall costs \n     to carry out section 4, 5, and 6, and to collect, process, \n     review, provide access to and protect from disclosure \n     information, are defrayed, subject to a $25,000,000 cap (that \n     itself can be adjusted for inflation or if it no longer \n     provides 25% of EPA's costs listed above). While the \n     collection of fees is tied to the submission of particular \n     information under sections 4 and 5 or the manufacturing or \n     processing of a particular chemical substance undergoing a \n     risk evaluation under section 6, in general the use of these \n     fees is not limited to defraying the cost of the action that \n     was the basis for payment of the fee. The exception to this \n     general principle is for fees to defray the cost of \n     conducting manufacturer requested risk evaluations, which are \n     independent of the $25 million cap or 25% limit. These must \n     be spent on the particular risk evaluation that was the basis \n     for payment of the fee. This limitation applies only to the \n     fee collected for the purpose of conducting the risk \n     evaluation and does not prevent EPA from collecting further \n     fees from such persons for other purposes for which payment \n     of fees are authorized under the section. For example, if a \n     manufacturer-requested risk evaluation later leads to risk \n     management action, EPA may assign further fees to \n     manufacturers and processors of that substance, subject to \n     the $25,000,000 cap and the requirement to not exceed 25% of \n     overall program costs for carrying out sections 4, 5, and 6, \n     and to collect, process, review, provide access to and \n     protect from disclosure information.\n       We also note that some have raised the possibility that \n     section 26(b)(4)(B)(i)(I), as amended by the Frank R \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, could be \n     read to exclude the cost of risk evaluations, other than \n     industry-requested risk evaluations, from the costs that can \n     be covered by fees. This was not the intent and is not \n     consistent with the statutory language. As clearly indicated \n     in section 26(b)(1), the amended law provides that \n     manufacturers and processors of chemicals subject to risk \n     evaluations be subject to fees, and that fees be collected to \n     defray the cost of administering sections 4, 5, and 6, and of \n     collecting, processing, reviewing and providing access to and \n     protecting from disclosure information. Risk evaluations are \n     a central element of section 6. And as demonstrated by \n     section 6(b)(4)(F)(i), the intent of the bill is that the \n     EPA-initiated risk evaluations be defrayed at the 25% level \n     (subject to the $25,000,000 cap), in contrast to the \n     industry-initiated evaluations, which are funded at the 50% \n     or 100% level. The final citation in section 26(b)(4)(B)(i) \n     should be read as section 6(b)(4)(C)(ii), as it is in section \n     6(b)(4)(F)(i), not to section 6(b) generally.\n\n\n                        19. Scientific Standards\n\n       The term ``weight of evidence'' refers to a systematic \n     review method that uses a pre-established protocol to \n     comprehensively, objectively, transparently, and \n     consistently, identify and evaluate each stream of evidence, \n     including strengths, limitations, and relevance of each study \n     and to integrate evidence as necessary and appropriate based \n     upon strengths, limitations, and relevance.\n       This requirement is not intended to prevent the Agency from \n     considering academic studies, or any other category of study. \n     We expect that when EPA makes a weight of the evidence \n     decision it will fully describe its use and methods.\n\n\n                      20. Partial Risk Evaluations\n\n       Section 26(1)(4) of TSCA, as amended by the Frank R. \n     Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, states\n       ``(4) CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES WITH COMPLETED RISK \n     ASSESSMENTS.--With respect to a chemical substance listed in \n     the 2014 update to the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical \n     Assessments for which the Administrator has published a \n     completed risk assessment prior to the date of enactment of \n     the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century \n     Act, the Administrator may publish proposed and final rules \n     under section 6(a) that are consistent with the scope of the \n     completed risk assessment for the chemical substance and \n     consistent with other applicable requirements of section 6.''\n       EPA has completed risk assessments on TCE, NMP, and MC, but \n     has not yet proposed\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\n     or finalized section 6(a) rules to address the risks that \n     were identified. The risk assessments for these chemicals \n     were not conducted across all conditions of use. During the \n     bi-cameral negotiations, EPA expressed the view that, rather \n     than reexamine and perhaps broaden the scope of these \n     assessments, it is better to proceed with proposed and final \n     rules on the covered chemicals to avoid any delay in the \n     imposition of important public health protections that are \n     known to be needed. Congress shared these concerns. The \n     language House-Senate negotiators included above is intended \n     to allow EPA to proceed with the regulation of these \n     substances if the scope of the proposed and final rules is \n     consistent with the scope of the risk assessments conducted \n     on these substances.\n\n\n                         21. SNURs for Articles\n\n       Section 5(a)(5) addresses the application of significant \n     new use rules (SNURs) to articles or categories of articles \n     containing substances of concern. It provides that in \n     promulgating such SNURs, EPA must make ``an affirmative \n     finding . . . . that the reasonable potential for exposure to \n     the chemical substance through the article or category of \n     articles subject to the rule justifies notification.'' This \n     language clarifies that potential exposure is a relevant \n     factor in applying SNURs to articles. Exposure is a relevant \n     factor in identifying other significant new uses of a \n     chemical substance as well. It is not intended to require EPA \n     to conduct an exposure assessment or provide evidence that \n     exposure to the substance through the article or category of \n     articles will in fact occur. Rather, since the goal of SNURs \n     is to bring to EPA's attention and enable it to evaluate uses \n     of chemicals that could present unreasonable risks, a \n     reasonable expectation of possible exposure based on the \n     nature of the substance or the potential uses of the article \n     or category of articles will be sufficient to ``warrant \n     notification.'' EPA has successfully used the SNUR authority \n     in the existing law to provide for scrutiny of imported \n     articles (many of which are widely used consumer products) \n     that contain unsafe chemicals that have been restricted or \n     discontinued in the U.S. and it's critical that SNURs \n     continue to perform this important public health function \n     under the amended law.\n\n\n                        22. Compliance Deadlines\n\n       The amended law expands on existing section 6(d) by \n     providing that rules under section 6 must include ``mandatory \n     compliance dates.'' These dates can vary somewhat with the \n     type of restriction being imposed but, in general, call for \n     compliance deadlines that ``shall be as soon as practicable, \n     but not later than 5 years after the promulgation of the \n     rule.'' While EPA could in unusual circumstances delay \n     compliance for as long as five years, this should be the \n     exception and not the norm. To realize the risk reduction \n     benefits of the rule, it is expected that compliance \n     deadlines will be as soon as practicable after the rule's \n     effective date as directed in new paragraph 6(d)(1).\n         Senator Barbara Boxer, Ranking Member, Environment and \n           Public Works Committee.\n         Senator Edward J. Markey, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on \n           Superfund, Waste Management and Regulatory Oversight, \n           Environment and Public Works Committee, and cosponsor, \n           Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st \n           Century Act.\n         Senator Tom Udall, lead Democratic author and sponsor, \n           Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st \n           Century Act.\n         Senator Jeffrey A. Merkley, cosponsor, Frank R. \n           Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I know that everyone here shares a \ndesire to fix our chemical safety law, the Toxic Substances Control \nAct, and I appreciate the years of hard work that my colleagues, \nstarting with the late Senator from New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg, put \nin to try to make this bill the best bipartisan compromise it could be.\n  So many parts of this bill strengthen the standards and review \nprocess for chemicals, and I am pleased that we will finally be able to \neffectively regulate chemicals on a Federal level.\n  However, there is one part of the bill that still concerns me: the \npreemption of State laws.\n  Right now, a number of States, including New York, have taken the \nlead in chemical safety and have set standards for their own citizens \nthat are higher than the standards set by the EPA.\n  These State actions have brought the chemical companies to the table \nto finally create a strong federal system for reviewing chemicals for \nsafety.\n  But this bill would significantly limit the rights of individual \nStates to set their own chemical safety standards from this day \nforward.\n  It would prevent a State from regulating or enforcing regulations on \na chemical if the EPA is studying but has not yet ruled on the safety \nof that chemical.\n  But the EPA's review process can take far longer than a State's \nreview process.\n  As a result, if a Governor or a State legislature wanted to develop \ntheir own rules to protect their citizens from a particular chemical \nthat they knew was toxic and posing an imminent threat, their hands \nwould be tied because of this law, and it would be left to the EPA to \ndetermine whether the State's science is valid.\n  Why would we take away this right from our States?\n  The only recourse for States is a burdensome waiver process that does \nnot guarantee that a State will prevail in obtaining a waiver to \ncontinue to protect the health of its families. That is not enough.\n  When it comes to protecting public health, I firmly believe that \nFederal laws should set a floor, not a ceiling, and States should \ncontinue to have the right to protect their citizens from toxic \nchemicals--especially while they wait for the EPA to complete their own \nlengthy studies.\n  No State should be prevented from acting to protect the health and \nsafety of its people when the Federal Government fails to act.\n  No State should be prevented from banning a dangerous chemical, \nsimply because the EPA is taking time to review the substance.\n  So despite all the hard work of my colleagues and the progress that \nhas been made, I cannot vote to undermine my State's ability to protect \nour constituents, and I will vote no on this bill.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n      congressional intent behind specific provisions of the bill\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Senator Vitter and I rise today to discuss a few \nprovisions in the bill with the desire of clarifying what the \nCongressional intent was behind specific provisions of the legislation. \nSenator Vitter, I would like to start with a question to you on the \npurpose of the term ``conditions of use'' and how that term is supposed \nto be applied by EPA in risk evaluations?\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you Senator Inhofe. There are many important \nprovisions of this law and I think clarifying what Congress intended is \nvery important to ensure the legislative intent is understood and \nfollowed. To specifically address your first question, the term \n``conditions of use'' is specifically defined as `the circumstances, as \ndetermined by the Administrator, under which a chemical substance is \nintended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, processed, \ndistributed in commerce, used, or disposed of.' The conditions of use \nof a chemical substance drive the potential for exposure to a chemical. \nExposure potential, when integrated with the hazard potential of a \nchemical, determines a chemical's potential for risk. So EPA's \nunderstanding of a chemical's conditions of use--and importantly it is \nthe circumstances `the Administrator' determines--will be critical to \nEPA's final determination of whether a chemical is safe or presents an \nunreasonable risk that must be controlled. Finally, to address your \nquestion of how this is supposed to be applied by EPA in risk \nevaluations, it is important to note that many TSCA chemicals have \nmultiple uses--industrial, commercial and consumer uses. EPA has \nidentified subcategories of chemical uses for regular chemical \nreporting requirements, so the Agency is well aware that some \ncategories of uses pose greater potential for exposure than others and \nthat the risks from many categories of uses are deemed negligible or \nalready well controlled. The language of the compromise makes clear \nthat EPA has to make a determination on all conditions of use \nconsidered in the scope but the Agency is given the discretion to \ndetermine the conditions of use that the Agency will address in its \nevaluation of the priority chemical. This assures that the Agency's \nfocus on priority chemicals is on conditions of use that raise the \ngreatest potential for risk. This also assures that the Agency can \neffectively assess and control priority chemicals and meet the new \nlaw's strict deadlines. Without this discretion to focus chemical risk \nassessments on certain conditions of use, the Agency's job would be \nmore difficult.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Senator Vitter. That response raised an \ninteresting follow up question I would like\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nto ask. If EPA's final Section 6(a) risk management rule includes a \nrestriction or prohibition on some of the conditions of use identified \nin EPA's scope of the risk evaluation, but not all of them, is it final \nagency action as to those other conditions of use?\n  Mr. VITTER. That is a very important question and the clear intent of \nCongress is the answer is yes. This is because, to be legally \nsufficient according to EPA's own technical assistance, EPA's Section \n6(a) rule must ensure that the chemical substance or mixture no longer \npresents an unreasonable risk. A Section 6(i) order, determining that a \nchemical substance does not present an unreasonable risk under \nconditions of use, is similarly final Agency action applicable to all \nthose conditions of use that were identified in the scope of EPA's risk \nevaluation on the chemical substance. To be clear, every condition of \nuse identified by the Administrator in the scope of the risk evaluation \nmust, and will be either found to present or not present an \nunreasonable risk.\n  Mr. Inhofe, this brings me to a question on the testing EPA has the \nauthority require manufacturers to conduct under this compromise. One \nof the major flaws in TSCA is the so-called `catch 22' under which EPA \ncannot require testing of chemicals without first making a finding that \nthe chemical may present an unreasonable risk. In TSCA's history, EPA \nhas been able to make that finding only for about 200 chemicals. Does \nthe compromise remedy that provision of TSCA?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is clear that the compromise directs EPA to \nsystematically evaluate more chemicals than ever before. To help the \nAgency meet that objective, the compromise does two things. First, EPA \ncan issue a test rule or order if it finds that a chemical substance \nmay present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. In \nthis case, an EPA order would be a final agency action subject to \njudicial review. EPA would be well-advised to consider the practice of \nissuing a `statement of need' similar to that required under section \n4(a)(3) when using this authority.\n  The section also provides EPA discretionary authority to require \ntesting--by rule, order or consent agreement--when EPA determines that \nnew information is necessary to review a pre-manufacture notice under \nsection 5, to conduct a risk evaluation under section 6, or to \nimplement rules or orders under those sections. The compromise also \nrecognizes that EPA may need new information to prioritize a chemical \nsubstance for review, to assess certain exports, and at the request of \nanother federal agency. To use this discretionary order authority, EPA \nmust issue a `statement of need' that explains the need for new \ntesting/exposure information. It must describe how available \ninformation has informed the decision to require new information, \nwhether vertebrate animal testing is needed, and why an order is \npreferred to a rule.\n  Section 4 of the compromise also requires EPA to use `tiered' \nscreening and testing processes. This means EPA must require less \nexpensive, less complex screening tests to determine whether higher \nlevel testing is required. This is an efficient approach to testing \nchemicals that is based on EPA experience in other testing programs \nTiered testing will also help assure that EPA is meeting the objective \nto minimize animal testing that is set out in the compromise.\n  Finally, section 4 prohibits the creation of a `minimum information \nrequirement' for the prioritization of chemicals. That is a very \nimportant provision that should be applied to any and all testing by \nthe Agency regardless of which authority it uses.\n  Senator Vitter, in addition to new testing authorities the bill also \nmakes changes to TSCA in the new chemicals program under section 5 \nwhich has been largely viewed as one of the major strengths of existing \nlaw. It has been credited with spurring innovation in chemistry used \nfor new products and technologies throughout the value chain. The \nindustry we're regulating in TSCA is highly innovative: 17 percent of \nall US patents are chemistry or chemistry related. Clearly Congress has \nan interest in preserving the economic engine that is the business of \nU.S. chemistry, while ensuring that EPA appropriately reviews new \nchemical substances and significant new uses. How does the compromise \nbalance these interests?\n  Mr. VITTER. Protecting innovation and not materially altering the new \nchemicals process was a critical part of the final compromise. Every \neffort was made to ensure EPA has the right tools to review new \nchemical substances but the amendments to this section were intended to \nconform closely with EPA's current practice and maintain the Agency's \ntimely reviews that allow substances to market within the statutory \ndeadlines. First, the compromise retains the 90-day review period for \nEPA to make a risk-based decision on a new chemical, without \nconsideration of costs or other non-risk factors. Second, when EPA does \nnot have the information sufficient for the evaluation of a new \nchemical, or when EPA determines that a new chemical may present an \nunreasonable risk, the compromise requires EPA regulate the new \nchemical to the extent necessary to protect against unreasonable risk. \nOnce sufficient information is available, of course, EPA must make a \ndecision. These requirements largely reflect EPA's practice today, \nunder which EPA can allow the new chemical on the market but with \nlimits. Finally, if EPA determines that a new chemical is not likely to \npresent an unreasonable risk, EPA must make a statement to that effect \nbefore the end of the 90 day period. This provision ensures that \nchemicals considered not likely to pose an unreasonable risk are not \ndelayed in getting to market.\n\n  Importantly, EPA would not stop reviewing new chemical notices while \nit develops any policies, procedures and guidance needed to implement \nthese new provisions in Section 5. The compromise is very clear: EPA \nshould not stop or slow its review of new chemicals while it develops \nany needed new policies procedures or guidance for Section 5. Also by \namending Section 5 to require EPA make an affirmative finding before \nmanufacturing or processing of a substance may commence, Congress did \nnot intend to trigger the requirements of any other environmental laws. \nThis again maintains the consistency with how EPA currently administers \nthe new chemicals program under existing law.\n  Senator Inhofe, this leads me to another question on a provision that \nis rather technical and has been misunderstood by many and that is \nnomenclature. After the TSCA Inventory was established in 1979, \nquestions arose about the appropriate chemical `nomenclature' to be \nused to list these chemical substances. EPA addressed many of these \nquestions in a series of guidance documents. The compromise includes a \nprovision on nomenclature. What is this provision intended to do?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Senator Vitter. These provision are very \nimportant to many major domestic producers including manufacturers of \nproducts like glass, steel, cement, along with domestic energy \nproducers across the country. The chemical nomenclature provision in \nsection 8 of the compromise addresses several issues critical to the \nefficient functioning of the new chemical regulatory framework.\n  For the purposes of the TSCA Inventory, a single, defined molecule is \nsimple to name. For example, ethanol is a Class 1 chemical on the TSCA \nInventory. Its identity does not depend on how it is made. Since one \nethanol is chemically the same as another ethanol, a new producer of \nethanol can use the existing ethanol chemical listed on the TSCA \nInventory. For other substances known as Class 2 chemicals, \nnomenclature is more complex. For those substances, the name of the \nsubstance typically includes either--or both--The source material and \nthe process used to make it. The compromise requires EPA to maintain \nthe Class 2 nomenclature system, as well as certain nomenclature \nconventions in widespread use since the early days of TSCA.\n  The compromise also directs EPA to continue to recognize the \nindividual members of categories of chemical substances as being on the \nTSCA inventory. The individual members of these categories are defined \nin inventory descriptions developed by EPA. In addition, the compromise \npermits manufacturers or processors to request that EPA recognize a \nchemical substance\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\ncurrently identified on the TSCA Inventory under multiple nomenclatures \nas `equivalents.'\n  Importantly, the equivalency provision relates only to chemical \nsubstances that are already on the TSCA Inventory. Although the \nequivalency provision specifically references substances that have \nChemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers, EPA could usefully apply an \nequivalency approach to substances on the Inventory that do not have \nCAS numbers as well, such as for naturally-occurring substances.\n  Now, Senator Vitter, once a chemical is on the inventory, information \nabout the substance that is provided to EPA often contains sensitive \nproprietary elements that need protecting. There has been a significant \ndebate in recent years regarding the protection from public disclosure \nof a confidential chemical identity provided in a health and safety \nstudy under TSCA section 14(b). Although new section 14(b) is \nsubstantially similar to the existing statute, what is the intent \nbehind the additional language related to formulas?\n  Mr. VITTER. It was the Congressional intent of the legation to \nbalance the need to ensure public access to health and safety studies \nwith the need to protect from public disclosure valuable confidential \nbusiness information (CBI) and trade secrets that are already exempt \nfrom mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. \nStriking the appropriate balance between public disclosure on the one \nhand, and the protection of a company's valuable intellectual property \nrights embodied in CBI and trade secrets on the other hand, is \nessential to better informing the public regarding decisions by \nregulatory authorities with respect to chemical, while encouraging \ninnovation and economic competitiveness.\n  The compromise retains the language of existing section 14(b) to make \nclear that the Administrator is not prohibited from disclosing health \nand safety studies, but that certain types of CBI and trade secrets \ndisclosed within health and safety studies must always be protected \nfrom disclosure. The new, additional language in this section is \nintended to clarify that confidential chemical identities--which \nincludes chemical names, formulas and structures--may themselves reveal \nCBI or trade secret process information. In such cases, the \nconfidential chemical identity must always be protected from \ndisclosure. The new language is not limiting; it makes clear that any \nother information that would reveal proprietary or trade secret \nprocesses is similarly protected. In other cases involving confidential \nchemical identities, EPA should continue to strike an appropriate \nbalance between protection of proprietary CBI or trade secrets, and \nensuring public access to health and safety information.\n  In addition to the protection of confidential information, another \ncritically important provision in the deal was preemption. Senator \nInhofe could you describe how the compromise address the relationship \nbetween State governments and the Federal government?\n  Mr. INHOFE. As we all recognize, the preemption section of this bill \nwas the most contentious issue of the negotiations as well as the most \nimportant linchpin in the final deal. The compromise includes several \nnotable provisions. First, it is clear that when a chemical has \nundergone a risk evaluation and determined to pose no unreasonable \nrisk, any state chemical management action to restrict or regulate the \nsubstance is preempted. This outcome furthers Congress's legislative \nobjective of achieving uniform, risk-based chemical management \nnationally in a manner that supports robust national commerce. Federal \ndeterminations reached after the risk evaluation process that a \nchemical presents no significant risk in a particular use should be \nviewed as determinative and not subject to different interpretations on \na state-by-state or locality-by-locality basis. Further, under the new \nlegislation, EPA will make decisions based on conditions of use, and \nmust consider various conditions of use, so there could be \ncircumstances where EPA determines that a chemical does not present an \nunreasonable risk in certain uses, but does in others. Preemption for \nno significant risk determinations would apply as these determinations \nare made on a use-by-use basis.\n\n  Second, to promote the engagement of all stakeholders in the risk \nevaluation process--including State governments--thee compromise \ncreates a temporary preemption period for identified high priority \nchemicals moving through EPA's risk evaluation process. The period only \nruns from the time EPA defines the scope of the evaluation to the time \nthat EPA finishes the evaluation, or the agency deadline runs out. It \ndoes not apply to the first 10 TSCA Work Plan chemicals the EPA \nreviews, and it does not apply to manufacturer-requested risk \nevaluations. It does apply to any and all other chemical substances EPA \nchoses to review through a risk evaluation. States with compelling \ncircumstances can request and be granted a vysaiver by EPA. These \nwaiver and scope limitations ensure that the piause has its intended \neffect--to ensure that there is one, comprehensive, nationally-led risk \nevaluation occurring at a time, allowing EPA and affected manufacturers \nto focus on and complete the work on a timely basis, and to ensure a \nuniform and consistent federal approach to risk evaluation and risk \nmanagement.\n  Senator Vitter, despite the fact that this law regulates products in \ncommerce and Congress has the authority and Constitutional duty to \nprotect interstate commerce, efforts were made to give States a role in \nthis process, and even to get waivers from preemption where State \nactions are adequately justified. It should be noted that nothing \nprecludes State action on chemical substances that are not the subject \nof an EPA risk evaluation or decision. There is also nothing in the \ncompromise that precludes states from offering opinions, advice, or \ncomment during the risk evaluation process. The risk evaluation process \nanticipates numerous opportunities for public comment. It is our hope \nthat States with an interest in a particular chemical substance will in \nfact bring forward relevant scientific information on chemical hazards, \nuses and exposures to inform an effective federal decision. This will \nensure that EPA is making the most informed decisions for the citizens \nof the United States as a whole, rather than one State affording \nprotection to only a fraction of the country.\n  Senator Vitter, before we conclude our discussion on preemption, I \nwould to ask you to help clarify the intent of the preemption provision \nas it relates to actions taken prior to enactment of the Frank \nLautenberg bill.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Senator Inhofe, for those important \nclarifications to preemption and for another question that is very \nimportant to clarify in order to capture the full conngressional intent \nof the bills preemption section. This Act is intended to change the \npreemption provisions of TSCA only with respect to regulations \npromulgated and actions taken under this Act after its effective date. \nThis Act is not intended to alter any preemptive effect on common law \nor state positive law of regulations promulgated or administrative \nactions taken under preexisting authorities, and is not intended to \nmake any statement regarding legal rights under preexisting \nauthorities, including TSCA sections 6 and 17 in effect prior to the \neffective date of this Act.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate your clarification on the intent of an \nimportant aspect of preemption under this act and also wanted to follow \nup with a question on judicial review. Specifically, what changes to \nTSCA's judicial review provisions have been made in the compromise?\n  Mr. VITTER. When TSCA was first enacted in 1976, the Act created a \nhigher level of judicial review for certain rulemakings that would \nrestrict chemicals in commerce. Congress took this approach because it \nwanted to ensure that rulemakings that would directly affect commerce \nby imposing restrictions on chemicals would be well supported with \nsubstantial evidence. The substantial evidence standard requires an \nagency rule to be supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking \nrecord taken as a whole. The compromise legislation makes no changes to \nthe process for judicial review of rulemakings or the standard of \nreview.\n  The compromise now provides EPA with expanded authority to pursue \ncertain administrative actions by order in\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\naddition to by rule. This new order authority is intended to allow EPA \ngreater flexibility to move quickly to collect certain information and \ntake certain actions. It is intended that an agency order constitute \nfinal agency action on issuance and be subject to judicial review. \nOrders under Sections 4, 5, and 6 of TSCA constitute final agency \naction on issuance, and continue to be reviewed under the standards \nestablished by the Administrative Procedures Act. The intention is that \nregulatory actions that result in total or partial bans of chemicals, \nregardless of whether such action is by rule or order authority, be \nsupported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record taken as a \nwhole.\n  Senator Inhofe, before we are done I think there are a few other \nsections of the bill that have been less discussed that it would be \nimportant to touch on. The first is Section 9 of TSCA which discusses \nthe relationship between this and other laws. Could you please speak to \nwhat the intent of this bill with regards to Section 9 is?\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senate Report language states that section 9 of TSCA \nprovides EPA with discretionary authority to address unreasonable risks \nof chemical substances and mixtures under other environmental laws. \n``For example, if the Administrator finds that disposal of a chemical \nsubstance may pose risks that could be prevented or reduced under the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act, the Administrator should ensure that the \nrelevant office of the EPA receives that information.''\n  Likewise, the House Report on section 9 of TSCA states: ``For \nexample, if the Administrator determines that a risk to health or the \nenvironment associated with disposal of a chemical substance could be \neliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent under the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act, the Administrator should use those authorities to protect \nagainst the risk.''\n  This act states in new section 9(a)(5) of TSCA that the Administrator \nshall not be relieved of any obligation to take appropriate action to \naddress risks from a chemical substance under sections 6(a) and 7, \nincluding risks posed by disposal of the chemical substance or mixture. \nConsistent with the Senate and House reports, this provision means that \nthe Administrator should use authorities under the other laws such as \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act to prevent or reduce the risks associated \nwith disposal of a chemical substance or mixture.\n  Senator Vitter, I know another section that is very important to you \nis the language around sound science and we all know you have worked to \nensure that this bill fixes the scientific concerns of the National \nAcademy of Science and other scientific bodies who have raised concerns \nwith the way EPA has reviewed chemicals in the past. Could you please \ndiscuss the Congressional intent of the bills science provisions?\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you Senator Inhofe, the sound science provisions \nwere a critical part of TSCA reform in my opinion and I hope this bill \nserves as a model for how to responsibly reform other laws administered \nby EPA and other Federal Agencies that are tasked to make decisions \nbased on science. For far too long Federal agencies have manipulated \nscience to fit predetermined political outcomes, hiding information and \nunderlying data, rather than using open and transparent science to \njustify fair and objective decision making. This Act seeks to change \nall of that and ensure that EPA uses the best available science, bases \nscientific decisions on the weight of the scientific evidence rather \nthan one or two individual cherry-picked studies, and forces a much \ngreater level of transparency that forces EPA to show their work to \nCongress and the American public.\n  Congress recognized the need to use available studies, reports and \nrecommendations for purposes of chemical assessments rather than \ncreating them from whole cloth. We do believe, however, that the \nrecommendations in reports of the National Academy of Sciences should \nnot be the sole basis of the chemical assessments completed by EPA. \nRather, the EPA must conduct chemical assessments consistent with all \napplicable statutory provisions and agency guidelines, policies and \nprocedures. Further, in instances where there were other studies and \nreports unavailable at the time of the NAS recommendations, EPA should \ntake advantage of those studies and reports in order to ensure that the \nscience used for chemical assessments is the best available and most \ncurrent science.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you for clarifying the Congressional intent of the \nimportant science provisions in this bill. I wanted to ask you one \nfinal question that is another key element to reforming this outdated \nlaw. It should be clear to all that H.R. 2576 attempts to ensure that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency takes the possible exposures to \nsensitive subpopulations into account when prioritizing, assessing and \nregulating high priority chemical substances. The goal, of course, is \nto ensure that factors that may influence exposures or risk are \nconsidered as the Agency assesses and determines the safety of chemical \nsubstances.\n  A concern, however, could be that the language regarding sensitive \nsubpopulations may be read by some to promote the concept of ``low dose \nlinearity'' or ``no threshold'' for many chemicals, including \nsubstances that are not carcinogens. This concept has not been firmly \nestablished in the scientific community. Does H.R. 2576 address this \nconcern?\n  Mr. VITTER. That is an important question Senator Inhofe and I \nappreciate the opportunity to clarify. The Lautenberg bill tries to \naddress the concern about forcing paralysis by analysis in several \nways. First, the bill establishes that `unreasonable risk under the \nconditions of use' as the safety standard to be applied by EPA. \n``Unreasonable risk'' does not mean no risk; it means that EPA must \ndetermine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the risks posed by a \nspecific high priority substance are reasonable in the circumstances of \nexposure and use. Second, the bill requires EPA to specifically \nidentify the sensitive subpopulations that are relevant to and within \nthe scope of the safety assessment and determination on the substance \nin question. At the same time, EPA should identify the scientific basis \nfor the susceptibility, to ensure transparency for all stakeholders. In \nthis way, the legislation affords EPA the discretion to identify \nrelevant subpopulations but does not require--or expect--that all \nhypothetical subpopulations be addressed.\n  While a principle element of this compromise is including protections \nfor potentially susceptible subpopulations to better protect pregnant \nwomen and children, a core of the bill since it was first introduced by \nSenator Lautenberg and I was never to require the national standard to \nbe protective of every identified subpopulation in every instance. If a \nchemical substance is being regulated in a condition of use that we \nknow has no exposure to a subpopulation, EPA should apply the \n``unreasonable risk'' standard appropriately. In addition, it is clear \nthat the concept of low dose linearity is not firmly established by the \nscience, and the concept is not appropriate to apply as a default in \nrisk evaluations.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much for that explanation, Senator Vitter.\n\n\n                Mercury-Specific Provisions in the bill\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we rise to highlight two mercury-\nspecific provisions--the creation of a mercury inventory and expansion \nof the export ban to certain mercury compounds--in the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act that the Senate \nwill approve tonight. These provisions are sections of the Mercury Use \nReduction Act that we introduced in the 112th Congress with the late \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, after whom this legislation is named, and \nwith then-Senator John Kerry. Senator Leahy and Senator Merkley have \nbeen longtime partners in these efforts. Senator Leahy was a leader in \nthe Senate's consideration of a resolution of disapproval concerning \nthe Bush administration's mercury rule. I yield to Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. Leahy. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse. His leadership \nin this area has been paramount.\n  Under the mercury inventory provision, the EPA will be required to \nprepare an inventory of mercury supply, use, and trade in the United \nStates every 3 years. Despite an EPA commitment in 2006 to collect this \ndata, there is not yet any good data on mercury\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nsupply and uses in the United States. This lack of data has impacted \nour ability to reduce health risks from mercury exposure and would \ncompromise our ability to comply with the Minamata Convention of \nMercury, which will come into force next year and to which the U.S. \nGovernment has agreed to become a party. When preparing the inventory, \nEPA shall identify the remaining manufacturing and product uses in the \nUnited States and recommend revisions to federal laws or regulations \nfor addressing the remaining uses. The term ``revisions'' in this \nprovision includes both new laws or regulations or modifications to \nexisting law.\n  To provide the data needed to compile the inventory, companies \nproducing or importing mercury or mercury compounds or using mercury or \nmercury compounds will be required to report on this activity under a \nrule to be issued by the Administrator. To minimize any reporting \nburden, EPA must coordinate its reporting with State mercury product \nreporting requirements through the Interstate Mercury Education and \nReduction Clearinghouse, IMERC. In addition, the provision excludes \nwaste management activities already reported under the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act, RCRA, from this reporting, unless the \nwaste management activity produces mercury via retorts or other \ntreatment operations. A company engaged in both waste generation or \nmanagement and mercury manufacture or use must report on the mercury \nmanufacture and use activity, since that data would not be provided \nunder the RCRA reporting. I yield to Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy.\n  The second mercury provision builds upon the Mercury Export Ban Act \nof 2008, expanding the export ban currently in effect for elemental \nmercury to certain mercury compounds previously identified by EPA or \nother regulatory bodies as capable of being traded to produce elemental \nmercury in commercial quantities and thereby undermine the existing \nexport ban. The mercury compound export ban would go into effect in \n2020, providing EPA and companies ample preparation time. An exemption \nis provided to allow the landfilling of these compounds in Canada, a \nmember country to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment, OECD, with which we have a bilateral arrangement to allow \nthese cross-border transfers. The export is only authorized for \nlandfilling; no form of mercury or mercury compound recovery, reuse, or \ndirect use is permitted. EPA must evaluate whether such exports should \ncontinue within 5 years, in part based upon available domestic disposal \noptions, and report to Congress on this evaluation so we may revise the \nlaw as needed. I have been happy to partner with Senator Whitehouse and \nSenator Leahy on these issues.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Merkley. We are \npleased these provisions were included in a bill and believe it is \nfitting they are included in a package designed to protect the public \nfrom toxic chemicals, like mercury, and named after the late Frank \nLautenberg, one of the original cosponsors of the Mercury Use Reduction \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will yield the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is all the time remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is all the time remaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will not use 7\\1/2\\ minutes, but I will be using that \nafter the vote. I do want to include one more person who has not been \nthanked, and that is Senator McCain.\n  Right now we are in the middle of the must-pass bill every year, the \nDefense authorization bill. He was kind enough to allow us to work this \nin during his very busy schedule on this bill, which we are trying to \nget through this week. So I do thank him very much.\n  It is important, even though we thank the same people over and over \nagain. When it gets to Dimitri, I am going to pronounce his name right, \nand I will be thanking him and several others. With that, I yield our \ntime back.\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I just want to once again compliment Senator Inhofe and \nSenator Vitter. It didn't have to wind up this way. It wound up this \nway because you reached across the aisle, because you ensured that all \nsides were given a fair hearing, and that at the end of the day there \nwould be this result.\n  I have been doing this for 40 years. I have been on the Environment \nCommittee for 40 years. This is not easy. From my perspective, it is \nhistoric and it is unprecedented in terms of ultimately how easy the \nSenator made this process. I was there at the table of Superfund, Clean \nAir Act, all the way down the line. You--you, my friend, have \ndistinguished yourself, and along with Senator Vitter you have made it \npossible for all of us to hold hands here as this historic bill tonight \nwill pass on the Senate floor.\n  I just wanted to compliment the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nMassachusetts very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield back our time and ask for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nconcur.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me go through the list. As I made the \nstatement, it is important that people recognize how long staff works \naround here. Quite frankly, I have often said, when they come around \nfor a report from our committee--the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, the committee that has the largest jurisdiction in the \nentire U.S. Senate--we are the committee that gets things done.\n  If we look at the variety of philosophies that are present praising \nthis work that is being done, we had the very most conservative to the \nvery most progressive of Members, and it is not just this bill. We did \nthe highway reauthorization bill, something that had to wait for about \n8 years to get done, the largest one since 1998. We had the WRDA bill, \nwhich we anticipate is going to be a reality. It has come out of our \ncommittee. This committee also has jurisdiction over the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and then all of the public works. As my ranking \nmember, Senator Boxer, has said several times during this process, we \nget things done.\n  Now, we do disagree on a lot of the issues on the environment. As I \nsay to my good friends on the other side of the aisle, you have every \nright to be wrong, but we get things done, and I appreciate that very \nmuch.\n  Senator McCain, I already thanked you for yielding to us to allow us \nto pass one of the most significant bills which we just passed by voice \nvote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to be thanked again.\n  Mr. UDALL. I am ready to do that also, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I will just also--has the Senator finished?\n  I just wanted to say a few closing words and thank a few more people \nstaying to the end, but of course the chairman needs to finish his \nremarks.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me just quickly say--because I do want to make sure \nwe get on the record on this, Senators Vitter and Udall, certainly the \nSenator from New Mexico. The way we have worked together is remarkable. \nThe Senator has brought in Bonnie to do the work she has done. I know \nshe wanted to be here as we are voting on this bill, but it got down to \ndo we want to get it done tonight or do we want to take a chance for \nlater.\n  Dimitri Karakitsos, all these were working. Jonathan Black with \nSenator Udall's office has been great, and Andrew Wallace so ably \nrepresented Senator Udall in those negotiations. I thank Michal \nFreedhoff in Senator Markey's office for the hours of work he poured \ninto this bill. I also thank Adrian Deveny with Senator Merkley for his \nwork in these negotiations and Adam Zipkin representing Senator\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nBooker. A special thanks goes to Bill Ghent and Emily Spain with \nSenator Carper. Senator Carper has not been mentioned much tonight, but \nhe has been very active in getting this done. Emily Enderle with \nSenator Whitehouse. Senators Carper, Whitehouse, Merkley, and Booker \nhave been partners in getting this completed. Finally, I appreciate, as \nI have said many times before, Senator Boxer and her team, Bettina \nPoirier and Jason Albritton, for working with us in support of this \nbill. We have done not just this bill but a lot of bills in the \ncommittee, and these same characters keep coming up. So it is the staff \nwho has driven this thing. I have to say, my chief of staff, the one \nmost prominent on the committee, obviously did so much of the work on \nthis. So, Ryan Jackson, you did a great job.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank the chairman. I just want to say to Chairman \nInhofe, the bipartisanship he showed is incredible, and it showed what \na significant accomplishment we could have.\n  I also want to thank so much Senator McCain for allowing us to fit a \nlittle slice here in the middle of this very important bill, the NDAA, \nwhich I know he works on all year long. He does a terrific job. He \nallowed us to come in.\n  He knew my uncle, Mo Udall. They served together in the House. I \nsaid: I hope you will do this for Mo. He just got a very big smile on \nhis face because he spent so much time with him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. UDALL. I will yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I save one of the best for last, and that is Alex \nHerrgott. I neglected to mention him.\n  Mr. UDALL. Of course, Alex, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use enough time here to \njust get through my thank-yous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. The House and the Senate passed bills. We didn't actually \ngo through conference committee, but we worked hard on those \ndifferences from late December through just a few weeks ago. We faced \nchallenges working out a final agreement with the House. We had two \nvery different bills. Both had broad bipartisan support, but they took \nvery different paths to fix our broken chemical safety program, but we \nworked through those issues too. Although this was not a formal \nconference, it was a true bicameral process with a lot of give-and-\ntake. To that end, I want to ensure the record reflects a number of \nviews that I and some of my colleagues have about the final product.\n  We are not filing a traditional conference report, but Senators \nBoxer, Markey, Merkley, and I have prepared a document to enshrine the \nviews we have on the compromised language. That will be added to the \nRecord for posterity on our final product.\n  I thank all of our Senate and House colleagues who were instrumental \nin pulling this together. Again, Chairman Inhofe was a driving force, \nand Senators Vitter, Crapo, Capito, and Senators Merkley, Markey, and \nBoxer. Throughout this entire process, Ranking Member Boxer and I \ndidn't always agree. We are of the same party, but we also have \ndifferent opinions about the most important aspects of this \nlegislation. I want to say I sincerely appreciate her work and \nadvocacy, especially on State preemption. She is a force. All of my \ncolleagues know that. She worked hard to improve this bill. The \nlegislative process is an important one, and I believe it played out to \na good resolution.\n  I also thank her and her staff, Bettina Poirier and Jason Albritton, \nfor their dedication and work. Then, my staff members who have been \nmentioned here several times were crucial: Jonathan Black, Andrew \nWallace, Mike Collins, Bianca Ortiz Wertheim, and all my staff who over \nthese 3 years kicked in and helped out when the heavy burden was on the \nfolks I have mentioned.\n  On the House side, I thank Chairman Fred Upton, Subcommittee Chairman \nJohn Shimkus, of course Leader Pelosi, Democrat Whip Hoyer, Ranking \nMember Pallone, and Representatives DeGette and Green. They all worked \ntirelessly to advocate for reform.\n  I would like to mention their staff members as well: Republican \nstaff, Dave McCarthy, Jerry Couri, Tina Richardson, Chris Sarley, and \nthe Democratic staff, Rick Kessler, Jackie Cohen, Tuley Wright, Jean \nFrucci, and especially Mary Frances Repko with Representative Hoyer's \noffice, and Eleanor Bastion and Sergio Espinosa with Representatives \nDeGette's and Green's offices. All these staff and so many more worked \ntirelessly to advocate for their members and shape and move this \ncomplex and important legislation, and of course my own staff and many \nmore whom I did not mention, many Senate and House staff who have come \nand gone over the long process but played very important roles. There \nare too many to try and list, but let me say thanks to the good folks \nat the House and Senate legislative counsel offices. Throughout this \nprocess, we used both offices a tremendous amount and appreciated their \npatience and good work, especially Michelle Johnson-Weider, Maureen \nContreni, and Deanna Edwards at the Senate legislative counsel.\n  A law like this takes so much work from all these offices and staff. \nI know my own staff could not have possibly done it without the \nexpertise and advice of the experts at the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Of course, Administrator Gina McCarthy and her top assistant, \nAdministrator Jim Jones, deserve a great deal of gratitude for all they \ndid to help support our efforts and ensure we got it right, and many \ncongressional liaisons, program officers, and lawyers from the general \ncounsel's office. My staff and others spent many evenings and weekends \nwith EPA experts on calls to make sure we were getting the text right. \nHere are just a few: Wendy Cleland-Hamnet, Ryan Wallace, Priscilla \nFlattery, Kevin McLean, Brian Grant, David Berol, Laura Vaught, Nichole \nDistefano, Sven-Erik Kaiser, Tristan Brown, Ryan Schmit, Don Sadowsky, \nand Scott Sherlock. I thank them all and put them on alert: The real \njob for the EPA is only beginning.\n  I am about finished, Senator Markey.\n  Mr. MARKEY. One second. I just wanted to reinforce what the Senator \njust said. On the House side, Fred Upton, Frank Pallone, Nancy Pelosi, \nand Steny Hoyer, that incredible staff, Mary Frances Repko, over there, \njust indispensable. That is why it happened. It is bipartisan, \nbicameral.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank the Senator. He knows, because he has served so \nmany years, how important it is to have good staff. I want to make sure \nwe get them thanked here. I appreciate that.\n\n  Implementation of this law is going to be extremely important. As the \nranking member on the Appropriations Committee with jurisdiction over \nEPA, I will remain very involved in ensuring that this law gets \nimplemented well.\n  Finally, I also recognize all the great advocates for reform who \npushed Congress to act and kept pushing until we did act. Of course, I \nneed to start by thanking the Environmental Defense Fund. In \nparticular, Fred Krupp and his staff, Richard Denison, Joanna Slaney, \nand Jack Pratt. Let me also thank Dr. Lynn Goldman, the dean of Public \nHealth at George Washington University, and the good advocates at Moms \nClean Air Force, the Humane Society, the National Wildlife Federation, \nthe March of Dimes, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, \nthe Building Trades, the American Association of Justice, and so many \nothers. They reminded us that we are working for reform that would \nimprove the lives of countless mothers, fathers, and children. From New \nMexico to Michigan, from California to Maine, they reminded us that the \nAmerican people need a working chemical safety program.\n  I know there are many other groups in the environmental and public \nhealth community that took a different approach to our bill. I \nunderstand and appreciate where they were coming from--groups like \nSafer Chemicals, Healthy Families, and the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil. They brought passion and conviction to the debate and stood \nfirm on principles. They played a great and important role, and I want \nto thank them for that.\n  Good legislation takes work. It takes give-and-take from everyone, \nincluding industry groups, the American Chemistry Council, the American \nCleaning Institute, and over 100 other members of the American Alliance \nfor Innovation. Thank you for engaging in the\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nprocess to get this done. Many thousands of Americans have worked for \nchemical safety reform over the last four decades. I am thanking you \nfor not giving up.\n  My dad always said--and Senator McCain knew my father Stewart Udall--\n``Get it done, but get it done right.'' And today I can say that not \nonly did we get it done, but we got it done right. Let's not forget, \nthis is just one step in the process. We must find a way to work \ncollaboratively as we turn to the next step--implementation. \nImplementation needs to be done and needs to be done right.\n  I look forward to working with all of these members and groups to \nensure we have a strong, workable chemical safety program.\n  Thank you, Senator McCain. I am sorry if this went longer than you \nexpected. I know my Uncle Mo is looking down and saying thank you to \nyou and my father Stewart and the long relationship you have had with \nthe Udall family and the chapters in your books about Mo Udall and that \nrelationship. So thank you so much, and I thank also Ranking Member \nJack Reed for his patience. I know the hour is getting late. Thank you \nso much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  I just wonder if there is anyone left in America whom he has not \nthanked.\n  Mr. UDALL. I did my best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3511-1"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3525-S3534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4549 to Amendment No. 4229\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4549 to McCain \namendment No. 4229, and I ask unanimous consent that it be reported by \nnumber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4549 to amendment No. 4229.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize parity for defense and nondefense spending \n             pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1513.

Mr. President, I look forward to a very thoughtful debate \ntomorrow. Senator McCain has introduced an amendment that would \nincrease spending with respect to the Department of Defense and related \nfunctions. In this amendment, we are proposing an additional increase \nin nondefense programs. I look forward to tomorrow.\n  I thank the chairman for his consideration through the process of \nthis floor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island and \nlook forward to vigorous debate on both the initial amendment and the \nsecond-degree amendment proposed by my friend from Rhode Island. I \nwould like to engage in very vigorous debate on both, and hopefully, \nfor the benefit of my colleagues, cloture on both will be filed by the \nmajority leader and hopefully we can finish debate on it either late \nmorning tomorrow or early afternoon, if necessary, so we can move on to \nother amendments.\n  Let's have no doubt about how important this debate and discussion on \nthis amendment will be tomorrow. We are talking about $18 billion. In \nthe case of the Senator from Rhode Island, I am sure there are numerous \nbillions more as well. I think it deserves every Members' attention and \ndebate.\n  I say to my friend from Rhode Island, I certainly understand the \npoint of view and the position they have taken, and from a glance at \nthis, it looks like there are some areas of funding that are related to \nnational security that I think are supportable. There are others that \nare not, but we look forward to the debate tomorrow, and hopefully any \nMember who wants to be involved will come down and engage in this \ndebate. We would like to wrap it up tomorrow because there are a number \nof other amendments pending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it was extraordinary to watch this \nbipartisan effort on TSCA.\n  An hour ago, Senator Peters and I thought we were going to have floor \ntime for some brief remarks. I would like to ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Peters have the chance to address the issues he thought he was \ngoing to address, and he is going to be brief. I will go next. I will \nbe brief. I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Peters' \nremarks, I be allowed to address the Senate briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4138\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to thank Chairman McCain and \nRanking Member Reed for their support and for their help in passing the \nPeters amendment No. 4138 to the National Defense Authorization Act. I \nalso would like to thank my colleagues Senators Daines, Tillis, and \nGillibrand for joining me in this important bipartisan amendment. I \nwould also like to thank all the\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nMembers who cosponsored the amendment, including Senators Tester, \nStabenow, Kirk, Sanders, Stabenow, Blumenthal, Boxer, and Chairman \nMcCain.\n  We have far too many servicemembers who are suffering from trauma-\nrelated conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic \nbrain injury. Unfortunately, many of these servicemembers have received \na less-than-honorable discharge, also known as a bad paper discharge. \nThese former servicemembers can receive bad paper discharges for \nmisconduct that is often linked to behavior seen from those suffering \nfrom PTSD, TBI, or other trauma-related conditions. The effects of \ntraumatic brain injury can include cognitive problems, including \nheadaches, memory issues, and attention deficits. In addition to \ncombat-sustained injuries, PTSD and TBI can also be the result of \nmilitary sexual trauma.\n  Bad paper discharges make former servicemembers who are suffering \nfrom service-connected conditions ineligible for a number of the \nbenefits they have earned and have become ineligible when they need \nthem the most. These discharges put servicemembers at risk of losing \naccess to VA health care and veterans homelessness prevention programs. \nThis is completely unacceptable.\n  I would like to share a story of a former servicemember who shared \nhis experience with my office in Michigan. This individual was deployed \nin Afghanistan in 2008 as a machine gunner. For his performance \noverseas, he received a number of awards, including the Combat Action \nRibbon, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Navy Meritorious Unit \nCommendation, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon, and the National Defense Service Medal. When he returned home, \nhe began suffering from agitation, inability to sleep, blackouts, and \ndifficulties with comprehension.\n  He was scheduled to be evaluated for TBI. However, that evaluation \nnever occurred. He began drinking to help himself sleep and received an \nother-than-honorable discharge after failing a drug test. Following his \ndischarge, the VA diagnosed him with TBI, and he began treatment.\n  The VA later determined he was ineligible for treatment due to the \ncharacter of his discharge, and his treatment ceased immediately. He \nwas later evaluated by a psychologist specializing in trauma management \nwho determined that the behavior that led to his discharge was the \nresult of his TBI and PTSD.\n  He petitioned the Discharge Review Board for a discharge upgrade and \npresented the medical evidence of both TBI and PTSD. However, the \nDischarge Review Board considered his medical evidence to be irrelevant \nand his petition was denied.\n  This Michigander has since experienced periods of homelessness and \nhas had difficulty maintaining a job. This is an example of someone who \nis suffering as a result of service to his country, and yet the VA \ndenied his request for benefits on the basis of this discharge. The \nDischarge Review Board also denied his request to upgrade his \ndischarge, despite his presenting clear evidence of his condition.\n  We must stop denying care to servicemembers with stories like this \nand start providing them with the benefits they deserve and earned \nthrough their service. We have a responsibility to treat those who \ndefend our freedom with dignity, respect, and compassion.\n  Last year I introduced the Fairness for Veterans Act, and the Peters-\nDaines-Tillis-Gillibrand amendment that was unanimously accepted by \nthis body is a modified version of that bill. The Peters amendment \nwould ensure liberal consideration will be given to petitions for \nchanges in characterizations of service related to PTSD or TBI before \nDischarge Review Boards.\n  The Peters amendment also clarifies that PTSD and TBI claims that are \nrelated to military sexual trauma should also receive liberal \nconsiderations. I would like to thank the many veterans service \norganizations that advocated tirelessly on behalf of this amendment and \nlegislation.\n  I would like to recognize the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica, Disabled Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, the American Legion, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Vietnam \nVeterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, United Soldiers and \nSailors of America, and Swords to Plowshares.\n  In addition to seeing strong support from these veteran services \norganizations, this has also been a bicameral effort. I would also like \nto thank Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado and Tim Walz of \nMinnesota, who introduced the companion bill in the House and are \nsupportive of this amendment.\n  Servicemembers who are coping with the invisible wounds inflicted \nduring their service and were subject to a bad paper discharge should \nnot lose access to the benefits they have rightfully earned. That is \nwhy we must ensure that all veterans get the fair process they deserve \nwhen petitioning for a change in characterization of their discharge. \nThe Peters amendment No. 4138 will do just that.\n  I am proud that today this body unanimously approved this important \namendment that I authored with Senators Daines, Tillis, and Gillibrand. \nI look forward to working with my House colleagues to ensure this \nprovision remains in the conference bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate works on the Defense bill, it \nis important to note the shameful squandering of taxpayer money by a \ndefense contractor accused of willfully exposing U.S. soldiers to toxic \nchemicals while they served in Iraq.\n  In 2003, courageous American soldiers, including members of Oregon's \nNational Guard, were given the task of protecting workers of Kellogg \nBrown & Root, KBR, at the Qarmat Ali water treatment plant in southern \nIraq. Some of these soldiers are suing KBR on the grounds that the \ncontractor knowingly exposed them to dangerous carcinogenic substances \nsuch as sodium dichromate and hexavalent chromium. Many of these \nsoldiers have reported serious illnesses, and at least one has already \npassed away at a surprisingly young age. KBR has fought this case, as \nis their right, and normally this would not be an issue for the \nCongress, but this is not a normal case because KBR isn't paying for \nthe case. The American taxpayer is picking up the bill. KBR's contract \nwith the Pentagon includes an indemnification clause. This, of course, \nis legalese that means that the U.S. taxpayer is on the hook not only \nfor any damages incurred as a result of the contractor's actions but \nalso for legal bills and administrative costs incurred during legal \nbattles. It makes no difference if the contractor is at fault or not.\n\n  In this case KBR has run up exorbitant and wasteful legal bills in \nthe course of its lengthy legal defenses against the soldiers' claims. \nThe Pentagon, in essence, gave these contractors a blank check. \nPredictably, KBR has run very high legal fees, paying first-class \nairfare for lawyers, witnesses, and executives, secure in the knowledge \nthat the taxpayer was picking up the tab.\n  Along with attorneys billing at $750 an hour, taxpayers are on the \nhook to pay at least one expert more than $600,000 for testimony and \nconsultation and apparently time spent napping. Of course, there is no \nincentive for KBR to bring the legal cases to a conclusion. The lawyers \ncan run fees until the cows come home because they know they will not \nhave to pay a dime no matter how the case turns out.\n  Fortunately, in this indemnity case, and in others, there is a \nsolution provided in the same contract. The contract empowers the \nDepartment of Defense to take over the litigation and look out for the \ninterest of the American taxpayer who is footing the bill. For reasons \nthat are hard to calculate, the Pentagon has refused to do this in the \nKBR case, despite my having urged several Secretaries of Defense to \nexercise this authority, and so the litigation continues with no end in \nsight. That is why I have filed amendment No. 4510 to the 2017 National \nDefense Authorization Act. The amendment directs the Department of \nDefense to exercise its contractual right to take over litigation for \nindemnified contractors in cases where the legal process runs more than \n2 years. In doing so, it will bring the seemingly never-ending \nlitigation to a timely resolution and save taxpayers from throwing good \nmoney after bad as the process drags on and on year after year.\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\n  The amendment isn't an attempt to relitigate the decision to \nindemnify contractors in the first place. What this commonsense \namendment seeks to do is to make sure that the blank checks being \npicked up by taxpayers stop. This is critical because the government \nhas an obligation to ensure that these legal bills don't cost the \ntaxpayers any more than necessary, and certainly the American taxpayer \ndoes not need to be padding the pockets of the lawyers of the \ncontractors.\n  I want to be clear: The amendment does not prejudice the outcome of \nthe legal case in any way. It simply ensures that when the taxpayers \npay the bill, the government that represents the American taxpayer is \nin control instead of a contractor's lawyer. It seems to me that the \nSenate owes that to the American taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it is considered \nlater in the course of the day.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, when I was growing up in the Eastern \nPlains of Colorado, one of the things I was hoping to do after \ngraduating from college and entering the workforce was to work in the \nspace program. I desperately wanted to be an engineer--an astronaut. I \nwanted to live that dream that was played on the television when I was \ngrowing up and when there were movies such as ``The Right Stuff.'' When \nI was growing up in the mid-1980s, the movies they showed idealized the \nworld of space exploration. I grew up idolizing the astronauts.\n  I can remember as a child writing a letter to the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, and basically telling \nthem that I was really interested in becoming an astronaut and how I \ncould someday do that. Little did I know that my mom, all these years \nlater, kept the response from NASA, and the letter had the old ``worm'' \nNASA logo on top. The response came with a picture of the most recent \nspace shuttle mission, which included Sally Ride. Of course we know \nSally Ride, the first female in the space shuttle program. I remember \nhow excited I was to get that letter back.\n  Years later, I looked at the actual content of the letter and noted \nthat they weren't necessarily quite as kind in confirming my \naspirations when they laid out how difficult it would be to become a \nrocket scientist--to become an aerospace engineer and to go on and \npursue that dream. Lo and behold, they were right. I ended up pursuing \na different direction in college and beyond, but I always had great \nadmiration and respect for the men and women of our space program.\n  Growing up on the Eastern Plains of Colorado was a fascinating \nexperience. I learned how people ran their businesses and how today \nmany of our tractors and combines rely on the very space programs that \nI was admiring. The roots of the space program that we saw in the 1970s \nand 1980s are being utilized today to steer tractors, satellite-guided \nequipment, to locate the best yield in a field through combines that \nuse global positioning systems and precision farming data to better \ntheir operations. Of course, we have these debates today that remind me \nabout those conversations. We have debates today over policy about how \nwe are going to see the future of space, how we are going to see the \nfuture of security, how we are going to see the future of rocket \nlaunches in this country. It reminds me of the conversations that I had \nwith those farmers in the Eastern Plains.\n  My family sells farm equipment today in a little, tiny town out by \nKansas. Oftentimes farmers would come in and talk about how they would \nbe more productive this year and what kind of equipment they needed to \nbe tailormade for their operation, how they could create a farming \nprogram with the farm equipment they would buy in order to have the \nright type of tractor, the right type of combine, or the right type of \ntillage equipment to meet the needs of their operation.\n  When they would come in and talk to us about what kind of farm \nequipment best fit their needs, they would look at what price range \nthey had to deal with--what was more affordable or less affordable. \nThey would look at the utility of a single piece of equipment. Could \nthis tractor or combine meet all of their needs? Could it harvest corn \nand sunflowers? Could it harvest soybeans? Could it pick sunflower \nseeds? Could it pick up dried beans? Those are the conversations we \nwould have.\n  What they didn't do was come in and say: Hey, I want to buy a piece \nof equipment that costs 35 percent more than any other piece of \nequipment and doesn't fit the needs of our operation. We sold red farm \nequipment. There may have been equipment that somebody would want to do \nthat with, but the fact is this: When they came into our store, they \nwanted farm equipment that would fit their needs at the right price and \nwas able to meet the demands of all of their operations so they \nwouldn't have to use a tractor for this field and a different tractor \nfor that field or pay for a tractor that costs 35 percent more over \nhere and a tractor that didn't fulfill all of their needs over there.\n  When I look at the debates today over the National Defense \nAuthorization Act and how we are handling our Nation's rocket program, \nthe EELV programs--the debate that has occupied this Congress for a \nnumber of years--I think back to the common sense of those farmers on \nthe High Plains of Colorado because what is common sense on the High \nPlains is just plain sense in Washington, DC, and that is what we are \nfacing during this debate over what rockets we are going to allow this \ncountry to use in the future. That is the argument that we are making \ntoday. It is an argument about competition, it is an argument about \ncosts, and it is an argument about what is actually going to fulfill \nall of our needs in space and not leave us without the capability to \nmeet our national security space missions. That is the critical part of \nwhat we are talking about today. Just as those farmers on the Eastern \nPlains did--they talked about the best fit for their mission to make \nsure they could plant their crops, to make sure they could get the \ncrops out of the field and do it in an affordable manner so they would \nstill be in operation the next year despite the fact that they had \nhistorically low commodity prices, just as we are facing a historically \ntight budget in the U.S. Congress.\n  What we are talking about is our national security. It is not about \ntractors in a field, and it is not about whether we are going to have \nthe right combine. This debate is about national security space \nmissions. This debate is about having the right kind of rocket to \nlaunch a critical mission that might include a satellite on top that is \nfor missile launch detection, or perhaps it is a rocket that is going \nto put into orbit a device that will listen and provide opportunities \nfor us to know what is happening across the world or across the United \nStates. Maybe it is something that is related to that organization that \nI was so desperate to join, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, NASA. Maybe it is the Dream Chaser from Sierra Nevada \nCorporation, which is attempting to build a vehicle that will be placed \non top of one of the rockets that might be no longer available, should \nthe current language of the National Defense Authorization Act move \nforward.\n  We have the same kinds of debates every day in our business, whether \nyou are a farmer or a car dealer, but this is about our security, this \nis about our defense, and this is about our ability to provide \ncompetition in space, to provide rockets that compete for business, to \nprovide rockets that are cost effective for their mission, to provide \nrockets for this country to meet those critical missions that we talked \nabout that are reliable and have a proven record. That is what we are \ndoing today, and that is why Senator Bill Nelson of Florida and I have \ntogether worked on amendment No. 4509 to make sure when it comes to our \nability to reach space, to reach the orbits that we need to, we can do \nit in a cost environment that reflects the reality of budgets today and \ndo it in a way that we know can be reliable. This amendment will \naddress those concerns by peeling out the language of the National \nDefense Authorization Act to ensure competition, to ensure reliability, \nto ensure affordability, and to assure that those agencies such as NASA \nor perhaps USGS and other agencies that are relying on space more and \nmore have the ability and capacity to reach the orbits they are trying \nto reach.\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\n  The Nelson-Gardner amendment assures competition. That is something \nwe have all agreed is critically important as we look to the future of \nour space and launch programs. This addresses the certification of the \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, the EELV program that I mentioned \nbefore, to make sure that a provider can be awarded a national security \nlaunch for one of these critical missions by using any launch vehicle \nin its inventory.\n  Why is that important? Because we need to make sure that the U.S. \nGovernment has the ability to receive the best value. It is the same \nconversation those farmers were having about what farm equipment they \nwere going to use back home, except this is a critical national \nsecurity space mission.\n  If we prevent this language from being removed or if we don't allow \nthe Nelson-Gardner amendment to move forward, then it is going to be \nvery difficult for us to have that competition. For instance, you are \nlooking at the possibility that a rocket we are using right now known \nas the Atlas V rocket, which has never failed, would be forced to bid \nfor future rocket missions; that is, United Launch Alliance, which \nmakes the Atlas V rocket right now, would be forced to bid using more \nexpensive Delta forerunners. To be expensive is one thing, but to cost \n35 percent more than what we already have today is missing that common \nsense that I talked about on the High Plains of Colorado.\n\n  This amendment will make sure that we abide by the request of the \nU.S. Air Force, which is concerned that if we allow the provision of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act to move forward today, that \nwould bar our ability to use certain rocket engines; that if the Atlas \nV, which relies on this rocket engine, is banned prematurely from DOD's \nuse, that alternative--which means they would have to use that Delta IV \nrocket--would cost an additional $1.5 to $5 billion more versus simply \nrelying on the proven and effective rocket that we have today.\n  I think everybody in this Chamber agrees that we can move to a \ndifferent rocket than the Atlas V, which relies on the engine \nprohibited under the act. Everybody agrees with that, but what they \ndon't agree with is the fact that we would spend $1.5 billion more to \nachieve this goal.\n  We are going to be debating very soon an amendment that will add $18 \nbillion and put that money into our defense because people are \nconcerned that we have a dwindling capacity in our military to meet the \nneeds around the globe for U.S. national security needs; that our men \nand women in uniform don't have the dollars they need to fix the \nequipment they are relying upon.\n  This Chamber is going to be voting on putting more money into \nnational defense. Allowing the language that is currently in the bill \nwould bar our ability to use this engine in an existing rocket, and it \nwould cost $1.5 billion more. The fiscally responsible thing to do is \nto allow for competition, to allow this rocket to continue to be used, \nto allow this engine to continue to be used as we transition out of \nthis engine and in a few years to have a different type of engine and \ndifferent type of rocket that they are working on right now. And in a \nfew years we will have it. To say that we are going to change and \neliminate competition today, we are going to drive up costs by 35 \npercent, and we are going to turn to a rocket that can't meet all the \norbits, can't meet all our needs, and doesn't have the track record of \nthe Atlas V--that is the definition of irresponsibility.\n  Adding $1.5 billion to $5 billion of cost and also eliminating \ncompetition is not what I think this place should stand for. The Senate \nshould stand for competition. We should achieve what remarkable changes \nwe have seen in the space program, as more people are entering into the \nrocket market. We have seen new entrants into rocket launchers--and \nthat is what we are talking about today--to continue the competition, \nnot lessen the competition by eliminating it, taking offline models of \nrockets and then spending $5 billion more.\n  We have already talked about the farmer sitting in the field. If he \nhas a combine that could cost 35 percent more but does the same job as \nthe one that cost 35 percent less, which one is he going to choose? \nWhich one would his banker want him to choose? The American people \nwould want us to go with what is proven and what is reliable. Let's \ntransition off of it--you bet--but not at an increased cost to our \ndefense of $1.5 billion to $5 billion more.\n  To support this amendment and the rocket competition that this Nation \ndeserves is what is fiscally conservative. The pro-competition position \nensures that the U.S. Air Force and National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration will have access to space. It is about meeting the needs \nof those in our Air Force, NASA, and others who have said that we need \nthis critical mission.\n  As General Hyten testified before this Congress, the Department of \nDefense will incur additional costs to reconfigure missions to fly on a \ndifferent rocket--the Delta IV we have been talking about and the Delta \nIV Heavy--because the competitor to the Atlas V doesn't have a rocket \nas capable as the Atlas V and can fly to only half of the necessary \norbits.\n  In 2015 and 2016, the Air Force and the Defense Department leadership \ntestified to the need for additional RD-180 engines--that is the engine \nthat we have been talking about that is stripped out of the Atlas V, \nending the Atlas V program--to compete for launches and to assure that \nthe United States doesn't lose assured access to space, making sure we \ncan get to where we need to go to place a satellite in the orbit it \nneeds to be in to provide security for this country. We can do it with \na reliable system at an affordable cost.\n  We talked about competition. The Nelson-Gardner amendment promotes \ncompetition by allowing the Defense Department to contract for launch \nservices with any certified launch vehicle until December 2022, \nallowing competition to 2022 and transitioning out of the RD-180 so \nthat we can have more competition in the future.\n  The language we have been discussing--I believe it is section 1036 or \n1037 of the National Defense Authorization Act--eliminates this \ncompetition. It puts an end to it by ending the use of these engines \nand basically taking out the Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V, again, is the \nUnited States' most cost effective and capable launch vehicle.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the Atlas V rocket, \nwhich is powered by the RD-180 engine, has had 68 successful Atlas V \nlaunches since 2000. The Atlas V has never experienced a failure. When \ntalking about competition, cost, reliability, and putting a satellite \non top of a rocket--where many times that satellite costs more than the \nrocket itself--we can't afford a failure from a fiscal standpoint, and \nwe certainly can't afford a failure from a security standpoint. That is \nwhy we need reliability and a proven track record.\n  This debate is complicated. People for years have talked about the \nAtlas V, the Delta IV, and the Falcon 9. People ask: What does it all \nmean, which engine do we use, how do we transition, and why did we end \nup in this position in the first place?\n  There are a lot of people who have come to the floor on different \nissues, saying it is not rocket science, but, indeed, today we are \ntalking about rocket science and the need to have an Atlas V rocket \nthat provides competition, reliability, and the opportunity for the \nUnited States to meet our national security needs.\n  Without the Nelson-Gardner amendment, the underlying language of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act legislates a monopoly. It creates a \nmonopoly with the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Program, or EELV, \nbecause only one company would be allowed to fairly compete. While we \nhave all committed to competition and we all have said we are going to \ntransition away from this rocket engine, we actually would be passing \nlegislation that would create a legislative monopoly. That is not plain \ncommon sense; that is nonsense.\n  It is important to note that the Department of Defense isn't the one \nthat is buying these rocket engines in the first place. The Department \nof Defense buys the launch services. The Nelson-Gardner amendment would \nallow United Launch Alliance and others to compete for missions with \nthe Atlas V. The ULA is competing with the Atlas V. Others could be \ncompeting as well. If the ULA does not win the competition, the \nDepartment of Defense will\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nnot be using the RD-180 engine. It makes sense to me.\n\n  Promoting this open and fair competition to get the best deal for the \ntaxpayers of this country--to get the best deal for national security \nneeds in this country--is the fiscally responsible path forward and \nallows the DOD to achieve those priorities. It allows the Air Force to \nreach the space that they need to. It is not just the Air Force; it is \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, the \nSecretary of the Air Force, Commander of the U.S. Space Command, the \nAir Force teaching staff, and many others who have testified before \nthis Congress in support of continued use of the RD-180 rocket engine \nuntil a new domestic engine is certified for national security space \nengines. Compared to the Delta IV, the Atlas V can reach every national \nsecurity space mission that we need with certified, 100-percent \nreliability from the Atlas V. We don't have that anywhere else.\n  It has been made clear by the Secretary of Defense, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the \nCommander of Space Command that ensuring America's access to space is \nan issue of national security, as well as protecting the taxpayers' \ndollars that are already so scarce in the defense budget. Why would we \nadd an additional $1 billion in cost by eliminating competition when we \nought to be doing the exact opposite?\n  The Nelson-Gardner amendment promotes national security by assuring \nreliable access to space that we talked about, to make sure that we \nhave a certified launch service available with a proven track record. \nThe Atlas V rocket is one of the most successful rockets in American \nhistory. Since 2000, we have had 68 consecutive successful launches \nwith zero failures, according to the Congressional Research Service. \nThat is a 16-year track record.\n  According to the Department of Defense--and this is important--if \nAtlas V restrictions are imposed, certain missions would sustain up to \n2\\1/2\\ years of delay.\n  We have threats emerging around the globe. This past week I had the \nopportunity to visit South Korea. We met with General Brooks, and we \ntalked about the need this country has in assuring a denuclearized \nKorean peninsula to make sure that North Korea doesn't possess the \ncapability to launch a nuclear weapon that could hit the mainland of \nthe United States. That is not something that can wait year after year \nbecause we made a decision that costs the taxpayer more and lessens our \ncapacity and capability of going into space.\n  In fact, what I heard from General Brooks and from others in South \nKorea is that our intelligence needs and requirements in North Korea \nare only increasing. So why would we decrease competition? Why would we \ndecrease access to space? Why would we increase costs when our security \nneeds are growing?\n  The Nelson-Gardner amendment assures that we have this access because \nwe know if there is a 2\\1/2\\-year delay, not only does that prevent us \nfrom putting important assets into space, it will also drive up costs. \nThe space-based infrared system, SBIRS, warning satellites designed for \nballistic missile detection from anywhere in the world, particularly \ncountries such as North Korea, would be delayed. The Mobile User \nObjective System and Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite \nsystems that are designed to deliver vital communications capabilities \nto our armed services around the world would both be delayed.\n  According to a letter dated the 23rd of May from the Deputy Secretary \nof Defense, ``losing/delaying the capability to place position and \nnavigation, communication, missile warning, nuclear detection, \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellites in orbit \nwould be significant.''\n  Challenges to our freedom around the globe in the Middle East, North \nKorea, along with what is happening in Southeast Asia and the \nradicalization occurring in certain countries mean we can't afford \ndelay. We can't afford cost increases. It is not just the defense bill. \nIt is not just the Secretary of the Air Force. It is these agencies \nthat we have also talked about tonight, like NASA.\n  The Nelson-Gardner amendment supports our civil space missions by \nensuring access and allowing Federal Government agencies to contract \nany certified launch service provider because many of those missions \nthat are critical to NASA's success outside of the DOD are designed to \nfly atop an Atlas V rocket. According to the Wall Street Journal, while \nthe underlying NDAA language only directly impacts the Department of \nDefense, the result ``is likely to raise the price of remaining NASA \nmissions because massive overhead costs would have to be spread across \nfewer launches.''\n  That goes back to the conversation about buying one piece of \nequipment, not a separate combine to harvest corn, a separate combine \nto harvest wheat, a separate combine to pick up beans. Buy one combine \nwith different attachments, and you can do it all. That is what we are \ntrying to do to make sure that we have the capability in the equipment \nbecause if there is a NASA mission and they are placing a Dream Chaser \non top of it, or if you are placing something to do with the Orion \nmission, which is designed to be on top of the Atlas V, you are going \nto drive up the costs. You have the costs being driven up by the rocket \nbecause there are higher costs being spread across fewer agencies. You \nhave a higher cost because you have to redesign the Orion and the Dream \nChaser to fit the new rocket. You are going to be delayed, possibly, \nbecause of those changes, and it is going to result in higher costs.\n  So we have a responsibility to the American people in how we \ntransition away from the RD-180 engine while ensuring reliability, \naccess, and maintaining competition. It is by keeping the Atlas V.\n  At a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on March 10, NASA \nAdministrator Bolden highlighted the need for the Atlas V by stating, \n``We are counting on ULA being able to get the number of engines that \nwill satisfy requirements for NASA to fly.'' That is not a \ncongressional staffer making it up in the back room of the mail office; \nthat is the Administrator of NASA. He went on to talk about the \nmission's impact. He talked about the Dream Chaser, which was recently \nawarded a cargo resupply services contract. This isn't pie-in-the-sky \nkind of stuff; this is a company that has already been awarded a cargo \nresupply service contract to supply the International Space Station.\n\n  The Dream Chaser was designed to fly atop the Atlas V rocket. The \nlanguage in the NDAA would strip this ability to use that rocket. Our \namendment, the Nelson-Gardner amendment, would allow us to use the \ncommonsense approach, to use that plain sense that I talked about.\n  Michael Griffen, former NASA Administrator, weighed in on the issue, \nstating:\n\n       A carefully chosen committee led by Howard Mitchell, United \n     States Air Force, Retired, made two key recommendations in \n     the present matter: 1. Proceed with all deliberate speed to \n     develop an American replacement for the Russian RD-180 engine \n     [and we agree], and while that development is being carried \n     out, buy all the RD-180s we can to ensure that there is no \n     gap in U.S. access to space for national security payloads. I \n     see no reason to alter those recommendations.\n\n  We are talking about a hard stop of 2022 so that we can replace the \nrocket with our own. But in the meantime, let's use some common sense. \nLet's make sure we are saving the taxpayer dollars. Let's make sure we \nare not putting an additional cost--pulling $1.5 billion out of our \ndefense budget to cover something that we can already do, when their \nresources are already far too scare. Let's make sure we have a reliable \nplatform to reach all of the orbits we need to, a platform that has had \n68 consecutive launches to achieve the mission needs. This is high-risk \nstuff. I mentioned as a kid growing up in the Eastern Plains of \nColorado how fascinated I was with this rocket science.\n  I believe this body has a responsibility to adopt the Nelson-Gardner \namendment to assure that we can protect our people fiscally and from a \ndefense standpoint. So later this week, as we debate and offer \namendment 4509, I hope and encourage everyone to do what is fiscally \nresponsible, to promote competition, to promote access and reliability \nfrom the DOD to NASA by adopting the Nelson-Gardner amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about amendment No. \n4083, submitted by a dear friend and respected colleague of mine from \nNew Hampshire whom I must in good faith disagree with. This amendment \nincreases already existing mandatory minimum sentences on offenses \nrelated to fentanyl and would not make our communities safer. It would \nredirect funds away from the kinds of investments we need to truly end \nthe opioid abuse and heroin use epidemic.\n  Today we face a deadly reality, a community-shattering reality--an \nopioid epidemic in America. I know what this epidemic is doing to our \ncommunities.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, the heroin death rate is more than \nthree times the national average. The heroin overdose rate in New \nJersey now eclipses that of homicides, suicides, car accidents, and \nAIDS as a leading cause of death. Over the past 10 years, we have lost \nover 1,500 people under the age of 30 to heroin overdoses in New Jersey \nalone.\n  I know that nationally death rates from prescription opioid overdoses \nhave tripled in the last 20 years. I know that the opioid epidemic \nknows no bounds. It crosses geographic lines, economic lines, and \nracial lines. This is an epidemic that is tearing apart families, \nindividuals, and communities.\n  This is an American epidemic, but this amendment is not part of the \nsolution.\n  First of all, mandatory minimums themselves have proven to be \nineffective in making us a safer Nation and stopping the drug war.\n  Secondly, this amendment and ones like it will divert critical \nresources that could be, that should be, that must be invested in real \nsolutions, in supporting preventive and education efforts, in \nsupporting law enforcement, in supporting treatment programs.\n  We have seen a rush like this toward mandatory minimums before. In \nthe 1980s and 1990s, we piled on mandatory minimum sentences and \n``three strikes and you're out'' laws in response to the growing drug \nproblem in the United States, but these laws did not prevent this \nepidemic. It didn't work then, and there is no reason to expect it to \nwork now.\n  What did the war on drugs do? Well, it increased our Federal prison \npopulation by 800 percent since 1980 alone.\n  The laws ended up increasing the costs in our Federal prison system \nfrom $970 million annually in 1980 to $6.7 billion in 2013, a close to \n600-percent increase in the use of taxpayer dollars.\n  According to Pew, the Federal prison system uses $1 in $4 spent by \nthe Department of Justice. This is unacceptable.\n  In fact, in my first meeting with then-Attorney General Eric Holder \nin his office after I was elected Senator, he shared with me how the \nBureau of Prisons budget had become so bloated that he had limited \nresources to put toward other Department of Justice programs--\ninitiatives such as hiring FBI officers and support for programs that \nwe actually know will make our communities safer.\n  What is more, these laws did not work. They didn't target those whom \nthey were supposed to target. Mandatory minimum sentences weren't \nresponsible for reducing crime. The work of law enforcement and the \nutilization of data-driven policies are what have done that. A report \nfrom the Brennan Center found that ``increased incarceration has been \ndeclining in its effectiveness as a crime control tactic for 30 years. \nIts effect on crime rates since 1990 has been limited, and has been \nnon-existent since 2000.''\n  Experts have found that mandatory minimum sentences have no \ndemonstrable marginal effect on deterring crime, and it is also the \nreason why police leadership across the country are speaking out \nagainst increasing these mandatory minimums. Former New York Police \nCommissioner Bernie Kerik spoke out earlier this year to say: ``The \nreality is that the federal mandatory minimum sentences established in \nthe early 1980's has had little, if anything, to do with the various \nstate and city violent crime and murder statistics in America.''\n  I know this. I ran a police department as a mayor and oversaw the \nfunctioning of an incredible group of professionals. Had we had more \nresources from the Federal Government--instead of going to mandatory \nminimums--to actually hire more police officers, to put more of them in \nthe streets, had we had more resources for drug treatment, had we had \nmore resources for doing things such as reentry programs, we could have \nbetter fought crime, rather than wasting more money on ineffective \nmandatory minimum sentences.\n  Since 1990, as the onslaught of these mandatory minimums have come, \nillegal drug use in the U.S. has actually increased.\n  To pay for the overincarceration explosion, Congress has increased \nspending on Federal prisons by 45 percent since 1998. But over that \nsame period, Congress has cut spending on State and local law \nenforcement by 76 percent. In fiscal year 2015, the Federal Government \nspent over $2.3 billion warehousing people who received lengthened \nmandatory minimums, and that is money that could be invested elsewhere.\n  Mandatory minimums, if we remember our history, were created to go \nafter drug kingpins. However, the U.S. Sentencing Commission has found \nthat they too often apply to every function within a drug organization, \nfrom mules and couriers to low-level street offenders. By the way, when \nlow-level offenders are arrested and given these mandatory minimum \nsentences, they are simply replaced by other low-level dealers. The \nstrategy does not work in making us safer, but it is costing us so much \nmoney.\n  This is contrary to the original vision of mandatory minimums. They \nwere created to go after serious drug traffickers and kingpins. The \nU.S. Sentencing Commission found that mandatory minimums are often \napplied too broadly, set too high, and--what is worse--that they are \nunevenly applied. In other words, people who can afford lawyers, people \nwho have resources and means, can fight against those laws, and people \nwho cannot afford the best defense often are the ones who get mandatory \nminimums.\n  Who is going to get mandatory minimums? People on college campuses, \nsuch as the one I attended, or people in the city I now call home.\n  Understand this: The amendment that is being proposed reflects the \nold strategies that haven't won the war on drugs but, in many cases, \nhave actually made things worse, especially by diverting so much money \ninto our prison system and away from strategies in our communities, \nsuch as treatment and law enforcement, which we know work.\n  What have these laws done? They have caused an 800-percent increase \nin our Federal prison population over the last 30 years. What have \nthese laws done? They have imprisoned too many nonviolent Americans for \ndecades for nonviolent, low-level drug crimes.\n  What have these laws done? They have imprisoned people such as \nSherman Chester, who with two prior nonviolent drug arrests was \nconvicted and sentenced to life in prison for a third nonviolent drug \ncrime. At his sentencing, Mr. Chester's judge said: ``This man doesn't \ndeserve a life sentence, and there is no way that I can legally keep \nfrom giving it to him.''\n  What have these laws done? They have imprisoned mothers such as Alice \nJohnson, who, after losing her job and filing for bankruptcy, began to \nassociate with people involved in drug dealing. She was arrested for \nher participation in transporting drugs as a go-between. When 10 of her \ncoconspirators testified against her for reduced charges, she was \nsentenced to life in prison without parole for 25 years for that \nnonviolent drug crime.\n  What have these laws done? They have imprisoned people like Dicky \nJackson, a father who was so desperate to save his 2-year-old child who \nneeded a bone marrow transplant that, after exhausting his options--\nincluding community fundraisers--he began transporting meth in his \ntruck. A year into his work, he was arrested for selling a half pound \nof meth to an undercover officer. He was found guilty of possession\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nwith intent to distribute and was given three life sentences without \nparole.\n  The Federal prosecutor assigned to Mr. Jackson's case remarked: ``I \nsaw no indication that Mr. Jackson was violent, that he was any sort of \nlarge-scale narcotics trafficker, or that he committed his crimes for \nany reason other than to get money to care for his gravely ill child.''\n  What these laws have done is make sure that these nonviolent \noffenders and too many more like them will die in prison for their \ncrimes--taking money from our communities and imprisoning people into \ntheir fifties, sixties, and seventies for nonviolent crimes. They are \nredirecting taxpayer dollars from strategies in our neighborhoods, in \nour cities, and in communities that we know work and will actually get \nto the problem of drug abuse. Our system hasn't empowered people. It \nhasn't empowered them to deal with addictions. It hasn't empowered them \nto deal with mental health challenges. Our system, as it stands, hasn't \nempowered us to do the things we know make us safer.\n  This has been punishment without proportionality, retribution without \nreason, and a gross taxpayer expense that takes away money that could \nbe invested in public safety and our community well-being.\n  If the failed war on drugs, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1984 have taught us \nanything, it is that locking more people up for longer and longer \nsentences for low-level drug crimes at the expense of billions and \nbillions of taxpayer dollars does not curb drug use and abuse. These \nlaws didn't work then. Why are we proposing new ones now?\n  There is a different way. More mandatory minimum sentences won't \nimpact the fentanyl opioid problem. The mandatory minimums being \nproposed for low-level drug offense are not going to accomplish what \nthe amendment supporters hope it will. It is a facade that makes people \nfeel like they are doing something about the problem, but they are not \nmaking a difference.\n  What they will do is throw more taxpayer dollars at our Bureau of \nPrisons, expanding that bureaucracy and draining money--taxpayers' \nmoney--from solutions that we know will work.\n  What is stunning to me, what is actually deeply frustrating to me is \nthat we have two pieces of bipartisan legislation, one that has passed \nwithout enough funding and one that has yet to be brought up for a vote \nthat would address this epidemic and the broken criminal justice \nsystem.\n  Instead of turning to bipartisan legislation that is going through \nregular order and investing in strategies that this body, in a \nbipartisan fashion, has agreed with near unanimity would work, we are \nnow considering an amendment that would spend more money on imprisoning \nlow-level offenders for longer and longer sentences.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act of 2015, also known as CARA. It is a bipartisan bill that \nwould allow the Attorney General to award grants to address the opioid \nepidemic and expand prevention and education efforts.\n  I was pleased to cosponsor that bill, but unfortunately the amendment \nthat would have provided funding for the programs and grants in this \nbill failed to pass. The bill that went forward had the right \nintentions, but an unwillingness in this body to provide robust funding \nmeans that it simply won't address the epidemic adequately. That is \nwhat is frustrating to me. The Members of this body who refused to \nincrease funding for preventive and treatment measures through CARA now \nwant to divert taxpayer resources towards putting people in jail for \nlonger and longer sentences for low-level, nonviolent crimes. That \nmakes no sense--to spend millions of more dollars to lock up low-level \noffenders and starve the programs that local leaders all over this \ncountry are asking for, such as treatment, education, and local law \nenforcement.\n  If properly funded, CARA would expand prevention initiatives, would \nexpand education efforts, and would curb abuse and addiction, hitting \nour Nation's problem at its heart--at its demand--and helping addicts \nwith what they need--treatment, not more jail. It would expand the \navailability of naloxone to law enforcement. It would increase \nresources to identify and treat incarcerated Americans suffering from \ndrug addiction. It would increase disposal sites for unwanted \nprescription medications and would promote best practices for evidence-\nbased opioid and heroin treatment and prevention all over our country.\n  This bipartisan bill had wisdom in it. It was sensible, commonsense, \nand based on evidence-based strategies.\n  But now, here we are, not talking about investing in what we know \nwill work but suggesting that we do things that have proven over the \nlast two decades not only not to work but to drain taxpayer dollars and \nto do more harm. We are considering an amendment that would use \ntaxpayer resources not to do the things I just listed that are \nunderfunded right now but would spend money on incarcerating low-level \ndrug offenders because of unwise increases of mandatory minimum \nsentences.\n  The fact is the opioid epidemic is not a problem we can jail our way \nout of. We already have mandatory minimum sentences in place for heroin \nand fentanyl offenses, and they haven't done what they were created to \ndo--to prevent an epidemic such as this from occurring. What this \namendment does is to double down on that failing strategy.\n  In fact, for over a year, Senate Judiciary Committee members on both \nsides of the aisle have worked on crafting a bill, the Sentencing \nReform and Corrections Act, which would take meaningful steps toward \nundoing so much of the damage these failed policies have caused over \nthe past decades. That bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation, \nwhich worked through regular order and would reduce mandatory minimum \npenalties and give judges more discretion at sentencing, has been \npending on the Senate floor for over 7 months now without Senate \naction.\n  The bill followed regular order. It moved through a hearing and a \nmarkup. It took in testimony from dozens of experts and organizations. \nIt was adjusted and amended with input from law enforcement officers, \nattorneys general, prosecutors, civil rights leaders, and local elected \nleaders. It passed out of the committee. It was then, because of input \nfrom other Republican Senators, changed again and modified. Now, this \nbaked bill is fully ready for a vote on the floor. If given that vote, \nit would most likely get a super majority in this body.\n  But today, instead of moving forward on that bipartisan, compromise \npiece of legislation--which would start to fix the failed drug policies \nof the 1980s and 1990s, which would save us money, which would help us \nright past wrongs, which would create resources through its savings \nthat could be used for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--we \nare now considering an amendment that would actually build on the \nmistakes of the past and divert money from the solutions we know work \ntoday.\n  So again I say that I am frustrated, I am angry, and I am beginning \nto grow disheartened by the current state of affairs. The amendment \nbeing proposed and its potential consequences are what a growing \nconsensus in the Senate from both sides of the aisle and especially \nthoughtful leaders around the country from all sides of the political \nspectrum--this is exactly what we have been fighting against. My \nfrustration is that instead of looking to take a step forward with the \ncurrent bipartisan legislation, we are looking to take a step back into \nthe mistakes of the 1980s and 1990s. Instead of learning from the \nmistakes of the past, we are damning ourselves to make them again.\n  Since arriving in the Senate 2\\1/2\\ years ago, I have been encouraged \nby the momentum building around this comprehensive criminal justice \nreform legislation. I felt encouraged that hope has been dawning. It \nhas been one of my more affirming experiences as a public leader. \nDuring the 2\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate, many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have been negotiating over this \nissue in good faith, and actually for a time even before I was here \nthey were working hard on criminal justice reform.\n  This comprehensive criminal justice reform bill would address so many \nof the issues that have been agreed to on both sides of the aisle. It \nwould address a system that does not make our communities safer but \ninstead wastes the\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\npotential of millions of Americans and drains billions, trillions of \ntaxpayer resources over time.\n  What we have in the Senate is amazing. It has been incredible to see. \nWe have Senators as different from each other on the political pole as \nSenator Leahy and Senator Grassley, with other Democrats and \nRepublicans, from the most liberal to the most conservative in this \nbody, coming together to craft a measured bill that would begin to fix \nour deeply broken criminal justice system. This result, the Sentencing \nReform and Corrections Act, would enable prosecutors and judges to \nmaintain critical tools for prosecuting violent offenders and high-\nlevel drug traffickers while reducing mandatory minimums and life-\nwithout-parole sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n  In addition, the bill actually includes a provision related to \nfentanyl--not one that I necessarily believe in or believe is most \neffective, but it was included in the bill as a compromise measure.\n  This critical piece of legislation has the support of dozens of civil \nrights groups and faith groups, Christian evangelicals and law \nenforcement and prosecutor groups, including well-respected \norganizations such as the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, and the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association. From law enforcement to faith-based \nleaders, civil rights activists, and fiscal conservative organizations, \nso many have come together and are being led in many cases by law \nenforcement officials because they know this bill is actually smart \npublic safety policy. This bill has the support of law enforcement \nleaders, including former President George Bush's U.S. Attorney \nGeneral, Michael Mukasey; former FBI Director Louie Freeh; and the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice.\n  In a letter to Senate leadership, former U.S. Attorney Michael \nMukasey, with former Director Bill Sessions and dozens of former \nFederal judges and U.S. attorneys, shared what they believe the \nSentencing Reform and Corrections Act can do. They said it ``is good \nfor Federal law enforcement and public safety. It will more effectively \nensure that justice shall be done.''\n  Groups like Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and \nIncarceration, which represent more than 160 current and former police \nchiefs, U.S. attorneys, and district attorneys, have spoken out in \nsupport of this bill, arguing:\n\n       This is a unique moment of rare bipartisan consensus on the \n     urgent need for criminal justice reform. As law enforcement \n     leaders, we want to make it clear where we stand: Not only is \n     passing Federal mandatory minimum reform necessary to reduce \n     incarceration, it is also necessary to help law enforcement \n     continue to keep crime at historic lows across the country. \n     We urge Congress to pass the Sentencing Reform and \n     Corrections Act.\n\n  Contrary to what the few opponents argue, this act would preserve \ncertain mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders. It would also \nmore effectively target these mandatory minimums toward high-level drug \ntraffickers and violent criminals. Federal drug laws were meant to go \nafter these kingpins, and this legislation leaves important tools in \nplace that allow prosecutors to go after them.\n  Also, contrary to what the few opponents of this bill argue, the bill \nwould not open the floodgates and permit violent offenders to be let \nout of prison early; rather, each case must go in front of a Federal \njudge, where the prosecutor will be present, for that independent \njudicial review.\n  Experts from the National Academy of Sciences to the National \nResearch Council have found that lengthy prison sentences have a \nminimal impact on crime prevention.\n  The profound thing about this bill is that it is not breaking new \nground. This is now becoming common knowledge around the States. In \nfact, it is being followed and led by many red States in our Nation. In \nfact, States have shown that we can reduce the prison population, save \ntaxpayers millions and billions of dollars, and also reduce crime. \nTexas, for instance, between 2007 and 2012, reduced its incarceration \nrate by 9 percent and saw its total crime drop by 16 percent. If \nTexas--a State known for law and order and being tough on crime--can \nenact sweeping measures to reform its criminal justice system, so can \nwe at the Federal level. That is why I am proud that one of the \nsponsors of the bill is the Republican Whip from Texas, Senator Cornyn.\n  But there are other States--California, Connecticut, Delaware, \nGeorgia, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, Massachusetts, North Carolina, \nSouth Carolina, Utah, and New Jersey. All these States have lowered \ntheir prison populations through commonsense reforms and--surprise, \nsurprise--have seen crime drop. These States have enacted reforms \nbecause it is good for public safety and it saves needed taxpayer \ndollars that can be reinvested in public safety strategies that \nactually make us safer. Remember, these are Republican-led States and \nDemocratic-led States, Governors from the right and the left.\n  There is a great conservative organization called Right on Crime. \nThis is what they had to say about public safety and criminal justice \nreform:\n\n       Taxpayers know that public safety is the core function of \n     government, and they are willing to pay what it takes to keep \n     communities safe. In return for their tax dollars, citizens \n     are entitled to a system that works. When governments spend \n     money inefficiently and do not obtain crime reductions \n     commensurate with the amount of money being spent, they do \n     taxpayers a grave disservice.\n\n  It is worth repeating that line: ``Citizens are entitled to a system \nthat works.''\n  You see, this is not a partisan issue; it is an American issue. There \nis a chorus calling for reform across the political spectrum. Everyone \nfrom Republican candidates for President to conservative groups, such \nas Koch Industries and Americans for Tax Reform, have come out in \nsupport of criminal justice reform and this bill. That is why some \nRepublicans like Grover Norquist and George Martin have written:\n\n       Some Republicans who have not focused on our successes in \n     the states think we are still living back in the 1980s and \n     also believe that ``lock them up'' is a smart political war \n     cry. . . . Wasting money is not a way to demonstrate how much \n     you care about an issue.\n\n  That is why people like Marc Levin, the founder of Right on Crime, \nhave shared that ``the recent successes of many states in reducing \ncrime, imprisonment, and costs through reforms grounded in research and \nconservative principles provide a blueprint for reform--at the Federal \nlevel.''\n  Former Governor Mike Huckabee said:\n\n       I believe in law and order. I also believe in using facts, \n     rather than fear, when creating policy. And, I believe in \n     fiscal responsibility. Right now, our criminal justice system \n     is failing us in all three camps.\n\n  Republicans and Democrats from across the political spectrum have \ncome together because they realize our failures to fix this system have \nsimply cost us too much already. Everyone knows that the first rule of \nholes is that when you find yourself in one, stop digging. That is why \nthis amendment is so frustrating--because it seeks to dig us deeper \ninto a hole. Look at the financial costs we are already paying. In \n2012, the average American taxpayer was contributing hundreds of \ndollars a year to corrections expenditures, including the incarceration \nand monitoring and rehabilitation of prisoners.\n  A report from the Center of Economic Policy Research concluded that \nin 2008 alone, formerly incarcerated people's employment losses--\nkeeping people in for decades and decades--cost our economy the \nequivalent of 1.5 to 1.7 million workers or $57 billion to $65 billion \nannually. And it is estimated that the U.S. poverty rate between 1980 \nand 2004 would have been 20 percent lower if it had not been for all \nthis mass incarceration. This is a lot of money we are spending keeping \npeople behind bars--nonviolent offenders--and it is taking a \nsignificant financial toll in our country. We could be investing this \nmoney better.\n  By passing this bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, the \nCBO told us that this one bill alone that takes modest steps toward \ncriminal justice reform will save an estimated $318 million in reduced \nprison costs over the next 5 years and $722 million over the next 10 \nyears. Doing the right thing creates savings that we can then invest in \nstrategies to make ourselves safer or give back to the taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\n  Please understand that we have paid dearly for our mistakes. For \nexample, from 1990 to 2005, a new prison opened every 10 days in the \nUnited States, making us the global leader in this infrastructure \ninvestment. A new prison opened every 10 days in the United States to \nkeep up with the massive explosion in incarcerations. Imagine the roads \nand bridges and railways we could have been investing in during that \ntime. As our infrastructure has been crumbling over the last three \ndecades, the one area of infrastructure that has been ballooning was \ngleaming new prisons to actually incarcerate overwhelmingly nonviolent \noffenders. Imagine the investments we could have made in lifesaving \nresearch, innovative technologies, science and math funding. Instead, \nwe extended mandatory minimums again and again and again for low-level \ndrug offenders.\n  The United States must be the leader around the globe for liberty and \njustice. Unfortunately, the United States now leads the world in a \nvastly more dubious distinction: the number of people we incarcerate. \nWe only have 5 percent of the world population--only 5 percent--but one \nout of four imprisoned people on planet Earth is here in the United \nStates. Again, the majority of those people are nonviolent offenders. \nThe U.S. incarceration rate is 5 to 10 times that of many of our peer \ncountries.\n  The financial cost, the dollars wasted, are only part of the story, \nthough. We are actually paying for our system's failures in innumerable \nways. The hidden financial costs of our broken prison system mirror the \nhidden social costs that befall families of those incarcerated, with 1 \nin 28 American children--or 3.6 percent of American kids--growing up \nwith a parent behind bars. Just 25 years ago, it was 1 in 125 American \nchildren. I recently saw that ``Sesame Street'' has started programming \nspecifically aimed at helping kids with parents in prison because there \nare now so many of them. Over half of imprisoned parents were the \nprimary earners for their children prior to their incarceration. What \nis more, a child with an incarcerated father is more likely to be \nsuspended from school than a peer without an incarcerated father--23 \npercent compared to 4 percent.\n\n  Our rush to incarcerate as a response to many of our societal \nproblems has now created a stunning distinction. According to a new \nreport from the Center for American Progress, close to half of all \nchildren in America are growing up with a parent with a criminal \nrecord.\n  Our system often entraps the most vulnerable Americans. We are \nentrapping people who often are in need of incarceration but treatment \nand medical help, putting those vulnerable populations in jail for \nlonger and longer periods. In fact, now many of our prisons serve as \nwarehouses for the mentally ill. Serious mental illness affects an \nestimated 14.5 percent of men and 31 percent of all the women in our \njails. Between 25 and 40 percent of all mentally ill Americans will be \njailed or incarcerated at some point in their lives, and 65 percent of \nall American inmates meet the medical criteria for the disease of \naddiction, many of them not getting the treatment they need but just \ngetting more incarceration.\n  Today we live in a country where in many ways the words of Bryan \nStevenson are also true. This idea of equal justice under the law is \nchallenged by the facts of our criminal justice system. As Bryan \nStevenson said, we live in a nation where you get treated better if you \nare rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent. Over 80 percent \nof Americans who are charged with felonies are poor and deemed indigent \nby our court system.\n  Our criminal justice system doesn't disproportionately affect just \nthe mentally ill, the addicted, and the poor; it also \ndisproportionately impacts people of color. We know that there is no \ndeeper proclivity to commit drug crimes among people of color, but \nthere is a much deeper reality that the drug laws affect people of \ncolor in a different way. For example, Blacks and Whites have no \ndifference in using or selling drugs. There is no statistical \ndifference. In fact, right now in America, some studies are showing \nthat young White men have a slightly higher rate of dealing drugs than \nyoung Black men. But Blacks are 3.6 times more likely to get arrested \nfor selling drugs. Latinos are 28 percent more likely than Whites to \nreceive a mandatory minimum penalty for Federal offenses punished by \nsuch penalties. A 2011 report found that more than any other group, \nLatinos in America were convicted at a higher rate of offenses that \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence. And Blacks are also 21 percent \nmore likely to receive a mandatory minimum sentence than Whites facing \nsimilar charges. Black men are given sentences about 20 percent longer \nthan White men for similar crimes. And Native Americans are grossly \noverrepresented in our criminal justice system, with an incarceration \nrate 38 percent higher than the national average.\n  Because minorities are more likely to be arrested for drug crimes \neven though the rates are not different in usage of drugs or selling of \ndrugs, they are more--disproportionately--likely, therefore, to lose \ntheir voting rights, thus resulting in stunning statistics. Today, 1 in \n13 Black Americans is prevented from voting because of felony \ndisenfranchisement. Black citizens are four times more likely to have \ntheir voting rights revoked than someone who is White.\n  Those are statistics befitting a different era in American history, \nbut unfortunately they reflect our current circumstances.\n  So here we find ourselves. I have been talking about this issue for \nmy entire time in the Senate. Many of my colleagues have been working \non this issue longer. I have been so encouraged that literally my first \npolicy conversation on the Senate floor right after being sworn in \nright there by the Vice President of the United States--I walked back \ntoward the back of the room and was met by colleagues who talked to me \nabout this issue. I am so glad there is this growing consensus, but I \nam frustrated that an amendment is potentially coming to the floor that \ntakes us backward while so much work has gone on to move this body \nahead.\n  I have come to believe in this body. I worked hard to become a Member \nof the Senate because I believe in the Senate and the power of this \ninstitution to do great things. In fact, it is the result of the great \ngood of this body and the labor and struggles of so many Americans that \nI am even here in the first place, so many Americans fighting for \nissues that this body helped to change. From equal housing rights, to \nvoting rights, to civil rights, this body has made us a fairer and more \njust Nation. This body has made our country the shining light on planet \nEarth for liberty and justice. This body, with so many committed \nAmericans through so many generations, has so much to be proud of.\n  I am so encouraged by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, that \ndespite the partisanship and cynicism this body often generates, we \nhave found common ground to advance the common good around our criminal \njustice system. We have a crisis in that system, but I am proud there \nis movement to address that.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the profound potential we have to \nadvance our Nation, to deal with the opioid crisis, the drug crisis, \nand the crime crisis with smart and effective policies that have proven \nto work already at the State level.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the seductive temptation to claim to \nbe tough on crime when in reality we are just wasting taxpayer dollars \non a failed fiction that obscures the true urgency of the day.\n  Finally, I urge the leadership of this body to not let this amendment \nreflecting failed policy of the past to the floor and instead move to \nbring forward a bipartisan, widely supported bill that will address the \ncurrent crisis. We can no longer hesitate or equivocate, and we can \ndefinitely not afford to retreat. Wasting more time is not the answer. \nThe time is now, and, I confess, I am losing patience.\n  While I am encouraged by leaders like the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the ranking member of that committee, while I am \nencouraged by the fact that the majority whip and the Democratic Whip \nare on this bill, while I am encouraged by the fact that likely a \nsupermajority of support exists for this bill, I am growing impatient \nthat it has not come to a vote yet. There is nothing as painful as a\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nblockage at the heart of justice, blocking the flow of reason, of \ncommonsense, fairness, and urgently needed progress.\n  But the pain and frustration I might feel is minimal compared to \nthose who are suffering under the brunt of a broken system. We cannot \nbe deaf to the cries for justice of families and children, those \nsuffering addictions, those suffering from mental illness, and those \nwhose families have been torn apart by such misfortunes. We cannot be \nmute or silent in the face of injustice, those of us who are elected to \nserve all Americans.\n  At the beginning of each day, we swear an oath in this body. We \npledge allegiance to those ideals of liberty and justice. Let us now \nact so we do not betray the moral standing of our Nation.\n  I urge the Senate leadership to bring the Sentencing Reform and \nCorrections Act for a vote. The time is right now to do what is right \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or ROTC, the \nNation's training program for commissioned officers of the U.S. Armed \nForces. Founded in 1916, ROTC prepares young adults to be leaders in \nour Nation's Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. ROTC cadets commit to \nserving their country in uniform after college graduation in exchange \nfor ROTC assisting with costs associated with their college education.\n  Although military training took place at civilian colleges and \nuniversities in the 19th century, it was not until the National Defense \nAct of 1916, signed by President Woodrow Wilson, that this training was \nconsolidated under a single entity: the Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps. ROTC is the largest officer-producing organization within the \nU.S. military.\n  In 100 years of history, ROTC has commissioned more than 1 million \nmilitary officers. The U.S. Army ROTC program started in 1916 with just \n46 initial programs, and today it has commissioned more than 600,000 \nofficers at almost 1,000 schools across the Nation, with a presence in \nevery State, as well as Guam and Puerto Rico.\n  In 2016, Army ROTC has an enrollment of more than 30,000 and produces \nover 70 percent of the second lieutenants who join the Army, Army \nNational Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve.\n  Army ROTC is one of the most demanding and strenuous leadership \ntraining programs a young person can choose today. ROTC training molded \nand shaped six Chiefs of Staff of the Army, two Chairmen of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, a current Supreme Court Justice, the current Governor \nof Kentucky, as well as countless other leaders in government, \nbusiness, science, sports, and the arts.\n  For decades, Army ROTC has conducted summer training for many cadets \nat Fort Knox, KY. In 2013, I was pleased to help Army ROTC get an ROTC \ntraining program called the Cadet Leader Course relocated to Fort Knox \nas well. More than 6,000 cadets attend that particular leadership \ncourse at Fort Knox every year since the installation began hosting the \nprogram in 2014. In all, over 10,000 cadets attend various summer \ntraining courses each year at Fort Knox.\n  ROTC serves as a vital introduction to life and a career in the \nmilitary for America's young men and women. Supporting our Armed Forces \nmeans supporting ROTC programs at institutions across the country. ROTC \ncreates America's next generation of leaders, in the Armed Forces, and \nin American life.\n  I know my colleagues join me in commemorating the 100th anniversary \nof the creation of our military's ROTC and in thanking the hundreds of \nthousands of brave cadets who have successfully completed the \nchallenges of the program and gone on to become officers. We are \ncertainly grateful for their service and their sacrifice. Without ROTC, \nour Nation's military would not be the superior fighting force that is \ntoday. I am proud that Kentucky plays a significant role in the \ntraining of ROTC cadets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3534-2"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3534-S3535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FRANK R. LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL SAFETY FOR THE 21st CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate's final passage today of the \nbipartisan Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century \nAct, after 3 years of difficult negotiations, reflects the true nature \nof compromise. I am glad that we have finally come to an agreement to \nupdate our country's ineffective and outdated chemical regulatory \nprogram. While this is not a perfect bill, I believe that it goes a \nlong way towards protecting American families from dangerous chemicals \nand serves as a fitting tribute to Senator Lautenberg, who was a \ntireless public health advocate.\n  This legislation overhauls the 40-year-old, outdated Toxic Substances \nControl Act and will bring more than 64,000 chemicals under the review \nof the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. Under the old law, \nthe EPA was required to approve chemicals using a burdensome and \nineffective economic cost-benefit analysis, but this reform bill will \nrequire the EPA to make a decision based solely? on health and safety \nconcerns. Additionally, the Lautenberg act gives the EPA enhanced \nauthority to require testing of both new and existing chemicals, \nrequiring safety reviews for all chemicals in active commerce and a \nsafety finding for new chemicals before they are allowed on the market.\n  The House bill originally included a provision preempting State \nauthority to regulate specific chemicals. State preemption is a \nsignificant concern for Vermont, especially with the discovery of \nperfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA, contaminated water in the communities of \nNorth Bennington and Pownal. Unfortunately, due to shortcomings in the \n1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, PFOA was one of many chemicals that \nhad been presumed safe without any requirement for testing or review. \nWhile\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\nthe inclusion of even minimal State preemption action in the final bill \nis unfortunate, the final compromise largely retains the Senate bill's \nprovisions and allows States 12 to 18 months to enact tougher \nregulations through a waiver process after the EPA formally announces \nthat it has started the review process for a chemical. There have been \nassurances to the Vermont congressional delegation from the EPA that \nVermont will be able to retain its more stringent regulation of PFOA. I \nwill continue to work with both the State and with the EPA to address \nPFOA contamination in Vermont.\n  I am pleased that the final bill includes two mercury-specific \nprovisions: The creation of a mercury inventory and the expansion of \nthe export ban to certain mercury compounds. These provisions are \nsections of the Mercury Use Reduction Act that I was proud to cosponsor \nin the 112th Congress. Under the mercury inventory provision, the EPA \nwill be required to prepare an inventory of mercury supply, use, and \ntrade in the United States every 3 years. This data will enhance our \nability to reduce the health risks from mercury exposure. The second \nmercury provision builds upon the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008, \nexpanding the export ban currently in effect for elemental mercury to \ninclude certain mercury compounds that could be traded to produce \nelemental mercury in commercial quantities, thus undermining the \nexisting export ban.\n  This reform bill also includes new unprecedented transparency \nmeasures thanks to new limits imposed on what can qualify as \n``confidential business information.'' The transparency provisions also \nensure that State officials, medical professionals, and the public have \naccess to health and safety information. In addition, the bill places \ntime limits and requires justification for any ``confidential business \ninformation'' claims that must also be fully justified when made and \nwill expire after 10 years if they are not re-substantiated.\n  Like many Vermonters, I have been concerned for years about the need \nto improve chemical safety standards in the United States. While I had \nhope for more reforms in the bill, overall, the bill is a significant \nimprovement over current law. It is a true testament to the groundwork \nlaid by Senator Lautenberg that we have finally heeded the calls from \nthe American people to reform this outdated law and better protect our \nfamilies from dangerous chemicals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3534-3"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3535-S3537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. FREDERICK BURKLE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the formative parts of my life was \nbeing a student at Saint Michael's College in Vermont. It was \nespecially so because of the people I met there. One of my most \nmemorable classmates is Dr. Frederick Burkle.\n  Skip Burkle was one who cared greatly about what he was learning and \nshowed moral leadership even then. As students, we both lived in dorms \nthat resembled World War II-era barracks. Fortunately, the living \nconditions for students at Saint Michael's have improved since then.\n  Last month, now-Dr. Burkle, spoke at Saint Michael's College giving \nthe commencement address. Everyone who was there actually listened to a \nman who spoke of his own background. He spoke also to the moral compass \nhe has developed both in school and since in the military and in his \nscientific work.\n  So much could be said about his career. I agree when he said, ``My \nhumanitarian work was the most meaningful I've ever done.'' That makes \nso much sense because few people I have ever known have begun to \napproach his life as a humanitarian.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that his speech to the \ngraduating class be printed in the Record because I want those beyond \nSaint Michael's College to read what an outstanding person has said.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Saint Michael's College Commencement Address\n\n                   Colchester, Vermont: May 15, 2016\n\n\n                   frederick m. burkle, jr., md, mph\n\n                    physician, scholar, humanitarian\n\n       Greetings to you all!\n       There are many reasons to celebrate this day. This \n     graduation is a milestone for you and your entire family.\n       Saint Michael's also needs to be celebrated and commended. \n     As an academic, I do not know of any other college or \n     university this year, or in recent memory, that has shown \n     both the insight and courage to declare ``Service to Others'' \n     as the theme of graduation. Only at Saint Mikes! . . . I'm \n     not surprised!\n       The implications of this decision are many and must be \n     applauded . . . Most importantly it brings great hope and \n     wisdom for the future of this generation and those that \n     follow . . . .\n       I have been asked to speak to you on what in my life and \n     college experiences influenced my humanitarian career. My \n     first concern when asked was: How does someone who graduated \n     in 1961, 55 years ago, tell his story to the class of 2016? . \n     . . .\n       Let's give it a try\n       In truth, if you knew me in high school you would have \n     voted me the ``least likely graduate to ever give a \n     commencement address.'' . . .\n       I attended an all male Catholic High School in Southern \n     Connecticut. I was painfully shy, occasionally stuttered, was \n     easily embarrassed, struggled to be an average student, and \n     was hopelessly burdened by what is known today as severe \n     dyslexia. I only began to read in the 5th grade.\n       My Father, emphatically and loudly said ``No'' to the idea \n     of college. He had labeled me a ``lazy dreamer'' . . . so to \n     him college was a waste of good money. You would agree . . . \n     I was certainly not a prize academic prospect!\n       So here I am . . . and now I've got to explain to you how I \n     got onto this stage as a Commencement speaker.\n       I would not be here today without the help of some very \n     unselfish people . . . I call them my own personal \n     humanitarians . . . we all have them.\n       Not going to college was a serious blow I could not live \n     with. For years I had held on to an otherwise quite \n     impossible and secret dream of being a physician. A dream \n     which simply arose many years before from viewing very early \n     Life Magazine photos of doctors treating starving children in \n     an African jungle hospital.\n       Having been born 2 years before WWII, all my life was one \n     war after another with equally dire photos of both World War \n     II and Korean War casualties. And soon after, during high \n     school, emerged my generation's war . . . in a strange and \n     unheard of country named Viet Nam . . . a war which actually \n     began to build up as early as 1954.\n       My story, in great part, is a love story. I met an equally \n     shy girl when she was 13 and I was the older man of 14. We \n     went steady during high school and secretly dreamed of our \n     future together. With College off the table the military \n     draft seemed inevitable. She urged me to plead my case to the \n     High School Academic Dean, a stern gray haired Brother of \n     Holy Cross, to both loan me the application fee and forward a \n     decent recommendation. I was shaking in my boots. He silently \n     pondered the circumstances yet nodded his head and agreed to \n     accept the personal risk despite the potential anger of my \n     Father . . .\n       The very next day there was a check waiting for me!\n       There were others . . . while working as an orderly in a \n     local hospital I met two very caring physicians. They \n     embodied everything I wanted to be. They introduced me to a \n     small French Catholic Liberal Arts College named St. Michaels \n     in rural Vermont that I never heard of. Both were WWII \n     veterans who attended St. Mike's and then medical school on \n     the GI Bill. Despite their busy schedules they took time to \n     counsel and encourage, spoke highly of the quality of the \n     education but also cautioned that the academic experience \n     would demand much more.\n       St. Mike's was the only place I applied. With luck, I was \n     accepted. My girl friend's parents, not my own, took me to \n     campus . . . There was no turning back!\n       Falling in love with St. Mike's was a little slower and not \n     nearly as romantic! Matriculation at St. Mike's was a shock . \n     . . and at first a disappointment. Maybe my Father was right \n     . . . Will I fail and embarrass myself once again?\n       From the outset, the St. Mike's academic faculty made it \n     clear that everyone on campus was required to take 4 years of \n     liberal arts. This included a long list of the world's \n     literature, history, arts and philosophy from the beginning \n     of written time. This included a comparative study of all \n     religions, and a compelling semester of logic that forced us \n     to deliberate the philosophical ``how'' and ``why'' problems \n     that stressed the minds of every adolescent, like me, whose \n     brain had not yet matured . . .\n       It took me 3 trips to the bookstore to carry all the \n     required reading back to the small shared room in a former \n     WWII poorly heated wooden barracks that once stood where we \n     are today.\n       We desperately asked why such torture was necessary. I'm to \n     be a scientist. Why did I have to study the liberal arts? I \n     pleaded . . . something must be wrong! With my reading \n     disability, my anxiety level was palpable to everyone.\n       The science faculty made it quite clear that to pass the \n     rigorous requirements for recommendation to graduate school \n     required excellent marks in both the sciences and the liberal \n     arts. They offered us multiple examples of notable Statesmen \n     and Nobel Laureates alike who, empowered by incorporating\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n     the lessons learned from the liberal arts, made major \n     breakthroughs for mankind . . . such as human rights, freedom \n     of speech, the splitting of the atom, penicillin, the Magna \n     Carta, the Geneva Conventions, and the U.S. Constitution \n     itself . . .\n       Slowly, St. Mike's, without my knowledge, began to hone, \n     tame and humble me by introducing new ways of thinking and \n     reasoning.\n       I, like all my classmates, had to give up that concrete \n     black and white thinking of youth to meet the demands of the \n     outside world.\n       Most students incorporated those new concepts to one degree \n     or another over the next 4 years. Confidence was built \n     through testy debates on what our increasingly complex world \n     demanded of us. The process re-introduced me to the academic \n     world I thought was unfriendly . . . and gave me a new love \n     for books which were once the enemy of every dyslexic \n     child.\n       Less than a month into my freshman year a profound \n     geopolitical event occurred that no one had anticipated or \n     was ready for. On October 4, 1957 we huddled around the one \n     radio available in the barracks to listen to the faint \n     battery powered beeps of the Russian satellite Sputnik. The \n     following day the faculty held an `all student assembly' to \n     discuss the impact of the satellite launch on mankind and \n     openly asked if any students would consider changing their \n     major to the sciences. The Space war had begun in earnest. \n     Everyone's sense of security suddenly changed and with it \n     many Cold War humanitarian crises sprang up around the world \n     . . . many of which, in a short decade, I became mired in \n     myself.\n       Every generation has their own Sputnik moments. Your \n     generation already has more than your share.\n       The liberal arts and the comparative religion courses \n     prepared me for my life as a humanitarian more than I ever \n     realized at the time.\n       Yes, we all read the Bible and debated its meaning . . . \n     but we also found a certain solace in understanding that \n     similar beliefs were universal among many other religions and \n     the cultures they were tied to.\n       All religions that have survived over the centuries \n     collectively teach ``social justice'' . . . a language all \n     its own that defines the fair and just relationship between \n     the individual and society. It is that shared social justice \n     that I have in common with my humanitarian and volunteer \n     colleagues on every continent . . .  might they be Muslims, \n     Hindus, Christians, Jews, Buddhists, agnostics or atheists \n     and whether they live in the Middle East or rural Vermont.\n       All the major wars and multiple conflicts that I became \n     engulfed in over my lifetime were all fought over ``whose god \n     was the true god!'' Unfortunately, these wars continue today.\n       Admittedly, and probably somewhat selfishly, I fell in love \n     with the challenges of global health and humanitarian \n     assistance.\n       And yes, that shy girl friend who supported my application \n     to St. Mike's and I were married my first year of medical \n     school and we had 3 children by the time I finished my \n     residency at the Yale University Medical Center.\n       Service to one's country was mandatory then . . . and the \n     government obliged by drafting me into the military. In 1968 \n     I was rapidly trained and rushed, within 20 days, into the \n     madness of the Viet Nam war as a Combat physician with the \n     Marines.\n       Subsequently I was recalled to active duty as a combat \n     physician in 5 major wars, and over the years moved up the \n     invisible ladder of leadership in managing conflicts in over \n     40 countries. I've worked for and with the World Health \n     Organization, the International Red Cross and multiple global \n     humanitarian organizations. I found myself negotiating with \n     numerous African warlords and despots including Saddam \n     Hussein in Iraq.\n       I set up refugee camps, treated horrific war wounds, severe \n     malnutrition, scurvy, the death throes of starvation, and \n     cholera, malaria and blackwater fever, to name but a few . . \n     . When I was only a few years older than you, I had to manage \n     the largest Bubonic Plague epidemic of the last century.\n       Eventually, in 2003 I served the State Department as the \n     Senior Health Diplomat and first Interim Minister of Health \n     in Iraq where I was the target of 3 assassination attempts by \n     the same Sunni military that now, more than a decade later, \n     make up today's ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. Yes, it is \n     madness.\n       Obviously, my work was often quite dangerous. Making \n     uncomfortable but real decisions over who survives and who \n     doesn't, simply because there are scant resources, is always \n     a nightmare. Over 1,000 fellow humanitarian aid workers have \n     been killed during my time . . . many, many more than any \n     United Nations Peacekeepers.\n       I have seen more senseless death and suffering than anyone \n     my age should be allowed to witness. The same ``how and why'' \n     issues that I first struggled with in Logic class at St. \n     Mike's were now re-framed in very basic daily struggles of \n     both ethics and morality.\n       As such, I moved more and more to care for the most \n     vulnerable . . . the children, women, the elderly and \n     disabled who make up 90% or more of those who flee or become \n     ill, injured or die in every war. This became my calling.\n       While some of this may impress the budding healthcare \n     professionals in the audience, everything I experienced in \n     war was preventable . . . it need not have happened. War is \n     not the answer.\n       But, my humanitarian work was the most meaningful I have \n     ever done. I have no regrets. The saving of lives when the \n     victims themselves have given up . . . and working with some \n     of the most self-less people in the world, is addictive . . . \n     and for a physician the adrenaline rush, intensity of the \n     work and the diagnostic challenges are comparable to nothing \n     else.\n       As Medical Director of the last Orphan Lift out of Saigon \n     in 1975, I was secretly slipped into a refugee crowded, \n     already surrounded and hostile Saigon during its last days to \n     find abandoned and ill infants . . . many alone and starving \n     in dank and dirty orphanages. We airlifted out 310 nameless \n     infants in file boxes . . . 20 years later, by chance, I met \n     an attractive and ebullient Asian woman, now a graduate \n     student who had been the valedictorian of her college class. \n     She was one of the infants I rescued . . . Life comes full \n     circle . . . it was a really good day.\n       The scientific research that defines my academic career has \n     me closely working with like-minded colleagues in Iran, \n     Israel, Iraq, China, the European Union and many others. And \n     Yes, another example of life taking full circle . . . the \n     Nobel Laureates, once touted in 1957 as examples for us to \n     emulate by the St. Mike's science Professors, selected a 2013 \n     research study I co-authored to be presented and debated at \n     their World Summit in Spain last year. Good people are \n     listening and reading your work. So for the future academics \n     and scientists in the audience. . . . Never give up!\n       Hopefully, my now fading career allows me to reflect and \n     offer some parting Grand-Fatherly advice:\n       The essence of volunteerism is found in understanding the \n     culture of the people we engage with, even within our own \n     communities. In my experience, we did not understand the \n     culture of Viet Nam or Iraq, and when General Petraeus was \n     asked at the 10 year mark in Afghanistan what he would have \n     done differently he said ``I would have learned more about \n     the culture!'' . . .\n       Graduation marks your movement from the protective culture \n     of the campus to a culture that is more complex, unforgiving \n     at times, but also very exciting and worthwhile.\n       Most young volunteers are understandably burdened by the \n     non-action they have reluctantly inherited from my \n     generation. . . . . Burdens that shamelessly stem from \n     worldwide political neglect of both the health and science of \n     the planet.\n       You should be disappointed but also challenged. . . . \n     However, a very hopeful characteristic of your generation is \n     that you more often than not see yourselves less as \n     nationalists . . . and more as global citizens. This marks a \n     significant shift from my generation and a hopeful game-\n     changer in the global landscape.\n       As your volunteerism matures, use whatever bully pulpit you \n     have to expose and change those inequities that you see in \n     the world. The risk is worth it.\n       I spoke up in Iraq over blatant human rights violations of \n     the Geneva Convention and was called a ``traitor'' in the \n     political Press. I am most proud I made that choice.\n       Remember, those who do have the political power to make \n     change frequently do not know what they don't know. \n     Instinctively, all volunteers are also educators and \n     advocates. . . . It comes with the title.\n       The MOVE program, run by the Campus Ministry, and the Fire \n     & Rescue Squad represent realistic ``real world models'' that \n     one can neither assume nor get from the classroom alone. I \n     wish I had experienced them myself. These inspiring volunteer \n     initiatives have changed the culture of the College and more \n     broadly and accurately re-defined ``American \n     exceptionalism.''\n       Harvard, where I teach today, has recently taken a page \n     from the St. Mike's playbook by placing more emphasis on \n     accepting students to College who value caring for the \n     community over individual extracurricular achievements. They \n     claim that ``community service'' and the ethical concern for \n     the greater public good!'' is a more sensitive and true \n     measure of an applicant.\n       I agree! St. Mike's, emphasizing ``service to others'' has \n     owned and promoted this belief for many decades.\n       Aid to the oppressed has never stood still. Volunteerism, \n     in general, is increasingly moving toward prevention, \n     recovery and rehabilitation. . . . . Your role models must be \n     those distinguished recipients of the honorary degrees today. \n     I applaud their self-less commitments to others.\n       St. Mike's was an unselfish gift to me. My class of 1961 \n     was unique in producing many leaders in science, education, \n     government, law, the military, industry, the social sciences, \n     and medicine and dentistry to name but a few. They are all \n     great citizens who still argue incessantly over politics . . \n     . some things never change. . . . nor should they!\n       Please promise me that you will see your classmates often . \n     . . call them, email them and return to the reunions . . . \n     it's a great time to brag and see that everyone is equally \n     aging and putting on weight. I do miss many of my friends and \n     colleagues and also the professors who I tried to model \n     myself on who passed away before I could thank them.\n       And yes, . . . as a bonus, there is another Harvard study \n     this year that shows that both volunteers and their \n     recipients increase social connections, reduce stress . . . \n     and live longer lives!\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\n       I must close now. . . . As a 31 year Navy and Marine Corp \n     veteran I wish to leave you with a saying that we, in the \n     service of our country, always thought was strictly a \n     nautical blessing. . . . In point of fact, it is a universal \n     phrase of good luck as one departs on a voyage in life. . . . \n     It reads: ``Let me square the yards . . . while we may . . . \n     and make a fair wind of it homeward''. I wish you all in this \n     audience ``Fair Winds and Following Seas''. . . . God speed \n     to you and St. Mikes . . . and thank you for listening . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3535-1"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEVIN PEARCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont athletes are no strangers to the \nU.S. Winter Olympic team. In 2009, the Hartland, VT, raised Kevin \nPearce was readying himself to be a member of that team when tragedy \nstruck. During a routine half-pipe training session for the 2010 \nOlympics, Kevin suffered a traumatic brain injury and was nearly killed \nwhen he crashed and struck his head. Since then, Kevin, with the \nsupport of his family, has worked to recover and heal from that \nterrible accident. I have heard firsthand from Kevin how instrumental \nhis younger brother David was in providing positive feedback and \nencouragement as he completed his physical therapy. Together with his \nolder brother, Adam, Kevin started the Love Your Brain Foundation, \nwhich offers support to survivors of traumatic brain injuries, their \nfamilies, and their caregivers.\n  The Love Your Brain Foundation recently held its free annual retreat \nin Lincoln, VT. The foundation's mission extends beyond simply \nproviding support to survivors; it also works to raise broader public \nawareness about the condition. Kevin, Adam, and those who support the \nmission of the Love Your Brain Foundation believe that traditional \ntreatment options, as well as alternative methods of care, can help \nsurvivors of traumatic brain injuries lead full and healthy lives. The \nfoundation's annual retreat enables people from around the country, and \nsome from Canada, who are dealing with traumatic brain injuries to \nshare their own personal stories and to sharpen skills in workshops \nfocused on music, yoga, and nutrition education.\n  Whether the result of sporting accidents or from a vehicle crash, \ninjuries sustained on the hiking trail or the battlefield, there is \nstill much to be learned about traumatic brain injuries and how best to \nhelp those who sustain them recover. That is why the work of the Love \nYour Brain Foundation makes a real difference.\n  Kevin Pearce's life forever changed the day of his accident. He and \nhis family have taken that tragedy and turned it into an opportunity to \nadvance public awareness. His story is one we can all be inspired by, \nand his road to recovery is one we should all from and seek to emulate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a May 28 article written \nby Vermont Associated Press reporter Lisa Rathke, entitled ``Injured \nsnowboarder helps brain injury survivors,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, May 28, 2016]\n\n            Injured Snowboarder Helps Brain Injury Survivors\n\n                            (By Lisa Rathke)\n\n       Lincoln--A near-fatal halfpipe crash while training for the \n     2010 Olympics ended Kevin Pearce's snowboarding career and \n     changed his life forever. Six years later, Pearce, 28, \n     continues to cope with his traumatic brain injury that he \n     will carry with him for the rest of his life and he's helping \n     other survivors do the same.\n       Pearce, who grew up in Vermont, and his brother started the \n     Love Your Brain Foundation to support traumatic brain injury \n     survivors and caregivers. The foundation provides workshops \n     for yoga teachers to cater their classes to brain injury \n     survivors. It also offers a free yearly retreat for those \n     with traumatic brain injury and their caregivers that is \n     taking place this week in Lincoln, Vermont, and hopes to \n     offer retreats in other parts of the country.\n       The foundation raises money to cover these activities and \n     is working on educating young athletes about the importance \n     of ``loving their brains''' and preventing concussions.\n       About 50 people from around the country and Canada are \n     attending the third annual event that also features nutrition \n     education, art, music and other mindfulness activities. \n     Attendees can also share their personal stories.\n       ``There was a huge missing piece to traumatic brain \n     injuries and there's such an unknown for so many people of \n     what to do after they sustain this injury,'' said Pearce, \n     following a morning yoga class at the retreat in a barnlike \n     building on a hillside.\n       Alternatives such as acupuncture, yoga and meditation are \n     proving helpful to traumatic brain injury survivors in their \n     recoveries, said Dr. Roger Knakal, medical director of \n     physical medicine and rehabilitation and the University of \n     Vermont Medical Center.\n       One of the hardest parts about traumatic brain injuries is \n     that they are invisible injuries, said Pearce's brother Adam.\n       The biggest eye-opener was how isolated people can become \n     from a brain injury, he said. ``When you have a brain injury, \n     you feel so not normal,'' said Pearce. ``You're thrown back \n     into the regular world. You're expected to be as you were \n     before this. We're not able to do that because we're now a \n     new person.''\n       Pearce was considered, along with Shaun White, to be one of \n     America's top athletes in the sport at the time of his crash. \n     On New Year's Eve in 2009, he struck his head during half-\n     pipe training in Utah. He was in critical care for a month \n     and then acute care for two weeks before moving to a \n     rehabilitation center in Denver. He had to relearn how to \n     walk, talk, even swallow. The family then moved back to \n     Vermont where he continued rehab.\n       Pearce, who now lives in Bend, Oregon, continues to do \n     cognitive therapy and is seeing eye therapists in Chicago to \n     help with vision problems. He maintains a busy schedule, \n     speaking to various groups about his story and the importance \n     of ``loving your brain'' and showing the 2013 documentary \n     about him called ``Crash Reel.''\n       Ari Havusha, 20, of Vancouver, returned to the retreat for \n     the third time this year. He said he suffered several severe \n     concussions and an eye injury as a teen soccer player and \n     another severe concussion later during a college fall. He \n     lives with a constant headache.\n       Havusha withdrew from McGill University in Montreal and \n     returned home, where he became anxious and depressed. His \n     mother pointed to the Love Your Brain retreat and right away, \n     Havusha said, he knew he had to do it. ``It was a huge \n     turning point for me,'' he said. ``I saw other people and \n     their traumatic stories and I was able to connect with other \n     people. Suddenly I was kind of lifted out of that isolation I \n     felt so heavily.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3537-1"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3537-S3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL BILL GORTNEY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I honor an exceptional leader and \naviator. After 39 years, a lifetime of service to our Nation, ADM Bill \nGortney is retiring from the U.S. Navy. On this occasion, I find it \nfitting to recognize Admiral Gortney's many accomplishments and years \nof uniformed service to our Nation.\n  As the son of a U.S. Navy captain and WWII aviator, Admiral Gortney \nwas no stranger to the challenges and opportunities of naval aviation. \nAfter graduating from Elon College with a bachelor of arts in history \nand political science, he entered the Aviation Officer Candidate School \nand commissioned in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1977. He earned his wings \nof gold as a naval aviator following his graduation from the jet strike \npilot training pipeline in 1978. He is a 1996 graduate of Naval War \nCollege and earned his master of arts in international security \naffairs.\n  Admiral Gortney moved through the ranks quickly, moving from \ncommander to four-star admiral in 8 years. Despite his rapid ascent \nthrough the command naval ranks, Admiral Gortney still managed to log \nover 5,360 mishap-free flight hours and completed over 1,265 carrier-\narrested landings primarily in the A-7E Corsair II and the F/A-18 \nHornet. Admiral Gortney has completed seven tours of command, starting \nwith the VFA-15 Vallions and culminating with his third commanding tour \nin U.S. Central Command, as commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central \nCommand / U.S. 5th Fleet, where he provided support to maritime \nsecurity operations and combat operations for Operations Enduring \nFreedom And Iraqi Freedom.\n  Admiral Gortney's first flag tour was as the deputy chief of staff \nfor Global Force Management and Joint Operation, U.S. Fleet Forces \nCommand in Norfolk. This was followed by assignment as Commander, \nCarrier Strike Group 10 onboard the USS Harry S Truman, during which \ntime he was promoted to a two-star rear admiral. After promotion to his \nthird star, he was assigned as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central \nCommand/U.S. 5th Fleet/Combined Maritime Forces, Bahrain. He also \nserved as director, joint staff, from 2010-2012. In 2012, he became \nCommander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command. His final assignment prior to \nretirement was that of Commander, North American Aerospace Defense \nCommand and U.S. Northern Command. It is the first and only position \nthat places a single military commander in charge of the protection of\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\nour Nation from any potential attacks on U.S. soil. It is also the only \nbinational command in the world's existence between Canada and the \nUnited States.\n  During his tenure there, Admiral Gortney redefined the mission for \nUSNORTHCOM's future, furthering the bonds that have secured the skies \nabove the homelands for 60 years. He built a personal trust critical to \nthe strength of the alliance with our partners in Canada, Mexico, and \nthe Bahamas and was able to expand the traditional bounds of security \ncooperation. He increased military-to-military training and \ninteraction. Within the homeland, Admiral Gortney's keen intuition led \nto a deliberate campaign plan to protect the United States forces from \nthe threat of homegrown violent extremists. He led the Department of \nDefense planning to support lead Federal agencies to minimize the \nthreat of both the Ebola and Zika viruses.\n  Throughout his career, Admiral Gortney's message of empowerment and \nhis relentless desire to seek creative solutions to the commands' \nchallenges has served as an example to all during his lifetime \nexemplary of military service. I join with the members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee in expressing my respect and gratitude to \nAdmiral Gortney for his outstanding service to our Nation. I offer \nheartfelt thanks to Bill; his wife, Sherry; their children, Stephanie \nand Billy; daughter-in-law, Jackie; and grandchildren, Gavin and \nGrayson. Congratulations to all on Bill's retirement from the U.S. Navy \nafter a lifetime of dedicated service. To Bill, trusted leader and \ndedicated patriot, fair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3537-2"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRIANGLE X RANCH\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to \nshare some news with the Senate about a very important anniversary we \nare celebrating in my home State. This is the year the Triangle X \nRanch, one of our State's great attractions, is marking its 90th year \nof operation.\n  As you can imagine, the Triangle X has quite a story to tell of those \n90 years. It began in the early 1900s when a visitor fell in love with \nan especially beautiful area of Wyoming. It continues to this day, its \n90th year, cared for over the years by five generations of the Turner \nfamily.\n  The people of my home State have a great fondness and appreciation \nfor the Triangle X because it reminds us of our Western heritage and \nour love of the land and all it provides. It reminds us of our growth \nas a State and what it was like to live in Wyoming back in those days.\n  The Triangle X Ranch Web site tells the story of the ranch. It \nbegins, back in the early 1900s, when John and Maytie Turner liked to \ntake ``fun vacations,'' as they called them, to Yellowstone National \nPark. It was during one of those visits they had a chance to see an \narea around Jackson Hole for the first time. It was one of those \nstorybook encounters--or to put it another way: love at first sight.\n  Life was a lot tougher back then, so when they decided to make the \narea their home, they had to bring their sons back with them to get \nthings started. It took a tremendous effort to build their home so they \nwould have a place to stay. Even today, it is hard to imagine what an \neffort it took for them to live what had become their dream.\n  For starters, they had to bring the logs from some felled trees to \ntheir home site so they could build the basement of what would become \ntheir home. Once that was done, they had a place where they could live \nwhile they built the rest of their house.\n  Everything was difficult. Providing for the essentials they needed \ntook planning and some time. Just taking a trip to the nearest town \ntook several days. They had to grow or produce their own food, and \nwhile they were at it, they had to come up with ways of making \nsomething of a living.\n  This paragraph from the history section of their Web site says a lot \nabout what their life was like back then for them and for many of those \nwho had left the comforts of home and traded them for the great freedom \nand excitement of Wyoming and the West: ``Because there was no \nelectricity, wood supplied heat and kerosene lamps brought light to \ninteriors. Refrigeration was provided by large chunks of ice that had \nbeen cut from nearby beaver ponds in the winter and stored in piles of \nsawdust to keep through the summer. A fresh meat supply was provided by \nthe Turners' cattle herd, chickens and big game harvested in the fall. \nSurprisingly, most of these methods of supply continued through the \n1940s.''\n  The next generation saw more changes to the ranch. It was now a dude \nranch. Their Web site describes how it became an ``authorized \nconcession of the National Park Service--the last dude ranch concession \nwithin the entire National Park system.''\n  Today, a fifth generation of the Turner family is working the ranch \nand greeting guests, both new and returning friends, the lifestyle \ntheir family has loved for all these years. As each guest comes to the \nTriangle X, they receive the kind of education you just can't get from \nwatching a movie or reading a book. You are immersed in a lifestyle \nthat provides you with a front row seat to what life was like in the \ndays of the old West.\n  As you can tell, I enjoy talking about the people of Wyoming, our \nbusinesses, and our unique brand of hospitality. I can't encourage you \nstrongly enough to come to Wyoming and get a taste of what life was \nlike back in the days when the West was the best part of our national \nheritage--and you will see that it still is. When you come to my home \nState, you might stop by the Triangle X and then explore some more of \nWyoming and the West.\n  Our homegrown businesses are one of the special things about Wyoming. \nTogether, they form the backbone of Wyoming's economy and they keep us \nheaded in the right direction. They are the strength of Wyoming and the \nWest, and they are one of the reasons why people keep flocking to \nJackson and the other cities and towns of Wyoming.\n  I will close by once again congratulating all those who are a part of \nthe Triangle X story. They have made a difference in our State and in \nthe lives of all those who come to visit. I would also like to invite \nmy colleagues to come and see my home State. You can't beat our scenic \nbeauty, hospitality, and our history and legacy as a State. I can \npromise you that you will have an adventure in Wyoming that you will \nremember for a long time to come.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3538-1"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3538-S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     PEASE GREETERS' 1000TH FLIGHT\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the Pease Greeters' nonprofit organization for more than \n11 years of continuous service in greeting our troops and civilian \npersonnel from the Department of Defense, DOD, passing through the \nPease International Trade Port in Portsmouth, NH. In June of 2016, they \nwill have welcomed more than 1,000 flights passing through the trade \nport on their way to or from Afghanistan, Iraq, or other areas of \nconflict in the world.\n  The Pease Greeters organization was created in May of 2005 when an \nunannounced plane carrying members of the U.S. military landed at the \nPease International Airport. The airport director, maintenance manager, \nand airport employees quickly got together to meet and greet these \ntroops, offering coffee, donuts, and a big thank you for their service. \nSoon thereafter, the airport director discovered that additional \ncharter flights would be arriving at Pease. Upon learning this, he \nreached out to the Seacoast Marine Corps League for assistance \nwelcoming the troops and putting together a fitting ceremony to show \nrespect, appreciation, and honor for their service.\n  Once word spread, dozens of citizens from New Hampshire, Maine, and \nMassachusetts, lent their support to organize what quickly became known \nas the Pease Greeters, whose mission is to promote broad participation \nin this welcoming of heroes, paying special attention to the education \nof school children by instilling respect and admiration for the troops \nthrough formal ceremonies for each flight. Whether it is 4 a.m. in the \nmorning or 4 p.m. in the\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nafternoon, the Pease Greeters are there to welcome and thank the \nmembers of the military and the civilian men and women working in the \nDOD coming through Pease. As of May 2016, the Pease Greeters have met \nmore than 190,000 servicemen and servicewomen at the trade port, \nprovided a bank of phones where they can call loved ones anywhere in \nthe world free of charge, offered them more than 27,000 pizzas, 167,000 \nsandwiches, 110,000 bottles of water or soda, and 74,000 knitted hats.\n  As the Pease Greeters welcomes its 1,000th flight on June 26, 2016, I \ncommend the board of directors, the many volunteers, the supporting \nbusinesses, the Pease International Airport director and staff, and the \nhundreds of well-wishers who have spent more than 11 years thanking and \nhonoring our troops and DOD members for their service and selfless \nsacrifice to our Nation. As the Pease Greeters' mission continues, I \nhave no doubt they will continue to provide comfort and welcome many \nfuture military members arriving or departing from the Pease \nInternational Trade Port.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3538-2"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MEMORIAL TOURNAMENT\n\n Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 40th \nanniversary of the first playing of the Memorial Tournament, ``the \nMemorial'', at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, OH. Jack \nNicklaus, a golf legend and Congressional Gold Medal recipient, founded \nthe Memorial in 1976. Jack wanted to bring an annual PGA tour event to \nCentral Ohio and named the tournament ``the Memorial'' to recognize a \nperson or persons, living or deceased, who have contributed to the game \nof golf with honor.\n  The Memorial has been a significant benefit to charitable \norganizations. For example, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, \nOH, has received over $14 million from the Memorial. In honor of that \nsupport, the hospital renamed its neonatal intensive care unit, NICU, \nas the Memorial NICU in 2006. The Memorial has also helped other \norganizations, such as the James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research \nInstitute, the First Tee of Central Ohio, Shriners, and many more. The \nMemorial provides a significant economic development impact to the \ncentral Ohio region with an estimated $35 million annually toward the \neconomy.\n  I am honored to have attended the Memorial to see firsthand its \nimpact in the community. I would like to congratulate all who were \ninvolved in making the first 40 years of the Memorial a \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3539-1"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING ALABAMA'S SPECIAL CAMP FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n40th anniversary of Alabama's Special Camp for Children and Adults, a \nnationally recognized leader in therapeutic recreation for children and \nadults with both physical and intellectual disabilities.\n  Also known as Camp ASCCA, the organization was founded in 1976 with \nthe goal of helping eligible individuals achieve equality, dignity, and \nmaximum independence. Camp ASCCA is the only one of its kind in the \nState of Alabama and hosts between 6,000 and 8,000 people each year, \nall varying in age.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nmy friend Marlin Moore of Tuscaloosa, AL, who passed away on May 25, \n2016. He will be long remembered as an accomplished businessman and a \ncivic leader.\n  A native of Tuscaloosa, Marlin attended Tuscaloosa High School and \nthen went on to become a student at the University of Alabama's School \nof Commerce. Following graduation, he joined the firm of Pritchett-\nMoore, Inc., where he worked under its founders, Marlin Moore, Sr., and \nHarry H. Pritchett.\n  Marlin eventually became president and then chairman of Pritchett-\nMoore. Not only did he develop 43 subdivisions during his time with \nPritchett-Moore, but he was involved with the Realtors Association both \non the State and national level. Marlin served two terms as president \nof the Tuscaloosa Association of Realtors, president of the Alabama \nAssociation of Realtors, and served as a board member of the National \nAssociation of Realtors for 11 years. For his contributions to the real \nestate community, he received the Alabama Realtor of the Year Award and \nwas named a member of the Home Builders Association of Tuscaloosa Hall \nof Fame.\n  In addition to his interest and work in real estate, Marlin was also \na founder of Security Bank, where he served as its chairman. He served \nas a board member of First National Bank and AmSouth Bank, and he \nserved two terms on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n  In addition to his professional contributions to west Alabama, Marlin \nworked with several philanthropic organizations such as the United Way \nof West Alabama, West Alabama Chamber of Commerce, Red Cross, Exchange \nClub, the Boy Scout Council, the West Alabama Community Foundation, and \nthe University of Alabama and the Crimson Tide Track Program. In 2008, \nhe was inducted into the Pillars of West Alabama for his dedicated \nefforts and service to the area.\n  The city of Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama was fortunate to have \na great businessman and civic leader like Marlin Moore, and he will be \nsorely missed. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Laine, and \ntheir children as they celebrate his life and mourn his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3539-3"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 3(a) of the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act of 2016 \n(Public Law 114-140), the Minority Leader appoints the following \nindividuals on the part of the House of Representatives to the \nCommission on Evidence-Based Policymaking: Dr. Sherry A.

 By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 3028. A bill to redesignate the Olympic Wilderness as the Daniel \nJ. Evans Wilderness; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Murray \nin introducing legislation to rename the Olympic Wilderness in Olympic \nNational Park as the Daniel J. Evans Wilderness, in honor of former \nWashington Senator and Governor Dan Evans.\n  Dan Evans has had a long and distinguished career in public service. \nHe was first elected Governor of Washington in 1964 and was reelected \nin 1968 and 1972. In 1983, he was appointed to fill the term of the \nlate Senator Henry M. Jackson and served an additional term in the \nSenate before retiring in January, 1989. From 1993 through 2005, \nSenator Evans served as a member of the University of Washington Board \nof Regents.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Evans was a leader in the \npassage of two major wilderness bills in our state. He was a cosponsor \nof the 1984 Washington Wilderness Act, which designated more than one \nmillion acres of national forest lands in Washington as wilderness. And \nhe was the lead sponsor of the Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988, \nwhich designated more than 1.5 million acres of Wilderness in Olympic, \nMount Rainier and North Cascade National Parks.\n  Thanks to Senator Evans' dedication to protecting many of our state's \nmost spectacular wildlands, Washingtonians and all Americans are able \nto enjoy outdoor recreation opportunities in some of our Nation's most \niconic areas, including protection of more than 876,000 acres of \nwilderness in Olympic National Park.\n  This dedication will not affect the management of either the national \npark or the wilderness, but it will appropriately recognize the \nimportant role of Dan Evans in securing the permanent protection of \nthis magnificent landscape.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Barrasso, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Cruz, Mr. Daines, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Ernst, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. \n        Flake, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heller, Mr. \n        Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Lee, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. Moran, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Paul, Mr. Perdue, Mr. \n        Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Scott, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Thune, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \n        Wicker, and Mr. Sullivan):\n  S.J. Res. 34. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by the Department of Labor relating to defining and \ndelimiting the exemptions for executive, administrative, professional, \noutside sales, and computer employees; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce a \nCongressional Review Act resolution of disapproval on the \nadministration's so-called overtime rule. I am joined by Senator \nJohnson of Wisconsin on this effort and also 43 other Senators who are \ncosponsors.\n  While President Obama is running around talking about keeping college \ncosts down, his administration has put out this so-called overtime rule \nthat could raise tuition by hundreds of dollars for millions of \nAmerican college students or cause layoffs at our colleges and \nuniversities. In Tennessee, for example, colleges report to me that \nthey may have to raise tuition by anywhere from $200 a student to $850 \na student in one case because of this rule.\n  The administration's new rule is a radical change to our Nation's \novertime rules. What they have done is doubled the salary threshold for \novertime. Here is what that means. Hourly workers are usually paid for \novertime work, but salaried workers generally don't earn overtime \nunless they are making below a threshold set by the Labor Department, \nas required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Today that threshold is \n$23,660. This administration is raising it all at one time to $47,476. \nThe administration calls this the overtime rule. I think we should call \nthis the ``time card'' rule or the ``higher tuition'' rule. This means \nthat a midlevel manager in Knoxville or Nashville who is making $40,000 \na year is going to have to go back to punching a time card.\n  The rule affects 4.23 million workers nationwide and nearly 100,000 \nin Tennessee. It is going to create huge costs for employers, including \nsmall businesses, nonprofits, such as the Boy Scouts, and colleges and \nuniversities. They have to decide whether to cut services, cut \nbenefits, lay off or demote employees, or create more part-time jobs or \ndo a little of all of that.\n  The University of Tennessee says that if they increase everyone's \nsalaries to meet the new threshold, they will have to increase tuition \nby over $200 per student on average, with some seeing as much as a $456 \nincrease.\n  If they put all the salaried employees back on time cards, they will \nface big morale issues.\n  Listen to this letter I received from a University of Tennessee \nemployee:\n\n       Currently, I am an exempt employee but I stand to fall \n     under the non-exempt status under the new standards. While \n     this may not seem like a major issue to many, I stand to lose \n     a substantial amount of benefits if my status changes. The \n     nature of my position does not ever cause me to work \n     overtime, as I work in an office from 8:30-4:30 daily and I \n     am salaried. If I am reclassified, it appears I will lose 96 \n     hours of annual leave per year, as well as be subject to an \n     almost 100 hour lower cap on accrued annual leave.\n\n  Another private college in Tennessee tells me it will cost them the \nequivalent of $850 a student if they don't lay off any employees.\n  As employers, they also face the cascade of regulations that is \ncoming from the Labor Department.\n  This rule should be called the ``time card'' rule because they are \ngoing to pull millions of Americans who have climbed their way to \nsalaried positions backwards--back to filling out a timecard and \npunching a clock, back to having fewer benefits, backwards in their \ncareers, back to being left out of the room, back to being left off \nemails and even out of the discussion.\n  Want to show your stuff at work? Want to get up early, leave late, \nclimb the ladder, earn the American dream the way that so many \nAmericans have before you? Tough luck. Employers are going to say: \nDon't come early. Don't stay late. Don't take time off to go to your \nkids' football game. Work your 8 hours and go home. I don't have enough \nmoney to pay you overtime.\n  This rule says the Obama administration knows best. They know how to \nmanage your career, your work schedule, your free time, and your \nincome. They know better than you do.\n  Today, somebody who makes a salary of less than $23,660 must be paid \novertime. Almost everyone agrees that threshold is low and should begin \nto go up. Almost everyone said to the administration: It is time to \nraise the number, but don't go too high, too fast or you will create \nall kinds of destruction.\n  They didn't listen, so now we are going to have these huge costs.\n  Let's talk about employers. Let's remember that we are talking about \nnonprofits like Operation Smile, which is a charity that funds cleft \npalate operations for children. They say this rule will mean 3,000 \nfewer surgeries a year. Then there is the Great Smoky Mountain Council \nof the Boy Scouts, my home council, which estimates $100,000 in added \nannual costs because during certain seasons, employees staff weekend \ncampouts and recruitment events, which mean longer hours.\n  Many Americans are discouraged by this economic recovery. Millions \nare still waiting for the recovery. But you don't grow the economy by \nregulations such as this.\n  The National Retail Federation says the rule will ``curtail career \nadvancement opportunities, diminish workplace flexibility, damage \nemployee morale, and lead to a more hierarchical workplace.''\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n  The U.S. Chamber Commerce says: ``The dramatic escalation of the \nsalary threshold, below which employees must be paid overtime for \nworking more than 40 hours a week, will mean millions of employees who \nare salaried professionals will have to be reclassified to hourly wage \nworkers.''\n  There are 16 million Americans--including 320,000 Tennesseans--who \nare working part time while looking for full-time work or who are out \nof work entirely. They need a vibrant economy; they don't need \nWashington bureaucrats telling them how to manage their work schedule, \ntheir free time, and their income.\n  I know this is a good-sounding rule, but it wrestles more and more \ncontrol from the hands of Americans and small business owners and puts \nmore power in Washington agencies.\n  Many of these rules, like the overtime rule or the ``higher tuition'' \nrule or the ``time card'' rule--call it whatever you will--won't stand \nthe test of time. They will end up in courts and they will lose, or \nanother President will come along and fix what is broken. But in the \nmeantime, how many millions of dollars and hours of time will be wasted \nas small business owners make excruciating decisions about how to \nimplement these rules?\n  My hope is that the Senate will vote to give this ``time card'' \n``higher tuition'' rule an early death before business owners and \nnonprofits and colleges and universities begin the task of implementing \nit by December.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise first to say thank you to the \nSenator from Tennessee for leading this vote of disapproval on what is \nreally a terrible rule. It is a solution looking for a problem.\n  I spent 31 years running a manufacturing plant. It has been my \nexperience that I have never had somebody in my operation ask to go \nfrom salary to hourly. I remember in 2004 when they tightened the rules \nand a number of people who worked for me were forced into hourly. None \nof them wanted to go. By the way, none of them received higher wages or \na higher salary; they just lost flexibility--and that is exactly what \nis going to happen.\n  Being an accountant, I would like to kind of go through the numbers. \nThese are the Department of Labor's own calculations. They claim there \nwould be $1.2 billion more wages paid to workers. That is what they \nclaim the benefit is going to be, but they also admit that there will \nbe $678 million in compliance costs to businesses just trying to figure \nout the rule, trying to implement it.\n  What they are missing is, if wages--and I think that is a big ``if'' \nbecause I think what will end up happening is--you know, employers are \ncompeting in a global economy, and you can't just increase costs. So my \nguess, basically, is what is going to happen--and happened to my \nbusiness in 2004--is they will just adjust. The workers won't get any \nmore money. But let's just say $1.2 billion in wages is paid to \nworkers. Well, that will be a cost to businesses. So as far as the \noverall benefit to the economy, wages might increase $1.2 billion, but \nbusiness costs will increase $1.2 billion, and that nets to zero \nbenefit to the economy. But there will still be a $678 million \ncompliance cost to businesses, and, of course, that will be added to \nthe already onerous regulatory burden on our economy.\n  There are three different studies--the Small Business Administration, \nthe Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the National Association of \nManufacturers--putting the cost of complying with Federal regulation \nsomewhere between $1.75 trillion to over $2 trillion per year. If you \ntake the medium estimate of that and divide it by 127 million \nhouseholds, that is a total cost of compliance with Federal regulations \nof $14,800 per year, per household. The only larger expense to a \nhousehold is housing. That is the cost of complying.\n  Let me finish with another figure--$12,000 per year, per employee. \nThat is the cost of just four Obama regulations to one Wisconsin paper \nmanufacturer. I can't tell you which one because the CEO fears \nretaliation. Now, think of that for a minute. But just four Obama \nregulations are costing one paper manufacturer the equivalent of \n$12,000 per year, per employee.\n  So if you are concerned about income inequality, if you are wondering \nwhy wages have stagnated, look no further than this massive regulatory \nburden, and of course the overtime rule is just one of those burdens. I \nwould just ask everybody, would you rather have that $12,000 feeding \nthe government in compliance costs or would you rather have that \n$12,000 in your paycheck feeding your family?\n  Making a living is hard. Big Government just makes it a whole lot \nharder, and this overtime rule is just going to make it that much more \nincrementally harder.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a few minutes to compliment \nChairman Alexander and Senator Johnson for their resolution of \ndisapproval on the overtime rule.\n  When I came into the Chamber, Lamar Alexander was making his speech, \nfollowed by Senator Johnson. I listened closely, because I got a phone \ncall last week from Bryant Wright, the pastor at the Johnson Ferry \nBaptist Church in Marietta, GA. They are one of the largest Baptist \nchurches in my State. They provide daycare. They provide early \nchildhood development. They provide sports activities. They provide \nvacation Bible school--a 24/7 program for underprivileged kids.\n  The unintended consequence of what I am sure is a well-intended \nregulation is that a 24-hour-a-day camp counselor at Johnson Ferry \nBaptist Church for their vacation Bible school will be paid regular pay \nfor 8 hours and then have to be paid time and a half for the other 16 \nhours of the day they are with the child under the application of the \nrule. You are going to price the Johnson Ferry Baptist Church out of \nthe business of providing for underprivileged children. And what is \ngoing to happen? Those people are going to come to the government for \nthe government to provide that service.\n  So what this will do is take a church out of the business of helping \nhuman beings and put the government in the position of having more \ndemand for taxpayers to fund services that would have been provided \nanyway.\n  I commend Chairman Alexander. I commend Senator Johnson and others. I \nurge all my colleagues to join them in the resolution of disapproval in \nthe overtime rule. It is wrong for America. Its consequences are \nunintended, but they are devastating. I urge everybody to vote in favor \nof it, and I appreciate Senator Alexander for his leadership in \nintroducing that joint resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/07/senate-section/article/S3544-1"}, {"day": "07", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3545-S3547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4448.

UNCLASSIFIED NOTICE AND MEMORANDUM OF \n                   UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE \n                   FOREIGN COUNTRY OR ENTITY CONCERNED BEFORE \n                   TRANSFER OF ANY DETAINEE AT UNITED STATES NAVAL \n                   STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, TO A FOREIGN \n                   COUNTRY OR ENTITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The detention facilities at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were established in 2002 for \n     the purpose of detaining those who plan, authorize, commit, \n     or aid in the planning, authorizing, or committing of acts of \n     terrorism against the United States.\n       (2) The facilities have detained individuals who have \n     killed, maimed, or otherwise harmed innocent civilians and \n     members of the United States Armed Forces, as well as \n     combatants who have received specialized training in the \n     conduct and facilitation of acts of terrorism against the \n     United States, its citizens, and its allies. This includes 9/\n     11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed and scores of other known \n     terrorists.\n       (3) The location of the detention facilities at Guantanamo \n     Bay protects the United States, its citizens, and its allies. \n     No prisoner has ever escaped from Guantanamo Bay.\n       (4) On January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama issued \n     Executive Order 13492 ordering the closure of the detention \n     facilities at Guantanamo Bay, consistent with the national \n     security and foreign policy interests of the United States \n     and the interests of justice.\n       (5) Executive Order 13492 directs the Department of State \n     to participate in the review of each detainee to determine \n     whether it is possible to transfer or release the individual \n     consistent with the national security and foreign policy \n     interests of the United States.\n       (6) The Secretary of State is ordered to expeditiously \n     pursue and direct negotiations and diplomatic efforts with \n     foreign governments as are necessary and appropriate to \n     implement Executive Order 13492.\n       (7) Since 2009, the Department of State has played a \n     substantial role in the review and transfer of enemy \n     combatants from the jurisdiction of the United States to the \n     custody or control of foreign governments through the \n     appointment of a Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure.\n       (8) President Obama has released numerous detainees from \n     Guantanamo Bay since taking office, some of whom are known or \n     suspected to have reengaged in terrorist activity.\n       (9) The transfer of individuals from Guantanamo Bay to \n     foreign countries sharply increased from 2014 to 2016, \n     bringing the number of detainees remaining at Guantanamo Bay \n     to less than 100.\n       (10) The administration often transfers detainees to \n     countries in close proximity to their countries of origin. In \n     some cases, prisoners have been relocated within blocks of \n     United States diplomatic facilities located in countries with \n     governments that have publicly stated no intention to monitor \n     or restrict travel of potentially dangerous former detainees \n     or that otherwise lack the capacity to mitigate threat \n     potential.\n       (11) The administration is required to notify Congress of \n     its intent to transfer individuals detained at Guantanamo \n     pursuant to section 1034 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92) \n     and certify that among other things, the foreign country to \n     which the individual is proposed to be transferred has taken \n     or agreed to take appropriate steps to substantially mitigate \n     any risk the individual could attempt to reengage in \n     terrorist activity or otherwise threaten the United States or \n     its allies or interests.\n       (12) While not required by law, the administration has \n     classified these notifications so that only a small number of \n     individuals are able to know their contents.\n       (13) The information contained in such a notice does not \n     warrant classification, given that third-party nations and \n     the detainees themselves possess such information.\n       (14) The decision to classify the notice and certification \n     results in a process that is not transparent, thereby \n     preventing the American public from knowing pertinent \n     information about the release of these individuals.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the people of the United States deserve to know who is \n     being released from the detention facilities at United States \n     Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, their countries of \n     origin, their destinations, and the ability of the host \n     nation to prevent recidivism; and\n       (2) the people of the United States deserve transparency in \n     the manner in which the Obama Administration complies with \n     Executive Order 13492.\n       (c) Notice Required.--Not less than 30 days prior to the \n     transfer of any individual detained at Guantanamo to the \n     custody or control of the individual's country of origin, any \n     other foreign country, or any other foreign entity, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, submit to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress an unclassified notice that includes--\n       (1) the name, country of origin, and country of destination \n     of the individual;\n       (2) the number of individuals detained at Guantanamo \n     previously transferred to the\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\n     country to which the individual is proposed to be \n     transferred; and\n       (3) the number of such individuals who are known or \n     suspected to have reengaged in terrorist activity after being \n     transferred to that country.\n       (d) Briefing.--The Secretary of Defense shall brief the \n     appropriate committees of Congress within 5 days of \n     transmitting the notice required by subsection (c).

COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT REGARDING RUSSIAN \n                   VIOLATIONS OF THE OPEN SKIES TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the President's letter of submittal for \n     the Open Skies Treaty provided to Congress by the Secretary \n     of State on August 12, 1992, it is the purpose of the Open \n     Skies Treaty to promote openness and transparency of military \n     forces and activities and to enhance mutual understanding and \n     confidence by giving States Party a direct role in gathering \n     information about military forces and activities of concern \n     to them.\n       (2) According to the Department of State's 2016 Compliance \n     Report, the Russian Federation ``continues not to meet its \n     obligations [under the Open Skies Treaty] to allow effective \n     observation of its entire territory, raising serious \n     compliance concerns''.\n       (3) According to the 2016 Compliance Report, Russian \n     conduct giving rise to compliance concerns has continued \n     since the Open Skies Treaty entered into force in 2002 and \n     worsened in 2010, 2014, and 2015.\n       (4) According to the 2016 Compliance Report, ongoing \n     efforts by the United States and other States Party to the \n     Open Skies Treaty to address these concerns through dialogue \n     with the Russian Federation ``have not resolved any of the \n     compliance concerns''.\n       (5) The Russian Federation has engaged in other activities \n     in coordination with, but outside the scope of, the Open \n     Skies Treaty overflights, which are a cause of concern and \n     should be addressed.\n       (6) It is a generally accepted principle of customary \n     international law that in the event of a material breach of a \n     multilateral treaty by one of its parties, a party specially \n     affected by that breach may invoke it as a ground for \n     suspending the operation of the treaty in whole or in part in \n     the relations between itself and the defaulting state.\n       (b) Statement of United States Policy.--It is the policy of \n     the United States that--\n       (1) restrictions upon the ability of Open Skies Treaty \n     aircraft to overfly all portions of the territory of a State \n     Party impede openness and transparency of military forces and \n     activities and undermine mutual understanding and confidence, \n     especially when coupled with an ongoing refusal to address \n     compliance concerns raised by other States Party subject to \n     such restrictions;\n       (2) it is essential to the accomplishment of the object and \n     purpose of the Open Skies Treaty that Open Skies Treaty \n     aircraft be able to overfly all portions of the territory of \n     a State Party in a timely and reciprocal manner;\n       (3) restrictions upon the ability of Open Skies Treaty \n     aircraft to overfly all portions of the territory of the \n     Russian Federation constitute a material breach of the Open \n     Skies Treaty;\n       (4) in light of the Russian Federation's material breach of \n     the Open Skies Treaty, the United States is legally entitled \n     to suspend the operation of the Open Skies Treaty in whole or \n     in part for so long as the Russian Federation continues to be \n     in material breach of the Open Skies Treaty;\n       (5) for so long as the Russian Federation remains in \n     noncompliance with the Open Skies Treaty, the United States \n     should--\n       (A) suspend certification or operation of new sensors for \n     Russian overflights of the United States pursuant to the Open \n     Skies Treaty;\n       (B) place restrictions upon Russian overflights of the \n     United States in response to Russian restrictions placed upon \n     United States overflights of the Russian Federation; and\n       (C) use appropriate additional measures to encourage the \n     Russian Federation's return to compliance with the Open Skies \n     Treaty; and\n       (6) during a period of Open Skies Treaty suspension or \n     curtailment, the Director of National Intelligence, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n     Defense, shall coordinate with parties to Open Skies Treaty \n     that are not the Russian Federation and Belarus, and fulfill \n     imagery requirements of those parties in a manner relative to \n     that provided by Open Skies Treaty collection.\n       (c) Report Required.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter \n     together with the Annual Arms Control and Verification \n     Compliance Report defined in subsection (e), the Secretary of \n     State, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense and \n     the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report that contains \n     the following elements:\n       (1) A description of all outstanding concerns regarding \n     compliance by the Russian Federation with its obligations \n     under the Open Skies Treaty.\n       (2) A description of all consistency, counterintelligence, \n     and other intelligence related issues that have arisen over \n     the previous year, including Russian Federation sensor or \n     equipment anomalies, intelligence actives carried out in \n     coordination with Open Skies Treaty overflights, and other \n     intelligence concerns as determined by the Director of \n     National Intelligence.\n       (3) A description of all compliance dialogue, diplomatic \n     engagement, or other interactions between the United States \n     and the Russian Federation with regard to concerns about \n     actual or potential Russian noncompliance with the Open Skies \n     Treaty, as well as any such dialogue, engagement, or \n     interactions between other Open Skies Treaty parties and the \n     Russian Federation with regard to concerns about Russian \n     actual or potential Russian noncompliance.\n       (4) A United States strategy for bringing the Russian \n     Federation into full compliance with its obligations under \n     the Open Skies Treaty, including--\n       (A) an assessment of the tools available to the United \n     States for purposes of enforcing compliance with the Open \n     Skies Treaty, including--\n       (i) bilateral or multilateral compliance dialogue;\n       (ii) the imposition of restrictions upon Russian \n     overflights pursuant to the Open Skies Treaty, either by the \n     United States or other States Party; and\n       (iii) the use of pressures or points of political, \n     economic, or military leverage separate from the Open Skies \n     Treaty.\n       (B) a description of how United States compliance dialogue \n     with the Russian Federation about the Open Skies Treaty \n     incorporates and integrates the tools described in \n     subparagraph (A); and\n       (C) an assessment of whether the Russian Federation is \n     expected to return to full compliance with the Open Skies \n     Treaty, and if so, when and under what conditions this is \n     most likely to occur.\n       (5) An assessment of the benefits the Russian Federation \n     receives from the conduct of Open Skies Treaty overflights \n     over European countries and the United States, including--\n       (A) The value of such information collection relative to \n     other sources of information available to the Russian \n     Federation; and\n       (B) A description of the types of United States and \n     European targets over which Russian overflights pursuant to \n     the Open Skies Treaty have flown, how this target set has \n     evolved over the course of the Russian Federation's Open \n     Skies overflights, and how this target set relates to current \n     Russian military doctrine and planning.\n       (6) An assessment of the intelligence value of Open Skies \n     information to States Party to the Open Skies Treaty, other \n     than the\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\n     United States or the Russian Federation, relative to other \n     sources of information available to such States Party, \n     including commercially-available satellite imagery.\n       (7) The impact of Russian noncompliance with the Open Skies \n     Treaty and other international agreements or commitments \n     relating to arms control, international security, or crisis \n     prevention or stability, including the INF Treaty, the \n     Incidents at Sea Agreement, and the Budapest Memorandum, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the CFE Treaty, upon \n     defense and security planning in and among States Party to \n     the Open Skies Treaty, including members of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n       (d) Form of Report.--The report required by subsection (c) \n     shall be submitted in an unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Annual arms control and verification compliance \n     report.--The term ``Annual Arms Control and Verification \n     Compliance Report'' means the annual Adherence to and \n     Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and \n     Disarmament Agreements and Commitments report required under \n     section 403 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 2593a).\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees defined.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, the Committee on Armed Services, and the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate;

IANA FUNCTIONS CONTRACT; UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT \n                   OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN DOMAINS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Department of Commerce and the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration (in this \n     section referred to as the ``NTIA'') should be responsible \n     for maintaining the continuity and stability of services \n     related to certain interdependent Internet technical \n     management functions, known collectively as the Internet \n     Assigned Numbers Authority (in this section referred to as \n     the ``IANA''), which includes--\n       (A) the coordination of the assignment of technical \n     Internet protocol parameters;\n       (B) the administration of certain responsibilities \n     associated with the Internet domain name system root zone \n     management;\n       (C) the allocation of Internet numbering resources; and\n       (D) other services related to the management of the \n     Advanced Research Project Agency and INT top-level domains.\n       (2) The interdependent technical functions described in \n     paragraph (1) were performed on behalf of the Federal \n     Government under a contract between the Defense Advanced \n     Research Projects Agency and the University of Southern \n     California as part of a research project known as the Tera-\n     node Network Technology project. As the Tera-node Network \n     Technology project neared completion and the contract neared \n     expiration in 1999, the Federal Government recognized the \n     need for the continued performance of the IANA functions as \n     vital to the stability and correct functioning of the \n     Internet.\n       (3) The NTIA may use its contract authority to maintain the \n     continuity and stability of services related to the IANA \n     functions.\n       (4) If the NTIA uses its contract authority, the \n     contractor, in the performance of its duties, must have or \n     develop a close constructive working relationship with all \n     interested and affected parties to ensure quality and \n     satisfactory performance of the IANA functions.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The terrorist organization that has referred to itself \n     as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and various other \n     names (in this subtitle referred to as ``ISIL'') poses a \n     grave threat to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq \n     and Syria, regional stability, and the national security \n     interests of the United States and its allies and partners.\n       (2) ISIL holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria and \n     has stated its intention to seize more territory and \n     demonstrated the capability to do so.\n       (3) ISIL leaders have stated that they intend to conduct \n     terrorist attacks internationally, including against the \n     United States, its citizens, and interests.\n       (4) ISIL has committed despicable acts of violence and mass \n     executions against Muslims, regardless of sect, who do not \n     subscribe to ISIL's depraved, violent, and oppressive \n     ideology.\n       (5) ISIL has threatened genocide and committed vicious acts \n     of violence against religious and ethnic minority groups, \n     including Iraqi Christian, Yezidi, and Turkmen populations.\n       (6) ISIL has targeted innocent women and girls with \n     horrific acts of violence, including\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\n     abduction, enslavement, torture, rape, and forced marriage.\n       (7) ISIL is responsible for the deaths of innocent United \n     States citizens, including James Foley, Steven Sotloff, \n     Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller.\n       (8) The United States is working with regional and global \n     allies and partners to degrade and defeat ISIL, to cut off \n     its funding, to stop the flow of foreign fighters to its \n     ranks, and to support local communities as they reject ISIL.\n       (9) The announcement of the anti-ISIL Coalition on \n     September 5, 2014, during the NATO Summit in Wales, stated \n     that ISIL poses a serious threat and should be countered by a \n     broad international coalition.\n       (10) The United States calls on its allies and partners, \n     particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, to join the \n     anti-ISIL Coalition and defeat this terrorist threat.\n       (11) President Barack Obama, United States military \n     leaders, and United States allies in the region have made \n     clear that it is more effective to use the unique \n     capabilities of the United States Government to support \n     regional partners instead of large-scale deployments of \n     United States ground forces in this mission.\n\n     SEC. 1282. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED \n                   FORCES.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the \n     Armed Forces of the United States as the President determines \n     necessary and appropriate against ISIL or associated persons \n     or forces as defined in section 1285.\n       (b) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. \n     1547(a)(1)), Congress declares that this section is intended \n     to constitute specific statutory authorization within the \n     meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution (50 \n     U.S.C. 1544(b)).\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     subtitle supersedes any requirements of the War Powers \n     Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this authorization is to \n     protect the lives of United States citizens and to provide \n     military support to regional partners in their battle to \n     defeat ISIL. The use of significant United States ground \n     troops in combat against ISIL, except to protect the lives of \n     United States citizens from imminent threat, is not \n     consistent with such purpose.\n\n     SEC. 1283. DURATION OF AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       The authorization for the use of military force under this \n     subtitle shall terminate three years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, unless reauthorized.\n\n     SEC. 1284.

REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE \n                   AGAINST IRAQ.\n\n       The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq \n     Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 116 Stat. 1498; 50 \n     U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby repealed.\n\n     SEC. 1287. SOLE STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR MILITARY ACTION \n                   AGAINST ISIL.\n\n       This authorization shall constitute the sole statutory \n     authority for United States military action against the \n     Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and associated persons \n     or forces, and supersedes any prior authorization for the use \n     of military force involving action against ISIL.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4497.

The motion \n     is highly privileged in the House of Representatives. The \n     motion is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to \n     postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n     motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If \n     a motion to proceed to the consideration of the qualifying \n     legislation is agreed to, the qualifying legislation shall \n     remain the unfinished business of the House until disposed \n     of.\n       (2) Consideration in the senate.--\n       (A) Committee referral.--Qualifying legislation described \n     in paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) of subsection (c) that is \n     introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations.\n       (B) Reporting and discharge.--If the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations has not reported such qualifying legislation within \n     10 days upon which the Senate is in session after such \n     referral, that committee shall be discharged from further \n     consideration thereof and such legislation shall be placed on \n     the appropriate calendar.\n       (C) Floor consideration.--When the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations has reported, or has been discharged (under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection) from further consideration \n     of, qualifying legislation described in paragraph (1) or \n     paragraph (3) of subsection (c), or when the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations has reported qualifying legislation \n     described in subsection (c)(2), it is at any time thereafter \n     in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect \n     has been disagreed to) for any Senator, notwithstanding Rule \n     XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, to move to proceed \n     to the consideration of the qualifying legislation, and all \n     points of order against the motion to proceed are waived. The \n     motion is not subject to a motion to postpone, or to a motion \n     to proceed to the consideration of other business. The motion \n     is not debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote by which \n     the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in \n     order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n     qualifying legislation is agreed to, the qualifying \n     legislation shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     Senate until disposed of.\n       (3) Rules of house of representatives and senate.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, \n     but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be \n     followed in that House in the case of legislation described \n     in those sections, and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n       (g) Reports to Congress.--\n       (1) Strategy.--Not later than September 20, 2017, the \n     President shall submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees and leadership a written report setting forth a \n     comprehensive strategy of the United States, encompassing \n     military, economic, humanitarian, and diplomatic efforts, to \n     protect Americans from al Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic \n     State of Iraq and the Levant (wISIL), and transnational \n     terrorist organizations that the President has determined \n     threaten the national security of United States and to \n     support international partners in their fight to defeat such \n     organizations.\n       (2) Implementation of strategy.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than September 20, 2017, and \n     every 180 days thereafter, the President shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees and leadership a \n     description and assessment of the implementation of the \n     strategy set forth in the report required by paragraph (1), \n     including a description of any substantive change to the \n     comprehensive strategy, including the reason for the change \n     and the change's effect on the rest of the comprehensive \n     strategy.\n       (B) Required elements of the report.--The report required \n     under subparagraph (A) shall include the specific military \n     actions taken to address the threat posed by transnational \n     terrorist organizations and associated persons or forces, \n     including--\n       (i) the persons and forces targeted by such actions;\n       (ii) the nature and location of such actions;\n       (iii) an evaluation of the effectiveness of such actions; \n     and\n       (iv) a description of and justification for the specific \n     authorities relied upon for such actions.\n       (3) Report on actions in foreign countries.--Not later than \n     30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees and leadership a report detailing all foreign \n     countries in which the United States government is \n     conducting, or is preparing to conduct, specific actions \n     described in paragraph (2)(B), and shall update this report \n     no less than 48 hours before such actions take place in a new \n     country, unless exigent circumstances exist.\n       (4) Covered persons and forces.--Not later than 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President \n     shall submit to Congress a list of the organizations, \n     persons, or forces against which the United States is \n     conducting military operations pursuant to the 2001 \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40, \n     155 Stat. 224) or the Authorization for Use of Military Force \n     Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 116 \n     Stat. 1498; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), or Article II of the \n     Constitution of the United States, respectively, along with a \n     justification for the inclusion of such organizations, \n     persons, or forces, and classified information relating \n     thereto.

FINDINGS; AGENCY DEFINED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal Government data is a valuable national \n     resource. Managing Federal Government data to make it open, \n     available, discoverable, and useable to the general public, \n     businesses, journalists, academics, and advocates promotes \n     efficiency and effectiveness in Government, creates economic \n     opportunities, promotes scientific discovery, and most \n     importantly, strengthens our democracy.\n       (2) Maximizing the usefulness of Federal Government data \n     that is appropriate for release rests upon making it readily \n     available, discoverable, and usable--in a word: open. \n     Information presumptively should be available to the general \n     public unless the Federal Government reasonably foresees that \n     disclosure could harm a specific, articulable interest \n     protected by law or the Federal Government is otherwise \n     expressly prohibited from releasing such data due to \n     statutory requirements.\n       (3) The Federal Government has the responsibility to be \n     transparent and accountable to its citizens.\n       (4) Data controlled, collected, or created by the Federal \n     Government should be originated, transmitted, and published \n     in modern, open, and electronic format, to be as readily \n     accessible as possible, consistent with data standards imbued \n     with authority under this subtitle and to the extent \n     permitted by law.\n       (5) The effort to inventory Government data will have \n     additional benefits, including identifying opportunities \n     within agencies to reduce waste, increase efficiencies, and \n     save taxpayer dollars. As such, this effort should involve \n     many types of data, including data generated by applications, \n     devices, networks, and equipment, which can be harnessed to \n     improve operations, lower energy consumption, reduce costs, \n     and strengthen security.\n       (6) Communication, commerce, and data transcend national \n     borders. Global access to Government information is often \n     essential to promoting innovation, scientific discovery, \n     entrepreneurship, education, and the general welfare.\n       (b) Agency Defined.--In this subtitle, the term ``agency'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 3502 of title 44, \n     United States Code, and includes the Federal Election \n     Commission.\n\n     SEC. 1099. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this subtitle, or the amendments made by this \n     subtitle, shall be construed to require the disclosure of \n     information or records that are exempt from public disclosure \n     under section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \n     known as the ``Freedom of Information Act'').\n\n     SEC. 1099A.
