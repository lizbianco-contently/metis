Mr. President, ``there is no such thing as a \nRepublican road or a Democrat road.'' That is what Chairman Inhofe said \na few days ago, and he is absolutely right. No wonder Republicans and \nDemocrats continue to rally around a bipartisan, multiyear highway \nmeasure that is fiscally responsible and will not raise taxes.\n  The bill before us would streamline regulations, advance research and \ninnovation in transportation, modernize infrastructure and \ntransportation systems, and inject new accountability measures so \nAmericans can get a better handle on how their tax money is actually \nbeing spent.\n  This multiyear bill also reverses the trend of short-term temporary \npatches, giving State and local Governments the certainty and the \nstability they need to better plan road and bridge projects. On top of \nthat, the bill would also provide State and local Governments with more \nflexible options for stretching those transportation dollars.\n  So this is a good bill for our country. Substantial numbers of \nRepublicans and Democrats continue to support it. But time is running \nout to get this bill through Congress. We are up against a deadline at \nthe end of the week. Jobs are on the line. Important infrastructure \nprojects are too. So we have to get the job done--and we are.\n  We have had to navigate some especially difficult political terrain \nto get this far already. It hasn't always been easy, but we are now \nnearing completion of the Senate's work on this bill.\n  If the bipartisan coalition supporting this fiscally responsible, \nmultiyear bill continues to cooperate and work hard, I know we can get \nthere.\n  I want to thank every colleague who has worked so hard already on \nthis bill, particularly Chairman Inhofe and Senator Boxer, who have \nreally done magnificent work to get us to this point. Let's hope we can \nall get it across the finish line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5893-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n        25th Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are no ideas more central to \nAmerica's democracy and identity than liberty\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\nand equality. The Declaration of Independence lists liberty among \nmankind's inalienable rights and states: ``All men are created equal.'' \nBut it wasn't until 1870 that the 15th Amendment to the Constitution \nwas ratified, extending the vote to African-American men, and women \nwere not given the right to vote in America until 1920, when the 19th \nAmendment was ratified.\n  America's democracy has indeed been imperfect, but throughout our \nhistory, we have sought to address our imperfections. After all, the \nstory of America is not the story of a perfect nation. It is the story \nof a nation in pursuit of a more perfect nation.\n  So it is sobering but not surprising that it took us nearly to the \nend of the 20th century to expand and acknowledge the rights of another \ngroup of Americans who suffered discrimination through history--people \nwith disabilities.\n  This Sunday we mark the 25th anniversary of one of the most important \ncivil rights victories in our nation's history--the enactment of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act \nset forth four great goals for people with disabilities: equal \nopportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency. But the fundamental goal of the ADA is simple. In the \nwords of one activist, the ADA is about securing for people with \ndisabilities the most fundamental of rights: ``the right to live in the \nworld.''\n  It is worth remembering that this was a bipartisan victory. Senator \nBob Dole, a Republican and a veteran wounded by German machine gun fire \nin World War II, and Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, teamed up to get \nthis done.\n  When President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law, he said: \n``Today's legislation brings us closer to that day when no Americans \nwill ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness.''\n  Tom Harkin called the day the ADA passed the proudest day of his \nlegislative career. I remember a story he told the Senate a few years \nago. When he was first elected to the Senate, his whole family came for \nthe swearing-in ceremony. They sat up in the gallery right behind me. \nHe even arranged a sign language interpreter for his older brother \nFrank, who was deaf. But he was told by the guard outside of the \ngallery door that the interpreter was not allowed to stand in the \ngallery and interpret.\n  Tom Harkin could not believe it. He came down to the floor and told \nthe majority leader, Bob Dole, the situation. Senator Dole said: ``I \nwill take care of it.'' And he did. It was the first thing they did \ntogether. It sure wasn't the last. Five years later they watched \nPresident Bush sign the ADA into law.\n  I want to give credit to some tireless advocates who helped make that \na reality: Justin Dart, the ``Father of the ADA,'' who has passed on, \nand my great friend from Chicago, Marca Bristo, President and CEO of \nAccess Living.\n  In 1977, Marca had a serious accident and broke her neck, leaving her \nparalyzed from the chest down. She lost her job, her house, and her \nhealth insurance. A lot of people would have given up--but not Marca \nBristo. She led an army of people who could not see, hear, walk, and \ntalk to mobilize and pass the most comprehensive civil rights law since \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  Marca is a force of nature. Every day, Marca and her team are on the \nfrontlines helping people with disabilities. They help people such as \nMichael Grice. He uses a power wheelchair and has been involved with \ndisability activism for many years. He has a bright personality that \ndraws many people to him.\n  He speaks with passion and compassion. He calls himself a very active \nperson. He was living on his own in an apartment in Hyde Park on the \nSouth Side of Chicago until health complications led him into a group \nhome, where he lived for more than a year. His health continued to \ndeteriorate, and he moved into a nursing home.\n  Michael and the group home staff planned for him to stay at the \nnursing home for 6 to 8 weeks and then move back on his own. Those 6 to \n8 weeks became nearly 3 years. Michael grew more frustrated. That is \nwhen Marca Bristo and Access Living came to the rescue, and they helped \nMichael find a new place so he could live on his own. Last year Michael \nwas able to move from the nursing home into his own apartment.\n  I am proud of activists such as Michael and Marca and the folks at \nAccess Living. We owe them a debt of gratitude for helping America \nrealize our full potential.\n  It is hard to imagine, but before the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, people with disabilities were denied the opportunity to \nparticipate fully in society. Back then, very few transit systems had \nbuses or trains equipped for wheelchairs. If you needed a haircut or to \nsee a doctor or just wanted to meet a friend for a cup of coffee, you \nprobably had to rely on family and friends or a social service agency.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act has changed that. The Americans \nwith Disabilities Act has changed America. Every day you can see how \nfar we have come as you walk down the street--with curb cuts, ramps, \nbraille signs, and assisted listening devices. Because of the ADA, \nthousands of Americans with disabilities get to go to school, get a \ngood education, and enter the workforce.\n  We still have a long way to go. The unemployment rate for people with \ndisabilities is still too high. Most people with disabilities want to \nwork and have to work. When they do work, that can impact our \ncommunities in ways that are hard to imagine.\n  Let me tell you about the late Bob Greenberg, a legendary \nsportscaster at WBEZ radio in Chicago. For his loyal Chicago radio \naudience, Bob described sporting events that they couldn't see. But \nBob's story is unique because Bob couldn't see them either. Bob \nGreenberg was blind. But that didn't stop him from achieving his \ndreams.\n  In the early 1980s, Hall of Fame basketball player Kareem Abdul-\nJabbar was taking questions from reporters after a hard game. He turned \nto Bob, who was holding a white cane and a microphone and he said: How \ndid you get here?\n  It wasn't hard, Bob said. He then explained how he knew the exact \nnumber of steps from his home to the Lake Street ``L,'' how he felt for \nthe right combination of coins to put in the turnstile, and then how he \nknew the exact number of steps to take along West Madison to Chicago \nStadium.\n  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar paused to take that in and finally said: Ask your \nquestion, sir.\n  It was clear. Bob Greenberg worked hard to get where he was.\n  There is no doubt that laws such as the ADA helped Bob. I just wish \nwe had passed it sooner. Maybe Bob's road to achieving his dream could \nhave been a little smoother.\n  Let me close by noting this. I wonder if the Americans with \nDisabilities Act were called before the Senate today, if it would pass. \nWe know how great it is. We know what it has done for America. But \nthere were also always voices then--and there are voices now--that \nquestion whether Government ought to have that big a say, that big a \nrole, that big a voice in our private lives and our public lives. Thank \ngoodness Bob Dole, a Republican, and Tom Harkin, a Democrat, put \ntogether a coalition that realized that at some moments in history we \nhave to move together as an American family to solve a problem. We use \nour Government to achieve that goal.\n  The day the ADA passed, Senator Harkin stood at this podium in the \nChamber and gave his entire speech in sign language. Afterward, he said \nit was the first time anyone ever gave a long-winded speech on the \nSenate floor and no one ever heard him. He was wrong. His brother Frank \nheard him. Marca Bristo heard him, Michael Grice heard him, Bob \nGreenberg heard him, and millions of others with disabilities heard \nthat speech.\n  Before leaving the Senate, Senator Harkin taught me a wonderful sign \nfor the word ``America.'' It is this: All ten fingers joined together, \nrotating in a circle around your chest. That is sign language for \n``America.'' That is the America that we all are striving to become, a \nplace where no one is left out, where we are all included within the \ncircle of equal opportunity. That is how we honor our Constitution and \nour great Nation--with liberty and justice for all.\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\n                     Syrian Safe Zone Announcement\n\n  Mr. President, I recently spoke on the floor about the terrible \nhumanitarian crisis in Syria. If you had to pick out one place in the \nworld today where more innocent people are dying, it is hard to think \nof any place that matches Syria. Over 200,000 people have died during \nthe course of the Syrian war, and up to 12 million Syrians have been \ndisplaced.\n  I have a friend of mine in Chicago, he is a Syrian American doctor, \nDr. Sahloul, who comes to see me regularly and brings photos back from \nSyria. They are heartbreaking photos.\n  Dr. Sahloul and his friends literally sneak across the border into \nSyria to treat the casualties in this war. He shows me pictures of \nsurgeries performed on the floors of schools and on card tables, and he \nshows me those who have been maimed and killed by the barrel bombs of \nBashar Assad and by the ravages of war.\n  We will be judged as a generation as to whether we have responded \nproperly to this humanitarian challenge.\n  In April, Senators Kaine, Graham, and McCain joined me on a letter to \nPresident Obama urging him to work with other world leaders to create \nno-fly zones within Syria where modern medical treatment can be \nprovided and displaced persons can safely escape.\n  I have raised this with many involved in this extremely difficult \nissue, including Gen. John Allen, Retired, U.N. Special Envoy for Syria \nStaffan de Mistura, the Turkish Ambassador, and National Security \nAdvisor Susan Rice.\n  So, I was heartened today--in fact, exhilarated--to read in the \nmorning paper that the United States is now working with Turkey and \nother countries to establish a humanitarian safe zone in the northern \npart of Syria to try to find one patch of real estate in that war-\nravaged country where these children, their mothers, families, elderly \npeople, and those who have been hurt can go and safely--safely--be \ntreated and live.\n  We have to do this. The Turks are going to lead the way. We are going \nto support them, but it is a challenge not just to our two countries--\nto us and to Turkey--but to the world to step up and put an end to this \nbloody, terrible, ruthless war.\n  There have been so many casualties. The United States--our good \npeople who reach out to help those around the world--should stand and \nbe counted when it comes to the establishment of this humanitarian zone \nto try to bring some peace to some part of the population living in \nwar-torn Syria.\n  This won't solve the larger crisis right away, which ultimately will \nrequire a political transition in Syria. Without a political dialogue, \nthere is no long-term hope for Syria, only short-term relief.\n  But this announcement does have the possibility to bring the Syrian \ncivil war one step closer to an end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I once again come to the floor to talk \nabout a Feinstein-Wicker amendment to this Transportation bill, which I \nhope we can have a vote on and dispose of and let the U.S. Senate work \nits will on, either late tonight or perhaps tomorrow after the pending \nbusiness is taken care of.\n  I would begin by quoting from an editorial that was in yesterday's \nPost-Gazette, the daily newspaper in Pittsburgh, where it says: ``The \ntractor-trailer roaring by you on the highway could be 9 feet longer \nnext year.'' It could be this long, as shown on this chart I have in \nthe Chamber. It could be mandated by this Congress on 39 States that do \nnot want it.\n  The editorial goes on to point out there is legislation pending that \nwould force these longer trucks on these 39 States--on all 50 States--\n11 of them already allow it, but 39 do not. Unless we act and adopt the \nFeinstein-Wicker amendment on this bill, a provision in the \nTransportation appropriations bill will go forward and is likely to be \nsigned into law requiring this. This will have been done, I might add, \nwithout a full debate, without a hearing being held in any committee of \nthe Senate on this issue.\n  So what are we talking about? I have in the Chamber a poster that \nsays: ``Would You Feel Safe Driving Next to a Double 33?'' As shown \nhere, this is the size of the proposed new longer trucks that we would \nmandate on all 50 States. As you can see on the chart, here is the size \nof a typical passenger car. Here is the comparative size of a \nmotorcycle, a bicycle, and, of course, here is a defenseless \npedestrian. Compared to the pedestrian down to the passenger car, this \nFederal mandate that I am trying to at least give a timeout to would \nmandate on States that they allow these twin 33 trailers, and they \nwould be driving along next to this car that my kids are going to be \ndriving in and my grandchildren are going to be riding in. I do not \nthink it is a good idea.\n  But I would point out, if a State does think it is a good idea, I am \nnot going to stand in their way. Some 11 States have decided they are \nwilling to take this risk--many of them out in the wide-open spaces of \nthe West. But it is worth saying that these 39 States do not allow \nlonger tandem trucks, and we should ask ourselves whether Congress \nknows better than these States.\n  These States do not allow them: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, and \nIllinois. As a matter of fact, we have a unanimous resolution from the \nIllinois State Senate, a bipartisan, unanimous resolution from the \nIllinois State Senate, saying: Do not mandate these double 33s on us. I \ngo on: Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, \nMinnesota, my home State of Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North \nDakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West \nVirginia, and Wisconsin, Mr. President. None of those States allows \ntwin 33s now, but there is a proposal I am trying to stop that would \nmandate that these States must allow for the longer and, I believe, \nmore dangerous trucks.\n  The editorial goes on to quote the former head of the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, who ``likens the massive trucks \nto `trains on highways' that would damage roads and endanger \nmotorists.'' I think it makes a lot of sense. I think it would damage \nroads. I think it would endanger motorists.\n  Now, if my State of Mississippi, with the considered judgment of the \nMississippi Department of Transportation and their commission, the \nMississippi Sheriffs' Association, the Mississippi Association of \nChiefs of Police--if all of those people are advising us against this, \nwhy should we as a Congress tell these States that we know better than \nthey do?\n  I will just quote one final statement from the editorial before I ask \nit be printed in the Record. The editorial concludes: ``With its \nbridges already in the worst shape in the nation, Pennsylvania doesn't \nneed longer trucks on its roads.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 26, 2015]\n\n Bigger's Not Better: Longer Tractor-Trailers Spell Trouble on the Road\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       The tractor-trailer roaring by you on the highway could be \n     9 feet longer next year if Congress approves a measure backed \n     by FedEx and other shippers, who want bigger trucks so they \n     can haul more stuff. It's a bad idea everywhere in the \n     nation, but particularly in Pennsylvania with its poorly \n     maintained roads and bridges.\n       The legislation would force states to allow ``twin 33s''--\n     trucks that pull two trailers, each 33 feet long. Only 11 \n     states allow them now, and Pennsylvania is not among them. \n     Double trailers here cannot be more than 28 feet, 6 inches, \n     and single trailers can be no more than 53 feet long.\n       Supporters say the change would eliminate 6 million trips \n     each year, improve the environment and cut down on crashes. \n     But anyone who has ever held his breath as a massive truck \n     comes within inches of his car while making a turn would be \n     hard to convince that bigger is better.\n       The former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration likens massive trucks to ``trains on \n     highways'' that would damage roads and endanger motorists. \n     Trucks weigh 20 to 30 times more than cars, and they take \n     longer than cars to come to a stop, particularly on wet and \n     slippery roads. A U.S. Department of Transportation study \n     found that the twin 33s require 22 more feet\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\n     for braking than the current trucks on the road. In 2013, \n     3,964 people died in crashes involving large trucks.\n       Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat who is crusading \n     against the change, says longer trucks would cause more than \n     $2 billion in damage to the nation's roads and bridges. With \n     it bridges already in the worst shape in the nation, \n     Pennsylvania doesn't need longer trucks on its roads.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Once again, I stress the point, this is Pennsylvania \nspecific. Pennsylvania has made a considered decision not to allow \nthese. I think it ill-behooves us as a Congress to say we know better \nabout the roads and the condition of the bridges in the State of \nPennsylvania than the local authorities do.\n  So in the interest of deferring to the States, I think we should \nadopt the Feinstein-Wicker amendment not to mandate these longer trucks \non States that do not want them.\n  Also, I do want to stress a few things. If this goes forward, it will \nhave been done with no hearings in this Congress in any committee. The \nAppropriations Committee, which voted on this, did not have a hearing. \nThe transportation committee, which I serve on, did not have a hearing. \nThe commerce committee, which is another committee of jurisdiction on \nthis matter, never had a hearing about this. Wouldn't it be a good \nidea--before we tell States they have to do this--to get proponents of \nthis Federal mandate before us to answer questions about it--perhaps \nopponents of this Federal mandate to come and give us their considered \nopinion, experts about the safety issues, experts about what this will \ndo to bridges, about what it will do to tear up our highways. Wouldn't \nthat be a good idea before we decide in our wisdom inside the beltway \nin Washington, DC, that we know better than 39 States? I think it would \nbe a good idea.\n  We might want to hear from AAA. We might want to hear from officials \nof the State of Missouri who have memorialized this Congress not to \nmandate this on the very people whom they are trying to represent on a \nState-by-State basis. I would like to get the Mississippi Trucking \nAssociation here. They have come out against this Federal mandate. They \nare in favor of the Feinstein-Wicker amendment to continue to leave \nthis up to the States. I would like to get them before a hearing and \nhear them out. Perhaps Members of Congress and members of the various \ncommittees could be convinced, as I have become convinced, that they \nare correct.\n  Why would any trucker be opposed to this? I will simply tell you, a \nlot of truckers are small businesspeople. We honor small business \npeople. We know they are the engine of job creation in the United \nStates of America. Many of the small truckers have told me--and they \nmake up organizations like the Mississippi Trucking Association--they \ncannot compete in an environment in which this becomes the norm. The \nbig guys can easily move to the tandem 33 trailers, but the small \nbusiness people cannot. It is much harder for them to get a loan. It is \nmuch harder for them to come up with the capital expenditure of moving \nto this, and many of them feel as though they will be put out of \nbusiness.\n  So I think we should be very careful about saying we are going to run \nover the considered opinion of people in 39 States, we are going to \ndisregard the Mississippi Association of Chiefs of Police and a host of \nother State chiefs of police associations, we are going to disregard \nthe Mississippi Sheriffs' Association and a laundry list of other \nsheriffs associations from all around the United States of America.\n  I think the better approach is the Feinstein approach, which lost on \na tie vote in the Appropriations Committee. The Feinstein approach \nsays: Let's make sure we have a full and comprehensive study about this \nand get back to us, and if we implement it, let's do it in the normal \ncourse of events with the rulemaking process and comments from all \nsides.\n  So all this Feinstein-Wicker amendment does is say we cannot mandate \nthis this year. Instead, we are going to ask the leading experts in \nthis city to come back to us and tell us if, in their opinion, this is \nsafe, to tell us, in their opinion, what this will do to bridges and \ninfrastructure. I think that is the better approach.\n  There were 30 members of the Appropriations Committee who voted on \nthis issue--exactly 30. Let me make sure I am precise. The Feinstein \namendment lost on a vote of 15 to 15. Now, should that go forward as \nthe policy of this U.S. Senate? I do not think so. I think we owe it to \nthe American people, on an issue that involves safety, on an issue that \ninvolves infrastructure, and on an issue that involves deferring to the \nStates to make the best decisions for their people--I think we owe it \nto them to have a full vote and not let something go forward on a \nvirtual tie vote.\n  The provision that is now in the appropriations bill was adopted 16 \nto 14 in the Appropriations Committee with no hearings. I simply ask my \ncolleagues, is that the way to make a major safety decision, an \ninfrastructure decision for the American people?\n  So we are nearing the time when supporters of the Feinstein-Wicker \namendment are hoping for a vote. I was heartened to hear the \nconversation of the majority leader yesterday that he certainly hoped \nwe would be able to have votes on germane amendments like this. I \nappreciate the efforts of the ranking member of the committee, a friend \nof mine from California, in saying she is going to do whatever she can \nto get us a vote on this. So I do appreciate it.\n  I would say to Members listening today, it is time to get informed on \nthis issue. It is time to find out what the facts are, to realize this \nappropriations decision that I am trying to reverse and put the brakes \non, to a certain extent, is not permissive in nature. It is a \nrequirement. If it goes through, we will be telling 39 States they are \nwrong, somehow we are right here in Washington, DC.\n  So I hope, first of all, we can get an amendment on the floor, and I \nhope Members will search their consciences and decide that indeed this \nis something which at least ought to be thoroughly studied. We ought to \nhave all of the facts. More than that, this is something where we don't \nneed to run over the 39 States that happen to feel otherwise.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the presentation by my \nfriend. He is absolutely right and my colleague Senator Feinstein is \nabsolutely right on this point.\n  I think the American truckers are saying, I say to my friend from \nMississippi, that this is a modest extension, a 5-feet extension, but \nit is 5 times 2, as my staff pointed out, so this is a 10-foot \nextension. And many of our States are already in trouble. Many of our \nbridges are structurally obsolete. So the American truckers are pushing \nhard for this. But I think my friend is right. I think States ought to \nbe able to decide the condition of their roads, the condition of their \nbridges, and if they feel this type of increase is going to jeopardize \nsafety, I don't think Uncle Sam ought to be telling them what to do.\n  Mr. WICKER. If my friend will yield briefly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. WICKER. I know she wants to talk about the larger issue. If it \nis, in fact, a modest and relatively harmless extension of the size, \nthen I think perhaps States might want to make that decision \nthemselves. They may very well conclude--39 have not made that \ndecision, but 11 States have made that decision. And even though some \nmay consider this a modest extension, I think modesty and the length of \nthe trucks and the safety thereof is really in the eye of the beholder, \nand the State of Mississippi might feel very different than one of the \nwide-open Western States.\n  I thank my friend for her comments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend, and I agree with him. If each of us \nhad written the bill that is before us, it wouldn't look the way it \nlooks. Clearly, if my friend had written it, this wouldn't be in there. \nIf I had written it, this wouldn't be in there and a lot of other \nthings would.\n  I am so happy Chairman Inhofe has arrived. I am the ranking member on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. Our title is responsible \nfor 70 percent of the spending in this legislation. We knew that \neveryone had a wish list. We knew that if one Senator got everything he \nor she wanted, we\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nwouldn't have a bill, and if I got everything I wanted, we wouldn't \nhave a bill. We had to meet in the middle, and we had to withhold on \nsome of the items on our wish list. Frankly, I think that is the story \nof legislating a huge and important bill such as this, and it is an \nimportant bill.\n  Before I came over here, I say to my friend Senator Inhofe, I read \nthat the whip over in the House, who comes from California, said: The \nSenate should not send the bill over to the House.\n  My response to that is, if we have a bill, we are sending it.\n  He said: We are leaving, and that is it.\n  If the House chooses to go out on vacation, a work period, or \nwhatever they do, that is their business, but it is our job to fix the \nproblems we are facing.\n  With the help of my friend Chairman Inhofe, I have a couple of \npictures to show everyone.\n  The first picture is my photograph of the bridge collapse on \nInterstate 10 at the Arizona-California border. Years ago they said \nthis bridge was functionally obsolete. In other words, when it was \nbuilt, nobody thought so much traffic would be traveling on it. Later \nthey gave it an A, but it was determined to be obsolete.\n  The reason bridges like this aren't getting fixed is we just haven't \nhad enough funds to do it. In this bill, it is true--we stayed away \nfrom a tax gas increase, and we found a way to get enough for what I \nconsider to be a very solid funding bill.\n  I will show everyone some other bridges that have collapsed, and \nthere are so many. Here is Washington State. The Skagit River Bridge \ncollapsed. Look at this. It is unbelievable. There are cars down below \nthat have crashed. This is pathetic. This isn't a third-world Nation; \nthis is America, and a Washington State bridge collapsed. How are we \ngoing to get the money for it? We need to pass a long-term bill.\n  If we pass a 5-month bill the way some of our opponents are calling \nfor here and in the House, we won't have a dime to fix any bridge. All \nwe are doing is, at the bare minimum, extending the program. Nobody is \ngoing to undertake any type of long-term fix on these bridges.\n  This is the Arlington Memorial Bridge. It was built in 1932. We know \nabout it; it is right here. It is deteriorating. It is in trouble. We \nare trying to avoid a collapse. We need this bill to do that.\n  So when I talk about this bill--these bridges are in trouble.\n  Here is a picture of another bridge that actually did collapse. This \nis in Minnesota. This started the whole thing, and it was in 2007. It \nwas unbelievable what happened there, and we can see the devastation. \nThis is why Senator Inhofe is doing this. It is the reason I am doing \nthis. It is the reason Senator McConnell is doing this. It is the \nreason Dick Durbin is doing this. It is the reason so many of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing to admit that while \nthis isn't a perfect bill, we cannot sustain this. Either bridges are \ncrumbling or they are collapsing.\n  There are other examples. I will keep up the California bridge \ncollapse so everybody can see it. It is the one I know the best because \nit is in my State. As I have said, and I ask rhetorically, how much \nbusiness are we losing when we have cars and cargo having to go 400 \nmiles out of the way to get from California to Arizona or Arizona to \nCalifornia? This is a nightmare.\n  As I understand it, we found some emergency funds, and so now we need \nto try to figure this out. Should we close part of it down or keep part \nof it open? It is not that safe to do, and there is no reason why we \nshould have a situation such as this.\n  It may surprise everyone to hear how many bridges are deficient and \nin need of repair. In Kentucky, the Brent Spence Bridge; in Louisiana, \nthe Calcasieu River Bridge; in Maine, the Piscataqua River Bridge; in \nMaryland, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge; in Massachusetts, the I-95 Bridge \nin Middlesex; in Michigan, the I-75 Rouge River Bridge; in Minnesota, \nthe I-35 East Bridge over Pennsylvania Avenue; in Mississippi, the \nVicksburg Bridge; in Missouri, the I-270 East Bridge over Conway Road; \nin Nevada, the Virginia Street Bridge in Reno; in New Hampshire, the I-\n293 Bridge in Hillsborough.\n  When I am done reading this, I will have the whole list printed in \nthe Record.\n  In New Jersey, the Garden State Parkway in Union County; in New \nMexico, the Main Street Bridge; in New York, the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  These are iconic structures, and they need to be fixed. They are \ndeficient.\n  In North Carolina, the Greensboro Bridge; in Ohio, the John Roebling \nSuspension Bridge; in Oklahoma, the I-40 Bridge over Crooked Oak Creek; \nin Oregon, the Columbia River Crossing; in Pennsylvania, the Benjamin \nFranklin Bridge.\n  Do you think we ought to fix the Benjamin Franklin Bridge?\n  In Rhode Island, the I-95 Viaduct in Providence; in South Carolina, \nthe I-85 Bridge in Greenville; in Texas, the I-45 Bridge; in Utah, the \nI-15 Bridge; in Washington, the Evergreen Point River Bridge; in \nWisconsin, the US-41 Bridge; Alabama; Arizona; Arkansas; and \nCalifornia.\n  The Golden Gate Bridge is the hallmark and one of the landmarks of my \nState, and it is deficient and in need of repair.\n  Colorado; Connecticut; the District of Columbia. I showed everybody \nthe Memorial Bridge. Florida; Georgia; Hawaii, the Halona Street Bridge \nin Honolulu County; Illinois, the Poplar Street Bridge; Indiana, the I-\n65 Bridge over the CSX Railroad; in Iowa, the Centennial Bridge.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of deficient \nbridges in need of repair be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n     State Examples of Deficient Highway Bridges in Need of Repair\n\n       Alabama--I-65 Bridge over US-11 in Jefferson County\n       Arizona--I-17 Bridge over 19th Avenue in Maricopa County\n       Arkansas--I-30 Bridge over the UP Railroad in Pulaski \n     County\n       California--Golden Gate Bridge\n       Colorado--I-70 Bridge in Denver\n       Connecticut--West River Bridge in New Haven\n       District of Columbia--Memorial Bridge\n       Florida--Pensacola Bay Bridge\n       Georgia--I-285 Bridge in Fulton County\n       Hawaii--Halona Street Bridge in Honolulu County\n       Illinois--Poplar Street Bridge connecting with St. Louis, \n     MO\n       Indiana--I-65 Bridge over the CSX railroad\n       Iowa--Centennial Bridge\n       Kentucky--Brent Spence Bridge\n       Louisiana--Calcasieu River Bridge\n       Maine--Piscataqua River Bridge\n       Maryland--Chesapeake Bay Bridge\n       Massachusetts--I-95 Bridge in Middlesex\n       Michigan--I-75 Rouge River Bridge\n       Minnesota--I-35 E Bridge over Pennsylvania Avenue\n       Mississippi--Vicksburg Bridge\n       Missouri--I-270 E Bridge over Conway Road\n       Nevada--Virginia Street Bridge in Reno\n       New Hampshire--I-293 Bridge in Hillsborough\n       New Jersey--Garden State Parkway in Union County\n       New Mexico--Main Street Bridge\n       New York--Brooklyn Bridge\n       North Carolina--Greensboro Bridge\n       Ohio--John Roebling Suspension Bridge\n       Oklahoma--I-40 Bridge over Crooked Oak Creek\n       Oregon--Columbia River Crossing\n       Pennsylvania--Benjamin Franklin Bridge\n       Rhode Island--I-95 Viaduct in Providence\n       South Carolina--I-85 Bridge in Greenville\n       Texas--I-45 Bridge over White Oak Bayou\n       Utah--I-15 Bridge over SR 93 in Davis County\n       Washington--Evergreen Point Floating Bridge\n       Wisconsin--US-41 Bridge over the Menomonee River\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if ever there were a bipartisan issue, it \nis this one. When Republican President Dwight Eisenhower was running \nfor office, he was shocked at the condition of our roads and the fact \nthat we really didn't have roads that were in good shape connecting one \nState to the next.\n  This is the United States of America. We are a large and sprawling \nnation. He said that ``a network of modern roads is as necessary to \ndefense as it is to our national economy and our personal safety.'' \nThis is Dwight Eisenhower. ``A network of modern roads is as necessary \nto defense as it is to our national economy and our personal safety.'' \nHe was referring to the fact that we really couldn't move easily \nbetween the States if there was some type of national emergency.\n  I was a little girl when Eisenhower ran, and my father was a lifelong \nDemocrat, but he was for Ike. One of the\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nreasons he was for Ike was because he knew we needed this kind of \nnetwork. It appealed to him. He knew how important it was.\n  If we look at the groups that are supporting us in this effort, I \nwill just say they represent America. They are everyone from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors to the Brotherhood of Carpenters; from the Chamber \nof Commerce to the International Union of Operating Engineers; from \nAAA--and most of us belong to AAA because we are worried something is \ngoing to happen on one of these bridges or one of these roadways that \nare filled with obstacles and we could get in a crash. People belong to \nthe AAA, and they support us. Also, the Laborers' International Union, \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, the American Council of Engineering \nCompanies.\n  Let's put up some more. Again, these are unusual allies. Usually they \nare fighting each other. The National Association of Counties agrees \nwith the National Association of Manufacturers, and they agree with the \nTruck Stop Operators and the National Governors Association. The \nNational League of Cities agrees with the National Ready Mixed Concrete \nAssociation; the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel Association; the \nOwner-Operator Independent Drivers Association; the Portland Cement \nAssociation; and the retail industry leaders. Why did they come \ntogether for this? If you are in the retail business and people cannot \nget to your store, you will not be there for very long. They may say it \nis just not worth it and will buy online.\n  The fact is that we need to fix our roads.\n  The American Highway Users Alliance agrees with the American Society \nof Civil Engineers and the Associated General Contractors.\n  I want to make a point. On Tuesday the Associated General \nContractors--the AGC--put out a very important and alarming study. \nConstruction employment declined in 25 States between May and June. \nThey went on to explain to the press that there were monthly \nconstruction employment declines as Congress continued to search for \nways to pay for new highway and transit investments. The monthly \nconstruction employment figures are troubling.\n  Investing in transportation infrastructure will make it easier for \nmany firms involved in highway and transit construction to add new \njobs.\n  There are certain States that are worse than others. Illinois lost \n2.2 percent of its construction jobs--they shed so many jobs--followed \nby New Jersey. New Jersey had the second-most shedding of jobs, 4,600; \nOhio shed 3,700 jobs; Florida, 3,100 jobs; Rhode Island, 700 jobs.\n  I heard my colleagues say: Well, Vermont lost 500 jobs. Here is the \nsituation. I have heard my colleagues say: We don't like the way this \nis paid for. We have better ideas. I agree with them. I have better \nideas too. I have 10 or 11 or 12, but I am not the only one putting \nthis together. We have to find that magic sweet spot where we can get \n60 votes here in the Senate.\n\n  I am thinking if they vote no on this but it passes, when they go to \nmeet one of these workers and the worker says: Thank you so much; we \ngot this job because we got a 3-year funding bill, what are they going \nto say? I didn't vote for it because I didn't think the funding was \nright? I wanted it to be done a different way? I am sure the worker \nwould say, I appreciate that, but I am working. I am working. I am \nfeeding my family.\n  I understand why people want a better source of funding, and we have \ntried. As my chairman knows, we have tried so hard. I know he wants to \nspeak now, so I will close down my time with this----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield.\n  (Mrs. ERNST assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am not attempting to get the floor. I think what the \nSenator from California has said is very significant.\n  I think people realize--and I have said several times that the \nSenator from California and I are about as far apart philosophically as \nany two people can be. She is a very proud liberal. I am a very proud \nconservative. We disagree on a lot of issues on the committee which the \nSenator from California used to chair when the Democrats were in the \nmajority and which I chair now, but during all that time and up to the \npresent time, we have agreed on this.\n  When I see people saying they don't want--I am very disturbed by what \nthe House is doing right now. If we don't have a long-term bill, then \nwe will go right back to what we have done since 2009.\n  The Senator from California and I remember when we passed the 2005 \ntransportation authorization. That was huge. We have had things that \nhave happened in Oklahoma now as a result of that legislation that are \nsaving lives. As I have mentioned before, remember the bridge when a \nchunk of concrete fell off and killed a mother of three. That happened \nright up toward the 2005 bill.\n  I can't imagine we are going to be in a position where we go back to \nincrease the number of short-term--we have had 33 short-term extensions \nsince 2009. I can't imagine we will go back to that. If we do that, we \ndon't get the reforms. A lot of the reforms, I say to my friend from \nCalifornia, were reforms where she had a hard sell. She had a hard time \ndoing it. There are a lot of things--I wanted to change the 80-20 \nfederal share. In some areas it was 60-40, and then 70-30. We couldn't \ndo it. We compromised. I remember there was quite a bit said about \nthat, so that was one of my losses that wasn't necessarily one of the \nSenator's gains.\n  The bottom line is we have a bill that is going to be before the \npeople who have a chance to vote on it. This is the last chance we have \nto get off of the part-time extensions.\n  I would ask my good friend from California if she is observing the \nsame circumstances that I am.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am observing it exactly the same way. \nI said before that we have a very honest relationship in terms of where \nwe can find that common ground, and it is in this arena.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma has pointed out, he reads the \nConstitution and I read the Constitution. He has said many times--and \nhe has addressed people who have heard the Senator say this--that this \nis a constitutional responsibility to make sure we have roads, bridges, \nhighways, and we can move interstate commerce. From my perspective, not \nonly do I agree with that, but I also think it is a very important way \nwhile we are taking care of the people to see that people have good, \ndecent jobs, and that businesses prosper.\n  We have never had a problem working together on this. I hope our \nworking together brings liberals, conservatives, moderates, and \neverybody in between to tonight's votes.\n  I don't know what the vote is going to be, I would say to my dear \nfriend, but I do know this. The House is saying through their whip that \nthey are leaving. Well, that is up to them. We all know, from the \nAssociation of General Contractors, it is stated right here that in 25 \nStates we are seeing layoffs right now in the construction arena \nbecause we have not acted.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that their statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Associated General Contractors, July 21, 2015]\n\nConstruction Employment Declines in Half of the States Between May and \n    June as Congress Seeks New Way To Pay For Needed Transportation \n                                Upgrades\n\n       Illinois and Rhode Island Have Biggest Declines for the \n     Month, Delaware and New York Have Largest Gains between May \n     and June; Ohio and West Virginia Have Biggest Annual \n     Declines, Idaho and California Add Most.\n       Construction employment declined in 25 states between May \n     and June even as 39 states and the District of Columbia added \n     construction jobs between June 2014 and June 2015, according \n     to an analysis today of Labor Department data by the \n     Associated General Contractors of America. Association \n     officials noted that the monthly construction employment \n     declines come as Congress continues to search for ways to pay \n     for new highway and transit investments.\n       ``While the year-over-year totals remains relatively \n     positive, the monthly construction employment figures are \n     troubling,'' said Ken Simonson, the association's chief \n     economist. ``Investing in transportation infrastructure will \n     make it easier for many firms involved in highway and transit \n     construction to add new staff.''\n       Illinois (-4,700 jobs, -2.2 percent) shed more construction \n     jobs during the past\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\n     month than any other state, followed by New Jersey (-4,600 \n     jobs, -3.0 percent); Ohio (-3,700 jobs, -1.9 percent) and \n     Florida (-3,100 jobs, -0.7 percent). Rhode Island (-4.5 \n     percent, -700 jobs) list the highest percentage of \n     construction jobs between May and June, followed by Vermont \n     (-3.3 percent, -500 jobs); New Jersey and New Mexico (-2.7 \n     percent, -1,100 jobs).\n       Twenty-four states added construction jobs between May and \n     June, while construction employment was unchanged in Wyoming \n     and the District of Columbia. New York (3,300 jobs, 0.9 \n     percent) added the most construction jobs. Other states \n     adding a high number of construction jobs included Minnesota \n     (2,600 jobs, 2.4 percent) and Connecticut (2,200 jobs, 3.8 \n     percent). Delaware (4.3 percent, 900 jobs) added the highest \n     percentage of construction jobs during the past month \n     followed by Connecticut, Hawaii (3.7 percent, 1,200 jobs) and \n     Arkansas (3.5 percent, 1,700 jobs).\n       Eleven states shed construction jobs during the past 12 \n     months with West Virginia (-12.8 percent, -4,300 jobs) losing \n     the highest percent of construction jobs. Other states that \n     lost a high percentage of jobs for the year included Rhode \n     Island (-9.6 percent, -1,600 jobs); Mississippi (-7.9 \n     percent, -3,900 jobs) and Ohio (-7.9 percent, -3,900 jobs). \n     The largest job losses occurred in Ohio, West Virginia and \n     Mississippi.\n       California added more new construction jobs (47,000 jobs, \n     7.0 percent) between June 2014 and June 2015 than any other \n     state. Other states adding a high number of new construction \n     jobs for the past 12 months included Florida (25,200 jobs, \n     6.4 percent), Texas (18,900 jobs, 2.9 percent), Washington \n     (15,300 jobs, 9.7 percent) and Michigan (14,000 jobs, 9.8 \n     percent). Idaho (12.9 percent, 4,600 jobs) added the highest \n     percentage of new construction jobs during the past year, \n     followed by Nevada (11.1 percent, 7,000 jobs); Michigan; \n     Arkansas (9.7 percent, 4,400 jobs) and North Carolina.\n       Association officials said one of the challenges facing the \n     construction industry is uncertainty about future federal \n     funding levels for highway and transit repairs and \n     improvements. Noting that the Senate is expected to vote on a \n     new long-term surface transportation bill later today, they \n     urged members of both parties to work together to address \n     growing problems with the country's aging transportation \n     infrastructure.\n       ``Passing a long-term highway and transit bill will provide \n     the kind of funding certainty many construction firms need to \n     expand payrolls and invest in new equipment,'' said Stephen \n     E. Sandherr, the association's chief executive officer. ``The \n     series of short-term transportation funding extensions \n     Congress has passed has clearly had a negative impact on the \n     construction industry's recovery.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is tragic. What happens when people are laid off? We \nknow what happens. We are getting out of this tough recession, and none \nof us wants to walk down the path of a short-term solution.\n  So I say to my friend, I am going to finish my remarks in about 2 \nminutes and when I yield the floor to him, I look forward to hearing \nhis remarks.\n  We have work to do tonight. We have to get 60 votes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, if the Senator from California will \nyield, let me make one statement, and then I will be coming back later \nto talk about some of these amendments that will be coming up.\n  One issue we need to clarify with our people on our side is that the \nconservative position is to support this. Our good friend, our mutual \nfriend Gary Ridley, said that the extensions cost about 30 percent off \nthe top--30 percent. In fact, I will say this, after our 27-month bill, \nwe went over it in the House, and I had requested an audience with the \nentire--all 33 Republicans on the appropriate committees, and all 33 \nagreed that it was a conservative position. All 33 voted for the bill. \nI think we have the opportunity to make that happen again.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, reclaiming my time, my friend is right. \nThis is an area where conservatives, progressives, liberals, \nmoderates--what we call ourselves doesn't matter. We need to have a \ngood, strong highway system. We need to fix the bridges. We need \ntransportation. That is what we do here.\n  In closing, I wish to make this point. Each of our States has relied \non the highway trust fund since Eisenhower was President. I have a \nlist, and I think I put it in the Record yesterday so I don't have to \nput it in the Record again, but it shows how much each State relies on \nthe highway trust fund. I will pull out a few States because it is \ninteresting. I know my own State is 49 percent. We raise the rest of \nthe money, but that 49 percent is huge, and if it were to disappear, we \nsimply could not do what we need to do. So my State is about 50 \npercent.\n  Here are some of the States: Rhode Island, 100 percent of its program \nis funded by the Federal highway trust fund. Alaska, 93 percent is \nfunded by the Federal highway trust fund. Vermont, 86 percent is funded \nby the Federal highway trust fund. South Carolina, 79 percent; Hawaii, \n79 percent; North Dakota, 78 percent; South Dakota, 71 percent; \nConnecticut, 71 percent; New Mexico, 70 percent.\n  Now, from that list--that is, everybody who is 70 percent and over--\nthose are red States, those are blue States, those are purple States.\n  My point is exactly what Senator Inhofe said yesterday. The fact is, \nthere is no such thing as a Democratic road or a Republican road or an \nIndependent road or a progressive road or a liberal road or a \nconservative road. We all use the roads, unfortunately, increasingly, \nat our peril--at our peril.\n  Idaho, 68 percent; Alabama, 68 percent; New Hampshire, 68 percent; \nMissouri, 65 percent; Minnesota, 64 percent; Oklahoma, 63 percent; \nGeorgia, 62 percent; Iowa, 59 percent; Ohio, 58 percent; Virginia, 57 \npercent; Wisconsin, 55 percent; Oregon, 54 percent, and it goes on.\n  Every single one of our States is waiting. The lowest, as I \nunderstand it, looks to be New Jersey at 35 percent, but the fact is \nwhether it is 35 percent or 45 percent or 90 percent or 100 percent, \nthey all rely on the Federal highway trust fund. All of our people pay \ninto it through the gas tax.\n  We have a responsibility. We are moving forward if we get the votes \ntonight. Again, we don't know that we will get them. We are working \nhard to get them. Hopefully, we will move forward with a good \ntransportation bill and, for the first time in 10 years, we will have a \nlong-term bill.\n  Now, the Washington Post did an interesting editorial. They don't \nadore this bill. They found problems with it, as we all do, but they \nsaid it is a sensible plan by Senators Boxer and Inhofe--if we worked \nit out--that it provides 3 years of guaranteed funding, that it would \nbe a significant improvement from what we have done in Congress for the \npast decade. They said lawmakers fumbled from short-term funding patch \nto short-term funding patch--a nonstrategy that often relied on budget \ngimmicks and made it difficult for transportation officials to conduct \nlong-term planning.\n  The New York Times said on Tuesday what I said before: Construction \nemployment fell in 25 States this summer as State agencies awaited word \nfrom Congress on the future of the highway and transit spending. We \nalso know there are well over one-half million unemployed construction \nworkers--one-half million. Now they are starting to get laid off again.\n  I don't know what else to say to Members. The biggest reason they are \nvoting no that I heard is they would like to find a better funding \nsource. Well, all of us would, and if we had our way--the Presiding \nOfficer would come up with her funding source. I love mine, which is a \nrefundable gas tax increase, but I can't get a lot of votes for that. \nPeople won't give me the votes for that. So what do I do, throw up my \nhands and say we will have another short-term extension? No. I sat down \nwith Senator Inhofe, I sat down with Senator Durbin, I talked to \nSenator Reid and Senator Schumer, of course, and all of my leadership \nover here, and I did my best. I think everyone has to understand, it is \neither this way or we will have to do a short-term patch.\n  I will predict--right now, seven States have shut down their program \ncompletely. If we don't find a solution, we are going to be looking at \neach other in a month, 2 months, and we are going to see programs shut \ndown. I often use this analogy, so if my colleagues have heard it \nbefore, I apologize in advance. But if you go to the bank, you want to \nbuy a house; they say: Great news, you qualify, and they only give you \na 5-month mortgage. Are you going to buy the house? Of course you are \nnot. Are our States going to build a highway if all they have is \nfunding for 5 months? No. That is why the private sector that gets this \nmoney from the States--that is why they are laying people off.\n  Now, I want to say, working with Senator Inhofe, we were able to \ncreate a new National Freight Program and a new program called \nAssistance for Major Projects. This means that every\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\none of our States would be eligible. It is exciting to have those kinds \nof programs. The freight program will provide funds for all States. All \nStates are going to get part of this formula to improve their goods \nmovement, to reduce the costs, and improve performance for business. It \nexpands flexibility for rural and urban areas to designate key freight \ncorridors. This is exciting. The program is supported by the Coalition \nfor America's Gateways and Trade Corridors, as well as business groups \nsuch as the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  Now, under the Assistance for Major Programs, this was something \nSenator Whitehouse of Rhode Island worked very hard on. The bill \nprovides support for major projects of high importance to a community, \na region, or the Nation, through a competitive grant program. It \nincludes a set-aside for rural areas and ensures an equitable \ngeographic distribution of funds along with strong transparency \nprovisions.\n  Now, these programs are exciting news. Whether one is from Iowa or \nCalifornia, we are all going to get these funds and locally, we will \ndecide how to spend them.\n  Our bill passed the committee 20 to 0. What a great moment that was, \nand the reason is we knew we had to compromise. So the part of this \nbill from EPW was a compromise. The part of the bill from the commerce \ncommittee was a little bit trickier because it did come out on a \npartisan vote, but we have been working--Senator Nelson and Senator \nThune, Senator Blumenthal, and others--on that to make it a better \ntitle. And I think it is moving in that direction. As to the banking \nbill, Senator Brown's staff worked very hard on this with Senator \nShelby's staff, and I believe it has clearly been improved since it was \nfirst released. The Finance Committee was tough. Senator Wyden tried \nhard. I put some ideas out there. It was tough to get them done. But \nsomehow we have managed to put together the funding. It does clear the \nCBO. We are in surplus for 3 years in the highway trust fund. We \nhaven't done that. It has been 10 years since we had more than a 2-year \nextension. This is real.\n\n  I just say to my friends from the House that I know you want to get \nout of town. Everybody does. It is August, and we have plans. A lot of \nus are going to go around the world and do our job that way, have \ncommunity meetings, and take a week of vacation with our families as \nevery family wants to do. But we are staying an extra week in August. \nYou can stay an extra week in August. That is not such a terrible \nthing.\n  I get an announcement from the whip over there, Representative \nMcCarthy from my State. He says: Don't send us a bill because we are \ngoing home.\n  Well, that is their choice.\n  There are so many good organizations. I am going to put this list up \nagain and share it because I think it is so important. It is tough to \nput together a bill that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports, along \nwith the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborers' \nInternational Union of North America, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nand AAA, not to mention Mothers Against Drunk Driving.\n  I will show you some others. It is exciting to see the National \nAssociation of Counties. I started off as a county supervisor. I was in \nlocal government. You know, to have us agree with the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the truckstop operators, the National \nGovernors Association, the National League of Cities, the concrete \npeople, and the gravel people--there is one more here--what you see is \nthat everybody supports this--the American Public Transportation \nAssociation, the American Trucking Association, the Associated General \nContractors of America. The Associated General Contractors of America \nhas warned us if we don't get this done, it is going to be a real \nproblem.\n  So for the sake of every single person in America, I hope we have the \n60 votes we need tonight, and I hope we get this moving. There are a \nlot of people who are slowing this bill down. I understand they are \nupset about everything. Look, we each can be upset. I mean every day we \ncan be upset, but we have to try to find common ground. Sometimes it is \nvery hard to find it.\n  Certainly, Senator Wicker was here. He and Senator Feinstein have an \namendment. I support it. It is unfortunate that Senator Wicker's \nopinion didn't hold sway in the Appropriations Committee. It is hard. \nIt is difficult. I personally think he is right. He didn't win in the \nAppropriations Committee. So now we are trying to fix the problem. We \nmay not have the votes, but what we do have before us--and I will \nconclude with this--is a solid bill with increases so we can fix these \nbridges.\n  I want you to see the last image, which is the collapse of this \nbridge in California. It just happened a few weeks ago or less. What we \nhad here was a bridge that was called functionally obsolete. What they \nsaid was that when it was built there was very little comment on it. \nBut now it is a very important bridge because we have to take the goods \nfrom Arizona over to California and from California over to Arizona, \nand it has collapsed.\n  Senator Inhofe and I talk a lot about why we do what we do. He had a \ndevastating bridge collapse--a devastating bridge collapse where a \nmother of three was killed just walking by the bridge. That is when he \nand I said enough is enough. We simply cannot handle it. It is our job.\n  Once I was told this when I was a county supervisor. If you know \nthere is a problem and people are in danger--this is what they told us \nway back in the day because we had an earthquake problem with the \nbuilding we were in and the county council said to the five \nsupervisors: You know this is a problem. If you don't fix it, there is \nan argument to be made that you are personally liable. Now, I am not \nsuggesting at all that Senators be held personally liable for a bridge \ncollapse, but I am talking about the moral issue. We do know we have \nproblems. We were fortunate that no one was killed in this collapse, \nand it was kind of a miracle. But we do know there is a problem. So \nwhile we don't have a legal obligation to step up to the plate--and I \nknow Senator Inhofe agrees with me--we believe there is a moral \nobligation.\n  There is this list of bridges. There are three pages of bridges that \nwe know are in trouble. We know that 50 percent of our roads are \ndeficient. Isn't that enough for us to come together tonight--it will \nprobably be late in the evening, I expect--and vote to move forward \nwith this bill and get it done, send it to the House, and hopefully, \nthey will decide in the same session and decide to pass it? There will \nbe a celebration across this Nation. It will be a celebration by \nworkers who want to fix these problems, by businesses who want to fix \nthese problems, by people who drive who want to see these problems \nfixed. It is a win-win for our Nation.\n  I thank you so much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Voluntary Country of Origin Labeling and Trade Enhancement Act\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about a program called Product of Canada. Product of Canada, you \nmight ask what it is. The Product of Canada Program is the voluntary \nfood labeling program they have in Canada. So no one has to participate \nin this program in Canada, but if they want to, they can. It is just \nthat, a voluntary food labeling program they call Product of Canada.\n  What does that mean? Well, just taking from one of the Web sites \nwhere we looked it up, the ``Product of Canada'' label can only be \napplied to animals that are born, raised, and slaughtered in Canada \nwith some exceptions. Now, they also have labeling as far as prepacked \nproducts. That is actually mandatory labeling. Under their mandatory \nlabeling it says: All prepackaged food products sold in Canada must be \nlabeled with the name and address of the company. Also, it says: If\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\nmanufactured outside of Canada, the label must reflect it is imported. \nIt is mandatory to state the country of origin on some specific \nimported prepackaged products such as wine and brandy, dairy products, \nhoney, fish, and seafood products, fresh fruit and vegetables, eggs \nshelled, eggs processed, meat products, maple products, processed \nfruits and vegetables.\n  The program goes on, but the important point I want to make is they \nhave some mandatory aspects to their prepackaged products and their \nprepackaged products program as I mentioned. But the Product of Canada \nProgram and the ``Product of Canada'' label, that is a voluntary \nprogram. It is animals that are born, raised, and slaughtered in \nCanada. Why do I come to the floor of the Senate to point out that \nCanada has a voluntary meat labeling program, a Product of Canada \nProgram? For the simple reason that we are and have been engaged in \nwhat do we do about COOL, the Country of Origin Labeling Program in the \nUnited States.\n  I have offered bipartisan legislation, legislation with Senator \nDebbie Stabenow of Michigan, who is the lead Democrat on the \nlegislation, bipartisan legislation that includes a majority of the \nagricultural committee in the Senate. So what we are trying to do is \nsolve the country-of-origin labeling dispute or disagreement by \ncreating bipartisanship and passing a bill that addresses the \nunderlying problem. So what is the problem?\n  The problem is that the WTO court, the World Trade Organization court \nhas determined that a mandatory food labeling program, COOL, does not \nmeet the WTO requirements. So the House of Representatives, led by the \nagriculture chairman, Mike Conaway, who is an outstanding ag chairman \nin the House, passed a bill that repeals mandatory COOL.\n  You know what. We took that bill and we have included it in our \nlegislation which we call the Voluntary Country of Origin Labeling and \nTrade Enhancement Act of 2015--we took the very same legislation, and \nwe are trying to pass it here. We are trying to pass the same--we did \nnot take anything out of Representative Conaway's bill, passed in the \nHouse. We took that bill. We are trying to pass it here to address the \nissue of mandatory food labeling, mandatory COOL.\n  But we also added a voluntary program, just as Canada has a voluntary \nProduct of Canada Program. So there are just a few basic logical \nquestions I would ask. First, we are repealing the mandatory program. \nSo when somebody says: Well, you have to repeal mandatory COOL, and you \ncannot have anything else, we have to repeal mandatory COOL, that is \nexactly what we do. We pass the Conaway bill. We repeal mandatory COOL. \nThat is a fact. Facts are stubborn things. So let's be clear on that. \nWe do. We pass the House bill, and we add to it a voluntary program, \nsimilar to the Product of Canada Program because there are people in \nthis country who want voluntary labeling. They want a voluntary \ncountry-of-origin labeling program. They want a program, which as \nCanada has--Product of Canada is a voluntary program.\n  At the end of the day, to get this done, to avoid any countervailing \nduty or tariffs under the WTO ruling, we need to repeal mandatory COOL, \nwhich we do, and we put in place the voluntary COOL, which we need to \ndo to get bipartisan support in the Senate and the House and pass the \nlegislation we need to pass. We need to do it in that way in order to \nget it done timely--certainly before we go on the August recess.\n\n  So this is a clear opportunity to come together in a bipartisan way \nand solve a problem and solve it in a way that makes sense. We reach \nout to our House counterparts. We reach out to our counterparts in the \nHouse and we say: You did good work. You did hard work. You passed a \nrepeal of mandatory COOL.\n  That is fine. We are passing your bill. At the same time, because \nthere are advocates for labeling, we pass a voluntary program so we can \nactually move the bill through the Senate, get into conference with the \nHouse, and get their work done now rather than waiting. The voluntary \nprogram is the same thing Canada does. So how can our very good friends \nin Canada say to us: Well, it is OK for Canada to have a voluntary \nprogram and, yes, we get that you are fully repealing mandatory COOL, \nbut, gee, even though we in Canada have a voluntary program, gosh, we \ndon't think you ought to have one in the United States. It does not \nmake sense.\n  Come on. Let's get together. Let's find a way to get together in a \nbipartisan way, move this legislation, get together with the House and \nget this done. That is all we are asking. We have a good start on this \nbill. We have a majority on our ag committee. Sponsoring the \nlegislation along with Senator Stabenow and me are Senator John Thune, \nRepublican; Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat; Senator Chuck Grassley, \nRepublican; Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat; Senator Mike Enzi, \nRepublican; Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat. That is bipartisan. It \nis common sense.\n  It is a simple solution. We are saying: OK. We get it. Canada won in \nthe WTO court. We cannot have a mandatory program. We follow the \nHouse's lead. We pass their legislation. At the same time, we put in \nplace a voluntary program similar to Canada's. We are reaching out to \nour friends and neighbors in Canada and saying: Hey, we want to work \nwith you. Please work with us. That is what we do in this legislation.\n  So I hope Senators will join together with us in a bipartisan--I \nemphasize that again--in a bipartisan way. That is what it takes in the \nSenate. It takes 60 votes to pass legislation. You cannot do it with \njust one party or the other. It takes 60 votes. You have to have \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I call on my colleagues to get together with us. Let's move this \nlegislation. Let's get together with the House and our friends from \nCanada and get this done. We can do it. We can do it now in a timely \nway, and we can make sure we not only don't have any countervailing \nduty or tariffs on our exports, but we can also have a voluntary \nlabeling program which many in this country want: consumers, producers, \nour farmers, our ranchers, retailers, some processors.\n  But you know what. If somebody does not want to participate, that is \nfine, hence the word ``voluntary.'' That is the American way. I have \nhad the good fortune to work with Representative Conaway. I certainly \nappreciate him and his hard work. I have also had the opportunity to \nwork with our good friends north of the border. We have no better \nfriend and ally than Canada. We should be able to get together with our \nCanadian friends and say: Look, we are absolutely doing what the WTO \ncourt requires. We are repealing mandatory COOL. We are passing the \nHouse bill.\n  But at the same time, there are a lot of people in this country whom \nwe have to be fair to who want a voluntary program. There is no reason \nin the world to hold up solving this problem by not allowing them to \nhave a voluntary program, similar to the voluntary program Canada has, \nProduct of Canada.\n  I also would note that my cosponsor on the legislation is on the \nfloor. I greet her and thank her for her hard, bipartisan work to solve \nthis challenge in a very commonsense way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first, let me say that it is always a \npleasure to work with the senior Senator from North Dakota. We \npartnered on a number of different things, including efforts on the \nfarm bill.\n  So it is with great pleasure that I am partnering with him again to \nsolve this problem and to make sure that we eliminate any possibility \nof retaliation on our businesses and solve a problem in a way that \nmeets our trade obligations and also makes sure that we are standing up \nfor our farmers and our consumers in America. That is really the goal.\n  I appreciate Senator Hoeven's leadership and commonsense approach to \nactually solving the problem. It is always great to be with the \nSenator.\n  As Senator Hoeven did say, we have put together a thoughtful and \nbipartisan bill, the voluntary COOL and trade enforcement act. We are \nvery ``COOL'' here in the country of origin labeling act.\n  I also thank our cosponsors. We have Senators Grassley, Heitkamp, \nKlobuchar, Thune, Brown, Enzi, Casey,\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\nRounds, Murray, Baldwin, and Wyden, and we are adding more people every \nday. So we are pleased to have the majority of the Agriculture \nCommittee standing with us on this bipartisan effort.\n  Let me start by saying as well that while I disagree with the WTO's \nconclusion and I am disappointed at the final outcome of the case, I \nrespect the decision and acknowledge that we have to act. We have to \nact in a responsible way to address this and live up to our trade \nallegations.\n  The potential impact on the economy and other industries demands that \nwe give this issue our full attention, and that is what we are doing. \nOur legislation offers something that is common sense. It is trade \ncompliant, and it is a path forward.\n  First, the bill repeals mandatory country-of-origin labeling. This is \nwhat we have to do to meet our trade obligations to Canada and Mexico. \nThere is no way around it, certainly on beef and pork, in order to come \ntogether to be able to address this quickly. In fact, we have in our \nbill the same language as in the House. So we have the same language as \nthe House and the same language as the amendment put forward by our \nchairman, Senator Roberts, and others.\n  No. 1, we all agree on what it takes to address the trade case and \nget that off the table.\n  No. 2, now it becomes this: What do we want to do as Americans? What \ndo we want to do? This is not a realm where Canada or Mexico really has \na voice. Once we meet the trade obligation, we have met the test. What \ndo we want to do?\n  I remember during the farm bill, when we were talking about changes \nwe needed to make to address the Brazil case on cotton, where they won \na case against us, and I asked folks: Well, what do the Brazilians \nthink?\n  I was told by members of the committee, many of whom are now saying \nwe have to give Canada veto power or Mexico veto power, that Brazil \ncan't have veto power over the United States on cotton and that is up \nto the United States.\n  We proceeded with a path that we believed met WTO rules and met the \nneeds of American producers. Now we have some of the same folks saying: \nOh, no, we can't do anything unless this is something that Mexico likes \nor Canada likes. So I would argue that we deal with that--with the \ntrade decision in WTO--in all three bills. Now the question is this: \nWhat do we want to do for our consumers and to support American \nfarmers?\n  So, second, we establish a voluntary ``Product of the United States'' \nlabel defined as born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States. So \nyou can have whatever labels are appropriate to have, but if you want \nto have a label that says ``Product of the United States,'' you have to \nmeet the integrity of that label.\n  If the consumer is seeking to purchase a product of the United \nStates, a packer is willing to provide it, and they decide they want to \ndo that--farmers want to do that; they want to provide that--then there \nshould be an accurate label. They can look at all the pros and cons of \ndoing that. Then they should be able to do that on a voluntary basis. \nThat is all we are saying.\n  Anyone who has watched this issue over the years knows that both \nsides have become very entrenched, and we understand that. But our \napproach is to say now that we will agree with the House, we will agree \nwith those who always opposed a mandatory country-of-origin labeling, \nand we will agree on repeal. However, we need to make sure, on behalf \nof American consumers, that for American farmers and processors it \nwould give them a tool--a voluntary tool--they can use if they wish to \ndo that.\n  Now, what is very interesting is the fact that back when the \nmandatory country-of-origin labeling bill was on floor and was being \npassed by the House and the Senate, the people who opposed that at the \ntime introduced S. 1333, the Meat Promotion Act, which would \n``establish a voluntary program for country of origin labeling of \nmeat.'' It was introduced by the same people who are now saying we \ncannot do that--Senators Cornyn, Roberts, Hatch, Alexander, and \nothers--all of whom were arguing that we should have a voluntary \nprogram, not a mandatory program.\n  So now here we are. You would think this would be easy. You would \nthink this would be a slam dunk. What we are suggesting, in fact, is \nsomething that was in a bill--a voluntary ``Product of the United \nStates'' label for meat from animals born, raised, and slaughtered in \nthe United States. At the time, it was broadly supported by the \nmeatpacking industry as well as the largest organization of cattlemen \nin the United States. At the same time, they argued they thought this \nproposal was a smart way to promote U.S. meat products while also \nsupporting international trade--the same people who are now working \nagainst us.\n  In fact, as it turns out, they were in the spot where we are now \nunderstanding we need to land. But instead of agreeing and saying to us \nthat it is about time you got here, embracing it and saying let's do \nthis very quickly so we can put other businesses where may face \nretaliation in a position of confidence so that is not going to \nhappen--we thought this would be a no-brainer; take the bill that was \nalready introduced, and take the language passed by the House--now we \nare seeing that, in fact, the same people who wanted S. 1333 are now \nsaying that in the world it will start a trade war and all kinds of \nother things.\n  But let's talk about that for a moment. Even as recently as last \nAugust, Canadian officials openly discussed a voluntary COOL program as \na way to address their trade concerns, and they said: ``If you do a \nvoluntary label, which we do in Canada under product of Canada, you \ndon't have that trade sanctioned problem.'' That was in August of 2014, \nGerry Ritz, Agriculture Minister of Canada.\n  Next, in 2012, the WTO Appellate Body report quoted both Canada and \nMexico, suggesting that the United States switch from a mandatory to a \nvoluntary labeling program to move ``beyond the dispute.'' So, again, \nthis was from Canada: ``Expanded as required to meet consumer interest, \nvoluntary labelling can provide as much consumer information on origin \nto interested consumers as the COOL measure.'' That was in 2012, \nsuggesting that was the tool that the United States should use.\n  Then, this is from our Mexican friends:\n\n       Mexico submits that there are at least four alternative \n     measures. . . . The first alternative is a voluntary country \n     of origin labelling scheme, which in Mexico's view, could \n     maintain the same labelling criteria on origin as the COOL \n     measure--that is, born, raised, and slaughtered [in the \n     United States].\n\n  That is 2012, Mexico.\n  So we clearly know that both Canada and Mexico have considered \nvoluntarily labeling as the responsible approach. In fact, they have \nsuggested we do that. So while both countries have been vocal, it still \ndoes not change the fact that Canada and Mexico are not entitled to \nveto what the Congress of the United States of America chooses to do \nwith our laws, as long as we are compliant with our trade obligations.\n  Clearly, I understand politics--Lord knows we do. We understand \npolitics, we understand elections, and we understand negotiations. We \nunderstand. If you can put the United States in a position to \nvoluntarily stand down and not let consumers know on a voluntary basis \nwhat is a product of the United States, that is great for competition, \nif you are Canada or Mexico. And if they can bully us into doing that--\nwell, shame on us if they can bully us into doing that.\n  The fact of the matter is our legislation, which I believe clearly \nhas the majority of votes in the Senate and certainly on the \nagriculture committee, not only meets the trade requirements of the \ndispute--which we lost, we know it, and we have to address it--but \nstands up for American consumers, American farmers, and processors who \nchoose to use the tool of a voluntary label.\n  WTO rules are very clear that a country should not proceed with \nretaliation if the underlying law has been made WTO-consistent. So \nfolks can stomp around and threaten. We understand negotiations. We all \nnegotiate with people who stomp around a lot.\n  But the reality is that if we take that away and we are now trade \ncompliant, they no longer can legally proceed. The Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\nhas also stated that our approach would be just as WTO-consistent as \nthe repeal bills alone: ``We believe both options--repealing the \nmandatory labeling scheme or repealing the mandatory labeling regime \nand replacing it with a voluntary labeling system--have the potential \nto constitute compliance with U.S. WTO obligations.''\n  There is no difference--no difference. And this is a few days ago--\nJuly 23, 2015.\n  It really comes down to the fact that if Canada has its own voluntary \nlabel for meat produced in Canada, how in the world can they argue with \nthe United States of America that our farmers and consumers should not \nhave the same label?\n  I think what it boils down to is competition. I do, because it starts \nas a trade case. We meet our trade obligations. We address what we have \nto do legally. Now the question is this: Can they bully us into a \nposition to actually stand down so we cannot brag about the great meat \nthat we have in this country and let consumers know about it?\n  I understand that the Canadians are afraid to compete head-to-head \nwith products that are 100-percent born, raised, and harvested here in \nthe United States. We do a pretty good job. Our farmers and our \nranchers do a very good job, actually. After all, there is no safer, \nmore abundant food supply produced anywhere in the world than in the \nUnited States. The American public deserves to know if they choose to \nlook for that label and purchase that label. They should have the \nopportunity to do that. Certainly, when our friends in Canada--and they \nare our friends; we work on many issues together in a wonderful way. \nBut on this one, I have to say I think this is very much about \ncompetition. And we need to be able to compete economically with them \nin the same way they compete with us. If they have a ``Made in Canada'' \nlabel, we need to be able to have a ``Product of the United States'' \nlabel.\n\n  So I would ask that we stop with all the rhetoric on the floor by \nfolks who sponsored a voluntary label with the same definition a few \nyears ago; stop the rhetoric by our friends from Canada and Mexico \nabout how the world will come to an end if the United States has a \nvoluntary program that meets our trade obligations. We need to just \ntake a deep breath and make sure that we solve the trade case, that we \ndo what we need to do and then have the USDA in America--the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture--allow all of us to decide what we want to do \nabout voluntary labeling of our meat--or anything else, for that \nmatter.\n  We are not interested in starting a trade war, and it seems pretty \nsilly when I hear the hot rhetoric that tries to claim that. What we \nare wanting to do is solve a problem that relates to international \ntrade that we all agree needs to be resolved. We must resolve it, we \nmust make sure those not involved in the dispute don't somehow pay a \npenalty through retaliation, and then respect our own consumers \nenough--our own families, our own farmers, our own processors enough--\nto give them a tool, if they decide they wish to use it, to have the \nintegrity of a product of the United States labeled.\n  It would be a sad day and I believe irresponsible on our part if we \nmove back to the days prior to COOL where we were labeling meat that \nwas born in a foreign country and spent most of its life in the foreign \ncountry but then could somehow come in and be harvested here and be \ncalled a product of the United States. Talk about something that is a \nproblem--that is a problem. That is a problem. And American consumers \ndeserve better than that. Our own processors and farmers who are \ncompeting with those in other countries deserve better than that.\n  We have the opportunity to embrace a proposal that, frankly, in my \njudgment, should be a no-brainer for us given all of the information \nand the case for why this works.\n  So, Madam President, I am looking forward to working with colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to actually get this done. We should get it \ndone quickly so that we can move on to a whole series of issues that \nneed to be addressed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Federal Environmental Regulations\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, all Americans but especially Arizonans \nshould be concerned about the crushing wall of Federal environmental \nregulations that President Obama has been announcing is coming our way.\n  Politico recently noted, ``Two years [after the President originally \nannounced his intent to take executive action on climate change], \nscarcely a week goes by without the administration unveiling a new \nclimate change initiative.'' Common among all these regulations is \ntheir complete disregard for how businesses really operate and how they \nwill adversely affect those businesses and their consumers.\n  According to a report recently released by the American Action Forum, \njust the 18 ``economically significant'' regulations the White House \nannounced before Memorial Day will saddle the Nation's slowly \nrecovering economy with more than $110 billion in potential cost, with \nbillions more in unknown burdens. If left uncorrected, these \nregulations will unfairly impact Arizona consumers and businesses and, \nin the view of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, ``cause significant \neconomic harm to our state.''\n  One of the most alarming of these new regulations is the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's so-called clean water rule or waters \nof the United States rule--a Federal regulation of almost unprecedented \nscope. The EPA has claimed this rule would just let it stop \nconstruction activities that disturb small, environmentally sensitive \nstreams and wetlands, but when you dive into the rule's 299 pages, you \nwill find it actually expands EPA's authority to roughly 60 percent of \nall ``waters of the United States,'' including irrigation ditches, \nstock ponds, and even dry desert washes.\n  This is bad news for Arizona agriculture and homebuilding sectors, \nwhich combined account for most of all economic activity in my State. \nIf a farmer wants to build or repair a canal, the EPA could block it. A \ncommunity that wants to build a school or a church near a dry wash will \nhave to beg for EPA's permission. The EPA can even go after property \nowners if the Agency thinks water historically flowed across their \nland, even when there is no visible evidence.\n  Ultimately, water is the last thing the EPA will be worried about \nonce their clean water rule becomes effective; they will be drowning in \nlawsuits.\n  Another proposed rule by the EPA--the ``Clean Power Plan rule''--\nwould place new limits on greenhouse gas emissions that would prevent \nthe use of coal and result in the elimination of 36 percent of \nArizona's electric power generation. Of course, the billions of dollars \nthat would be needed to comply with the plan would be passed on to \nconsumers. Estimates are that utility rates could increase up to 13 \npercent in Arizona. If you are a small business owner and you don't \nhave the luxury to pass on these costs, this dramatic increase in your \nutility bill could prevent replacing old equipment or hiring new \nemployees or otherwise expanding your business.\n  In addition to being a job killer, this rule will impact Arizona's \nwater supply, which in many cases is moved through the State by energy \nderived from coal-fired plants, negatively affecting consumers and \ncommerce throughout the State.\n  This rule also threatens default on hundreds of millions of dollars \nin taxpayer-backed USDA rural utility service loans around the country \nwhich are critical to providing rural residents with affordable energy \nand reliable, good-paying jobs.\n  Another rule, which would revise ozone regulations, may also \ndisproportionately impact Arizona, especially her rural communities. \nFailing to acknowledge qualities unique to Arizona regarding ozone \nconcentrations in the State--for example, altitude, topography, \nlightning, and wildfires--this rule would undermine the State's \ncontinuing attractiveness to business by creating construction \nrestrictions, permitting delays, and reduced Federal transportation \nfunding.\n  So what can be done about all of this? Well, that depends. For those\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\nrules that have been finalized, we can start looking at legislatively \nrepealing them, as a bill Senator Flake and I recently sponsored would \ndo with the clean water rule, or we can pass resolutions of disapproval \nunder the Congressional Review Act to help bring public attention to \nthem. For those rules that haven't been finalized yet, we can consider \nincluding riders in appropriations bills to disrupt their \nimplementation.\n  Madam President, we need to be very clear on what is going on here. \nThese regulations don't represent a good-faith effort by President \nObama to work with Congress to legislate transparently with care and \nacuity to help the States ensure the health, welfare, and safety of our \ncitizens; rather, like the President's Executive order on immigration, \nthey are an example of his insistence on using his ``pen and phone'' to \nunconstitutionally and unilaterally forge a legacy--a legacy that will, \nin fact, have a chilling impact on economic growth and prosperity.\n  The fact is, after years of economic recession, the Arizona economy \nis showing signs of recovery. But with Arizona's growing slower than \nthe rest of the country, with only a 1.1-percent increase in real gross \nState product compared to 2.2 nationwide and 65,500 fewer people \nworking in Arizona compared to 8 years ago, Washington has to be \nfocused on doing everything it can to unburden small business owners \nand promote entrepreneurialism. These regulations would do just the \nopposite.\n  For these reasons, it will be important for all Arizonans and all \naffected Americans to make their concern and outrage heard. For \nArizona, Senator Flake and I join our colleagues representing other \naffected States and will continue to exercise our constitutional \noversight prerogative to keep the Executive in check and help educate \nthe American people about what is coming and how it will affect all of \nus.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Arizona Republic's editorials on this issue that appeared \nyesterday and on June 30, 2015; the op-ed from me and Senator Flake in \nthe Arizona Republic entitled ``We're standing up against regulation-\nhappy Obama''; the two oversight letters we recently sent relevant \nAgency heads on the Clean Power Plan rule and the clean water rule; and \nthe op-ed from Arizona Chamber of Commerce president Glenn Hamer in the \nYuma Sun entitled ``List of examples of federal overregulation is way \ntoo long.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From The Republic, July 26, 2015]\n\n          New EPA Clean-Air Rules Threaten Rural Power Co-ops\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n\n  Our View: Coal is on the way out, but the feds need to acknowledge \n                               economics.\n\n       By this fall, the federal Environmental Protection Agency \n     is expected to march the nation's energy consumers into new \n     territory on the frontier of controlling carbon emissions.\n       Representatives of the big power companies are flooding \n     Washington, D.C., in a desperate effort to mitigate the \n     impact of the EPA's venture, known as the Clean Power Plan.\n       Debates between environmental activists and politicians \n     over its implications are heating up.\n       But few have looked at the EPA's new carbon plan with quite \n     the riveted sense of alarm as small utility companies that \n     serve rural customers.\n       The president of a small cooperative serving rural \n     customers in Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada is blunt about \n     that impact:\n       ``The people throughout rural Arizona that we serve will be \n     screwed more than anybody else in the country,'' Patrick \n     Ledger, CEO of the Arizona Generation and Transmission \n     Cooperatives, told the Environment and Energy news service.\n       Unless the EPA's plan includes substantial revisions. \n     Ledger is not exaggerating.\n       His energy co-op, serving some 500,000 rural customers, \n     operates one natural-gas-fired and two coal-fired units at \n     the Apache Generating Station in southeastern Arizona.\n       One of the coal-fired units is scheduled to convert to gas \n     in 2018 to accommodate recent EPA rules governing haze. But \n     under the draft plan proposed by the EPA, the co-op would be \n     forced to shutter its coal-fired unit altogether, stranding \n     around $230 million in recent upgrades and investment.\n       In addition, the co-op would have to take on between $450 \n     million and $600 million in additional debt to rebuild \n     capacity to serve its customers.\n       All told, that would push the price of the energy Ledger's \n     cooperative sells to distributive cooperatives to 38 percent \n     above market rates. And that, says Ledger, spells the end.\n       ``We will be put out of business,'' Ledger told the \n     Republic editorial board last week. We go into bankruptcy.''\n       Arizona Generation's debt is owed to another federal \n     agency. Repeat this story with multiple rural co-ops, and \n     taxpayers will be stuck with an enormous bill.\n       Ledger and his colleagues understand that coal's future is \n     limited, so they are lobbying the EPA to give the nation's \n     100 smallest utilities more flexibility in meeting the carbon \n     goals.\n       Ledger doesn't hold much hope for that, so he's also \n     working with Arizona's other utilities. This state faced the \n     most ambitious goal to reduce carbon under the draft plan; \n     utilities are urging the EPA to give them a longer glide path \n     to ease the transition away from coal.\n       Concerns over enormous amounts of stranded debt is a near-\n     universal one as the Clean Power Plan approaches.\n       Arizona's major utility companies, including Salt River \n     Project and Arizona Public Service Co., recently invested \n     hundreds of millions of dollars to bring their coal-fired \n     plants into compliance with existing EPA regulations.\n       Much of that investment will be lost if the EPA does not \n     revise the draconian carbon reductions written into the Clean \n     Power Plan, much of which the agency expects to occur no \n     later than 2020.\n       A battle among giants, the debate over the Clean Power Plan \n     is scarcely considering the dire consequences for little-guy \n     energy providers like the Arizona Generation and Transmission \n     Cooperatives.\n       It needs to start.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From The Republic, June 30, 2015]\n\n            We Have the Right To Know Cost of New EPA Rules\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n\n our view: how much will new carbon rules cost you? the supreme court \n               says taxpayers should be able to find out\n\n       Within months, maybe weeks, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency will release new rules governing carbon dioxide \n     emissions from energy plants.\n       The rules will constitute the most sweeping assertion ever \n     of the EPA's regulatory power. And it is only the beginning. \n     The EPA in the fall is expected to alter its standard for \n     what constitutes unhealthy ground-level ozone pollution, \n     which would require significant, economy-wide investment in \n     ozone-pollution control measures.\n       That's a lot of unprecedented action. This would be a good \n     time for an honest talk about the balance between the costs \n     of these policies and their benefits.\n       The Supreme Court is strongly suggesting that conversation \n     take place.\n       In a 5-4 vote, the high court on Monday said the EPA must \n     reconsider a rule governing mercury emissions, mostly from \n     coal-fired power plants, because it did not weigh the costs \n     and benefits of the rule change before issuing it. The rule \n     is estimated to cost $9.6 billion annually.\n       The decision is considered a setback for the Obama \n     administration's all-but acknowledged mission to retire the \n     majority of the nation's coal-fired electric plants.\n       But not necessarily a major setback. The court's decision \n     does not throw out the mercury-emissions standards. It just \n     requires the agency to recalculate the rule while considering \n     more closely the price tag of implementing it.\n       Most importantly, it leaves the EPA in charge of \n     determining anticipated costs and benefits.\n       In the coming debate over the EPA's Clean Power Plan \n     mandates, Arizonans deserve to know exactly what \n     environmental benefits they are getting and whether the costs \n     of implementing these new emissions standards are reasonable.\n       The EPA's self-analysis of the costs and benefits of its \n     mercury-pollution rule, however, suggests an honest report \n     may not be in the cards.\n       According to the EPA, its mercury emissions rule would cost \n     the energy industry (which is to say, consumers) $9.6 billion \n     annually. That figure, however, doesn't take into account \n     significant factors like the higher costs of additional \n     borrowing the industry would have to incur, or the potential \n     economic drag.\n       NERA Economic Consulting of Washington, D.C., calculated \n     the rule's annual cost at $16 billion.\n       However, the EPA gets really creative in naming the \n     ledger's benefits.\n       According to the EPA's figures, the mercury rule generates \n     a direct economic benefit of less than $7 million annually. \n     Part of that is derived from the 15 percent of pregnant women \n     in Wisconsin the agency assumes catch and eat at least 300 \n     pounds of lake fish per year.\n       The EPA also calculated that secondary impacts of the \n     mercury rule--infinitely more malleable ``improvements to the \n     public health''--would boost it's ``economic'' value to \n     between $24 billion and $80 billion per year.\n       Bingo. Economic justification.\n       We are talking about a significant financial investment to \n     achieve far less impressive results.\n       As long as the EPA is in control of economically certifying \n     its own rules, it will be\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\n     impossible to seriously judge whether the upcoming Clean \n     Power Plan emissions rules are justified. That stands in \n     opposition to the court's direction.\n       In Monday's Michigan vs. EPA decision, the high court's \n     majority concluded that federal administrative agencies ``are \n     required to engage in `reasoned decision-making.' ''\n       That means honestly assessing costs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From The Republic, July 11, 2015]\n\n            We're Standing Up Against Regulation-Happy Obama\n\n                    (By John McCain and Jeff Flake)\n\n\n senators: this administration intends to rewrite environmental policy \n                      with no thought to the costs\n\n       A few days ago, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a victory \n     for businesses and consumers when it turned back the Obama \n     administration's regulate-at-all-cost proposal for \n     controlling power plant emissions.\n       In Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency, the court \n     held that the EPA failed to consider the potentially \n     exorbitant cost its regulation would impose on the economy. \n     The EPA's rationale? The costs are ``irrelevant'' to the \n     decision to regulate.\n       We strongly disagree.\n       This is one of several new regulations the White House has \n     imposed over the past two years with no regard for how \n     businesses really operate. According to the American Action \n     Forum, 37 major regulations the White House recently \n     announced it is planning on releasing will saddle the \n     nation's recovering economy with more than $110 billion in \n     potential costs--hardly ``irrelevant.''\n       If left unchecked, those regulations will unfairly impact \n     Arizonans and, according to the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, \n     ``cause significant economic harm to our state.''\n       One of the most alarming new regulations is the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's so-called Waters of the \n     United States Rule. The EPA claims the rule protects only \n     waters that ``have historically been covered by the Clean \n     Water Act'' and that it ``protects clean water without \n     getting in the way of farming, ranching, and forestry.''\n       But, dive into the rules 299 pages and you'll find it \n     actually enshrines the EPA's authority to regulate nearly \n     everything that is considered a ``tributary,'' including \n     irrigation ditches and dry desert washes.\n       While this rule was supposed to be based on science, there \n     are glaring omissions in how Arizona's arid landscape was \n     considered. An analysis of U.S. Geological Survey stream maps \n     projects that Arizona would see a 200 percent increase in \n     river miles subject to the EPA's jurisdiction.\n       This is bad news for Arizona's agriculture and home-\n     building sectors, which are vital to the state's economy. The \n     federal government could block farmers from building or \n     repairing canals, communities from building schools or \n     churches near dry washes, or even private property owners \n     from developing on their own land if the agency believes \n     water historically flowed there, despite no visible evidence \n     that it still does.\n       When this massive regulatory expansion becomes effective, \n     Arizonans will be drowning in consultants' fees and lawyers \n     bills. We have introduced legislation halting this rule until \n     the scientific analysis of intermittent and ephemeral streams \n     is complete.\n       We are also pushing back against the federal government's \n     water grab in other ways. Recently, the Forest Service \n     formally withdrew its groundwater directive, something we \n     asked it to do last October. For now, at least, private \n     property rights that could have been impacted by that rule \n     are safe.\n       But another proposed rule by the EPA, the ``Clean Power \n     Plan,'' would place new limits on greenhouse gas emissions, \n     including preventing the use of coal, which produces 36 \n     percent of Arizona's electric power generation. The billions \n     of dollars necessary to comply with this plan would be passed \n     on to consumers through increased utility rates.\n       This rule will most negatively impact those least able to \n     afford such a rate hike. Likewise, small-business owners who \n     don't have the luxury of passing on dramatic utility-price \n     increases could have trouble replacing old equipment or \n     hiring employees.\n       These regulations are not intended to bolster our economy \n     or get Arizonans back to work. They are an assertion of \n     executive power by a president intent on rewriting \n     environmental policy, not a thoughtful attempt to help states \n     ensure the health, welfare and safety of their citizens.\n       It is essential that those of us who represent Arizona in \n     Congress exercise our constitutional oversight prerogative to \n     keep the executive branch in check, and to help educate \n     Americans about what's coming and how it will affect us all.\n       Given what is at stake here, we certainly will.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Gina McCarthy,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Tom Vilsack,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Shaun Donovan,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator McCarthy, Secretary Vilsack, and \n     Director Donovan, We write to express deep concern with \n     President Obama's attempt to bypass Congress and commandeer \n     the state regulatory process to impose unduly burdensome \n     carbon-emissions regulations at existing power plants; the \n     so-called Clean Power Plan (CPP). Our fear is that the CPP \n     would create significant technological and economic \n     challenges that disproportionately affect Arizonans.\n       As proposed, the CPP would force Arizona, unlike almost any \n     other state, to achieve a 52% reduction in its carbon-\n     emissions by 2030, with nearly 90% of that reduction \n     (equivalent to re-dispatching all of Arizona's coal-fired \n     baseload generation) coming within five years. The plan \n     effectively ignores Arizona's zero-emission nuclear asset, \n     Palo Verde Generating Station, and gives little credit for \n     the widespread deployment of renewable technology throughout \n     the state. Instead, the plan charges head long toward \n     dictating Arizona's resource portfolio and regulating beyond \n     the fence line.\n       Shrouded by the veil of choice, EPA contends that Arizona \n     can use a combination of options (aka ``building blocks'') to \n     achieve these targets. In reality, the CPP treats Arizona so \n     harshly that it would be compelled to maximize the use of all \n     its building block ``options'' just to comply with the rule. \n     This is hardly a choice. Rather, as explained by Harvard law \n     professor Laurence Tribe, the proposed plan would effectively \n     dictate the energy mix in each state, allowing a federal \n     commandeering of state governments and violating principles \n     of federalism that are basic to our constitutional order.\n       As an example, EPA expects Arizona to redispatch coal-fired \n     generation almost entirely with increased natural gas \n     generation. Yet, EPA ignores that more than half of the \n     state's existing natural gas capacity is merchant capacity, \n     not owned by Arizona utilities. Moreover, Arizona's natural \n     gas generating units are often used to manage the diverse \n     energy portfolio, including renewable supplies, meaning that \n     increased baseload use of those resources limits their \n     ability to assist with intermittent generation. Mistakenly, \n     EPA assumes that Arizona can quickly transition from coal \n     generation to natural gas generation by making greater use of \n     existing natural gas facilities. The EPA is not taking into \n     consideration the peak customer energy demands the state \n     requires in the summer months or the current natural gas \n     infrastructure in place.\n       Converting coal resources to natural gas will also leave \n     millions of dollars in stranded assets in which plants are \n     forced to close before their useful life. As you are well \n     aware, utilities throughout the state have recently \n     retrofitted a number of these units to comply with other EPA \n     regulations, such as the regional haze rule. It is \n     unreasonable for EPA to compel utilities and their ratepayers \n     to comply with one rule, only to render those investments \n     wasted just a couple of years later under a different rule.\n       Utilities and pipeline providers would, therefore, be \n     forced to spend billions of dollars on new energy \n     infrastructure which could take years to plan, implement, and \n     negotiate. The state's year-round energy needs simply cannot \n     be replaced by natural gas-fired plants in time for the CPP's \n     2020 interim deadline.\n       As the Supreme Court recently found, these types of \n     economic issues are not ``irrelevant'' to the rulemaking \n     process. They must be considered, rather than marginalized. \n     And, in this case, it is not simply the stranded cost of \n     investing in new emissions technology or the increased rates; \n     it is also the impact on other areas of the state's economy, \n     such as water deliveries that depend on energy. An increase \n     in water-delivery costs, particularly during the ongoing \n     drought, will only serve to further harm consumers.\n       This situation is no doubt exacerbated by the possibility \n     that taxpayers could also pay more for this rule, as it \n     threatens to cause default on over $250 million in taxpayer-\n     backed Rural Utilities Service (RUS) loans in Arizona. But, \n     Arizona's coal plants, including those with expensive air \n     pollution controls, will not operate long enough under the \n     CPP to pay these loans back. Shuttering Arizona's coal plants \n     before their useful life is completed will challenge rural \n     electric cooperative's ability to pay back those loans.\n       In an effort to address many of these concerns, on December \n     1, 2014, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality \n     (ADEQ) in concert with the Arizona Utility Group, proposed a \n     compliance plan that would work for Arizona. They suggested \n     narrowly modifying EPA's CPP to allow newer, more efficient \n     coal-fired power plants to continue to fully operate after \n     2030. This more gradual plan would ensure that investments in \n     expensive emission control technologies will not be stranded \n     and that the CPP's impact on Arizonans will be mitigated.\n       With the proposed final rule currently pending before OMB, \n     we would appreciate your consideration of the Arizona Utility \n     Group proposal and our concerns, as well as a written \n     response to the following questions no later than July 27, \n     2015:\n       1. What cost-benefit analysis was conducted in connection \n     with the Administration's decision to go forward with this \n     rule? Specifically, what is the expected aggregate economic \n     impact of this rule on Arizona businesses and consumers?\n       2.

Gina McCarthy,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Pennsylvania \n         Ave. NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator McCarthy: I'm writing concerning the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water Rule that \n     was signed on May 27, 2015. As you know, I've written you \n     before opposing the rule and I've cosponsored several bills \n     in the Senate to block it because of the damage it will \n     inflict on job creation and economic recovery in Arizona.\n       The Clean Water Rule will extend Clean Water Act \n     jurisdiction to roughly 60-percent of all ``waters of the \n     United States,'' effectively allowing EPA to regulate small \n     streams like it currently does large rivers. But the rule can \n     also apply to ephemeral streams, irrigation ditches, stock \n     ponds, and even dry desert washes that are common in Arizona. \n     As such, the rule disproportionately impacts Arizona farmers, \n     cattlemen, developers and other key sectors of Arizona's \n     economy historically and moving forward into the 21st \n     century. Please bear in mind that agriculture makes up about \n     30-percent of the economy in my home state, and that \n     construction jobs account for roughly 13-percent of new jobs \n     created in Arizona during the economic recovery.\n       In recent years, the EPA has, unfortunately, succeeded in \n     building a track record of unilaterally reinventing federal \n     statutes, like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, to \n     advance politically-sensational regulations. What follows is \n     not genuine environmental protection, which is vitally \n     important, but a stigmatization of EPA and its restrictive \n     regulations, which are criticized and then litigated for \n     their blatant disregard for their economic harmfulness. This \n     pattern recently forced the hand of the Supreme Court in \n     Michigan et al. v Environmental Protection Agency, in which \n     it rejected EPA's new rule on mercury and air toxic Standards \n     because the agency had not justified the economic cost-\n     benefit of the rule.\n       Against this backdrop, I respectfully request that you \n     respond to the following questions:\n       1. Explain on what basis the EPA has concluded that its \n     economic-impact analysis for the final Clean Water Rule \n     determined that this rule is ``appropriate and necessary?''\n       2. What economic-impact analysis, if any, did the EPA \n     conduct in connection with the Clean Water Rule that took \n     into account Arizona businesses and consumers in particular?\n       3. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Michigan et al. \n     v EPA, do you believe EPA sufficiently calculated the rule's \n     cost considering that the Small Business Administration's \n     Office of Advocacy's requested that the EPA withdraw the rule \n     because it ``will have a direct and potentially costly impact \n     on small business'' and requested further review by the SBA? \n     Please explain your answer.\n       Thank you for your attention to this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Yuma Sun: Opinion, June 24, 2015]\n\n  Guest Column: List of Examples of Federal Overregulation Is Way Too \n                                  Long\n\n                            (By Glenn Hamer)\n\n       During an address before a joint session of the Indiana \n     State Legislature, Ronald Reagan once quipped, ``If the \n     Federal Government had been around when the Creator was \n     putting His hand to this State, Indiana wouldn't be here. \n     It'd still be waiting for an environmental impact \n     statement.'' These remarks were from a speech given in 1982, \n     and although tongue-in-cheek, their meaning unfortunately \n     still rings true 33 years later.\n       The federal government continues to roll out rules and \n     regulations that are often overly burdensome and unnecessary. \n     This has a particularly chilling effect on business and \n     economic growth. What's more, the Arizona business community \n     is increasingly concerned that the regulatory agenda of the \n     current administration unfairly impacts Arizona, and has the \n     potential to cause significant economic harm to our state.\n       Last week I sent a letter to Sen. John McCain outlining \n     five federal rules, primarily driven by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA), that illustrate this concern:\n       First up, the EPA's carbon emission rule for electric power \n     plants. In this proposed rule, the EPA has assigned Arizona \n     one of the most stringent reduction goals in the country--52 \n     percent carbon emission reduction by 2030, with an aggressive \n     interim goal to achieve more than three-quarters of that \n     reduction by 2020. Arizona's utilities would need to retire a \n     majority of the coal-fired generating facilities in the state \n     to meet this goal, This transition is not economically \n     feasible and would threaten the reliability of Arizona's \n     electricity supply.\n       Next, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \n     issued a final rule changing the definition of ``waters of \n     the United States,'' under the Clean Water Act. This brings \n     vast swaths of land under the federal government's \n     jurisdiction and disproportionately impacts Arizona as a \n     result of our unique landscape and infrastructure. For \n     example, Arizona's canal systems, drainage systems, ditches, \n     and private property will be subject to federal government \n     control, which limits our ability to manage water allocation \n     and usage locally. According to a recent economic analysis, \n     our system of canals is responsible for 30 percent of \n     Arizona's gross state product, yet the EPA found the \n     definitional change would ``not have a significant economic \n     impact.''\n       The EPA is also considering a rule that would lower the air \n     quality standard for ozone. Under the EPA's proposed range, \n     the entire state of Arizona stands to be classified as a non-\n     attainment area. Such a designation brings significant \n     consequences, including permitting delays, restrictions on \n     construction, and threats to our federal transportation \n     funding, all of which will undoubtedly make it more difficult \n     for Arizona to attract and retain businesses.\n       Arizona is further disadvantaged by these environmental \n     regulations because of the cost of proving so-called \n     ``exceptional events'' and their frequency in our state. As \n     we all know, Arizona is home to frequent dust storms during \n     the summer months. These exceptional events occur regularly \n     in Arizona and contribute to artificially poor air quality \n     readings. Under the EPA's current Exceptional Events Rule, a \n     state can be subject to a non-attainment designation and \n     other significant consequences unless it can prove that a \n     poor air quality reading is the result of an exceptional \n     event.\n       Finally, the federal Endangered Species Act lists hundreds \n     of species as endangered or threatened, many dozens in \n     Arizona. This results in high costs to industry by hindering \n     development and economic growth and imposing exorbitant \n     compliance costs even when the designation does not give an \n     accurate picture of the species' status.\n       Government regulation and oversight serves an important \n     purpose. However, the federal government has a responsibility \n     to ensure the regulations it promulgates are fair, equally \n     applied, and result in an articulable benefit. Recent \n     environmental regulations demonstrate a failure to recognize \n     the limits of federal authority and to meaningfully engage \n     the states to develop regulatory schemes that safeguard \n     public health and safety, acknowledge the unique qualities of \n     the individual states, and support a robust and growing \n     economy.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, last week a terrible tragedy occurred \nin Lafayette, LA, when a mentally ill gunman opened fire in a movie \ntheater filled with innocent people.\n  Jillian Johnson was a talented artist, successful entrepreneur, and \nan active member of the Lafayette community. Jillian played in a local \nall-female band, co-owned a gift and toy shop, and often organized \ncommunity projects that benefited all. She was a kind and charitable \nsoul, described by her husband as a loving friend, daughter, sister, \nand wife.\n  Mayci Breaux was an incredible young lady with a bright future ahead \nof her. A student of Louisiana State University, Mayci was studying to \nbe a medical radiology technician and was engaged to her high school \nsweetheart, planning to marry after she graduated. Mayci worked at a \nlocal fashion boutique, where her customers and coworkers remember her \ngenerous smile and wonderful optimism.\n  These two women exemplify the kindness and essence of the Lafayette \ncommunity. Although they were taken from us far too quickly, their \nmemories live on.\n  Let's also take a moment to thank the heroes in this tragedy--the \nLafayette police, Acadian Ambulance, the employees of the Grand 16 \nmovie theater, and other first responders who acted bravely and quickly \nto stop the shooter and aid the injured. We are grateful for their \nservice, and we honor them today.\n  I also acknowledge by name Jena Meaux and Ali Martin. Their quick\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\nthinking and courageousness saved lives when they crawled across the \nmovie theater floor to pull the fire alarm to alert authorities.\n  Lafayette and Louisiana are resilient. In times of tragedy and pain, \nwe come together to support and care for one another. The love we have \nfor each other, even in the darkest of times, will help Lafayette, our \nState, and our community recover.\n  The events that transpired in Lafayette last week are a reminder of \nthe long road we must take to reform our mental health system. Too many \ninnocent lives are being taken from us in senseless attacks in movie \ntheaters, schools, churches, and other places where we should feel \nsafe. The common denominator in these tragedies is all too often \nuntreated mental illness.\n  As public servants, we should seek to keep the public safe, but our \nmental health system is badly broken and fails to do so, and reforms \nare coming too slowly. It doesn't make sense that parents caring for a \nmentally ill child cannot be part of medical decisionmaking that could \nprevent horrendous tragedies like these. I can go down the list of \nreforms that need to be made to improve our mental health system. I am \nworking with my good friend Senator Chris Murphy on legislation that \nwill help reform our mental health system and make it easier for those \nin need to get the help that could potentially avert a future tragedy \nlike this.\n  I finish by saying once more that our thoughts and prayers are with \nthe families and loved ones of Jillian and Mayci and all those wounded \nwho are suffering. May they know God's comfort at a time when it may be \notherwise impossible for them to feel comforted.\n  I yield to my fellow Senator and good friend, Senator Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor sadly, in \nlight of this tragedy, to join my colleague Senator Cassidy in \nexpressing these heartfelt thoughts. We rise today to express our \ndeepest sympathy for the victims of this horrible shooting in \nLafayette. The hearts of all of Lafayette and Louisiana go out to all \nof the families involved in this tragic incident.\n  As Senator Cassidy suggested, we lost two enormously talented, \nunique, and irreplaceable individuals, and we certainly pay tribute to \nthem.\n  As Senator Cassidy suggested, Mayci was a student at Louisiana State \nUniversity, full of life, full of hope, full of promise. She was \nstudying to become an ultrasound and radiology technician. She was \nscheduled to begin her training just a few days after her tragic death. \nShe was at the movies with her boyfriend, Matthew Rodriguez, who was \namong the nine wounded.\n  Jillian was the owner of Parish Ink, a T-shirt printing company \nspecializing in old Acadiana verities. She and her husband also owned \nthe Red Arrow Workshop, a gift and toy shop in Lafayette. She also was \nfull of life, full of talent, full of vigor and happiness. She played \nthe ukulele and guitar for The Figs, an all-female sextet from \nLafayette.\n  These are two individuals who are completely irreplaceable, and they \nwill be sorely missed.\n  I also join Senator Cassidy in recognizing and thanking the heroic \nactions of those two teachers from Jeanerette High School in Iberia \nParish, Jena Meaux and Ali Martin. According to several reports, Ali \njumped in front of Jena to shield her from the shooting, very likely \nsaving her life; it caused the bullet to hit Jena's leg instead of \nAli's head. Ali was shot in the leg in the process. Despite her \ninjuries, Jena courageously pulled the fire alarm, alerting the whole \nmovie theater and certainly saving lives. So we pay tribute and \nremember them as well.\n  We also pause and remember and continue praying for the recovery of \nnine other individuals who were wounded in that horrible incident: I \nmentioned Matthew Rodriguez, the boyfriend of Mayci Breaux; Morgan \nJulia Egedahl; Dwight ``Bo'' Ramsey and his wife Gerry--cousins of \nCongressman Boustany, by the way, and good friends of mine and Senator \nCassidy's; Ali Viator Martin, an English teacher at Jeanerette Senior \nHigh School, and Jena Legnon Meaux, whom I mentioned as true heroes in \nthis incident.\n  On Saturday evening, Lafayette residents gathered downtown to honor \nparticularly the two victims who lost their lives. During the vigil, \none Lafayette resident certainly stated it well:\n\n       We can't let evil win. We as a community have to rise above \n     that and move forward.\n\n  Well, we do, but as we do, Senator Cassidy and I rise today to honor \nthe victims, to remember them--particularly Mayci and Jillian--and to \ncertainly recommit ourselves to the important work at hand, including \nregarding mental illness, as Senator Cassidy suggested.\n  We have prepared a Senate resolution commemorating the victims of \nthis horrible event.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of S. Res. 231, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 231) honoring the memory and legacy \n     of the two Louisiana citizens who lost their lives, \n     recognizing the heroism of first responders and those on the \n     scene, and condemning the attack of July 23, 2015, in \n     Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 231) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, again, we all hold these families, \nparticularly the two victims and their families, in our prayers and our \ncontinuing thoughts and our love. It was a horrible incident. But I \nknow the community of Lafayette well, I know the State well, and it \ncertainly will not stop with the pure tragedy. Certainly folks will \nhold up these families in love and support and prayer and work toward \nfar better resolution of issues involved, as the one Senator Cassidy \nmentioned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5907-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5907-S5919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015--Continued\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I see there is kind of a lull here. We \nare waiting around for a vote to take place at 10 or 10:30 tonight, I \nthink it is, and I thought I would share.\n  There are still some uncertainties on the bill, the Transportation \nreauthorization bill. It is one I am very proud to be the author of. In \nfact, I was privileged to be the author the last long-term \nreauthorization in 2005. At that time, I was working very closely with \nsomeone, with a fellow Member who is the least likely to be working \nwith me on anything. By her own admission, Senator Boxer is a very \nproud liberal and I am a very proud conservative, but we do agree there \nis that old, worn-out document that nobody reads anymore called the \nConstitution, and it tells us what we are supposed to be doing here. It \nsays, defend America and build our roads and bridges. That is what we \nare doing. That is what this is all about.\n  We received a disturbing message from the House about an hour ago \nsaying they would not take up our bill. We are going to pass this bill, \nbut they say they are not going to take it up. That means there is a \ndilemma because at the end of this month, there is no longer any money \nin the highway trust fund, and things will stop.\n  I don't know whether their intention is to give a short-term \nextension and go home or--of course, I am still thinking brighter minds \nwill prevail and they will realize we have a long-term, 6-year highway \nauthorization bill because the things you can't do in this\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\ncountry, you can't do with the short-term extensions.\n  Yesterday, I listed many of the bridges that were in terrible shape \nand the fact that we could not address those problems unless we pass a \nlong-term highway reauthorization bill. I mentioned also that someone I \nknew--it was right around the 2005 bill--a mother and three children \nwere driving under a bridge in Oklahoma City. It was far out of its \nextended life, its warranty period, if you will, and a chunk of \nconcrete fell off and killed her. This is happening all over America. \nWe saw what happened in Minnesota when that disaster occurred, all the \npictures of the people who died and were injured.\n  We are going to be looking at a lot of amendments. I heard there is \none amendment that Senator Manchin along with Senator Boozman are \nputting together to adopt the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2, which is \nappropriate. It may not be as germane as we would like it to be, but it \nis still transportation.\n  The Pilot's Bill of Rights 1 was passed 2 years ago. In fact, they \nwould not even take it up in committee, but I had 67 cosponsors to the \nbill. I was very thankful at that time. Of course, the Democrats were \nin the majority. I went to Harry Reid's office and said: It doesn't \nseem fair to me that we have 67 cosponsors, and they will not even take \nit up in the committee.\n  He said: Well, that isn't right.\n  We came down to the floor, we rule XIV'd it, and passed it. It does \nshow that sometimes when things get really outrageous, people tend to \nwork together. That was on an issue that just a handful of people are \naware of, but anyone who is a licensed pilot knows, in their minds, \nthat was the most significant thing that was going on.\n  I have been flying for a lot more years than most people in this \nChamber have been alive. Because I have been an active pilot--I have \nbeen in aviation for many years--the people who have problems with the \nFAA would come to me to help them with their problems. I found this to \nbe true back when I was mayor of Tulsa. We had a police force, a very \ngood police force. There are a few bad guys who get in there. The same \nthing is true with the FAA. You have a few people who take advantage of \nthe power they have and take licenses away from people.\n  I remember 10 years ago, Bob Hoover--I bet none of you ever heard of \nBob Hoover. Bob Hoover was arguably the best pilot in the history of \naviation. He had a Shrike. A Shrike is a twin-engine Aero Commander. He \nwould put a glass of water on the dash, and he would start doing barrel \nrolls and would not spill his glass of water. I would do barrel rolls, \nbut I would spill my glass of water. This guy was really good.\n  There was an inspection in the field, and Bob Hoover lost his pilot's \nlicense. There was no reason for it. In order to get it back, I \nactually had to go to the floor, and it took a year to pass legislation \nthat would stop that abuse from going on. That has continued. I have \nalways helped people until it happened to me, and then that had a whole \nnew feeling because people who are involved in aviation--the one thing \nthey don't want to lose is their pilot's license.\n  For many years, I was a builder and developer in South Padre Island, \nTX. We are on the east coast now. Nobody knows where Texas is here. \nThey think there is no such thing as a nice coast with beaches and all \nof that unless it is on the east coast, but there is the Padre Island \narea of Texas. It has beautiful beaches.\n  I was in the building business. We built condos and townhouses, and I \nalways enjoyed that. Keep in mind this is the southern tip of Texas. It \nis just as far south as Key West, FL, is, but it is in the middle of \nthe country. We would go down there. I would fly my plane probably once \na week for quite a number of years. I went down, and I was making a \nnormal landing. It is not a controlled field. You have your approach \ncontrols that control it. The approach control from valley approach--I \nam getting a little technical here, but I have a reason for telling \nthis story.\n\n  He said: All right, you are clear to land on runway 1-3 in Cameron \nCounty. I went up to land. Just before I touched down, with six \npassengers--so it was too late for a go-around--I saw that there were a \nbunch of people working on the runway. There wasn't a big X on the \nrunway, which is required. They claimed there was. They quickly painted \none on right after that.\n  Everyone started criticizing me. I remember there was a front-page \ncartoon in the New York Times. Everyone was having a good time with \nthat. The bottom line is, I didn't do anything. They claimed there was \na NOTAM. That is short for Notice to Airmen. The Notice to Airmen says \nthat if you check your notice before you land on the field, you will \nfind out if there is construction on the runway, if lights are out or \nsomething else. Of course, we did that. There was no NOTAM. They \nclaimed there was a NOTAM--the FAA did. They never could find it.\n  Anyway, to bring us up-to-date, I introduced and we passed the \nPilot's Bill of Rights. In our system, our legal holdout was where you \nare guilty until you are proven innocent if you are a pilot. That is \nthe last--because one man's accusation can turn into the revocation of \na license, so we introduced the Pilot's Bill of Rights. We gave an \nopportunity, if they disagree with the FAA, if an accusation is made--\nor the NTSB--they can go to the Federal district court. That seemed to \nwork out.\n  The bill forced the FAA to put NOTAMs in one secure place where \neverybody would have access to it, and all of these complaints that \nwere made were dealt with, but a lot of the things we wanted to happen \nwouldn't happen.\n  In case you are wondering--I will take it off now since there is no \nreason to keep it on. Do you know what that is? That is the pass to get \ninto Oshkosh. The Chair knows this because the Chair's husband has an \nFBO operation in Western Iowa. Anyway, I have gone to the largest \naviation event worldwide in Oshkosh. It is the last weekend of July of \nevery year. I have been to every one of those, along with my sons, for \n36 years. I never missed one. I didn't miss one last week either. Some \nthings are really important.\n  I went there with the idea that we have the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 \nin order to correct the areas where the FAA is either not complying \nwith the intent of the law or even the Federal district courts are not \naccepting cases. We are going to correct that.\n  First of all, if it happens that Senator Manchin and Senator Boozman \noffer their amendments, then I will be supporting their amendments. I \nam going to go over why it is important, but if as a result of the \nannouncement that was made by the House of Representatives 2 hours ago \nwe are not going to be having amendments, it is still introduced as a \nfreestanding bill. I have 56 cosponsors. That is a lot of cosponsors. \nIf that happens, I want to mention a couple of things that are on here.\n  There is a problem with the third-class medical. So 10 years ago, a \ndecision was made, and it was a good decision. They took the light \naircraft, and they said if you can drive a car, you can fly an \nairplane. They went ahead, and we have had 10 years' experience now \nwithout a third-class medical certificate. There has not been one \naccident in 10 years where it was due to the fact that they didn't have \nany third-class medical certificates.\n  In this bill, we are taking that up to include a larger number of \npilots, and to include airplanes as heavy as 6,000 pounds, carrying six \npassengers, not exceeding 250 knots, and several requirements like that \nin giving them the same opportunities the pilots of the light aircraft \nhave. That is a part of this bill. I know there are a lot of people in \nthis Chamber because I have talked with them, not a whole lot because \nwe have 56 cosponsors, but there are a lot of them who really believe \nthat would somehow be dangerous. For that purpose, we have made several \nexceptions to it. I will outline these because I know there are some \nMembers of this body that if this comes up as an amendment, they need \nto know this.\n  First of all, on a third-class medical, we have the requirement for \nan online medical education course every 2 years. This will make sure \nthe pilots coming up for renewal of their certificate are up-to-date on \nall of the new things that have transpired since the last time in the \nnew medical requirements.\n  The second thing it does is anyone who is a new pilot just coming on, \nhe has to have a thorough examination that now you have to have every \ncouple of years. That hasn't changed.\n\n  And then the third would be the self-certification that takes place \nevery 5\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\nyears, which could actually be done with your own doctor. Those are \nsome of the changes that have been made to make it a little bit easier \nfor some Senators who will be voting on this legislation.\n  The second area where the Pilot's Bill of Rights did not--they \naddressed it, but there are two Federal judges. You are supposed to be \nable to go from the FAA to the NTSB, the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, and then to the Federal District Court. What has happened in the \npast is that the NTSB has rubberstamped anything the FAA does, so \nreally the FAA is making those decisions without proper due course \nwhich other people are entitled to.\n  What we have done with this is--there are a couple of Federal judges \nwho said they are not going to take a case on a pilot until they have \nexhausted all of the administrative remedies that come from the FAA and \nthe NTSB. We have a solution to that in this bill so this actually \nexplicitly states the pilots will have an option to appeal the FAA \nenforcement action directly to the Federal courts for a guaranteed de \nnovo trial. De novo means, instead of taking the conclusions of the \ninvestigation from the FAA and risking rubber stamping it, they have to \nhave a trial from the beginning. That is a very significant change we \nare making.\n  The other thing we neglected to do is include certificate holders \nother than pilots. You could be a mechanic, a flight attendant, or any \nnumber of things, and not be included in these legal opportunities, so \nthe Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 allows all certificate holders to have \nthis.\n  The third area is the access to the flight records. In my case, I \ncould not get access as to what the FAA was accusing me of. We thought \nwe had this corrected in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but it still needs \nto be strengthened, so we have a section in the Pilot's Bill of Rights \n2 that requires the FAA to notify a certificate holder that he is being \ninvestigated and clarify the incident being used to begin enforcement \nproceedings so that person will know what he has been accused of and \ncan address it.\n  The fourth area has to do with document requests. The FAA has \nretaliated against pilots because the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1 \nrequested broad documents from them, which can be very time consuming \nand very costly, and it is not necessary at all. The solution to that \nis that we explicitly rein in the ability of the FAA to initiate the \nexpansive document request and limit them to the pertinent issues being \ninvestigated by the FAA. That should correct that.\n  We have several other items too. If somebody has a minor infraction \nin a car, then after 90 days, or so many days, it would be taken from \ntheir record. That is the way it used to be prior to 1996 when they had \nthe Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996, and now we will go back to \nwhere we were before that.\n  Many of these issues that were problems before and weren't corrected \nwith the Pilot Bill of Rights are corrected, and I feel very \ncomfortable with it.\n  The reason I have all of this in my mind now is that I just came back \nfrom Oshkosh. Although I was there only 2 days, I was able to give 10 \npresentations, and there were a little less than a half-million pilots \nthere at the time, so I am sure I got to all half-million of those \npilots collectively with all of those events that we had.\n  It is kind of interesting because for someone who is a pilot, that is \nthe most important thing. We are not talking about Democrats, \nRepublicans, or things that are controversial. It is just that when you \ngo to Oshkosh and you see what people have accomplished through \nexperimentation and the technology that has developed--it used to be \nthat all planes had to be made out of aluminum, and this all changed \nwith new types of things that were discovered at Oshkosh. People are \nbuilding planes behind their garages.\n  Well, anyway, so much for that. We have a good solution for all of \nthese problems, and I will say to the 56 members that they are \ncertainly very popular among the pilots and the group I spent the last \n2 days with.\n  I mentioned that only because in the event that they change the rules \naround here, and we are allowed to have amendments that are not \ngermane, that would be one of the amendments that I would offer, and I \nwant to be sure that we are at least getting things into the Record so \npeople are aware of it. While there are no Members here right now, the \nstaff is monitoring everything that is going on, so I want to make sure \npeople know that is an issue we may or may not be dealing with.\n  It would be a surprise to me if the House of Representatives said: \nWell, we are just going to go home, and we are not going to pass this \nbill after we go through all of the trouble of passing it. I think \nthere are ample votes to pass this legislation. Long-term \nreauthorization is a very important thing back in the States.\n  The coalitions which are coming together on this legislation include \nthe Department of Transportation for every State, along with the labor \nunions. They are supporting this legislation because it will provide a \nlot of jobs. The Chambers of Commerce are all involved; the farmers are \nall involved. This has the most popular support of anything that we \nwill deal with all year long, so we really need to have this bill. I am \nhaving a hard time believing that if we go through the trouble of \nhaving a reauthorization bill, the House is not going to take it up, \nbut that statement was made 2 hours ago, and that may be the situation.\n  I can remember in the earlier days when the highway trust fund had \none big problem: They always had a surplus. They had too much money, \nbut that has changed with the increased efficiency of cars. Electric \nvehicles are using highways, but they are not paying the gas tax. \nConsequently, we have a real problem with funding this legislation.\n  If we take the total amount of revenues that come from the gas tax, \nlet's say over the next 6 years because this is a 6-year bill, each \nyear falls short by $15 billion. So we are looking at being short $90 \nbillion over a 6-year period.\n  I can say this because I think I may be ranked as the most \nconservative Member for a longer period of time than anybody else in \nthe Senate. I can talk about this because this is a conservative \nposition. The conservative position is to have a long-term bill because \nif we do short-term fixes, it costs--and this is irrefutable and no one \ndisagrees with this--an additional 30 percent off the top if we do \nshort-term extensions, and that is what we have been doing. We have had \n33 short-term extensions since the 2005 bill that we passed expired in \n2009, and that has used a very large amount of the money that was there \nto take care of the problems with the roads and the highways.\n  We do have problems out there, and it is going to take a long-term \nbill to take care of it. I have a feeling, since the money runs out on \nthe last day of this month, that the House, if they are not going to \ntake up our bill, they may just pass a short-term extension and then go \nhome. That is not the way I think it should be done, we have to get \nthis long-term bill.\n  This is something that doesn't happen very often, but now and then it \ndoes. We went through the same thing with the other big bill, which was \nthe Defense authorization bill over the last 3 or 4 years, and they \ndidn't bring it up as they should have early in the year. I remember 2 \nyears ago we passed our Defense authorization bill in June, and the \nleadership didn't bring it up until December. If we hadn't brought it \nup, then the kids who are out there risking their lives would lose \ntheir reenlistment bonuses, their hazard pay, and a lot of things would \nhave happened. Just before the end of December, we were able to get it \ndone. It is not the way things are supposed to be done around here. I \ncertainly don't want that done with the highway reauthorization bill, \nbut that is what very likely could happen if the House does what they \nsay they are going to do.\n  With that, I do want to come back and go over some of the larger \nproblems that cannot be addressed unless we pass a long-term highway \nreauthorization bill.\n  I will say this: There is a very fine FBO operation in Western Iowa \ncalled Red Oak. It just so happens that my son just left Red Oak on his \nway back from Oshkosh. It also happens that Red Oak is owned by the \nhusband of a very prominent Senator in this body who happens to be \npresiding now.\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\n  With that, I will come back later, and we will be talking about these \nthings because I understand the next thing we are going to do is a vote \nat 10 tonight, unless some time is yielded back. I hope they will yield \nback their time. They are not down here talking, so there is no reason \nnot to yield back time. If time is not yielded back, I will talk about \nsome of the projects that will not be done unless we have a long-term \nreauthorization bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Honoring Marine Sergeant Carson Holmquist\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I come to the floor to pay tribute to \none of America's sons who has fallen in the line of duty. Sgt Carson \nHolmquist was a 25-year-old marine from Grantsburg, WI, who lost his \nlife tragically as a result of the heinous act committed by a terrorist \non July 16 in Chattanooga.\n  Sergeant Holmquist was one of the finest among us. He gave his life \nto preserve the liberties upon which America was founded. He was a son, \na husband, a father, and a very proud marine.\n  He also must have been a great friend to all the people he knew and a \nman who was respected by many people he didn't know.\n  I was honored to attend his funeral this past Saturday, and I was \nwitness to a tremendous outpouring of support. I saw a line--probably \nabout 2 blocks long, three or four people wide--of citizens from all \nacross Wisconsin and from several other States.\n  Some of these people were Sergeant Holmquist's relatives, some were \nhis friends, many were brothers-in-arms, both past and present. Still \nothers were citizens who had no personal connection to Sergeant \nHolmquist. They came simply to pay their respects to a man who swore to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  They came to honor a man who so loved America that he chose to serve \nin faraway lands. He revered freedom, so he sacrificed his own freedom \nthat we may be free. He defended our right to live as individuals by \nyielding his own individuality in that noble cause. He valued life. Yet \nhe bravely readied himself to lay down his own life in humble service \nto his comrades-in-arms, to his family, and to his Nation.\n  For 239 years, our service men and women have served as guardians of \nour freedom. The cost of that vigilance has been high. Since the \nRevolutionary War, more than 42 million men and women have served in \nour military, and more than 1 million of those selfless heroes have \ngiven their lives. Wisconsin has borne its share of that sacrifice. \nSince statehood, more than 27,000 of Wisconsin's sons and daughters \nhave died in military service. Statistics cannot possibly convey the \nweight of these losses. Statistics are merely numbers that could never \nfully communicate the qualities of promising lives which were cut far \ntoo short. Statistics say nothing of unfulfilled hopes and dreams.\n  So instead of numbers such as 1 million or 27,000, I ask everyone to \nthink for a moment about a much smaller but yet even more staggering \nnumber--simply the number one. Sergeant Holmquist was one man, loved \nand cherished by family and friends. He was one man whose loss is a \ntremendous blow to Wisconsin and to this great Nation.\n  He was one man, but his sacrifice was not his alone. His parents \nThomas and LaBrenda, his wife Jasmine, his son Wyatt, and every other \nrelative and friend left behind are experiencing profound loss and \ngrief. But tragedy multiplies. It is not contained. For those left \nbehind, the pain may slowly subside, but the wound will never heal.\n  The Holmquist family loved Carson dearly, and our hearts go out to \nthem. I pray they will find peace and comfort amid overwhelming tragic \nloss.\n  The torch of freedom burns brightly because of men like Sergeant \nHolmquist. May God bless and comfort the sergeant's loved ones. May He \nwatch over those who have answered the Nation's call. May God bless \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Trafficking in Persons Report\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise because I am deeply and \nprofoundly disappointed in this year's ``Trafficking in Persons \nReport'' that was released today. By upgrading Malaysia and Cuba, which \nwere at tier 3--the worst tier at which any country could be \nconsidered--the administration has turned its back on the victims of \ntrafficking and turned a blind eye to the facts and politicized the \nreport, and they completely ignored the calls from Congress, from \nleading human rights advocates, from the realities on the ground in \nCuba, and from Malaysian Government officials themselves to preserve \nthe integrity of this exceedingly important report. They have succeeded \nin elevating political considerations and political goals above the \nmost fundamental principles of basic human rights.\n  I heard Secretary Kerry, in his presentation of the report, say \nsomething to the extent that we should not put a price on our fellow \nhuman beings' freedom. Well, it seems we have in this case. In \narbitrarily upgrading Malaysia and Cuba, they are clearly politicizing \nthe report, giving an undeserved stamp of approval to countries that \nhave failed to take the basic actions that would merit this upgrade. \nThis flies in the face of what Malaysians themselves want. In Malaysia, \nmembers of the Parliament, the legal profession, and human rights \nactivists have urged the United States to support their efforts to \nmaintain the tier 3 ranking they tell us Malaysia deserves. Today we \nhave failed them.\n  In Cuba, adults and children are subjected to sex trafficking, and \nthe government continues perpetrating abusive practices of forced \nlabor. The administration's decision to upgrade Cuba defies common \nsense. In the State Department's own words, Cuba is a source country \nwhere adults and children--children--are subjected to sex trafficking \nand forced labor.\n  In the case of forced labor, the Castro regime itself is the single \ngreatest perpetrator of forced labor in Cuba. Every year the Cuban \nGovernment coerces tens of thousands of its own doctors and medical \nprofessionals to serve in foreign missions under conditions that \nviolate international norm. The Castro regime restricts the movement of \nits doctors while they are overseas, takes their passports from them, \nand often prevents family visits. Additionally, the Cuban Government \ngarnishes its doctors' wages by more than 70 percent, using what should \nbe a humanitarian mission as a means to fill its own coffers.\n  This gross violation of international standards is so bad that the \nUnited States has a specific parole program for Cuban doctors who have \nbeen subjected to forced labor conditions by the Castro regime. We have \nour own special parole program for Cuban doctors who have been \nsubjected to forced labor conditions by the Castro regime. Thousands of \nCuban doctors have come to the United States as a result.\n  So at a time when these doctors are being received into the United \nStates on humanitarian parole, we are going to turn a blind eye to the \nfact that the Castro regime is the sole responsible actor. This raises \none question. Is this yet another emerging detail of something that the \nadministration and the Cuban Government have been discussing in recent \nmonths, another demand of the Castro regime that the United States had \nto agree to in the name of normalizing the relations? They are willing \nto look the other way on human rights in order to normalize relations? \nAs the State Department's own report recognizes, there has been no \nprogress--no progress--on forced labor in Cuba. Given that reality, any \nupgrade of the country's ranking challenges common sense.\n  So I intend to use all the tools at my disposal--from hearings, to a \ncall for\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\ninvestigations, to legislation--to challenge these upgrades. The \ncredibility and commitment of the United States to fighting the scourge \nof modern-day slavery is on the line. We spent an enormous amount of \ntime in this Senate on the legislation Senator Cornyn had, along with \nothers, on modern-day slavery, spent a lot of time on it in the Foreign \nRelations Committee on which I am privileged to serve under Senator \nCorker, who had his own legislation about how we deal with human \ntrafficking in the world--modern-day slavery, as he calls it. So we \nneed to make clear that the ``Trafficking in Persons Report'' must not \nbe subjected to political manipulation.\n  I am utterly dismayed at the administration's decision to upgrade \nMalaysia and Cuba under these circumstances. It represents a \nbastardization of the trafficking-in-persons ranking process and calls \ninto question the credibility of the ``Trafficking in Persons Report,'' \nand it takes away the power to incentivize real progress. The \nadministration's upgrade of Malaysia as well as Cuba compromises \nAmerican values in the interest of promoting a trade agenda with a \ncountry that has consistently failed to uphold human rights. One can \nonly characterize this action as a cynical maneuver to get around the \nclear intent of Congress with no regard for the effect on a key \nmeasurement tool of a country's human trafficking record. This not only \nrepresents the latest release of the ``Trafficking in Persons Report'' \nin the history of its publication--nearly a full 2 months' overdue--but \ncalls into question this administration's commitment to uphold human \nrights.\n  We all know that the Malaysian Government has not undertaken a \nconsistent, serious effort that would warrant an upgrade.\n  As I have noted before on other occasions, on April 17 of this year, \nthe U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia--our Ambassador to Malaysia--said that \nthe Malaysian Government needs to show greater political will in \nprosecuting human traffickers and protecting their victims if the \ncountry hopes to improve on its current lowest ranking in the \n``Trafficking In Persons Report.'' This is the person on the ground in \nMalaysia representing the U.S. Government who has eyes on what is \nhappening, and he said on April 17 that, in fact, the Malaysian \nGovernment needs to show greater political will in prosecuting human \ntraffickers and protecting their victims if the country wanted to rise \nfrom tier 3 to a better tier 2 standard.\n  On June 1, the Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Migration \nand Refugees, Anne Richard, reaffirmed that ``this year's report covers \nup to March 2015, which means Malaysia's handling of the Rohingya \nrefugee crisis will only be reflected in the 2016 report.'' According \nto the Assistant Secretary, then, actions taken after March of this \nyear, good or bad, should certainly not be reflected in this year's \nevaluation.\n  Well, if you are not going to reflect the mass graves of Rohingya \nMuslims and what the Government of Malaysia did or did not do--the \nholding pens of humans--because it came after the reporting period, \nthen you can't claim that the government's action to pass a law that \nhas no teeth, no enforcement, and that hasn't even been put into effect \nafter the date--the same date that you say you cannot consider the \nplight of hundreds who lost their lives--then you can't consider the \npassage of a hollow bill. It doesn't work both ways.\n  Even the Malaysian Bar, the Malaysian association of legal \nprofessionals, stated in a letter last week: ``If there is any lesson \nto be learnt from recent experience, it must be that the government has \nan excellent record of drafting written plans, but a less than \nsatisfactory record of implementing them. As such, the upgrade of \nMalaysia, if it were to occur, would be premature and undeserved.''\n  The fact is, by the admission of the ``Trafficking in Persons \nReport,'' the Malaysian Government had only three human rights \nconvictions in 2014--a two-thirds decrease from the last report. So \ncompared to the last ``Trafficking in Persons Report,'' they had a two-\nthirds decrease in their convictions of human rights abuses. Yet they \nget an upgrade. Wow. That is a surefire way to send a message across \nthe world that we are serious about human trafficking. Frankly, that is \nbeyond comprehension and common sense.\n  There can be no clearer statement nor a more compelling statement \nthat we have lowered the bar on human trafficking and lessened the \nvalue of the one report the world relies on to evaluate the behavior of \nnations. The events of recent months have clearly shown that the \nMalaysian Government has not even begun to adequately address its human \ntrafficking problem. Thousands of victims continue to be exploited \nthrough sex trafficking and forced labor. And it was unnecessary to do \nthis, having passed an amendment that said tier 3 countries in the \n``Trafficking in Persons Report'' of the State Department would not be \nallowed preferential access to the U.S. market unless they cleaned up \ntheir record, which had strong bipartisan support of the members of the \nSenate Finance Committee and ultimately was incorporated in the TPA, \nthe trade promotion authority legislation that passed the Senate and \nwas sent to the House. In good faith, because of concerns that maybe \nthat would undermine the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in good faith I \nnegotiated an amendment--a provision to change it in the amendment that \nwould have said you could still negotiate with Malaysia, but they had \nto clean up their act if you concluded that negotiation and they were \npart of TPP. They had to clean up their act on human trafficking before \nthey got the preferential access to U.S. markets. I thought it was a \nsignificant give on my part, considering the vote of the Senate, but it \nwas a good-faith effort. So this wasn't even necessary to do unless you \njust want to give Malaysia a pass. The goal was to take the full weight \nof the TPP deal off of the ``Trafficking in Persons Report'' process.\n  Instead of choosing the route we worked out together, requiring the \nPresident to testify in writing that Malaysia has taken concrete steps \nto deal with its very serious human trafficking problem, the \nadministration backed out. I therefore see no reason why the \ncomprehensive ban on fast-track for tier 3 human traffickers should now \nbe amended. I see no reason why my willingness to accommodate should be \namended.\n  This underscores the need for further oversight of the trafficking in \npersons process, both legislatively and through the noble work of human \nrights groups here in Washington and out in the field.\n  I plan to work with my colleagues to advance my amendment to the \nState authorization bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee last month which requires the State Department to notify \nCongress of all trafficking in persons upgrades and downgrades 30 days \nprior to the release of the report.\n  I am looking forward to speaking to the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee to see if he, within a very busy schedule \nbecause we have all of the Iran nuclear review--but it seems to me this \nmerits a congressional hearing to determine what went on here. If I, \nfor some reason, cannot achieve that, then I may very well turn to the \ninspector general of the Department to seek a report as to what went \non.\n  Despite the clear will of Congress, this administration has made a \nmistake and will now have to answer questions as to its ability to \nobjectively evaluate global human trafficking. The hard-working, \ncommitted NGOs that labor in the field to fight human trafficking and \nthe countless victims who continue to suffer deserve an honest \nreflection of American values, not an arbitrary determination based \nupon expediency in achieving a limited political objective rather than \na real solution.\n  I look forward to working with all of the groups that have been \ninstrumental in shining a light on the continued human rights abuses \nthat take place in Malaysia, in Cuba, and elsewhere, to ensure that the \nintegrity of the ``Trafficking in Persons Report'' is restored.\n  Thousands and thousands of men, women, and children around the world \nwho are the victims of human trafficking--it is on their behalf that I \ncome to the floor. It is in their interest and in the interest of \nresponsible trade policy that recognizes there can be no reward to \nnations that ignore those types of trafficking in persons and do\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nnothing to end the scourge of what amounts to modern-day slavery, one \nof the great moral challenges of our time.\n  It is for the world's 50 million refugees and displaced people--the \nlargest number since World War II, many of whom are targets of \ntraffickers. Because they are displaced, have nowhere to go, they are \npreyed upon. We have the largest number since World War II of refugees \nin the world. It is for the 36 million women and 5 million children \naround the world subjected to involuntary labor or sexual exploitation. \nFor the victims of these crimes, the term ``modern slavery'' more \nstarkly describes what is happening around the world.\n  I will continue to fight against human trafficking in all its forms. \nI intend to fight for the integrity of a report that is a critical tool \nfor us to be able to not only cast the light upon human trafficking in \nthe world but to get countries to understand they must meet this great \nmoral challenge and change the course of events in their country. That \nis why I come so incredibly upset to the Senate floor on something I \nnever thought would have happened, but it has. We need to change it and \nchange the course of events.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the Nation's \ncyber security. Prior to being elected to the Senate, I spent nearly 12 \nyears working at a cloud computing company. This is a company we \nstarted from virtually nothing. We took the company public, and we grew \nto over 1,000 employees. It became a leading cloud computing company in \nthe customer experience sector. I have seen firsthand the opportunities \ncreated by advances in technology, but I have also seen the power Big \nData holds because our information becomes currency for both companies \nand for hackers.\n  These risks are even greater when they impact our children, and as \nthe daddy of four children, I know the importance of maintaining a \nclose relationship between the parents and their children's school. \nToday, student electronic records are used in schools across the \ncountry, and updates can be easily made and can follow a student from \none school to another. This more accurately reflects the nature of \nstudents' movements within the school system.\n  But at a time when overseas hackers are fighting to gain access to \nany information they can, these technological gains also come with some \nrisks. Securing students' digital information is critical to ensuring \nthat our kids' privacy is protected. That is why I am grateful and \nproud to announce that I joined Senator Blumenthal in introducing the \nSAFE KIDS Act.\n  The Safeguarding American Families from Exposure by Keeping \nInformation and Data Secure--the SAFE KIDS Act--protects student \nprivacy by establishing clear parameters for third-party operators when \nusing data collected from students. This bipartisan legislation \nempowers parents to control access to their children's information \nbecause keeping personally identifiable information secure will lead to \na uniform way to secure our students' data. By placing that power back \nin the hands of the students, in the hands of the parents, and in the \nhands of the schools, we can make progress toward protecting the \nprivacy of our children because our schools and our kids aren't the \nonly ones at risk for a serious breach.\n  This week we are debating ways to provide the certainty and resources \nneeded to improve our Nation's infrastructure--our roads, our bridges, \nour ports, our highways--but recent news reminds us that we must also \nconsider the security of the cars that are driving on our roadways. In \nfact, just in the past week, news broke that Fiat Chrysler announced a \nrecall of 1.4 million vehicles due to a vulnerability that could allow \nhackers to disable the vehicles on the highways. In fact, through the \nradio of a Jeep Cherokee, hackers disabled the vehicle's transmission \nas a driver drove onto a public highway in St. Louis. This episode is \ntelling in that cyber hacks can affect every sector of our economy, \nfrom the financial sector to our automotive manufacturers.\n  Our military installations across the globe are also vulnerable to an \nattack, according to a new report from the GAO. In fact, our utility \nsystems that provide water, electricity, and other essential services \nto our military installations worldwide have limited defenses against \ncyber attacks. Report details that the industrial control system--ICS--\nthe computers that monitor or operate physical utility infrastructure, \n``have very little in the way of security controls and cybersecurity \nmeasures in place.'' In fact, in a recent July 25 Military Times \narticle, they cite: ``An example of a successful cyber-physical attack \nthrough an ICS was the `Stuxnet.' '' It was a computer virus that was \nused to attack Iranian centrifuges in 2010. By hacking the Iranian \nnuclear facility's ICS, the centrifuges were made to operate \nincorrectly, causing extensive damage.\n  The fears of a massive cyber security breach don't only rest in the \nPentagon. Just yesterday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on ABC's \n``This Week'' that a cyber attack by the Islamic State is one of the \nterrorist group's biggest emerging threats to our country. In fact, \nduring the interview, Attorney General Lynch noted that the terrorist \ngroup now boasts over 20,000 English language Twitter followers. Our \ncountry's most sensitive data can be in the hands of our enemies at the \nmere click of a button or press of a screen.\n  As I speak today, we have yet to obtain answers from the Obama \nadministration on the scope and the perpetrators from the massive hack \nat the Office of Personnel Management. This attack has paralyzed the \nObama administration. They haven't put in place any real, meaningful \nreforms at OPM. I have called for Chief Information Officer Donna \nSeymour's resignation since June 24. Yet she still remains in her post \nand we still don't have any concrete answers for the 21 million-plus \nFederal employees who were victims of this attack.\n  We must do more. We must act more quickly and more nimbly than those \nseeking to wage a terror attack on our Nation's cyber security \ninfrastructure.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the freight division \nof the DRIVE Act, the highway transportation bill that is under \nconsideration before us at the moment.\n  The freight provisions represent the combined efforts of both the \nCommerce Committee, which I have the honor of chairing, and the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works. To create this division, we \nincorporate a number of provisions from legislation offered by Senator \nCantwell, Senator Markey, Senator Booker, Senator Murray, and the \nadministration's GROW AMERICA Act proposal. We worked very hard to \nincorporate and make this a bipartisan product. We took into \nconsideration suggestions that were made by our colleagues, many of \nwhom serve on the Commerce Committee and some who don't, but we got to \na point where we feel as if we had a good product that incorporates the \nbest ideas--not everything, obviously, that everybody wanted but that \naddressed many of the issues that pertained to our particular part of \nthis legislation.\n  The language included in the Commerce Committee's freight program \nalso drew from recommendations made by the Department of \nTransportation's nonpartisan National Freight Advisory Committee--\nanother entity we looked to and consulted with respect to these \nparticular provisions of the bill.\n  Because of our Nation's vast transportation network, freight can move \nby rail, it can move by aircraft, it can move by truck, and it can move \nby ship. It is multimodal. Under the bipartisan legislation before the \nSenate, freight-planning efforts will be concentrated under the \nSecretary of\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nTransportation. This is to reflect the multimodal nature of how goods \nare transported and to ensure the involvement of various agencies which \nregulate different forms of transportation is properly coordinated.\n\n  Because freight moves from truck to rail to port, freight planning \nmust consider these connections, and it must include the development of \na strategy to expand capacity and to increase efficiency to meet \ngrowing demand. This is especially true when it comes to focusing \ninfrastructure investment decisions. Growing demand indicates and fuels \na growing economy. We need a plan to handle the significant growth of \nfreight traffic we expect in the coming years.\n  The Department of Transportation notes that, by 2040, our \ntransportation system is projected to haul an additional 9 billion tons \nof freight. That represents a 45 percent increase over what we move \ntoday. As our economy recovers and continues to grow, we will continue \nto need additional freight infrastructure. The freight network serves \nour import and export needs and is a critical element of our economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Bottlenecks and delays have significant economic cost. Freight is, by \nnature, not just a highway problem. Airports, ports, and railroads \nconnect farms, manufacturing centers, and the markets they serve.\n  Freight needs are not just urban issues. They are also very important \nfor rural America. Advancing agricultural freight projects is necessary \nfor the economies of many States, so ensuring planning and funding for \nthese projects is also critical. Keeping freight transportation costs \nlow keeps American farmers competitive in the global marketplace.\n  In the winter of 2014, South Dakota faced significant challenges \nmoving grain from the State due to congestion in the rail network. When \nthe freight couldn't move, farmers weren't getting paid. Commodities \nfaced spoilage due to a lack of available storage space.\n  Agriculture is the leading driver of South Dakota's economy. Delays \nand the significant increased costs of moving grain by rail negatively \nimpacted the pocketbooks of many of the farmers in my State. This, in \nturn, reduced Main Street's bottom line as well.\n  More recently, the West Coast port slowdowns delayed shipments to and \nfrom stores in South Dakota and across the country. Agricultural \nproducts for export were delayed, and imports of products from lumber, \nmedical supplies, and automobiles to basic retail goods were delayed. \nThis was an unforced error that harmed our economy for way too many \nmonths.\n  This labor strife underscored the interconnected nature of our \ntransportation system and how vital our freight infrastructure is to \neach and to every State in this country. In fact, the resulting strife \nwas widely cited as a contributing cause of the U.S. economy actually \nshrinking in the first quarter of 2015.\n  Protecting our competitiveness is at the core of this legislation's \nfreight program that was developed between the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee and my colleagues on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee.\n  Planning for and fixing our freight network will create and maintain \njobs over the long term. Reducing delays and lowering the price of \nfreight transportation serves the entire supply chain and, ultimately, \nthe American consumer.\n  That is why the freight division in the DRIVE Act is so important. \nThe bill improves the planning process, engaging States and \nstakeholders to help plan for future freight needs. States will provide \na forward-looking plan to address these freight needs step by step. \nThese plans will develop investment strategies and prioritize projects \nfor funding.\n  The bill's consolidated strategy that plans for both highway projects \nand multimodal projects is a significant improvement over what we have \ntoday--or the status quo. In addition, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee developed a highway trust fund formula program that will \nsupport critical projects in every State. In the first year alone, the \nbill provides $450 million of grant funding to assist with these \ncritical investments.\n  Projects to improve rail grade crossings, port facilities, and \nconnections between freight modes of transportation will have access to \nthese new resources. This will reduce the time and the cost of moving \ngoods.\n  The Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors noted that \nthe planning and strategy outlined in the bill is ``a significant step \nforward for multimodal freight planning and policy.'' The American \nAssociation of Port Authorities says: ``Elevating a policy for freight \nwithin your legislation sends a strong message that freight must \ncontinue to be a priority and that planning, funding, and the \nestablishment of a multimodal freight network are critical for the \neconomic growth of our nation.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full statements of these two organizations I just mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors, July \n                               16, 2015]\n\n Goods Movement Coalition Applauds Commerce Freight Policy, Calls for \n                            Freight Funding\n\n                 (By Executive Director Elaine Nessle)\n\n       Washington, DC.--Yesterday the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation approved a six-year \n     transportation bill, the Comprehensive Transportation and \n     Consumer Protection Act of 2015, S.1732. Included in the bill \n     is a freight chapter, providing a focus on multimodal freight \n     planning and policy.\n       The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection \n     Act of 2015 is a significant step forward for multimodal \n     freight planning and policy. I commend Chairman Thune and the \n     Committee members for developing policy that incorporates the \n     many modes of transportation that move freight. The proposal \n     contains several policy objectives held by the Coalition for \n     America's Gateways and Trade Corridors, including creation of \n     a multimodal national freight policy and the call for \n     designation of a multimodal national freight network to \n     inform transportation planning and improve investment \n     decision making.\n       While this proposal is a step in the right direction, \n     dedicated freight funding is necessary to make targeted \n     system improvements. The Coalition has long called for a \n     minimum annual investment of $2 billion in addition to \n     current programs of funding. A freight investment grant \n     program, with multimodal project eligibility that distributes \n     funding on a competitive basis, is needed to make strategic \n     investments. Businesses and agricultural producers rely on \n     our national multimodal freight system to move goods to \n     market and support growth. To remain competitive in the \n     global market place, we must invest in the system that moves \n     our nation's commerce.''\n       Demonstrating the large number of projects that stand to \n     benefit from a competitive grant approach, CAGTC published in \n     April a booklet titled ``Freight Can't Wait.'' The booklet \n     contains a sampling of significant freight infrastructure \n     projects that could be realized with federal resources, like \n     funding distributed through a competitive freight investment \n     grant program.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                          of Port Authorities,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 23, 2015.\n     Hon.

AAPA empowers port authorities, \n     maritime industry partners and service providers to serve \n     their global customers and create economic and social value \n     for their communities. Our activities, resources and \n     partnerships connect, inform and unify seaport leaders and \n     maritime professionals in all segments of the industry around \n     the western hemisphere. This letter is on behalf of our U.S. \n     members.\n       The approach of grouping the Environment and Public Works \n     and Commerce Committees' jurisdictions into one division \n     within the DRIVE Act is a positive step forward. This \n     grouping reinforces a top AAPA priority--that freight policy \n     must be integrated as well as intermodal in order to be \n     efficient, safe and secure. In the past, freight policy and \n     funding measures have been fragmented.\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\n     Elevating a policy for freight within your legislation sends \n     a strong message that freight must continue to be a priority \n     and that planning funding and the establishment of a \n     multimodal freight network are critical for the economic \n     growth of our nation.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you on building \n     the freight provisions in the DRIVE Act as the legislation \n     moves forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Kurt Nagle,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the legislation before the Senate is a \ncritically important part of addressing our Nation's current and future \ntransportation investments. As Senator Cantwell often says: Freight \ncan't wait.\n  The DRIVE Act includes these critical freight provisions that will \nhelp our economy and lead to job creation. Strengthening our freight \nprogram is yet one more reason to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I hope before all is said and done in the Senate we \nwill complete action on this legislation this week and get many of \nthese provisions, which are so important to our economy, so important \nto jobs, and so important to America's competitiveness, passed into \nlaw.\n  Of course, first we have to get action by the House of \nRepresentatives in order to get it to the President's desk, but the \nwork that has gone into this is the product of a lot of various Members \nand committees, those from the stakeholder community offering their \ninput and consultation to get us to the point we are today where I \nthink we have a product we can be proud of and that we can say actually \nwill help address the freight challenges and the needs we have across \nthis country and make our economy even more competitive.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with regard to one of the \nparts of the highway bill we are talking about, and that is the Export-\nImport Bank, otherwise known as Ex-Im.\n  I rise today as somebody who feels strongly we need to have a long-\nterm highway bill. I am glad we are on the floor with that because it \nis about jobs and crumbling infrastructure. I am also pleased that \nwithin this bill there is some regulatory reform on the permitting \nprocess, and I thank the authors for including my permitting reform \nbill. But I also am pleased by the fact we also voted to add as an \namendment the reauthorization of this Bank called the Export-Import \nBank.\n  If I may, let me talk about why this is so important to Ohio jobs and \nto jobs around this country and to keeping our economy from falling \nbehind. Some people say: Well, why do we need the government involved \nin this business of providing financing or credit to companies that do \nbusiness overseas? Well, frankly, it is because often these are \nrelatively high-risk ventures, so companies cannot get the credits, the \nguarantees or the loans from private-sector companies.\n  I will give a few examples of this in a minute, but it is also \nbecause of the fact that other countries all over the world have these \nexport credit subsidies. In fact, we are pikers. We have a lot less \nthan our competitors. On average, our competitors do a lot more in \nterms of supporting their exports than we do.\n  So we need to have this in order to ensure that we don't lose jobs in \nthis country. By our unilaterally saying we are not going to help our \ncompanies to export, we are shooting ourselves in the foot.\n  Now, if these other countries around the world were to say, you know \nwhat, we are going to back off on our export financing, that would be \ngreat. When I was U.S. Trade Representative back in the Bush \nadministration, that is what I pushed for. I think we should be getting \nrid of these subsidies.\n  By the way, also in terms of agriculture subsidies and others, if \nthere were a level playing field, where our competitors were not doing \nthis, it would be a different world. I will note one thing I like about \nthe amendment that was adopted--or at least the cloture vote here and \nthe amendment that is likely to be adopted to this bill on the Export-\nImport Bank--is that it requires, as one of the reforms--and, yes, I \nthink it should be reformed--that the administration begin the process \nof an international negotiation to get rid of these export subsidies \nall over the world.\n  In the meantime, if we as the United States of America say \nunilaterally that we are going to stop these export subsidies through \nthis financing mechanism, we are going to lose jobs. It is not just we \nare not going to create jobs that would be otherwise created by these \nprojects, it is the fact that some companies will actually move \noverseas to take advantage of the export subsidies in other countries. \nThey have told me this, and I am sure they have told other Senators \nthis, and Senators know this.\n  I view this in pretty simple terms: No. 1, this program actually puts \nmoney back into the coffers every year rather than taking money out. I \nthink it added about $650 million or so to our surplus last year. Over \ntime it has added billions of dollars, so it is not costing taxpayer \nmoney. It brought $7 million in profits to the U.S. Treasury since \n1992. Last year it generated $675 million in profits, and by the way, \nit created 164,000 jobs and $27 billion in exports. So No. 1, it is not \none of these government programs that is costing the taxpayer.\n  No. 2, other countries are doing it, and if we don't do it, they will \ncontinue to do it and we will lose out on jobs, on contracts. I am \ntold, for instance, that right now, while this program is in flux--\nwhere we are not sure whether it will go forward or not because it has \nalready technically expired--there are 100 transactions sitting in the \npipeline worth more than $9 billion, and those transactions won't go \nforward unless we take action. So again, this is one where the United \nStates of America would be shooting itself in the foot by saying we are \nnot going to expand exports to the detriment of our workers.\n  Then No. 3, yes, we ought to get busy on reforms to the Export-Import \nBank, to make it more transparent. I think that is good. One of the \nreforms in here, as I said earlier, is to ensure the President submits \na strategy for ending government supported export subsidies \ninternationally. The Obama administration should be more aggressive at \nthat. I believe that is appropriate, and they should be doing it.\n  By the way, it also creates a risk management committee to oversee \nthe Bank's risk exposure. It also sets up a new nonpolitical chief \nethics officer to provide oversight with regard to the ethics practices \nof Bank employees. That is all important, and I support all those \nreforms. I could probably support some more, too, but let us not shoot \nourselves in the foot and lose these good-paying jobs we have in this \ncountry.\n  I view it frankly a lot like the trade debate we just had. What we \nwant to do in trade is have a balance, where we are sending more \nexports overseas, creating more jobs in this country--in my State of \nOhio, in the Presiding Officer's State of Indiana, and other States \naround this country--at the same time leveling the playing field by \nincreasing our enforcement and stopping the unfair imports from other \ncountries--the dumping and the subsidies.\n  In the trade bill--we talked a lot about this over the last month--we \nactually got in place a new amendment to help companies be able to deal \nwith unfairly traded imports, to get a remedy right away, and it is \nalready working. Sherrod Brown, my colleague from Ohio, and I put \ntogether an amendment. It is part of the trade bill that was passed. \nAlready, tire workers in Ohio, United Steelworkers union employees in \nOhio have been able to take advantage of that because they got a \npositive determination from the International Trade Commission, in part \nbecause we gave them better tools. We improved the law to be able to \nmore easily show they have been injured by these unfairly traded \nimports that are sold below cost or dumped or subsidized and so that \nthey can get the relief needed to avoid losing so many jobs that they \ngo out of business.\n  That is one thing we ought to be doing to expand exports--more trade. \nAnother thing we ought to be doing is ensuring we aren't pulling back \non this\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\nexport financing--again, it doesn't cost the taxpayers anything--at a \ntime when we are under-exporting compared to what we should be doing as \na country.\n  When we look at our exports per capita in the United States of \nAmerica, I think we are somewhere between Tonga and Ethiopia in terms \nof our exports per capita. Other countries depend a lot more on trade \nthan we do.\n  We need to export more. Why? It creates good jobs--jobs that pay 13 \npercent to 15 percent more on average and offer better benefits. The \nlast thing we want to do is to pull the rug out from under these \nexporters by saying we are going to change the law to make it even \nharder to export and put American workers at a disadvantage vis-a-vis \nthe rest of the world.\n  It is the same thing with regard to trade policy, generally. Let's \nexpand exports by opening up markets for our products through good \ntrade agreements, and let's enforce the laws and increase the \nenforcement, as we did with regard to the amendment I talked about \nearlier. That makes it easier for those tire workers at Cooper Tire in \nOhio and around the country to be able to say: This isn't fair. The \nChinese tires--in this case--are coming in under cost and are being \nsubsidized. We want our government to stand up for us so we can compete \nand so we can export more of our product.\n  So if we were not to allow this Export-Import Bank to continue, it \nwould be running counter to everything we just did in the trade bill. \nWe want more exports.\n  The final thing I have to say, again, is if we don't allow American \ncompanies to compete globally as American workers making products here \nin America, some of these companies are going to go overseas. A lot of \nthem already have production overseas. Let's be honest. A lot of these \nU.S. multinational companies make things all over the world on two, \nthree, four continents. They can shift production overseas, and then \nthey take advantage of the export guarantees in that country. That is \nwhat some of them have told me they are likely to do if we don't have \nan export guarantee in this country and we don't do anything about the \ninternational situation, where these other countries do more than we \ndo.\n  That reminds me of another topic we ought to be taking up here on the \nfloor of the Senate, and that is tax reform, because our Tax Code does \nthe same thing. Our Tax Code says to an American company: You can't \ncompete fairly. You have to compete with one hand tied behind your \nback. It is the American workers who are hurt by this because our tax \nrate is so high. Because of the way we tax internationally, we make it \nan advantage to be a foreign company. That is why so many U.S. \ncompanies are becoming foreign companies. Last year there were twice as \nmany transactions in dollar terms--twice as many as the year before--of \nforeign companies taking over U.S. companies, driven largely by our \ninefficient and out-of-date Tax Code.\n  So if we combine all of these--if we combine what is going on with \ntrade, if we combine what is going on with our tax system--we certainly \ndon't want to put our workers at a further disadvantage by pulling the \nrug out from under them with regard to this export financing. Yes, \nlet's try to get the rest of the world to do the right thing. But in \nthe meantime, let's not shoot ourselves in the foot.\n  On many of these projects overseas, there is a de facto requirement \nthat you have to have financing from a government. All these other \ncountries provide it. So whether in Africa, Asia or in some of these \nother emerging economies, they say: Where is your financing? This is \nwhy, as I said, there are about 100 projects in limbo right now.\n  Let me talk about some of the companies in Ohio that benefit from \nthis Export-Import Bank--again, this bank that actually puts money back \ninto the coffers every year. I have talked to these companies, and I \nhave talked to the workers on the line whose jobs are at stake because \nof what we are going to decide here in this body.\n  One is U.S. Bridge. They are in Cambridge, OH. They have been \nmanufacturing and building bridges in America and around the world for \n81 years. They are quite a success story. Their global business depends \non the financial guarantees of the Export-Import Bank. They can't \ncompete in bidding for these projects around the world without it. \nRecently, they got a $100 million contract to build bridges in West \nAfrica, but it was immediately put in jeopardy after they got it \nbecause Congress refused to move on the Ex-Im Bank one way or the \nother. We just allowed it to expire without even voting on it. That is \none of those projects currently in limbo. They have 150 employees in a \nvery small county with high unemployment in Eastern Ohio.\n  If they get this job we talked about to build bridges in West Africa, \nthey say they can add up to 50 new manufacturing workers with this one \ncontract. That is a big deal for a family-owned company that has been a \ncornerstone of the eastern part of Ohio in the small town of Cambridge, \nwhich has 10,000 people. That is 50 jobs right there, in a small town \nin an area of Ohio that has high unemployment, that are at stake if we \ndon't move on Export-Import Bank.\n  Let me talk about McGregor Metalworking in Springfield, OH. I know a \nlot about the McGregor family because they are distant cousins of mine. \nMy family was the McCullough family. They came to Springfield from \nScotland.\n  The McGregors run a company that is a staple of the community. They \nare pillars in the community. They have skilled trade jobs. The workers \nthere get good pay and good benefits. However, they are very concerned \nabout what is going on with the Ex-Im Bank. More than 60 workers at \nMcGregor work directly on products that depend on Ex-Im financing. That \nis about 16 percent of McGregor's sales. They are not a big company, \nbut they are a really important company to that community, to those \nworkers, and to their families.\n  So to the people who have stood up on this floor over the last couple \nof days and said this is not about jobs, this is about jobs, folks. \nThis is not just about big businesses. Yes, it is about them, and that \nis important too. We want those jobs here as well. It is also about a \nlot of small businesses.\n  I recently spoke to some of the workers at McGregor. They told me \nthere are a lot of manufacturing issues they just can't control--their \nhealth care costs, which are going up. ObamaCare has not helped. It has \nmade it worse. In Ohio, they are told their costs are going to go up \nbetween 10 percent and 33 percent next year. That is what the insurance \ncompanies have told them. The price of steel goes up and down. \nSometimes it is tough to get the skills to be able to compete and to \nget these jobs in places such as McGregor. Those are things that are \nout of their control. But Ex-Im is something they know we can control, \nand they are wondering why we are making it even more difficult and \nless predictable for them by not acting.\n  Let me talk about another small business in Hamilton, OH, called \nKaivac. They employ 50 people. They manufacture commercial cleaning \nmachines used to clean floors in schools, museums, stadiums, and \nairports. They are a kind of modern-day mop and pail.\n  With the help of Ex-Im, Kaivac grew its international sales by 60 \npercent last year, exporting their commercial cleaning machines all \nover the world. But as we have heard repeatedly, this is another \ncompany that said they can't do that in the future if they don't get \nthis financing from Ex-Im.\n  So what will happen to these companies? For a lot of these smaller \ncompanies, they will just lose business, and they will lose jobs. They \nwill lose the jobs they already have, and they won't be able to gain \nthe jobs we have talked about today.\n  For some of the bigger companies, they will be OK. They will move \noverseas. Frankly, I am not worried about the companies. I am worried \nabout the workers in Ohio--American workers who work hard, play by the \nrules, and do all the right things. We are going to pull the rug out \nfrom under them. That doesn't make any sense to me. We need to stand up \nfor these American workers. Whether it is with regard to trade or \nwhether it is with regard to taxes, as we talked about earlier, \nWashington is letting them down. We are not doing the basic things we \nought to be doing to create the environment for success to allow them \nto be able to compete and to win.\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n  Today we have the opportunity to stand with American workers. We have \nthe opportunity to move forward--yes, with regard to trade, knocking \ndown barriers to our exports, making sure there is a more level playing \nfield, including the amendment we talked about earlier that allows us \nnow to bring trade cases and get results and help American workers. We \nhave to be sure that we do reform this Tax Code, because if we don't, \nmore American companies and investments are going to go overseas. That \nis our job. We are letting the American worker down right now.\n  I see Senator Schumer here on the floor. Senator Schumer has been \nworking on this international tax reform issue, and his point is a very \nsimple one: We want the jobs and investments here. We are tired of \nseeing companies get taken over by foreign companies and move their \njobs to those other countries. We saw this recently. A pharmaceutical \ncompany got bought by a foreign entity. By the way, the foreign company \nhad just left America. They inverted to another country. They then came \nback and started buying American companies. One third of the workforce \nof that company bought by the foreign company is now gone--Raleigh, NC, \nto Canada.\n  So these are things we can do. It is within our control here in this \nbody for us to pass these kinds of bills and, with regard to Ex-Im, to \nensure that we are not shooting ourselves in the foot and shooting \nAmerican workers in the foot by taking away their opportunity to, yes, \nwin these bids, to win these competitions, to build that bridge in West \nAfrica, to send those cleaning supplies all over the world, to be able \nto ensure, with regard to McGregor Industries, that the parts they put \ninto those locomotive engines that get sent to developed countries and \ndeveloping countries can continue to grow.\n  Our job here is not to make life harder for these workers and these \nsmall companies. It is to make it easier for them to compete and to win \nso that we can begin to bring back not just more jobs but better jobs.\n  Over the last 6 years, we have seen wages flatten out and on average \ngo down. Economists tell me it is about a 6-percent reduction in real \nwages. Think about that. This at a time when health care costs are up, \nin part thanks to ObamaCare, which makes it harder, not easier, to get \nhealth care at a reasonable cost. Education costs are up. Electricity \ncosts are going up, in part because of the regulations that the Obama \nadministration is putting on the economy in my home State of Ohio and \naround the country. That is called the middle-class squeeze. Wages are \nflat and declining, and expenses going up. That is what the people I \nrepresent are experiencing.\n  Let's not make it more difficult for them. Let's stand up for \nAmerican workers. Yes, let's tell the Obama administration, as this \nlegislation does: You are required to put more pressure on the \ninternational community and other countries to reduce their export \nsubsidies, their guarantees, their credit agencies. But in the \nmeantime, let's be sure we are standing up for the people we represent \nand doing the right thing for the American worker.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank and support American manufacturing, because a \ncountry that doesn't make something can't make something of itself.\n  I have seen everything manufactured in Maryland, from crab cakes on \nKent Island and ice cream in Laurel to commercial truck engines in \nHagerstown and unmanned aircraft in Hunt Valley. I have met with \ninnovative manufacturers who credit the Export-Import Bank with helping \nthem grow their businesses by exporting to new markets overseas.\n  Through critical assistance, at no cost to taxpayers, these small and \nmedium-sized businesses are able to sell American products around the \nworld.\n  I visit businesses all over Maryland. I have visited bakeries, \nmicrobreweries, factories of small machine tool companies. I visited \nMain Street, small streets, rural communities. And I have talked with \nbusiness owners and their employees.\n  These are ``good guy'' businesses. They work hard and play by the \nrules. They have jobs right here in the U.S. They want to expand. They \nwant to hire. They need a government on their side and at their side.\n  Some business owners I met with said that the secure financing at the \nExport-Import bank helped them strengthen their business and grow.\n  Selling your products overseas isn't as simple as selling them \nlocally. But getting secure credit insurance helped Maryland \nmanufacturers that relied on cash-in-advance payments for exports \nexpand their businesses by exporting to new markets.\n  Other business owners I met with said that the Export-Import Bank was \na lifeline during a difficult economy. They told me that they relied on \nprivate financing before 2008, but during the credit crisis even safe \ninvestments couldn't get help from the private sector. The Export-\nImport Bank helped them weather the storm.\n  The Export-Import Bank provides critical direct loans and loan \nguarantees to foreign buyers of U.S.-made goods. The Export-Import Bank \nalso provides working capital loans to small businesses that are \nexporting. And it provides insurance for exporters in case a foreign \nbuyer fails to pay.\n  In all these cases the bank is filling gaps in the private market. It \nis an important tool for U.S. companies that are seeking to compete \nwith foreign firms, and those foreign firms often get aggressive trade \nfinancing support from their own national governments.\n  On July 1, 2015, the authorization for the Export-Import Bank lapsed. \nRight now, the bank is unable to process applications or engage in new \nbusiness. The bank cannot authorize any new transaction to do any new \nlending or help any businesses with any new exports. That puts American \njobs at risk. American businesses and workers are missing new \nopportunities because they can't get the new financing they need to \nclose the deal and make the sale abroad.\n  A vote to support the Export-Import Bank is a vote to support \nAmerican manufacturing jobs. Reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank means \nMaryland will be able to export more, manufacture more, and create more \njobs.\n  The Export-Import Bank helped over $27 billion in export sales in \nfiscal year 2014 and supported 164,000 jobs nationwide.\n  Nearly 90 percent of the transactions done by the Export-Import Bank \ndirectly supported small businesses.\n  From 2007 to 2015, the Export-Import Bank financed $2 billion in \nexports from Maryland.\n  The Export-Import Bank is about helping Main Street. It is about \nhelping the entrepreneurs with a dream in their heart, with a small \nbusiness underway, with the grit and determination to be able to create \na job for themselves and for others.\n  I call upon my colleagues to think about where America is going in \nthe 21st century. Where are we going to be? Are we going to create more \nopportunity? Are we going to create more jobs that pay good wages with \ngood benefits?\n  I am proud to stand firm in my commitment to manufacturing jobs from \nHagerstown to Stevensville and from Baltimore to Easton.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the facts are undeniable. Climate change \nis real, it is caused by humans, it is happening now, and, it is \nsolvable.\n  Today I would like to talk about a noncontroversial way to reduce 10 \npercent of the world's carbon pollution: fighting deforestation.\n  Of course, no single action will solve climate change, but stopping \ndeforestation is underrated as a solution, with a high impact and a low \ncost. While we have been on this floor for years in an intense, often \npartisan, debate over pipelines and the EPA's rules on coal-fired \npowerplants, forest conservation\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\nis an area where we have always had strong bipartisan support.\n  As forests are cut down, two things happen. First, carbon stored in \ntrees is released. Second, the trees stop absorbing carbon from the \natmosphere.\n  Each year, the world loses forests the size of Ohio, and that rate is \nincreasing. Unless we act, an area twice the size of Texas will be lost \nby the year 2030.\n  Of course, most deforestation is happening in tropical forests, in \nthe Amazon, the Congo River Basin, and in Southeast Asia. But global \ndemand, including demand from the United States, for palm oil, soy, \nbeef, and timber products greatly contributes to forest loss in these \nregions.\n  This is why the United States has to lead in stopping deforestation. \nThere are three things that we can do: First, we have to fully \nimplement and fund the Lacey Act. This law prohibits the import of \nillegally harvested wood products but has only been in place since \n2008. Congress hasn't given the USDA and other agencies the tools to \nfully implement it. We are good at catching raw products like lumber \nfrom illegally harvested forests, but we still need more tools to catch \nillegal wood, which is in processed products such as furniture.\n  Full enforcement of the Lacey Act could keep 27 million metric tons \nof carbon pollution out of the atmosphere each year. This is equivalent \nto the emissions from more than 5 million cars every year. The Lacey \nAct is also good for the U.S. timber industry because illegally \nharvested wood products undercut this industry by $1 billion in 2013 by \nreducing the competitive advantage of legal timber.\n  Second, we have to support private sector commitments to stopping \ndeforestation. We have had some recent very good news in this space. \nDriven by consumer demand, 34 corporations recently committed to \ncutting deforestation from their products in half by 2020 and ending it \nby 2030. These are big companies--Walmart, McDonald's, and Unilever, \namong many others. These businesses were joined by 35 governments, 16 \nindigenous groups, and 45 NGOs. This was the first time that leaders \nfrom developed and developing countries have partnered around a \ntimeline for ending deforestation.\n  One challenge in meeting these commitments is that we don't have a \nrobust standard to verify that they are being met. Without this, we are \nmerely taking everyone's word for it, but the United States can lead in \nmonitoring and verifying these commitments. Publicly available \nsatellite imagery from NASA and USGS has already allowed forest \nscientists to measure the magnitude of global deforestation, but we \nstill need more accurate, real-time monitoring of the carbon content in \nforests, and the technologies do exist.\n  Finally, we have to provide forested countries with technical and \nfinancial support to protect and grow their forests. Absorbing carbon \nwith trees is more cost-effective and more energy efficient than doing \nso from coal or gas powerplants. This is because trees capture carbon \nusing energy from the Sun and powerplants capture carbon using \nadditional energy from a powerplant.\n  Despite the ability of forests to capture and store carbon, we can't \njust tell landowners to stop cutting down their trees. They are often \nin a very dire financial situation on a personal level. We have to \nshare with them our expertise in sustainable forest management--how to \nprosper from a forest without cutting it down and moving on to the next \nstand. The State Department, USAID, and USDA bring sought-after \nknowledge in this area from how to fight forest fires to how to combat \nillegal logging.\n  We also have to provide financial incentives for landowners to \nprotect their forests. The economic benefit of forests is real. They \nstore carbon, filter water, keep soil healthy, and protect against \nerosion.\n  The value of a forest's ecological services, not just its raw \nmaterials, must be recognized in the global economy. REDD-plus \nprograms--shorthand for reducing emissions from deforestation and \nforest degradation--provide a mechanism for financially rewarding \ncountries that reduce emissions from deforestation. If we want to lead \nin solving climate change, we have to contribute our fair share to \nthese programs.\n  Thankfully, forests in the United States absorb more carbon than they \nrelease. However, the U.S. Forest Service estimates that the loss of \nforests through urban growth and wildfires could make our forests a \nsource of carbon pollution as soon as 2030. We have to ensure that our \nforests continue to absorb more carbon than they release and work with \nour allies to protect our forests abroad.\n  We have solutions on climate change. Stopping deforestation is one of \nthem, and it is one of the solutions I am most excited about because it \nis an opportunity for bipartisan work. We know what we need to do, and \nwe know how to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have been discussing the value of \nhaving a multiyear transportation bill, a highway bill moving through \nthe Senate. It is something that I, too, would like to see, but as with \neverything that we do around here, it is important how we do it. When \nyou have a multiyear highway bill, it is important to ask the question, \nhow are we paying for that?\n  One of the considerations that is in front of this body is to pay for \n$9 billion of this multiyear highway bill through a selloff of crude \noil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve--SPR.\n  I have come before this floor several times already during this \ndebate to try to convince colleagues that this is exactly the wrong way \nto address our transportation priorities by selling off a national \nenergy security priority; basically, an insurance policy that we have \nfor this country, an insurance policy to ensure that at the time that \nwe might be most vulnerable with our energy supplies, we have reserves, \nwe have a safety net we can turn to in the event of an emergency \nbrought about by a hurricane or natural disaster or whether it is a \nmanmade disaster, war or something else that has caused global \ndisruption.\n  In short, it boggles my mind that we would be willing, so willing and \nalmost eager, to tap into this strategic asset for such short-term and \nlimited gain. In the absence of supply disruption that justifies \nreleasing oil from the SPR, selling our strategic reserves only worsens \nan existing competitive disadvantage for our American oil producers.\n  As you know, we have in place an outdated 40-year-old-plus ban on our \nability to sell our domestic crude oil overseas. We are limited in our \nability to export that. I think that is a wrong and outdated policy, \nand I am working with many, including the occupant of the chair, to \nlift this outdated policy. I have introduced legislation to do just \nthat. We will actually have a bill before the banking committee \ntomorrow to, again, shed some light on the fact that it is so \nincredibly inconsistent from a policy perspective that we would be \ntalking about lifting the sanctions on Iran, allowing Iran to access \nthe broader global market so they can sell their oil reserves, so they \ncan take advantage of the resources that will come to them to do who \nknows what mischief, while at the same time prohibiting, further \nprohibiting in this country our oil producers that opportunity to \naccess the global market. By lifting the sanctions on Iran and keeping \nthe oil export ban in place in this country, we are effectively \nsanctioning our own U.S. oil producers. That is wrong. Again, we are \nworking to address that.\n  We are in a situation currently in which American companies cannot \nsell oil to the same countries that we let Iran sell its own oil to. \nNow, with this proposal in front of us to sell off some 101 million \nbarrels of oil from the SPR, we are potentially going to saturate a \nmarket that is already oversupplied. Think about what that means to \nthose in Oklahoma where the rig count in this country right now is down \nby half of what it was just last year. We are at a 5-year low with \nthat. Our market is oversaturated.\n  This morning I introduced yet another white paper out of the energy\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\ncommittee. It is entitled ``A Turbulent World: In Defense of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.'' This white paper outlines some of the \nhistory behind the SPR, why I feel so strongly and why I will continue \nto come to this floor to oppose the sale of 101 million barrels of oil \nfrom the SPR to pay for a portion of this highway bill.\n  Let's take a look at the history of when we have had emergency \ndrawdowns. We have had exactly three emergency drawdowns ever. The \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve has been in place since the mid-1970s. We \nhad a drawdown in 1991 with Desert Storm. We had a drawdown in 2005 \nwhen Hurricane Katrina hit and then in Libya in 2011 during their civil \nwar.\n  This red right here is the 101 million barrels that this legislation \nseeks to sell off--101 million barrels. The total amount of sales from \nemergency drawdowns ever combined is 58.9 million barrels.\n  What we are talking about doing is, in one act, taking 101 million \nbarrels and putting it out there on the market. In the 40 years that we \nhave had access to reserves in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we have \nhad three emergency drawdowns--one, a hurricane and, two, in the event \nof disruption for war, and together, all three of those totaled just \nshy of 60 million barrels. Yet this proposal is 101 million barrels.\n  We have exchanged oil out of the SPR a total of 12 times. This was in \nHurricanes Isaac, Katrina, Lili, Ivan, Gustav, and Ike. We have created \na home heating oil reserve. We have closed some ship channels for \naccidents. We have imported oil from Mexico. All of those exchanges, \nnot drawdowns, but all of those totaled only 68.9 million barrels. \nAgain, we are talking about a 101-million-barrel sale. We have also \ndone test sales. We have done three test sales. In 1985, in 1990, and \nthen in 2014. We have also closed down a reserve site--Weeks Island. We \nhave sold off some barrels for that. The total for all of that activity \nwas 15 million barrels for all four sales.\n  I have had people tell me: Oh, don't overreact here; don't overreact. \nThis is no different than what we did with the two sales in 1996 for \nFederal deficit reduction.\n  Let's look at that chart. In 1996, we had a deficit reduction in May, \nwhich is shown in blue, and then in October we did further reductions, \nand that is shown in green. Both of those sales totaled 23 million \nbarrels. Again, back in 1996, there was a total of 23 million, and what \nwe are looking at with this legislation is, again, a selloff of 101 \nmillion barrels. That is not even a fair comparison. Selling 101 \nmillion barrels would be the equivalent of 60 percent of all of the oil \nthat has ever left the SPR.\n  We have effectively taken out a total of 161 million barrels and \nmoved that out of this SPR since it was created in 1975, about 40 years \nago. We have had three emergency drawdowns, we have had the exchanges I \ntalked about, we had test sales, and then we had the sales in 1996 with \nthe Federal deficit reduction. If we take all of that together--\neverything in the history of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we \never sold off or exchanged--it brings us to 161 million barrels, and \nnow we are talking about selling 101 million barrels, which is 60 \npercent.\n  I think it is important to put into context because this is a big fat \ndeal. Yet we are acting like this is just another withdrawal from your \nATM. Just go down, check the balance, there is enough money in there so \nit must be OK.\n  Let's talk about the strategic environment we are operating in right \nnow. There is a nominal drawdown capacity of 4.4 million barrels per \nday. I mentioned this the last time I was on the floor. The drawdown \ncapacity is subject to some discussion in terms of what we are actually \nable to pump out, and that is why we do test sales. It is to make sure \nit works as it was designed.\n  Secretary of Energy Moniz has suggested that our distribution rate--\nour ability to move this once we take it out--is significantly less \nthan this nominal drawdown capacity of 4.4 million barrels due to \ncongestion and changes in midstream infrastructure. This is one of the \nreasons I have been banging the lectern, and Senator Cantwell, the \nranking member on the energy committee, has also been joining me in \nsaying that doing this is not appropriate. We have significant \nmaintenance issues within the SPR that we need to address. There is \nsomewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion that it is going to take \nto address some of the shortcomings we have in the SPR, some of the \nmaintenance and operations aspect of it. As we speak, there is a study \nunderway to determine the right size of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. What do we need to do in terms of maintenance?\n  If we go ahead and sell off 60 percent of what we have done \nhistorically throughout the whole lifetime of the SPR to fund a highway \nbill for 6 years--again, it just causes one to wonder why we are doing \nthis because of the strategic environment and the drawdown capacity we \nhave.\n  We have a pretty volatile world out there, and I think we all know \nthat. We have unplanned disruptions, unplanned production outages, if \nyou will, in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Nigeria, Libya, and Iran. \nThese are around 2.5 to 3 million barrels per day. These are pretty \ntense regions of the world, and I don't think anyone would dispute \nthat.\n  On the next chart what we see is our drawdown rate of 4.4 or \nthereabouts is greater than the daily production of Iran, Iraq, \nVenezuela, Nigeria, Algeria or Libya. I don't think anybody would \nsuggest that any of these countries in blue exudes stability or \nsecurity.\n  Look at the transit chokepoints. A drawdown rate of 4.4 million \nbarrels per day is bigger, in fairness, than the capacity of some of \nthe other areas that would be clearly noted as these chokepoints. We \nhave the Panama Canal at the end, the Turkish or Danish Straits, and \nBab el-Mandab off the coast of Yemen. If something went wrong in more \nthan one of these critical parts of the supply chain at once, we could \nbe overtaken by upheaval in the global oil market without much recourse \nand our ability to respond would be dramatically lessened. And 4.4 \nmillion barrels per day is less than the oil that transships the Suez \nCanal and its accompanying pipeline. It is a fraction of the oil that \ngoes through the Strait of Malacca or Strait of Hormuz which moves 15 \nto 17 million barrels per day.\n  This my central point. Our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a \ntremendous national security asset, and we need it because the world is \njust simply more turbulent. I have been told: Look at what is happening \ndomestically. We are importing less and producing more; therefore, we \ndon't really need all of this. We don't need this safety net. We cannot \nimmunize ourselves from global events and just suggest that somehow or \nother we need it less. It is like you go to the doctor and get a clean \nbill of health and you go home and you say: OK. Now I don't need life \ninsurance or health insurance because the doctor just said I am fine. \nYou know what. The world is not fine, and we know that. At a time when \nspare capacity is low and the global threat environment is heightened, \nselling 101 million barrels of America's strategic reserve to pay for \nlegislation that makes almost no contribution to improving our energy \nsecurity, I think, is just a foolish error of historic proportions.\n  I will restate what we would be doing if we moved forward with the \npay-for as has been outlined. We would be conducting the largest sale \nin the history of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve since it was created \nin 1975. It would be greater than all of the previous emergency \ndrawdowns combined. We are going into hurricane season. We don't know \nwhat may be coming at us in the Middle East. Yet we are proposing to \npay for a short-term fix to the highway trust fund with a buyout of \nunprecedented proportions.\n  Last time I was on the floor, I said this is like cashing out your \nhomeowner's insurance to pave your driveway. It is not the right pay-\nfor.\n  Again, I, too, want to make sure we do right by our transportation \ninfrastructure. It is important. It is about jobs and the strength of \nour economy, but we are also obligated to make sure the decisions we \nmake in this Senate--in this Congress--are there to provide for our \nsecurity as a nation.\n  I want to know that if we need these ready resources, we haven't \nmoved precipitously to sell them off. The last time I checked this \nmorning, the price of oil was at about $50 a barrel. Is this really a \ngood time to sell at $50 a barrel?\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his attention. I think those of us \nwho have been following this issue with great interest are concerned \nand are conflicted because we want to make sure we do right by our \nhighway systems, but I also want to make sure we do right by our \nnational energy security, and selling off 101 million barrels of \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve is foolhardy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n876 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 876) to amend Title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act to require hospitals to provide certain \n     notifications to individuals classified by such hospitals \n     under observation status rather than admitted as inpatients \n     of such hospitals.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate passage of H.R. 876, \nthe Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care \nEligibility, NOTICE, Act. Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas \nintroduced H.R. 876. Senator Enzi and I introduced an identical \ncompanion bill in the Senate, S. 1349, which the Finance Committee \nreported unanimously by voice vote on June 24, 2015. This important \nlegislation requires hospitals to give notice to Medicare beneficiaries \nwho are classified as ``outpatient observation'' status\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nfor more than 24 hours rather than being admitted to the hospital as \ninpatients. Being classified as ``outpatient observation'' status may \nresult in higher out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries and \nmakes those beneficiaries ineligible for Medicare coverage of post-\nacute care in a skilled nursing facility after they are discharged from \nthe hospital.\n  The use of ``outpatient observation'' status has become more \nprevalent in recent years, and the duration of these ``outpatient \nobservation'' stays has grown longer--meaning that an increasing number \nof Medicare beneficiaries are spending more and more time in the \nhospital without being admitted as inpatients. According to the \nDepartment of Health & Human Services's, HHS, inspector general, in \n2012, Medicare beneficiaries had more than 600,000 ``outpatient \nobservation'' stays that lasted 3 nights or more.\n  These ``outpatient observation'' stays can have serious financial \nconsequences for seniors. Medicare beneficiaries classified as \n``outpatient observation'' status are responsible for outpatient co-\npayments and prescription drug costs that they would not have had as an \ninpatient--and there is no out-of-pocket cap on these costs. Perhaps \nmost importantly, Medicare will only cover post-acute care in a skilled \nnursing facility, SNF, if the beneficiary had 3 consecutive days of \nhospitalization as an inpatient--even though ``outpatient observation'' \npatients may spend multiple nights in the hospital and receive the same \ntype and level of care as inpatients. This means Medicare beneficiaries \nclassified as ``outpatient observation'' status who require skilled \nnursing care after discharge from the hospital must pay the entire cost \nthemselves--an average out-of-pocket cost of more than $10,000 per \nbeneficiary.\n  Understandably, Medicare beneficiaries spending several nights in the \nhospital often simply assume that they have been admitted as \ninpatients. Many seniors are unaware that they have actually been \nclassified as ``outpatient observation'' status and what that means in \nterms of the financial consequences for them and their families. In \nsome cases, these seniors only become aware of their ``outpatient \nobservation'' status after they receive a bill from the nursing home \nfor tens of thousands of dollars.\n  Under the NOTICE Act, within 36 hours or, if sooner, upon discharge, \nhospitals are required to provide written notice to the Medicare \nbeneficiary explaining, No. 1, that he or she has been classified as an \noutpatient under observation status, instead of being admitted as an \ninpatient; No. 2, the reason for that classification; and, No. 3, the \nimplications on cost-sharing and eligibility for Medicare coverage of \npost-acute care in a skilled nursing facility.\n  The NOTICE Act is a no-cost, commonsense approach that will help \nensure our seniors are fully informed about their hospital status and \nthe financial implications. I thank my colleagues for joining with me \nand Senator Enzi to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 876) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5921-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the city of Muncie on \nits 150th anniversary and to recognize the many contributions of \nMuncie's citizens to the great State of Indiana and to our country.\n  Muncie's history dates to the 1790s when the Lenape Native Americans \nsettled the area and named it Wapicamikunk. As early European settlers \nmoved into the area, it was named Munsee Town after the dialect of the \nLenape Native Americans, who spoke Munsee. When it was incorporated in \n1865, Munsee Town became the city of Muncie.\n  The gas boom helped establish the city of Muncie as an important \nmanufacturing center for the Nation. In 1880, the Ball brothers founded \nBall Corporation where they specialized in manufacturing glass bottles. \nThe company was moved from Buffalo, NY to Muncie in 1887 to take \nadvantage of the ample amounts of available natural gas. The Ball \nCorporation provided jobs, local business funding, and philanthropy \nthat propelled Muncie into a thriving city.\n  As business boomed for the Ball Corporation, new businesses opened \nand Muncie grew. In the early 1900s, manufacturing and industrial \ncompanies including Delco Battery, New Venture Gear, BorgWarner, and \nGeneral Motors opened factories and businesses in Muncie. Muncie is \nalso home to one of the famous early 20th century ``Middletown'' \nstudies, which helped to measure social trends in the U.S.; Muncie is \nconsidered one of most studied communities in the country. Over the \nyears, the city continued to grow and innovate with the addition of \nrailroads, higher education institutions, and health care facilities.\n  Today, Muncie is one of the 10 largest cities in Indiana with a \npopulation of more than 70,000 citizens. Top attractions in the Muncie \narea include the north Walnut Street Fieldhouse, Emens Auditorium, \nhistoric downtown Muncie, the National Model Aviation Museum, the \nCardinal Greenway trail system, Minnetrista Cultural Center, and Ball \nState University.\n  Ball State opened in 1899 as a small, private teacher training \nschool. The university was founded in 1918. Ball State attracts \nstudents from around the Nation and 43 different countries, and is \ncurrently one of the top employers in the city of Muncie. Ball State is \nhome to about 21,000 current students in undergraduate and graduate \nprograms, and it recently experienced the largest 5-year increase in \non-time graduation rates of any Indiana public institution of higher \neducation. A report released by the Indiana Commission for Higher \nEducation found that between 2009-2014, Ball State's 4-year graduation \nrates increased by 12.1 percentage points. Distinguished Ball State \ngraduates include David Letterman, former host of CBS's Late Show and \nJim Davis, creator of the iconic comic strip Garfield--recognized as \nthe world's most widely-syndicated comic strip. With the addition of \nIvy Technology Community College and Harrison College, Muncie has shown \na continued commitment to higher education.\n  The city of Muncie reflects our Hoosier values, and its citizens \nserve as an example of how hard work and dedication lead to success, \nopportunity, and prosperity. It is a great honor to represent the city \nof Muncie in the Senate. On behalf of the State of Indiana, I \ncongratulate each and every citizen of Muncie on the city's 150th \nanniversary and wish you continued success and prosperity in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5923-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ORFORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE 250TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Orford, NH--\na town in Grafton County celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in \nrecognizing this historic occasion.\n  Orford village is the town's main population center and is situated \nalong the Connecticut River. The town lies in the shadow of Sunday \nMountain, Cottonstone Mountain, and Mount Cube--Orford's highest peak. \nThe Appalachian Trail runs through the summit of Mount Cube, greatly \ncontributing to the town's natural and scenic treasures.\n  The town of Orford is named for Robert Walpole, first earl of Orford, \nand England's first Prime Minister. It was originally chartered by \nColonial Governor Benning Wentworth in 1761 and later settled in 1765.\n  The rich agricultural history of Orford is exemplified by the success \nof the Mt. Cube Sugar Farm. For over 60 years, the Thomson family has \nbeen producing its award-winning maple syrup from the groves located on \nthe farm's namesake mountain.\n  Orford also boasts an impressive industrial past, including soapstone \nquarries, sawmills, a tannery, grist mill, and factories that \nmanufactured starch, chairs, doors, boots and shoes. The town is known \nfor its historic ``ridge'' homes and is credited with having one of the \nfinest collections of federal-style houses in the Nation.\n  As innovators, statesmen and soldiers, Orford residents have been \nknown throughout history for their commitment and sacrifice in the \nservice of our great Nation. Early steamship pioneer Samuel Morey, U.S. \nCongressman Jeduthun Wilcox, Senators Gilman Marston and Leonard \nWilcox, and most notably, New Hampshire's 73rd Governor Meldrim \nThomson, Jr., all share ties to Orford.\n  On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am pleased to offer my \ncongratulations to the citizens of Orford on reaching this special \nmilestone, and I thank them for their many contributions to the life \nand spirit of New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5923-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5923-S5924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RICHARD LAPOINT\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nexceptional public service of my good friend, Pittsburg Police Chief \nRichard ``Dick'' Lapoint. Chief Lapoint has worked as a Pittsburg, NH \nlaw enforcement officer for more than 40 years. He is retiring on \nAugust 16, 2015, the day after Pittsburg's 175th Old Home Day \ncelebration.\n  Chief Lapoint is a 1968 graduate of Pittsburg High School, and first \nbegan his law enforcement career as a part-time officer in August 1975. \nAfter working part-time for 11 years, he became a sergeant, and was \nlater promoted to the department's full-time chief on January 16, 1987. \nHaving held the position for more than 28 years, Chief Lapoint is one \nof the longest serving police chiefs in the Granite State.\n  Throughout his career, Chief Lapoint has established a reputation not \nonly as a knowledgeable, respected, and compassionate public safety \nprofessional, but also as an engaged community member. Chief Lapoint \nknows that in a small town, public safety means wearing many hats. He \nwas a member of the fire department for 36 years and an emergency \nmedical technician for over 20 years. Known for his advocacy of \ncooperative North Country policing, he was a leader in uniting local, \ncounty, State, and Federal agencies to share information, train, and \nwork together. He also served as the president of the Coos County \nChiefs Association, and has built strong partnerships with colleagues \nthroughout the public safety community.\n  During my time as New Hampshire's attorney general, it was my \nprivilege to work directly with Chief Lapoint on many important law \nenforcement initiatives.

The loss of Patrolman Wilding is a tragedy for the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, but the legacy of his bravery and \nselfless service to the people of Scranton will live on.\n  Born in Scranton, Patrolman Wilding dedicated his career to \nprotecting and serving others. Prior to joining the Scranton Police \nDepartment in 2014, he worked at St. Joseph's Center, Dunbar Armored \nand Lackawanna College, where he built personal connections throughout \nthe community that greatly influenced his service on the police force. \nHe was well-known for his compassionate demeanor, respectful \nleadership, and love of his community. He loved his family fiercely, \ntaking every opportunity to spend time with his wife Kristen, and \nchildren Loa Mae and Sidney.\n  Though Patrolman Wilding's life and career in public safety were cut \nshort, we are all grateful for his dedicated service to Pennsylvania. \nHe set a wonderful example of community activism for his children and \nhe will be remembered for his bravery and humility. My thoughts and \nprayers are with his family and friends during this difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5925-8", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5925-S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            STENNIS CENTER PROGRAM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INTERNS\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this summer marks the 13th year \nduring which Congressional office interns have benefitted from a \nprogram operated by the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service \nLeadership. This 6-week program is designed to enhance the internship \nexperience for exceptional college students by giving them an inside \nlook at how Congress works and a deeper appreciation and understanding \nfor the role that Congress plays in our democracy. Each week, the \ninterns meet with senior congressional staff and other experts to \ndiscuss issues including the legislative process, the constitutional \npower of the purse, our government's separation of powers, the media, \nand other topics.\n  Interns are selected based on their college records, community \nservice experience, and interest in a career in public service.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize Caley Clark, an \neducator from White Sulphur Springs, MT. Ms. Clark has recently been \nchosen from among more than 300 other applicants to participate this \nweek in the Library of Congress' Teaching with Primary Sources Summer \nTeacher Institute.\n  Every year, the Library of Congress hosts five teacher institutes in \nWashington, DC for a select number of K-12 educators from across the \nNation. During the Library's Teaching with Primary Sources Summer \nTeacher Institute, Ms. Clark will work with education specialists and \nsubject-matter experts about how to best utilize primary sources in the \nclassroom. In doing so, she will explore the world's largest online \ncollection of historical artifacts, and will be able to access millions \nof unique primary source documents for her work as an educator.\n  Teaching with primary source documents is an effective way of \neducating students not just about the history that these firsthand \nsources give us, but also helps students to develop important skills \nlike critical thinking. Ms. Clark will have the opportunity to bring \nwhat she has learned at the Library of Congress back to her students \nand colleagues at White Sulphur Springs School. I am proud to call Ms. \nClark a fellow Montanan, and to recognize her achievement and her \ncontribution to the students of our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5926-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KATIE DECKER\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize \nPrincipal Katie Decker for her unwavering dedication to the Clark \nCounty School District and to the Las Vegas community. Her \ncontributions to the local school district have had tremendous positive \nimpacts, which will be felt by future generations of Clark County \nstudents for years to come.\n  Throughout her 25 years in the district, Principal Decker has worked \ntirelessly to give students the best opportunity for success. She \ncurrently serves as principal of two different elementary schools, \nWalter Bracken STEAM Academy, Bracken, and Long Elementary School, \nsplitting her days to spend time at each individual institution. Her \nwork at Bracken has been recognized nationally, as Bracken has been \nnamed a 2015 Merit School of Excellence. Along with this outstanding \nachievement, Principal Decker was awarded the Magnet Schools of America \nPrincipal of the Year in 2013, the Terrel Bell Award for Outstanding \nLeadership, and locally by United Way Women's Leadership for commitment \nto financial stability in 2015. April 15 has also been named ``Katie \nDecker Day'' by the city of Las Vegas. No amount of recognition could \nadequately thank Principal Decker for all that she has done.\n  When Principal Decker initially began at Bracken, the elementary \nschool was one of the lowest performing schools in the district. She \nworked to improve the climate and academics of the school, spearheading \nthe development of unique magnet programs. Bracken is now a five-star \nBlue Ribbon magnet school and is one of the top schools offered in the \nNation. Recently, a local initiative began to incorporate techniques \nfrom highly performing schools, also referred to as franchise schools, \ninto poorly performing schools. Principals from franchise schools were \nselected to lead poorly performing schools, ultimately introducing \nsuccessful programs into the curriculum. Principal Decker was one of \ntwo principals chosen to participate in the initiative and has been \nassigned to Long Elementary School, where she is working to bring \nconsistency to the schools she leads and greater opportunity to all of \nher students. It is because of her consistent academic success with her \nstudents that the franchise initiative began. Her Piggy Bank Program \nwas utilized at Bracken and will be expanded to her Franchise School \nWalter Long STEAM Academy in the fall. Principal Decker has also worked \nto bring improvement to schools across the district by providing \nmentoring and administrative help. She teaches student climate classes \nto administrators, counselors, and teachers and has shared her \nleadership experience at the State of Nevada Mega Conference. She has \nalso presented her ideas on innovative programs to schools across the \ncountry for over 10 years. Her great list of accomplishments is \nlegendary in the Clark County community and remains invaluable to local \nstudents.\n  As a father of four children who attended Nevada's public schools and \nas the husband of a life long teacher, I understand the important role \nthat educational institutions play in enriching the lives of Nevada's \nstudents. Ensuring that America's youth are prepared to compete in the \n21st century is critical for the future of our country. The State of \nNevada is fortunate to be home to an educator like Principal Decker, \nwhose mission is to prepare our children for their futures.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Principal \nDecker for her dedication to enriching the lives of Nevada's students \nand congratulating her on her many achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5926-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5926-S5927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING KEN FURLONG\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate \nCarson City sheriff Ken Furlong on being named the\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nD.A.R.E Law Enforcement Executive of the Year. It gives me great \npleasure to see him receive this prestigious award after years of hard \nwork within the local community.\n  Sheriff Furlong was born and raised in Carson City. In 1975, he \ngraduated from Carson High School and enlisted into the U.S. Air Force \nin 1978. Throughout his service, Sheriff Furlong earned associate \ndegrees in political science and criminal justice, as well as a \nbachelor's degree in criminal justice administration. He retired from \nthe U.S. Air Force, Office of Special Investigation in 1998 and began \nwork with the Nevada Department of Public Safety, Investigations \nDivision and Parole Probation. In 2003, he was elected to the Office of \nSheriff and has continued to serve the local community in this role \never since.\n  The D.A.R.E Law Enforcement Executive of the Year is awarded each \nyear by D.A.R.E America and the Drug Enforcement Agency to recognize \nlaw enforcement officers who go above and beyond in drug prevention and \nenforcement. Sheriff Furlong reinstated the D.A.R.E Program during his \nfirst term in office and has consistently worked to improve the \ninitiative throughout his tenure, heavily involving local schools and \nthe community. He has expanded the program to cover several topics \npertaining to positive decisions in addition to substance abuse. His \ndedication and commitment to shaping positive futures for Carson City \nstudents is undeniable. The efforts made by Sheriff Furlong and the \nCarson City Sheriff's Office are truly admirable, standing as an \nexample to neighboring communities. Along with the award, Sheriff \nFurlong will receive $1,000 that he has decided to put back towards the \nD.A.R.E America Program.\n  I also commend each contributing organization that has made this \nimportant program possible, including Grocery Outlet, the Emblem Club, \nNorthern Nevada Coin, the Elks, the Eagles, and the Downtown Business \nAssociation, as well as the local schools that have facilitated the \nD.A.R.E Program. Through the help of local funding, students learn \nabout peer pressure, resistance strategies, internet use, safety, \nbullying, violence prevention, and the value in making wise choices. \nThe Carson City Sheriff's Office provides numerous activities and \neducational opportunities throughout the year to compliment the \ncurriculum and further inform students. This initiative is truly a \nreflection of Carson City's strong and dedicated community.\n  Throughout his tenure, Sheriff Furlong has demonstrated \nprofessionalism, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the \nhighest standards of the Carson City Sheriff's Department. This program \ncould not have achieved its success without Sheriff Furlong's hard \nwork. I am honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow \nNevadan. Today, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nSheriff Furlong on receiving this award, and I give my deepest \nappreciation for all that he has done to educate our local students on \nthese important topics. I offer him my best wishes on the D.A.R.E \nProgram and in his role to keep Carson City safe for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5927-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING CARRIE HAIR AND JAN HRINDO\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Carrie \nHair and Jan Hrindo on receiving the Presidential Awards for Excellence \nin Mathematics and Science Teaching. These awards are truly \nprestigious, attained by only the most influential educators across the \ncountry. The Silver State is fortunate to have both of these successful \nteachers working at local schools.\n  The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science \nTeaching are considered the Nation's highest honor for kindergarten \nthrough high school mathematics and science educators. These teachers \nstand as role models to their colleagues and are dedicated to the \nsuccess of Nevada's future generations, particularly in encouraging \nstudents to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math. The \nfirst teachers to receive these awards were selected in 1983, with 108 \nrecognized annually. These educators go above and beyond in their local \nschools to implement unique, high-quality curriculum to help students \nexcel in their learning. I am thankful to both Ms. Hair and Mrs. Hrindo \nfor their invaluable educational contributions.\n  Mrs. Hrindo has been very influential in the lives of students, \nteaching for a total of 20 years. She has spent the last 15 years at \nIncline Elementary and Incline Middle School, teaching a variety of \ndifferent science classes. She also taught at Sierra Nevada College for \nseveral years, serving as a mentor to preservice teachers. Mrs. Hrindo \ncurrently teaches sixth grade earth science, seventh grade life \nscience, and eighth grade Spanish. Her vast range of knowledge is truly \ninspirational. She is most recognized for her hands-on labs and \nactivities that provide students with a unique learning experience and \nfor incorporating science into her students' lives outside the walls of \nthe classroom. She has also administrated community science events and \nscience fair workshops. Mrs. Hrindo's work is truly commendable.\n  Ms. Hair has been a mathematics teacher for 15 years. Her past 4 \nyears have been spent teaching seventh and eighth grade students in \nReno at Darrell C. Swope Middle School, a highly successful magnet \nschool. Ms. Hair was a key contributor in developing the curriculum \nincorporated at several middle magnet schools in Washoe County School \nDistrict, which aims to enrich student knowledge at an accelerated \npace. Ms. Hair is also an active member in the Nevada Math Council and \nthe Northern Nevada Math Council and presents workshops at regional \nconferences. Her work is greatly appreciated.\n  As a father of four children who attended Nevada's public schools, \nand as the husband of a life-long teacher, I understand the important \nrole that teachers play in enriching the lives of Nevada's students. \nEnsuring that America's youth are prepared to compete in the 21st \ncentury is critical for the future of our country.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the National \nWomen's Law Center for its longtime leadership and tireless commitment \nto expanding opportunities for women, girls, and families. The law \ncenter's advocacy has made a difference in countless lives for more \nthan 40 years, and I have been proud to work with its members on many \nissues during my time in the Senate.\n  On July 30, the Coalition on Human Needs will honor the law center as \nits 2015 Human Needs Hero, recognizing years of research, analysis, \nadvocacy, and litigation on a wide range of issues at the State and \nFederal levels. Since its inception in 1972, the law center has been a \ntireless advocate for women, children, families, and those Americans \nmost in need. It has been at the forefront of many important policy \ninitiatives and a source of insightful information that is essential to \npromoting and enacting good public policy.\n  Over the years, I have been proud to work with the law center on \nimportant programs and policies--from affordable childcare to expanding \ntax credits for low- and moderate-income families, increasing the \nminimum wage, and narrowing the wage gap. The law center's outreach and \nhard work have educated grassroots advocates and helped convey their \nviews to policymakers for over 40 years--it is truly an invaluable \nresource.\n  As a determined and committed defender of the needs of women and \nfamilies, the law center has earned the admiration of fellow advocacy \norganizations, the respect of its ideological opponents, and the trust \nof members of this body, including myself. I congratulate the National \nWomen's Law Center for receiving this important award recognizing its \nhard work and commitment to social justice. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work together for years to come.\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5928-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5928-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5928-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 5:42 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1626.

Mr. KIRK:\n  S. 1863. A bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Timothy \nNugent, in recognition of his pioneering work on behalf of people with \ndisabilities, including disabled veterans; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 25th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, as well as \nTimothy Nugent, who has spent the past 70 years as a relentless \ninnovator and tireless advocate for disabled people across the country. \nTogether with Congressman Rodney Davis, I have introduced a bill that \nwould award Mr. Nugent with the Congressional Gold Medal. Mr. Nugent \nand the ADA have helped millions of Americans live better, more \nproductive lives, improving the United States overall, and making us an \nexample for the world to follow.\n  Timothy Nugent saw a need for services and accommodations for \ndisabled servicemen when they came home from the battlefields of World \nWar II. Mr. Nugent founded the first higher educational program for \nwounded and disabled soldiers in the world, and he confronted the bias \nof the general public by bringing students with disabilities into the \nmainstream of college campuses and societies. Because of Mr. Nugent's \nleadership and commitment, the University of Illinois built \naccommodations for the disabled veteran and created a hospitable \nenvironment for our Nation's greatest heroes, providing them the same \neducational opportunities as others. He also disproved many in the \nmedical community who believed that either rehabilitation and sporting \nactivities were harmful to individuals with severe disabilities or that \neducation was not necessary because of the beliefs at the time was that \nthe lifespan of persons with spinal cord injuries would be too short \nfor them to benefit from college degrees.\n  Many of the architectural accessibility standards and laws of the \nUnited States, including the welcoming Americans with Disabilities Act, \ntrace back directly to innovations created by Nugent. I know firsthand \nhow important this law and Mr. Nugent's actions are to the University \nof Illinois and the community of 50 million Americans living with a \ndisabilities. Laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act allow all \nAmericans to live life on their own terms, and Mr. Nugent's work on \nbehalf of these individuals is well-deserving of the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/27/senate-section/article/S5932-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 230--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 25, 2015, AS ``NATIONAL \n                             LOBSTER DAY''\n\n  Mr. KING (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. \nReed, Ms. Ayotte, and Mr. Murphy) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (C) simple maintenance of the current condition and \n     configuration of the Interstate System is insufficient for \n     the System to fully serve the transportation needs of the \n     United States for the next 50 years.\n       (b) Future Interstate System Study.--Not later than 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall enter into an agreement with the Transportation \n     Research Board of the National Academies to conduct a study \n     on the actions needed to upgrade and restore the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways \n     to its role as a premier system network that meets the \n     growing and shifting demands of the 21st century and for the \n     next 50 years (referred to in this section as the ``study'').\n       (c) Methodologies.--In conducting the study, the \n     Transportation Research Board shall build on the \n     methodologies examined and recommended in the report prepared \n     for the American Association of State Highway and \n     Transportation Officials entitled ``National Cooperative \n     Highway Research Program Project 20-24(79): Specifications \n     for a National Study of the Future 3R, 4R, and Capacity Needs \n     of the Interstate System'' and dated December 2013.\n       (d) Recommendations.--The study--\n       (1) shall include specific recommendations regarding the \n     features, standards, capacity needs, application of \n     technologies, and intergovernmental roles to upgrade the \n     Interstate System, including any revisions to law (including \n     regulations) that the Transportation Research Board \n     determines appropriate to achieve the goals; and\n       (2) is encouraged to build on the robust institutional \n     knowledge in the highway industry in applying the techniques \n     involved in implementing the study.\n       (e) Considerations.--In carrying out the study, the \n     Transportation Research Board shall determine the need for \n     reconstruction and improvement of the Interstate System by \n     considering--\n       (1) future demands on transportation infrastructure \n     determined for national planning purposes, including \n     commercial and private traffic flows to serve future economic \n     activity and growth;\n       (2) the expected condition of the current Interstate System \n     over the next 50 years, including long-term deterioration and \n     reconstruction needs;\n       (3) those National Highway System routes that should be \n     added to the existing Interstate System to more efficiently \n     serve national traffic flows;\n       (4) features that would take advantage of technological \n     capabilities to address modern standards of construction, \n     maintenance, and operations, for purposes of safety, and \n     system management, taking into further consideration system \n     performance and cost; and\n       (5) the resources necessary to maintain and improve the \n     Interstate System, including the resources required to \n     upgrade those National Highway System routes identified in \n     paragraph (3) to Interstate standards.\n       (f) Consultation.--In carrying out the study, the \n     Transportation Research Board--\n       (1) shall convene and consult with a panel of national \n     experts including current and future owners, operators, and \n     users of the Interstate System and private sector \n     stakeholders;
