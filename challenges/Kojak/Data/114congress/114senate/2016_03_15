Mr. President, in the last national election, the \nAmerican people elected a Republican Senate. Since then, we have \naccomplished a lot of important things for our country--landmark \neducation reform, permanent tax relief for families and small \nbusinesses, significant action to repair America's roads and bridges--\nand, just last week, decisive steps to address the prescription opioid \nand heroin epidemic. The Republican Senate has been able to lead on \nmany important issues because we focused on areas where both sides can \nagree, rather than just fight about issues where we don't.\n  Everyone knows one issue where we don't agree; that is, whether the \nAmerican people deserve a voice in filling the current Supreme Court \nvacancy. Republicans think the people deserve a voice in this important \nvacancy. The President and Senate Democrats do not.\n  Whoever is chosen to fill the Supreme Court vacancy could radically \nchange the direction of the Court for a generation. The American people \nobviously deserve a voice in such an important conversation. They can \ncontinue making their voices heard, and we can continue doing our work \nin the Senate to move America forward on important issues.\n  Americans elected this Republican Senate to serve as a check-and-\nbalance to the President. It is natural that both parties will disagree \nin some areas. It is natural we will find common ground in others. \nLet's keep focused on those areas of common ground.\n  For instance, today I hope colleagues across the aisle will join us \nin working to protect middle-class families from unnecessary and unfair \nincreases in their food and grocery bills. Vermont passed food-labeling \nlegislation that will be implemented soon and could increase annual \nfood costs across America by more than $1,000 per family. It is one \nState's decision, but it could negatively affect families--especially \nlower and middle-income families--in other States. Now we see other \nStates following in Vermont's footsteps, which could lead to a \npatchwork of State laws. We should work to protect America's middle \nclass from the unfair higher food prices that could result, and that is \njust what the Senate is working to do now.\n  We know this may be the last chance to stop this economic blow to the \nmiddle class, but we can't act if colleagues block us from helping the \nmiddle class. As our Democratic colleagues know, we are eager to \ncontinue working toward a solution. I would encourage our colleagues \nacross the aisle to work with the bill managers to offer the amendments \nor alternative proposals they may have.\n  The commonsense, bipartisan legislation offered by Chairman Pat \nRoberts of the Agriculture Committee would set clear, science-based \nstandards in order to prevent families from being unfairly hurt by a \npatchwork of conflicting State and local labeling laws passed in places \nwhere they don't even live. This bipartisan bill would help meet \nconsumer interest for information about how food is made, while keeping \ncosts from rising at every level of production. It has earned the \nsupport of more than 650 groups nationally, including farmers and small \nbusinesses. As Kentucky's agriculture commissioner put it, this \nbipartisan bill would ``allow for a more efficient flow of food to \nconsumers everywhere and would cut down on production costs.''\n  We know this is not a safety or health issue. It is a market issue. \nOfficials at both USDA and the FDA--the two agencies charged with \nensuring the safety and delivery of our Nation's food supply--have \nfound there are no health, safety, or nutritional risks associated with \nbioengineered crops and products. At the same time, we recognize that \nmany families have a desire to know what is in the food they are \npurchasing. That is why the legislation Chairman Roberts is working on \nwould offer incentives for the marketplace to provide more information \nto\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\nconsumers while also addressing many of the unintended consequences of \na patchwork of State laws. I thank Senator Roberts for his continued \nwork with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to move to a solution \nthis week.\n  The Agriculture Committee recently passed the chairman's mark by a \nbipartisan vote, and the House passed its own legislation last summer. \nNow it is time for the full Senate to act so we can protect the middle \nclass from higher food costs, and with continued cooperation from \nacross the aisle, that is just what we can do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1476-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 90 percent of Americans want to know what is \nin their food. All of Europe, China, Russia, they know what is in their \nfood. We should know what is in our food. Senator Stabenow, the ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, has been trying to work to come up \nwith some reasonable approach, but what she has gotten is not much help \nfrom the chair of the committee. There are no discussions going on \nright now that are meaningful. The Republican leader has offered an \namendment that is a purely voluntary scheme, which is a quasi-Roberts \nproposal and would leave consumers actually in the dark, and that is \nthe truth. But this is just another case of where Republicans in the \nSenate are trying to create an appearance of doing something without \nreally doing anything at all. It happens so often. This has happened so \noften during the past year. Things that my friend the Republican leader \ncomes to the floor and boasts about are things we tried to do and we \nwere blocked by Republican filibusters. We have been happy in the \nminority to be responsible and work with the Republicans to get things \ndone, and we continue to do that. It is the right thing for the \ncountry. We are not trying to block everything, as they in fact did. We \nare trying to get things done.\n  One of the things we need to get done that belies the fact of this \ngreat Senate Republican majority is the fact that we think there should \nbe a Supreme Court Justice. There should be 9, not 8.\n  One hundred years ago today, this very day, this Senate concluded the \nconfirmation hearing of Justice Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish \nSupreme Court Justice ever. Prior to his nomination, it was not a \ncustom for the Senate to hold public confirmation hearings to set up \nSupreme Court nominations, but over the last century these hearings \nhave become a vital part of the Senate's constitutional duty to provide \nits advice and consent. For 100 years, the Senate has had open hearings \nto deal with controversies--real or imagined--surrounding Supreme Court \nvacancies and nominees.\n  It is disappointing that Republicans are now willing to throw away a \ncentury of transparency and deliberation just to block President \nObama's Supreme Court nominee. Republicans will not even meet with this \nman or this woman. Republicans will not allow a hearing for this man or \nthis woman. Republicans will not allow a vote on this man or this \nwoman, and that is wrong. We want transparency on what is going on here \nwith the Supreme Court. We want transparency on the food we eat.\n  They are adamant that President Obama's nominee will have nothing--no \nopening hearing, no public hearing, no hearing at all. It is further \nevidence of how far Republicans will go to avoid their constitutional \nduties.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor to speak, so I ask the Chair \nto announce the schedule of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1476-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of you know that in my real life I am \na farmer. I know where my food comes from and how it is made. \nUnfortunately, that is not true for most Americans.\n  We will be dealing with a bill called the DARK Act shortly, and quite \nfrankly the DARK Act does not empower America's consumers. It does not \ntell them what is in the packaged food they purchase, and it doesn't \ngive them any information when we are dealing with genetically modified \ningredients.\n  I was told that the customer is always right. If you are a good \nbusinessman, you listen to your customers. In this particular case, the \ncustomer has a right to know what is in their food. In fact, they \nexpect it because 9 out of 10 consumers say they want labeling for \ngenetically engineered foods. Some of the folks in this body are not \nlistening to the customers. They are not listening to their \nconstituents. Instead, they are listening to the big corporations that \nwant to keep consumers in the dark, and we cannot allow that to happen \nin this body today. The Senate is above that.\n  Transparency in everything leaves better accountability and gives \nmore power to average Americans, and that is also true when we talk \nabout food. Free markets work when consumers have access to \ninformation. The U.S. Senate should not be in the business of hiding \ninformation from consumers.\n  Let's be clear. What the new DARK Act, which is sponsored by the \nSenator from Kansas, does is it tells the American people: We in the \nSenate know what is best for you, and quite frankly, whether you want \nthis information or not, you are not going to get it.\n  How does this DARK Act do this? First of all, it blocks the States \nfrom enforcing their own laws, so we can throw States' rights out the \nwindow. Second, this ``compromise'' would hide the information behind \n800 numbers and QR codes.\n  Let me tell you, if you think this is labeling, if you think this is \ngiving the consumer a right to know what is in their food, you are \nwrong. This is a game. And for the mom who wants to know what is in her \nchild's cereal or soup or bread, there may be a bunch of different 800 \nnumbers out there, and I don't know about you, but when it comes to \nphone numbers, especially the older I get, the harder it is for me to \nremember. Or you will stand in a grocery store aisle and scan each \nindividual product with a smartphone, if you have a smartphone and if \nyou have cell phone coverage at that location, because, quite frankly, \nin rural America, we don't in a lot of places. And that is going to be \nthe labeling. Unbelievable.\n  The fact is, if folks are so proud of the GMOs, they should label \nthem. What they are saying is you can voluntarily do it. Frankly, \nvoluntary standards are no standards at all. If they were standards, we \nwould say to the super PACs: Tell us who you get your money from. Tell \nus what you are spending it on, why you are spending it. We don't know \nthat. We don't know that in our elections, by the way, which puts our \ndemocracy at risk, and we won't know about our food if this DARK Act \npasses.\n  There are 64 countries out there that require GMO labeling. China, \nRussia, and Saudi Arabia are not exactly transparent countries, but \nthey are requiring GMO labeling. Vermont passed a GMO labeling law that \nwould go in effect in July. Maine and Connecticut have passed mandatory \nlabeling laws. There are numerous States that require things like farm-\nraised or wild-\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\ncaught. FDA, in fact, even regulates terms such as ``fresh'' and \n``fresh frozen.''\n  Some of the proponents of the DARK Act will say: Well, you know, \nfolks from California and Washington defeated it when it was on the \nballot.\n  Yes, they did. Let me give you some figures. In Washington, more than \n$20 million was spent in opposition to the labeling law--more than $20 \nmillion. By the way, about $600 of that came from Washington residents, \naccording to the Washington Post. About $7 million was in support of \nthat campaign, with at least $1.6 million of that $7 million coming \nfrom Washington residents.\n  In California, the opponents to labeling our food with GMOs spent \nabout $45 million to defeat it. Monsanto alone spent $8 million of that \n$45 million. Supporters of the labeling spent about $7 million.\n  So let's be clear. When people have a choice to vote and get the \nfacts, they want their food labeled. This DARK Act does exactly the \nopposite. It is bad legislation. It does not empower consumers. It does \nnot empower the American people. In fact, it does what the title of \nthis bill says: Keep them in the dark. That is not what the U.S. Senate \nshould be about. We need to defeat this bill, whether it is through the \ncloture process or later on. This is bad, bad, bad policy.\n  I yield my time to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, will my colleague from Montana yield for \na question?\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you. I appreciate the Senator's presentation.\n  This Monsanto DARK Act 2.0--this new version--says to the States that \nthey no longer have the right to respond to consumers' interest in \nproviding a consumer-friendly label that alerts them to genetically \nengineered ingredients, but it does not replace that with a federal \nconsumer-friendly label?\n  Mr. TESTER. Correct.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Is it right that the Federal Government takes away this \npower from States, which are, if you will, our places of \nexperimentation and creativity, and then does nothing at the national \nlevel? Is this an overreach of the Federal Government?\n  Mr. TESTER. Absolutely. The Senator came out of the State Legislature \nin Oregon. I came out of the State Legislature in Montana. Quite \nfrankly, much of the work is done at the State level. We follow their \nlead. This bill does exactly the opposite. It prevents States from \nlabeling for genetically modified foods, and it replaces it with a \nvoluntary labeling system basically or QR codes that nobody is going to \nhave the technology, quite frankly, or the time to be able to \ninvestigate. So the Senator is right. This tells folks in Vermont and \nMaine and Connecticut and many other States--as I said, 9 out of 10 \nconsumers want genetically modified foods labeled, and this replaces it \nbasically with nothing.\n  The proponents will walk out here and say: No, no, no, there is going \nto be a QR code or 800 number. That simply does not give the consumers \nthe ability to know what is in their food. We live in a very fast-paced \nsociety. I can tell you, it happened just this weekend when I was home. \nI pulled up in a pickup. My wife ran in the grocery store, grabbed what \nshe needed, came out, and we zipped home. People don't have the time to \nlook unless it is sitting right there and they can see it. And that is \nwhat your bill does, I say to Senator Merkley. Your bill gives the \nconsumer the ability to simply look at the package and know what is in \nit, and that is what we should be fighting for in this body. We \nshouldn't be fighting to keep people in the dark; we should fight to \nlet people know so they can make good decisions. If you have good \ninformation--and it is true here and it is true amongst the American \npublic--if you have good information, you can make good decisions. When \nparents buy food for their kids, they ought to have the information so \nthey can make good decisions. It is simply a right to know what is in \nyour food.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleague from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I will use these papers as examples of food products. I have three \ndifferent bags of rice, and I want to look. I can scan the ingredients \nlist of these three products to see what they contain. Well, in about 5 \nseconds--if what is required of me is to pull out my phone, call up an \n800 number, work my way through a phone tree, proceed to talk to \nsomeone who may or may not even know what I am calling about--and maybe \nI will get a busy signal or a message that says: I am sorry, our phone \nlines are very busy, but we will get to you in 25 minutes. How long am \nI going to have to stand there versus the 5 seconds that it takes if \nthere is a symbol or an indication on the ingredients panel for these \nthree products? While standing in the aisle of the grocery store, how \nlong is it going to take me to try to find out if these three products \nhave genetically engineered ingredients?\n  Mr. TESTER. Well, you said it. For the people who heard you explain \nthe process you would go through, that is not labeling. That is not \ntransparency. That isn't telling folks what is in their food.\n  Needless to say, I have to tell you, I think these are a pain in the \nneck. If I wasn't in this body, I don't think I would even have one, \nand there are a lot of people who feel that way. So now I am going to \nhave to spend money and get a plan so I can determine what is in my \nfood? Not everybody has the resources to have one of these. What does \nthis do to folks who are poor? They deserve to have the food that they \nwant to eat. They deserve to know what is in it. And they are not going \nto have that capacity. Then what about folks in places such as eastern \nWashington or all of Montana that isn't where a lot of people live? \nOftentimes there is not that service. So it just does not make any \nsense. You are trying to replace what Vermont is doing with nothing, \nand that is not fair. It is not fair to the consumers.\n  As I said in my remarks, the consumer is always right. They are. It \nis a fact of business. We ought to be listening to folks. That is why \nwe have single-digit approval ratings in this body. We need to listen. \nAnd we are not listening with the DARK Act.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Is the Senator saying the whole idea presented in the \nMonsanto DARK Act 2.0 about putting a phone number on the package so \nsomeone can call a company is a sham?\n  Mr. TESTER. Bogus.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Bogus.\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes. It is worse than nothing. At least if you had \nnothing, you know what you have.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. There is a second option put into the Monsanto DARK Act, \nwhich is the quick response code. You have to have a smartphone that \ncan take a picture of that quick response code, take you to a Web site \nto get information--information, by the way, written by the very \ncompany that controls the product you are looking at. It is not some \nthird party. I picture that as taking just as much time and being just \nas complex for the ordinary person as the 1-800 number. The QR code \nrequires first that you actually have a data plan to be able to get to \na Web site, that you have a smartphone instead of an ordinary cell \nphone, and furthermore it reveals information about you when you go to \nthat Web site, so you are giving up your privacy.\n  So is the QR code option being discussed also a sham?\n  Mr. TESTER. Absolutely. It is just as bogus as the 800 number, quite \nfrankly, if not more, for all the same reasons. First of all, you have \nto have a phone. You have to have service. Oftentimes that isn't the \ncase.\n  Quite frankly, what we need is what your bill does, and that is, just \ntell folks what is in the package--parentheses, three letters, or an \nasterisk that says what it is, very simple. People can understand and \nthey don't have to jump through all these hoops.\n  I know proponents of this DARK Act will say: Well, you know, that is \ngoing to cost a lot of money.\n  Look, Budweiser makes a beer labeled for every NFL football team in \nthe country. At Christmastime, they put Santa Claus on, and then they \nmake the ones in the blue cans too. It is standard stuff. It is all the \nsame\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\nprice. Companies change their labels all the time.\n  So the fact that we are replacing what would be common sense--the \nSenator's bill, which is what we should be taking up and passing here \non the floor because it makes sense, it gives consumers the right to \nknow what is in their food--with something that has an 800 number or QR \ncode is crazy. It is crazy. And the arguments that folks are using for \nkeeping people in the dark simply are not factual.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Well, in this Monsanto DARK Act 2.0 that has been put on \nthe floor, there is a third option beyond the voluntary labeling and \nbeyond the 1-800 numbers and QR code, and the third option--door No. 3, \nif you will--is that the company can put something on social media, \nwhich means, I assume, Instagram, Facebook, or who knows what. So if I \nam a customer and I am in the store and I see these three products and \nI want to find out if they have GE ingredients and there is no 800 \nnumber and there is no QR code because the company has chosen door No. \n3, how am I to know that?\n  Mr. TESTER. You don't. And by the way, there are three doors here, \nand it is kind of like ``Let's Make a Deal.'' The problem is, what is \nbehind No. 1, 2, and 3 are all zonks for the American consumers.\n  I say to Senator Merkley, this makes no sense to me whatsoever \nbecause it is confusing. It absolutely keeps the consumers in the dark. \nAnd we are actually going to try to promote something like that in the \nSenate? It doesn't make any sense to me.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The majority leader has put this bill on the floor, and \nit has not even gone through a committee hearing because this is a new \ncreation that we have just seen for the first time last night. \nFurthermore, it has been put on the floor the night before one of the \nmost important primary days in the Presidential election, strategically \nscheduled, if you will, so that the news networks are busy with Florida \nand Ohio and Illinois and two other States, and they are not paying \nattention to this egregious proposal to take away States' rights and \nconsumers' rights.\n  We had a pledge from the majority leader coming into here that due \nprocess--things would be considered in committee and things would be \nfairly considered on the floor with an open amendment process. Has this \nMonsanto DARK Act 2.0 gone through a committee process, and is it \ngetting a full opportunity to be heard on the floor? In fact, the \nmotion to close debate was filed within seconds of it being put on the \nfloor last night. Is this a true opportunity for the American people to \nwrestle with a major policy decision taking away States' rights and \nconsumers' rights?\n  Mr. TESTER. No. In a word, no. And of all the choices that we have \nout there, that we do every day, food is one of the most important \nchoices we make. That is what we put in our bodies. It gives us power. \nIt gives us intellect. It gives us the ability to do our daily jobs, to \nwork, to be successful, to support our family. Quite frankly, this \nbill--and the timing of it is curious--this bill does none of those \nthings to help move families and the people and society forward. It \njust keeps them in the dark, which is disturbing.\n  As I said in my opening statement, the Senate should be above this. \nWe should be empowering people, not taking away their right to know.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Well, this taking away the right to know--it isn't like \nthe right to know some detail about how your car was manufactured. As \nthe Senator put it, this is about the food you put into your \nmouth. This is about the food we feed our families. This is about what \nour children consume.\n\n  I was very surprised to read this from a scientific study: Two-thirds \nof the air and rainfall samples tested in Mississippi and Iowa in 2007 \nand 2008 contain glyphosate, which is the herbicide being applied in \nmassive quantities because of the genetically engineered resistance of \nkey crops, including corn and soybeans and sugar beets. So the \nherbicide is very prevalent in the rainfall samples and it is very \nprevalent in the air samples, or at least two-thirds of the air \nsamples.\n  Then, a recent study published in the Journal of Environmental & \nAnalytical Toxicology found that humans who consume glyphosate-treated \nGMO foods have relatively high levels of glyphosate in their urine. So, \nactually, residuals are finding their way into our bodies\n  There are other effects. Glyphosate is a known carcinogen. It has \nbeen defined as a known carcinogen. But this herbicide is also running \ninto the streams. Study after study is showing big impacts on the \nmicrobial population, and that is at the base of the food chain, so it \nis affecting the food chain inside our rivers and our streams. There is \ngene transfer to relatives--weeds that are relatives of the growing \ncrops. There is an impact on the evolution of bugs; specifically, the \nwestern corn root worm which is evolving, if you will, to become \nresistant to the pesticide that is in the plant because of the \ngenetic--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to \ncontinue for another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  So we have these affects that scientific documents are showing.\n  So when people come to this floor and say that it is OK to suppress \nthe consumers' right to know because consumers have no legitimate \nconcerns, that there are no scientific studies that show any legitimate \nconcerns about the impacts of genetically engineered plants, are they \ntelling the truth? Is that accurate?\n  Mr. TESTER. Well, I think that is up to the consumer to find out, and \nthe consumer never knows if it is not on the label. I think we put a \nlot of things on labels. I bought some orange juice last night. It was \nnot from frozen concentrate; it was fresh squeezed. That is a consumer \nchoice that I have. I buy that because I like it. I think it is better. \nI think it is better for you. That is what I choose to do.\n  I think what this DARK Act does is it doesn't allow consumers to make \nthe choices they want. They can do the research. Once they see what is \nin it and make the decision whether they--some people may want to eat \nit. It may be a positive thing: This is good. It has GMO in it. I want \nto buy that. For other folks, they may say: No, I don't want to buy \nthat. That is their choice. That is what this country is about. It is \nabout freedom. Now we are stopping that. That is what this debate is \nabout. It is about labeling of food. It is about letting consumers know \nwhat they are eating and letting them make the decision as to what is \nbest for their family.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think my colleague summed it all up in the word \n``freedom''--the freedom to choose. And that freedom to choose--if it \nis between wild fish and farmed fish, we facilitate that by giving the \ninformation on the package. If it is the freedom to choose between \njuice from concentrate versus fresh squeezed--juice from concentrate or \nfresh juice--that, in fact, is a freedom of the consumer, and they can \nexercise it from the package.\n  If someone decides they want to have a product that is vitamin A \nenriched, such as golden rice which has been done by GE engineering--\nmaybe they need more vitamin A--they should have the freedom to choose \nit.\n  In fact, my point here is that there are scientific studies that show \nbenefits in a variety of circumstances from genetic engineering, and \nthere are studies that show legitimate concerns. On the benefits side \nwe have cases--for example, sweet potatoes--in which they have been \nmade to resist viruses that kill. In South Africa, that has been very \nimportant to the growth of sweet potatoes and the provision of that as \npart of a significant source of food in parts of that country. Then \nthere is golden rice being enriched with vitamin A in regions of the \nworld where people eat primarily rice, but they really lack vitamin A. \nBut there are also studies that show concern.\n  Shouldn't we as consumers have freedom? Why is it that we have on the \nfloor a bill which not only takes away States' rights to respond to \nconsumers' interests in freedom, but proceed to squash, for all time \nand in all geographic areas, the freedom of an individual to make that \ndecision? And then they put up a sham which says that somehow, the \nconsumer could inquire by guessing at a social media outlet or going to \na phone bank that is somewhere overseas in the Philippines to\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\nfind out whether or not there is a GE ingredient or having to give up \ntheir privacy and go to a Web site sponsored by the company that made \nthe food. That is not information that allows the consumer to make a \nchoice.\n  What if a consumer had to go to a phone company operating overseas to \nfind out--I don't know--the calories that are in the food or the \nvitamins that are in the food? That would be ridiculous. It is absurd. \nIt is a sham and a scam. It is a theft of individual freedoms in this \ncountry. And shouldn't we all in the Senate be standing up for freedom \nfor American citizens who, by the way, when asked in a nationwide poll, \n9 to 1 say they want this information on the package; 9 to 1 say that. \nHere we are in this deeply divided country where we have this huge \nspectrum of ideologies that we are seeing in the Presidential campaign. \nYet, on this issue, Independents, Republicans, and Democrats, 9 to 1--I \nam rounding off slightly, but very close--9 to 1 in all three \ncategories say they want this information on the package, and 7 out of \n10 said they feel very strongly about this. So that is the desire of \nthe American people. That is the ``We the People'' that is in our \nConstitution that we are pledged to support.\n  Here we have a bill on the floor that is designed in the dark of \nnight while people are paying attention to Presidential primaries, the \npress is paying attention to that, and in the dark of night they are \ntrying to take away that freedom. Isn't that just completely wrong?\n  Mr. TESTER. Well, absolutely. The Senator from Oregon hit the nail on \nthe head. We need to defeat cloture. We need to defeat this bill. If we \nwant to take up a labeling bill, we ought to take up the Merkley bill \nand pass it. That would empower consumers. It would give them freedom. \nIt would live up to what our forefathers had in mind for this country. \nInstead, in my opinion, they are doing exactly the opposite.\n  This is a bad piece of legislation. The Senator is right. The polls \ndo show that across the parties, we are all Americans on this one, 9 to \n1. We have to listen.\n  If folks are having a hard time hearing what people are saying, they \nshould just read their emails. Hear what the folks out in front of our \noffices are saying, because folks are talking and we need to listen. \nRead the editorial pages. Folks are not asking for anything out of the \nordinary. They just want to know so they can make decisions.\n  So I hope this body will defeat this bill, put it to bed, and then we \ncan talk about a labeling bill that makes sense for this country.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank so much my colleague from Montana for being such \na clear and powerful voice on this issue of freedom, of American \nconsumers' rights, of States' rights, and for his solid opposition to \nthis Monsanto DARK Act--Deny Americans the Right to Know--2.0.

Mr. President, I grew up on a cattle farm in Dardanelle, \nwhere I started helping my dad around the farm when I was just a little \nboy. In fact, I was kicking hay bales off the truck when I was barely \nbigger than those hay bales. Growing up, most people I knew had some \nconnection to farming, and I am proud to say that in Arkansas, that is \nstill mostly the case today.\n  In honor of National Agricultural Day, I wish to say a few words \nabout Arkansas' agriculture and what it means to our State.\n  Agriculture is Arkansas' largest industry. It accounts for over $20 \nbillion in value added to our State economy each year and contributes \nto thousands and thousands of jobs. Arkansas is a top 25 producer in 23 \ndifferent agricultural commodities, and we rank first in the Nation in \nrice production, producing close to 50 percent of the rice in the \nUnited States.\n  It doesn't end there. We are also a major exporter of crops like \nsoybeans, cotton, poultry, and feed grains. Our catfish and timber \nindustries are booming and our cattle inventory exceeds 1.7 million \nhead. Our agriculture industry is also expanding by the day. We have \nrecently become a big player in the peanut industry.\n  For Arkansas, agriculture is more than just a business; it is a \npassion and a way of life. We have nearly 50,000 farms in Arkansas, and \n97 percent of them are owned by families. Neighborly chats in Arkansas \noften tend to focus on planting seasons and beef prices. And in towns \nlike Dardanelle, kids don't have to worry about farm chores keeping \nthem from playing with their friends on a Saturday because those \nfriends are likely busy helping on their farms too.\n  Agriculture is who we are. I have certainly taken the lessons I \nlearned growing up on a farm with me into the Army, the Congress, and \nnow fatherhood.\n  So, today, and every day, let's remember Arkansas' and America's \nfarmers and ranchers. Happy National Agriculture Day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I come to the floor once again with a \nsimple message for Senate Republican leaders: Do your job and let me do \nmine.\n  When President Obama sends us a nominee to fill this vacancy on the \nSupreme Court, Republican leaders need to stop playing politics, stop \npandering to the tea party, and fulfill their responsibility to their \nconstituents, their country, and the Constitution. That is what people \nacross the country are demanding.\n  But the hearing Republicans on the Judiciary Committee held this \nmorning makes it clear they are not getting the message, because while \nthe Republicans on that committee say they won't take up their time to \ndo their most important actual job, they were happy to spend their time \nthis morning on their favorite hobby--doing everything they can to turn \nback the clock on women's health care. While they say they won't even \nhold a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee to fulfill their \nconstitutional responsibilities, they were eager to hold the hearing \nthis morning to attack women's constitutional rights.\n  Mr. President, I wish I were surprised by this, but, unfortunately, \nthis is just the latest example of Republican leaders playing political \ngames with the rights of women across the country and pandering to \ntheir extreme tea party base.\n  Republicans love to say they want to keep government out of people's \nlives, unless of course we are talking about women's health care and \ntheir choices. They love to talk about the Constitution, unless we are \ntalking about a woman's constitutional right to make decisions about \nher own body or the part that lays out the Senate's responsibility when \nit comes to filling Supreme Court vacancies.\n  But people across the country are sick of the partisanship, sick of \nthe gridlock, and sick of the games. They want Republicans to do their \njobs, and they are not buying their excuses for inaction.\n  For the last few weeks, Republican leaders have been desperately \ntrying to convince people that there is a precedent for their extreme \nobstruction in this election year. Well, first of all, their arguments \nhave run up against the facts. They simply are not true. The Democratic \nSenate confirmed President Reagan's Supreme Court nominee in his last \nyear in office. And that is just one example of many.\n  But in case the facts weren't enough, last week the Republicans' \nmessage facade began to crumble, and the truth began to come out. \nFirst, one Republican leader warned that any potential nominee should \nbe aware that he or she\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\nwill be treated like a pinata. Republicans say they will refuse to even \nmeet with the nominee. But they and their special interest groups are \nclearly getting ready to drag him or her through the mud.\n  Also, speaking to his constituents back home, another Senator made it \nclear that Republicans' refusal to do their jobs right now is nothing \nmore than partisan politics. He said: If this President were a \nRepublican, it would be ``a different situation,'' and there would be \n``more accommodation.''\n  We all knew this Republican obstruction had nothing to do with what \nis actually right and everything to do with the fact they do not like \nthat President Obama is President right now, but it was nice to hear a \nRepublican Senator actually admit that out loud.\n  Another Republican, the senior Senator from South Carolina, admitted \nlast week that this kind of blind obstruction, this refusal to even \nmeet with a Supreme Court nominee or hold hearings, is absolutely \nunprecedented. He said Republicans wanted to create a new rule--right \nnow--limiting President Obama's constitutional authority and \nresponsibility. Well, I am glad he made clear that what Republican \nleaders have been saying about their obstruction being based on \nprecedent isn't true, but creating this new partisan precedent for \nSupreme Court nominations would be absolutely wrong too.\n  Republicans may not like to hear this, but the American people spoke. \nThey elected President Obama twice, and they entrusted him with the \npowers and responsibilities laid out in the Constitution. Those \nresponsibilities don't just last for 3 years. They last a full term, \nand people across the country are making it very clear they expect \nRepublicans to work with the President, to meet with the nominee, to \nhold hearings, and to do their job.\n  But if Republicans are open to new election-year precedents, I have \none I would like to offer for their consideration that would actually \nbe helpful. I propose that Republicans stop using attacks on women's \nhealth care to rally their tea party base, that they stop using women's \nrights as an election-year political football. That would be \nunprecedented for sure, but it sure would be a step in the right \ndirection, and women across this country would really appreciate it.\n  So when President Obama sends us a nominee, I hope Senate Republican \nleaders will move out of the partisan corner they are in now, will stop \nfocusing on throwing red meat to the tea party, and will do their jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nWashington for her remarks and for her passion for women's health and \nalso for doing our job--for doing our job.\n  The Senator from Washington is right. The Republican members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee have vowed not to hold a single hearing on a \nSupreme Court nominee when the President does his job and sends us down \nhis nomination. They refuse to do their job. And I would say that if \nevery American just got up in the morning one day and said: You know \nwhat, I don't feel like doing my job, they would be fired. They would \nbe fired.\n  But do our Republican colleagues have time to do other things with \ntheir time? Oh yes. What are they doing right now? My colleague pointed \nthis out. They are holding a hearing today on legislation that, if \npassed, would threaten the health and the lives of women.\n  This is about using women's health as a political football once \nagain. It is about reopening debates we have already settled, including \nthe debate over Roe vs. Wade itself. That case was decided in 1973. \nBefore that, women died from back-alley abortions. Women received no \nrespect for private personal decisions they made with their doctor, \nthey made with their God. Oh no, they have to keep challenging Roe v. \nWade.\n  That is what Republicans are doing today in the Judiciary Committee, \nafter they decided, well, they just don't have time enough or will \nenough to hold a hearing on the President's nominee for the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Now, the decision in Roe was very clear. It said that in the early \nstages of a pregnancy, a woman has the right to decide whether to \ncontinue her pregnancy. Later decisions confirmed that, yes, she still \nhas that right. Roe also affirmed that later in the pregnancy, the \nhealth and the life of the mother must always be protected. Let me say \nthat again. The health and the life of the mother must always be \nprotected. That is the law of this land.\n  Now, the major problems with the bills the Judiciary Committee is \nhearing today is they have no respect for the health and the life of \nthe mother and they have no respect for doctors.\n  The first bill, the 20-week abortion ban, is a direct violation of \nRoe v. Wade and a grave threat to women. And, by the way, the Senate \nhas already rejected that bill. They are bringing it back again. No \nmatter what Roe says--that you can't threaten the health and life of a \nwoman--they have brought it back. That bill--that 20-week abortion \nban--offers no health exception for a woman facing cancer, facing \nkidney failure, facing blood clots, or other tragic complications \nduring the pregnancy. And it would throw doctors in jail for doing \nnothing more than helping a woman who is at risk for paralysis or \ninfertility or who has cancer and whose life would be in danger if the \npregnancy continued.\n  That bill--that bill they say is going to help women--harms women. It \nalso revictimizes survivors of rape and incest by assuming they are \nlying--lying--and creating unconscionable barriers to care.\n  The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which \nrepresents thousands of physicians nationwide--physicians who help \nwomen with their first line of health care in many cases--said: These \nrestrictions are ``dangerous to patients' safety and health.''\n  So that is the first bill they are hearing today--a bill that has \nalready been rejected, a bill that will hurt women and their families.\n  The Judiciary Committee is also wasting precious time debating a \nsecond bill this morning because we already have a law that we voted \nfor called the Born-Alive Infant Protections Act. That bill, which I \nsupported, says that a fetus that is alive at birth has the same \nprotections as every other human being. We voted on it, I say to my \nfriend, in 2002.\n  So what they are doing over in the Judiciary Committee is rehearing a \nbill we already voted on, and they are rehearing a bill that passed, \nand then they are rehearing a bill that we voted down. This is \npolitics, pure and simple.\n  Our job is to improve the health and lives of the people, not to \nundermine it. Our job is to act when there is a vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  You know, the Republicans always quote Ronald Reagan. Some of us do \nas well, but he is definitely a Republican hero. Let's see what \nPresident Ronald Reagan said when there was an opening in an election \nyear during his Presidency and he nominated Justice Kennedy. What did \nhe say? Ronald Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme \nCourt below full strength impairs the people's business in that \ncrucially important body.''\n  That is not Barbara Boxer. That is not Patty Murray. That is not \nPresident Obama. That is not Vice President Biden. That is not Harry \nReid. That is not Chuck Schumer. And I could go on. That is Ronald \nReagan. So let me say it again. ``Every day that passes with a Supreme \nCourt below full strength impairs the people's business in that \ncrucially important body.''\n  You know what. We had a Democratic-controlled Senate, and we voted on \nJustice Kennedy in an election year, and we didn't give speeches and \nsay: Well, let's wait for the American people to decide the next \nelection. You know why we didn't say that? Because that would be \nlaughable. Ronald Reagan got elected twice, just like Barack Obama got \nelected twice. He deserves respect. He needs to do his job, and we need \nto do our job.\n  So when you say you are not even going to hold a hearing on the \nPresident's nomination, you are showing disrespect for the \nConstitution--and let's see what the Constitution says--and disrespect \nto Ronald Reagan, I would argue. Look at what the Constitution says: \nThe President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent \nof the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and \nConsuls, and Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  My friends are saying that the Constitution should be obeyed, that \nthey\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\nare strict constructionists. Where are these people? They are hiding in \nthe corner not doing their job. Look at what it says: The President \n``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, \nshall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.'' It doesn't say: \nP.S., unless you don't like who is President. It doesn't say that.\n  So I say to everyone on the other side of the aisle who says they are \nstrict constructionists--and most of them do--read the Constitution and \nread what Ronald Reagan said.\n  The American people have three words for Republicans: Do your job. \nStop disrespecting the Constitution. Stop disrespecting our President \nand stop threatening to create a manmade crisis at the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court has to do its job. This isn't some ideological \ndiscussion in a salon somewhere, because every day the Court considers \ncases with profound impacts for the American people--like whether \nStates can have voter identification laws that put an unfair burden on \nvoters or whether the American people have the right to organize and \nfight for fair pay. I could go on, because almost every issue that \nAmerican families face eventually winds its way to the Court. So \nregardless of your political position or your personal position on any \nindividual case, we have to fill the vacancy because Americans deserve \na full functioning Supreme Court.\n  In closing, I want to quote Sandra Day O'Connor. Now, here is a \nwoman--the first woman on the Supreme Court, appointed by Ronald \nReagan--who made history. She says this to us in the clearest of terms: \n``I think we need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on \nwith it.'' So if you don't want to listen to the Constitution, and you \ndon't want to listen to Ronald Reagan, how about giving some respect to \na woman who made history and understands how the Court functions. We \nhave to get on with it.\n  Every one of us has to do our job. The Judiciary Committee should \nstop holding hearings to hurt women, and they should instead go down to \nthe White House and advise and consent with the President on this \nnomination. They should stop playing politics. We should all come \ntogether. We see such division in the country. It is making a lot of \nour people afraid because there is no respect. How about we start off \nwith respecting the Constitution and working together to fill this \nvacancy and showing the public that we can come together to have a \nfully functioning Supreme Court. The American people deserve nothing \nelse.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake).

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on two \ntopics. The first is the piece of legislation that I introduced last \nyear, along with the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, right \nafter the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. This bill is \nentitled the ``Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,'' or JASTA \nfor short. It makes minor adjustments to our laws that would clarify \nthe ability of Americans attacked on U.S. soil to get justice from \nthose who have sponsored that terrorist attack.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee considered this bill last month and \nreported it to the floor without any objection, so now it is my hope \nthat we can soon take up this legislation because this is important to \nthe victims of the 9/11 attacks. Actually, that is an understatement. \nThis bill, if signed into law, will hopefully help victims and their \nfamilies achieve the closure that they so terribly need from this \nhorrific tragedy. But this legislation is more than that. As our Nation \nconfronts new and expanding terror networks that are targeting our \ncitizens, stopping the funding source for terrorists grows even more \nimportant. So I hope Senators can work together to get this critical \nbipartisan bill done soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1481-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1481-S1482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on another note, I come to the floor to \nmake a few remarks about the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of \nJustice Scalia.\n  It is pretty clear that our colleagues across the aisle do not \nbelieve that the American people deserve a voice in the process by \nwhich the successor to Justice Scalia is selected. We have made our \nposition pretty clear that there will not be a new Justice confirmed \nuntil the American people, in the elections that come up in November, \nmake their preferences known about who will make that appointment.\n  Instead of following the rule book of the minority leader, the senior \nSenator from New York, and our current Vice President--the ones that \nthey advocated for under a Republican administration--our Democratic \nfriends now argue that a lameduck President should be able to nominate \nsomeone to a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court, which \nwill upset the ideological balance on that Court for a generation. As I \nhave mentioned before, the last time a Supreme Court nominee was \nnominated and confirmed during an election year was 1932, and we have \nto go back much earlier, to 1888, to find a similar situation in \ndivided government, which we have now.\n  When Vice President Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, he made perfectly clear that a Supreme Court nominee should \nnot be considered until after a Presidential election has concluded. As \nwe all know, both Democrats and Republicans are well down the road to \nmaking their selection for their nominee for President, and obviously \nwe will have that election in the coming November. But our friends \nacross the aisle continue to contradict themselves and their previous \nstatements, insisting that this decision is somehow unprecedented. \nWell, we know it is not, because if the shoe were on the other foot, \nthey have made clear what they would do.\n  I thought I might share with my friends across the aisle what so many \nof my constituents in Texas have told me about our decision to let them \nhave a voice in the selection of the next lifetime appointment to the \nCourt.\n  Killeen, TX, is the home of Fort Hood, one of the largest military \ninstallations in the world. Last Friday, the town decorated a memorial \nto honor those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack of 2009, \nwhen MAJ Nidal Hasan went on his violent rampage. But John from Killeen \nwrote:\n\n       President Obama is free to make any nomination he wants \n     under the Constitution. The Senate, under the same \n     Constitution, has no obligation to hold hearings on or \n     confirm that nomination. The Judiciary Committee's decision \n     to observe the so-called Biden Rule is absolutely correct. \n     The replacement for Justice Scalia should be nominated by the \n     next president.\n\n  I agree with the letter writer, and the minority leader agreed with \nhim in 2005 as well. That is basically what Senator Reid said in 2005 \nduring the Bush 43 administration. While the President could nominate \nanybody he wanted, the Senate was not obligated under the Constitution \nto vote on that nominee.\n  At the end of the letter, John asked me to ``hold the line'' on this \ndecision. He, like many Americans, is passionate about having a say in \nthe selection of the next Supreme Court nominee. I intend to do \neverything I can to make sure they do have that voice.\n  Another constituent from Plano--just north of Dallas--was emphatic \nthat the Senate should ``Give We The People a say.'' I couldn't agree \nwith him more.\n  The American people made clear they wanted a check on the Obama \nadministration in November of 2014 when they put Republicans in the \nmajority of the Senate. Now we have an obligation to use that mandate \nfrom the people for issues that matter most to our country, and that \nincludes the direction of the Supreme Court.\n  My constituents are right to care deeply about this because there is \nso much at stake. As I said, the next Supreme Court Justice could well \nchange the balance of the Supreme Court for a generation and \nfundamentally reshape American society in the process. So the people \nshould have a chance for input and should have a voice. I am proud to \nstand alongside my Republican colleagues and make sure their voice is\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nheard in the next selection of a lifetime appointment to the Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1482-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I suspect a quorum call has been \ninitiated. If so, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in a quorum call.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today is National Agriculture Day, and I \nwish to thank the farmers and ranchers of America. The Senate is \nconsidering legislation on an issue that is critically important to our \nNation's food supply. It affects everyone from our producers in the \nfields to our consumers in the aisles of grocery stores. Without Senate \naction, this country will be hit with a wrecking ball--an apt \ndescription--that will disrupt the entire food chain. We need to act \nnow to pass my amendment to S. 764. This is a compromised approach that \nprovides a permanent solution to the patchwork of biotechnology \nlabeling laws that will soon be wreaking havoc on the flow of \ninterstate commerce, agriculture, and food products in our Nation's \nmarketplace, and that is exactly what this is about. Let me repeat \nthat. This is about the marketplace. It is not about safety. It is not \nabout health or nutrition. It is about marketing. Science has proven \nagain and again and again that the use of agriculture biotechnology is \n100 percent safe.\n  In fact, last year the Agriculture Committee heard from three Federal \nagencies tasked with regulating agriculture biotechnology: the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency--yes, the EPA--and the Food and \nDrug Administration, the FDA. Their work is based on sound science and \nis the gold standard for policymaking, including this policy we are \ndebating today--one of the most important food and agriculture \ndecisions in recent decades.\n  At our hearing, the Federal Government expert witnesses highlighted \nthe steps their agencies have already taken to ensure that agriculture \nbiotechnology is safe--safe to other plants, safe to the environment, \nand safe to our food supply. It was clear our regulatory system ensures \nbiotechnology crops are among the most tested in the history of \nagriculture in any country. At the conclusion of the hearing, virtually \nall Senate Agriculture Committee members were in agreement. What \nhappened? When did sound science go out the window? Since that hearing, \nthe U.S. Government reinforced their decisions on the safety of these \nproducts.\n  In November, the FDA took several steps based on sound science \nregarding food produced from biotech plants, including issuing final \nguidance for manufacturers that wish to voluntarily label their \nproducts as containing ingredients from biotech or exclusively \nnonbiotech plants.\n  More important, the Food and Drug Administration denied a petition \nthat would have required the mandatory labeling of biotech foods. The \nFDA stated that the petitioner failed to provide the evidence needed \nfor the agency to put such a requirement in place because there is no \nhealth safety or nutritional difference between biotech crops and their \nnonbiotech varieties, regardless of some of the rhetoric we have heard \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Thus, it is clear that what we are facing today is not a safety or \nhealth issue, despite claims by my colleagues on the Senate floor; it \nis a market issue. This is about a conversation about a few States \ndictating to every other State the way food moves from farmers to \nconsumers in the value chain. We have a responsibility to ensure that \nthe national market can work for everyone, including farmers, \nmanufacturers, retailers, and, yes, consumers.\n  This patchwork approach of mandates adds costs to national food \nprices. In fact, requiring changes in the production or labeling of \nmost of the Nation's food supply for a single State would impact \ncitizens in our home States. A recent study estimates that the cost to \nconsumers could total as much as--get this--$82 billion annually, which \ncomes to approximately $1,050 per hard-working American family. This \nVermont law, which is supposed to go into effect in July, will cost \neach hard-working family $1,050. Let me repeat that. If we fail to act, \nthe cost to consumers could total as much as $82 billion annually and \nwill cost each hard-working American family just over $1,000. Now is \nnot the time for Congress to make food more expensive for anybody--not \nthe consumer or the farmer.\n  Today's farmers are being asked to produce more safe and affordable \nfood to meet the growing demands at home and around a troubled and very \nhungry world. At the same time, they are facing increased challenges to \nproduction, including limited land and water resources, uncertain \nweather patterns, and pest and disease issues. Agriculture \nbiotechnology has become a valuable tool in ensuring the success of the \nAmerican farmer and meeting the challenge of increasing their yields in \na more efficient, safe, and responsible manner. Any threat to the \ntechnology hurts the entire value chain--from the farmer to the \nconsumer and all those who are involved.\n  I also hear--and I do understand the concern from some of my \ncolleagues about consumers and available information about our food. \nSome consumers want to know more about ingredients. This is a good \nthing. Consumers should take an interest in their food, where it comes \nfrom, and the farmers and ranchers who also produce their food. I can \nassure you the most effective tool consumers have to influence our food \nsystem or to know more about food is by voting with their pocketbooks \nin the grocery stores and supermarkets. This legislation puts forward \npolicies that will help all consumers not only find information but \nalso demand consistent information from food manufacturers. However, it \nis important, as with any Federal legislation on this topic, for \nCongress to consider scientific fact and unintended consequences.\n  The committee-passed bill created a voluntary national standard for \nbiotechnology labeling claims of food. I have heard concerns that a \nvoluntary-only standard would not provide consumers with enough \ninformation, even though there is no health, safety, or nutritional \nconcern with this biotechnology. So we worked out a compromise to \naddress these concerns by providing an incentive for the marketplace to \nprovide more information.\n  This legislation will allow the markets to work. However, if they do \nnot live up to their commitments and information is not made available \nto consumers, then this legislation holds the market accountable. Under \nthis proposal, a mandatory labeling program would go into effect only \nif a voluntary program does not provide significant information after \nseveral years. The marketplace would then have adequate time to adjust \nand utilize a variety of options--a menu of options--to disclose \ninformation about ingredients, along\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\nwith a wealth of other information about the food on the shelves.\n  Simply put, the legislation before us provides an immediate \ncomprehensive solution to the unworkable State-by-State patchwork of \nlabeling laws. Preemption doesn't extend to State consumer protection \nlaws or anything beyond the wrecking ball that we see related to \nbiotechnology labeling mandates, and we do ensure that the solution to \nthe State patchwork, the one thing we all agree upon, is effective. It \nsets national uniformity that allows for the free flow of interstate \ncommerce, a power granted to Congress in the U.S. Constitution. This \nlabeling uniformity is based on science and allows the value chain from \nfarmer to processor, to shipper, to retailer, to consumer to continue \nas the free market intended. This ensures uniformity in claims made by \nmanufacturers and will enhance clarity for our consumers.\n  Increasingly, many Americans have taken an interest in where their \nfood comes from and how it is made. Let's keep in mind this is a good \nthing. We want consumers informed about food and farming practices, but \nat the same time we must also not demonize food with unnecessary \nlabels.\n  This debate is about more than catchy slogans and made-up names for \nbills. It is about the role of the Federal Government to ensure the \nfree flow of commerce, to make decisions based upon sound science, all \nthe while providing opportunity for the market to meet the demands of \nconsumers.\n  This is not the first time this body has addressed this issue. In \n2012 and 2013, Members of the Senate soundly rejected the idea of \nmandatory labeling for biotechnology. That is right. Both times more \nthan 70 Members voted to reject mandatory labeling. This body then \nstood up for sound science and common sense, and I trust my colleagues \nwill continue to stand up and defend sound science again.\n  Time is of the essence for not only agriculture in the food value \nchain but also consumers who work together, face the wrecking ball of \nthis patchwork of State-by-State mandates. This legislation has the \nsupport of more than 650 organizations. We never had 650 organizations \ncontact the Agriculture Committee about any other bill, any other piece \nof legislation--more than 650. My staff now tells me that number is \nover 700, large and small, representing the entire food chain, and that \nnumber continues to grow every day. That is quite a coalition. They are \nhere in Washington trying to say: Look, this is not going to work with \nregard to State-by-State regulation.\n\n  As I have said, never before in the Agriculture Committee have we \nseen such a coalition of constituents all united behind such effort. \nTheir message is clear: It is time for us to act. It is time for us to \nprovide certainty in the marketplace.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan support of those on the committee who \njoined me to vote out our committee bill. The vote was 14 to 6. We made \nsignificant changes to address the concerns of others. Now we must \ncarry this across the finish line. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncompromising approach and protect the safest, most abundant, and \naffordable food supply in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Upon close inspection, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very important \nissue for the American people--what they feed their families. Here is a \nphoto of a dad--a pretty typical photo of a dad taking his two kids \nshopping. You can see he has one toddler there and he has one infant in \nthe cart. How well I remember doing this with my own kids and then \nwatching my kids with their kids. It is kind of a tradition.\n  So we have a couple of questions we have to ask ourselves when we \nlook at a photo like this. If this dad wants to know what ingredients \nare in the food that he gives his kids, he should have a right to know \nthat. That is my deep belief. He has a right to know that, just as they \ndo in so many countries all over the world.\n  The bill that is going to come before us, called the Safe and \nAccurate Food Labeling Act, is anything but that. I would call it the \n``no label'' act. It is a ``no label.'' There is no label required. It \nis a totally voluntary system. It is a ``no label'' label. Even if in 3 \nyears Senator Roberts' mandatory labeling kicked in, you still would \nnot have a true label. I think it is an embarrassment. I think it is an \ninsult to consumers, and it is a sham. The goal of the bill--and I hope \nwe vote it down--is to hide the information from consumers. It is going \nto make it harder, not easier, for consumers to know if they are \nfeeding their families genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.\n  So here again is our typical dad, and he has his kids in the cart. \nThey are shopping, they have had their outing, and he picks up a \nproduct. He wants to see the ingredients, including whether it has been \ngenetically modified. Guess what. There is no GMO label.\n  So what are his options? Well, in 3 years, maybe he will have an \noption. But before then, the voluntary program is going to make it \nliterally impossible for him to know what is in his food. It is either \ngoing to be a QR code--so he will have to have a smartphone, and even \nwhen he puts the smartphone up against the code, they don't really have \nto tell you easily whether it is GMO, and it is going to have a whole \nbunch of other information--or he is going to have to call a 1-800 \nnumber.\n  Can you believe this? The man is going through the grocery store. He \nhas 50 products in his cart. He is saying: Wait a minute, kids--just a \nminute. Here, have some chips. Then he calls 1-800 and he tries to find \nout, and he gets probably some person answering him in India, which is \nusually what you get, and you go around the mulberry bush. How \nembarrassing is this?\n  Now, if he is lucky, he gets some products from companies that really \nare being fair about this, such as Campbell Soup Company. They are \ndoing a really smart, voluntary label. It says: ``Partially produced \nwith genetic engineering. For information visit . . .'' and they have a \nsite. Campbell's, if he is lucky, has enough products in here that have \na label. He may find out more information, but it is totally voluntary. \nIt is totally voluntary. I want to say thank you to Campbell's for \nbeing upfront and putting the information right on the label.\n  As a mom and as a grandma, I want to know what is in my food. Because \nof work we have done before, you do have to list how much sugar is in \nthe product, which is so critical as we combat diabetes and other \nthings. Sometimes you read that sugar content, and you think: Oh my \nGod, I am going to get something else. And you can see how many carbs, \nhow much fat. Why can't you find out if the product is genetically \nmodified? Seems to me, this is fair.\n  So while I call the Roberts proposal the ``no-label label,'' because \nit makes believe you are going to have a label, but there is no label--\nthe groups, the consumer groups call it the DARK Act, because the label \nis voluntary. There is not going to be a label, at least for 3 years \nafter that, if not longer. They will figure out another way to put it \noff indefinitely. Even if, after 3 years USDA decides they have to make \nsomething mandatory, information will be hidden behind Web sites or \nphone numbers or these QR codes that are so problematic.\n  So this busy dad that we have here, he is going to have to stop \nshopping for every item on his list. He would have to pull out his \nphone to make a call or go to a Web site or scan a code. You don't have \nto live too long to know this is not going to happen. This dad is not \ngoing to do that because he has two kids. By now they are screaming: \nGet me out of here; I am hungry, and where is mommy? So as to all of \nthis notion that this dad is now going to deal with all of this--I \ndon't care how much of a super dad you are, you are not going to make \n50 phone calls to 1-800 numbers. You are not going to go look at 50 QR \ncodes and find out whether the product has GMO. You are just not going \nto do it. It is not going to happen. The kids are going to be melting \ndown. Even if he doesn't have kids with him, he has other things to do, \nby the way, like live his life outside the supermarket. He is going to \nwant to get back home\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nor get back to work. It makes no sense at all.\n  By the way, this dad--and I ask Senator Reid to take a look at this \npicture, if it doesn't remind him of one of his kids taking his \ngrandkids shopping--is going to be expected--if he has 50 products and \nhe wants to find out--either to have a smartphone and to put it up \nagainst the code and then find a whole bunch of information--\n  Mr. REID. Or call the 1-800 number.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Or he could call the 1-800 number, and we know what \nhappens then. He will be transferred around the world.\n  So Americans should not have to run through hoops. Life is difficult \nenough already not to have to do that. This thing is a sham. It is an \ninsult. It is a joke.\n  Why are they doing it on the other side of the aisle? Because they \nare beholden to the special interests that don't want to label GMOs, \nthat are afraid if people know the food is genetically modified, they \nwon't buy it, even though there is no proof of that at all.\n  Mr. President, 64 countries require labels. Some 64 countries today \nrequire simple labels, and many of our products are sold in those 64 \ncountries. Let me tell you some of these countries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of the 64 countries that require GMO labeling.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                       Countries with GMO Labels\n\n       1. Australia, 2. Austria, 3. Belarus, 4. Belgium, 5. \n     Bolivia, 6. Bosnia and Herzegovina, 7. Brazil, 8. Bulgaria, \n     9. Cameroon, 10. China, 11. Croatia, 12. Cyprus, 13. Czech \n     Republic, 14. Denmark, 15. Ecuador, 16. El Salvador, 17. \n     Estonia, 18. Ethiopia, 19. Finland, 20. France;\n       21. Germany, 22. Greece, 23. Hungary, 24. Iceland, 25. \n     India, 26. Indonesia, 27. Ireland, 28. Italy, 29. Japan, 30. \n     Jordan, 31. Kazakhstan, 32. Kenya, 33. Latvia, 34. Lithuania, \n     35. Luxembourg, 36. Malaysia, 37. Mali, 38. Malta, 39. \n     Mauritius, 40. Netherlands;\n       41. New Zealand, 42. Norway, 43. Peru, 44. Poland, 45. \n     Portugal, 46. Romania, 47. Russia, 48. Saudi Arabia, 49. \n     Senegal, 50. Slovakia, 51. Slovenia, 52. South Africa, 53. \n     South Korea, 54. Spain, 55. Sri Lanka, 56. Sweden, 57. \n     Switzerland, 58. Taiwan, 59. Thailand, 60. Tunisia, 61. \n     Turkey, 62. Ukraine, 63. United Kingdom, and 64. Vietnam.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to name some of these countries that require \nthe labels. So in other words, our companies have to put the label on \nif they want to sell there, letting people know if their food is \ngenetically modified: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, \nBulgaria, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, \nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, \nItaly, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Latvia, Mali, Malta, Netherlands, New \nZealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, \nSenegal, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, \nSwitzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and \nVietnam. I left some out, but they will be in the Record if anyone \nwants to see them.\n  Why is it that consumers in Russia have more information than our \nconsumers do--the greatest country in the world? This makes no sense at \nall. Why is it that our companies are up in arms, since they have to \nput the label on in these other countries? They could put the label on \nhere.\n  Now, if we care at all about what the public thinks, we should vote \nno on the Roberts bill. Some 90 percent of Americans want to know if \nthe food they buy has been genetically engineered--90 percent. That is \na majority of Republicans. That is a majority of Democrats. That is a \nmajority of Independents. I think the other 10 percent are working for \nthe big food companies, which don't seem to want to share this. \nMillions of Americans have filed comments with the FDA urging the \nagency to label genetically engineered food so they can have this \ninformation at their fingertips.\n  The bill also preempts any State in the Union from doing a label. \nNow, I don't like the notion of every State doing a label. That is why \nI support my bill--which has about 14 sponsors and simply says to the \nFDA to write a label and make this the law--or the Merkley bill, which \ncomes up with four labels. Senator Merkley will talk about this. We say \nthat would, in fact, be enough so that States wouldn't be able to act.\n  Meanwhile, this says no State action, and we are going to keep the \nstatus quo for at least 3 years--no labeling. Even after those 3 years, \nthere may be no labeling at all. It is going to be barcodes, which are \nconfusing, and 1-800 numbers, which probably take you to India to try \nand figure your way through it all.\n  Now, I have long believed in the power to give consumers information. \nI think you are all familiar with the dolphin-safe tuna labeling law. I \nam proud to say that I wrote that law. That law has been in effect \nsince the 1990s, and people like it. But guess what. They see a smiling \ndolphin on the tuna can, and they know that tuna was caught in a way \nthat does not harm the dolphins. We found out so many years ago that \nthe tuna schools swim under the dolphins, and the tuna companies were \npurse seining on dolphins. They were putting nets over the dolphins, \npulling them away and then catching the tuna, and the dolphins would \ndie by the tens of thousands. So the schoolkids in those years said--at \nthat time I was a House Member: Congresswoman Boxer, we don't want to \nhave tuna that resulted in the death of all these dolphins. So we \ncreated the label, and the tuna companies were very helpful, just like \nCampbell Soup Company has been very helpful in labeling their products. \nWhen you have the companies come forward, it is very helpful. So we \npassed the bill. Everybody said: Oh, this is going to be terrible; no \none will buy tuna. Actually, people started buying the tuna because \nthey changed the way they fish for the tuna. The dolphins weren't \nharmed. We have saved literally hundreds of thousands of dolphins over \nthe period of time that label has been in effect.\n  Now, as to this label, all we are saying is to let us know. Let us \nknow. What we do know is that many of these genetically engineered \nproducts, as they are growing in the ground, require huge amounts of \npesticides. Senator Heinrich talked about that. That is one issue which \nhas grown in importance to parents because they don't want to give \ntheir kids food that is covered in pesticides if they have an option.\n\n  So the power we give the consumers is critical--the power to simply \nknow the truth. And, to me, knowledge is power. To me, it is respect. \nYou tell people the truth; you don't give them a sham bill and say: \nWell, we won't require anything for 3 years, but then we may have a \nbarcode, and then we may have a 1-800 number. No. It is pretty simple: \nRequire a label. Require a label. A label is simple. A label works.\n  I see Senator Merkley on the floor, and I am finishing up. We have \nvarious ways we can do the label. One way is to give it to the FDA and \ntell them to come up with it, and another way is the way Senator \nMerkley has proceeded in a way to attract more support. He has given \nfour options, all of which are very good and all of which would \nimmediately give consumers the information they need.\n  In 2000, when I introduced the first Senate bill concerning the \nlabeling of GE foods, my legislation had one supporter, and it was me. \nI had no other supporters back then. It was so long ago. It was in \n2000. Now 14 Senators are cosponsoring the bill. I am so proud to \ncosponsor Senator Merkley's bill, the Biotechnology Food Labeling and \nUniformity Act, which, again, will put forward four options for \ncompanies.\n  There are reasons people want this information, and not one of us \nhere should decry what our people want, even if they want to know if \nthe foods contain GMOs because of the prevalence of herbicide-resistant \ncrops. We know from the USGS that growers sprayed 280 million pounds of \nRoundup in 2012--a pound of herbicide for every person in the country. \nThat is what they spray on these foods that contain GMOs. Whatever the \nreason, Americans deserve to know what is in the food they are eating. \nSome want to know it just to have the information.\n  Some in the food and chemical industry say that adding this very \nsmall piece of information would confuse or alarm consumers. This is an \nold and familiar argument raised by virtually every industry when they \nwant to avoid giving consumers basic facts. In fact, a 2014 study from \nthe Journal of Food Policy shows there is little evidence that \nmandatory labeling of GE foods signals consumers to avoid the product. \nThere is no proof of that.\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\n  The FDA requires the labeling of more than 3,000 ingredients, \nadditives, and processes. Orange juice from concentrate must be \nlabeled. Consumers should be able to choose the product they prefer. If \nthey like it from concentrate, fine. If they prefer it in a different \nfashion, fine. There is no reason they can't also have the knowledge \nthat the food they are buying is genetically engineered.\n  The world certainly has moved ahead of us. The Roberts bill would \ntake us way back into the dark, and that is why consumer groups call it \nthe DARK Act. It is a sham. It is an embarrassment. It is time for us \nto shelve the DARK Act, to listen to 90 percent of the American people. \nFor God's sake, if we do nothing else, we ought to listen to 90 percent \nof the American people, and we ought to pass a real bill to help \nAmericans make informed choices about the foods they eat.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senator Merkley for really delving into this \nissue and coming up with another alternative that will be very \nacceptable not only to me but to, I believe, the 90 percent of the \npeople who are crying out for this information.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this debate on the Monsanto DARK Act, \nwhich stands for Denying Americans the Right to Know, centers around \ntwo basic propositions. The first proposition is that it would be \nchaotic to have 50 States with 50 different labeling standards. How \ncould a food company possibly always get the right label to the right \nstore if there are 50 different State standards? This is not a problem \nwe actually have yet because we have no States that have adopted a \nstandard for GE labeling. We have one State--I should say no States \nhave implemented it. One State has adopted a standard, and that won't \nbe implemented until July. So we are far away from having any issue \nover conflicting standards. But I acknowledge the basic point. This \nmakes sense. It makes sense that we don't want to have a world in which \nevery State has a different approach: In this State you do X, Y, and Z, \nand in this State you do A, B, and C, and what the exemptions are \ndiffer, and the formats differ, and so on and so forth. So let's just \nconcede that at this point, it makes sense to have a single standard \nfor the country. But a single standard about what?\n  That brings us to the second basic proposition, which is that there \nbe a consumer-friendly alert that there are GE ingredients in a \nproduct. That is all. If a State says they want to have a simple, \nconsumer-friendly alert that there are GE ingredients, then they should \nbe able to do that.\n  If we don't want 50 standards, then we need to have the replacement \nbe a national standard that provides the same thing, that is a \nconsumer-friendly alert that there are GE ingredients. Then the \nindividual can do more investigation. They can go to the company's Web \nsite and find out the details, including what type of genetic \nengineering it is, what is its impact, and so on and so forth.\n  Right now there is a coalition of individuals in this Chamber who \ndon't believe in Americans' right to know. They want to take it away. \nThey want to support a bill, which is currently on the floor right now, \nthat denies Americans the right to know because they are getting \npressure from Monsanto and friends, and they are not willing to stand \nup for the American citizen, their constituents. They don't believe in \na ``we the people'' America; they believe in ``we the titans,'' that we \nare here simply on the end of a puppet string. But we are not here for \nthat purpose. That is not the vision of our Constitution. The vision of \nour Constitution is that we are an ``of the people, for the people, and \nby the people'' world. That is what makes America beautiful, not that a \nfew powerful groups can control what happens here in this Chamber, this \nhonored and revered Chamber where it is our responsibility to hold up \nour ``we the people'' vision of the Constitution.\n  So this bill, this Monsanto Deny Americans the Right to Know Act 2.0, \nhas a few shams and scams placed in it to pretend that it is a labeling \nlaw.\n  The first scam that it has in it--or sham--is an 800 number. I as a \nconsumer can go to a grocery shelf and in 5 seconds I can check three \nproducts for an ingredient by looking at the label; 1 second, 2 \nseconds, 3 seconds--well, less than 5 seconds. In 3 seconds I can check \nand see whatever I want to find out. If I want to check the calorie \ncount or check for vitamin A or what percentage of the daily \nrecommended amount is in the food or if I want to see if it contains \npeanuts because I am allergic to peanuts, I can do it for three \nproducts in 3 seconds. That is consumer-friendly. That is why we put it \non the label. That is why we say: Oh gosh, we are going to give people \nthe information they want so they can exercise their freedom when they \nbuy things to support what they want. That is integrity between the \nproducer and the consumer.\n  But do we know what the opposite of integrity is? That is the DARK \nAct. Deny Americans the right to know and ban States from providing \nthis basic information. It is the complete absence of responsibility to \nthe citizen.\n  Well, there is a 1-800 number. How would that work? First of all, I \nhave to find the 800 number. Then I have to make sure I have a phone \nwith me. Then I have to make sure I have good cell phone coverage. Then \nI have to go to a phone tree. You know how these work. You go to the \nphone tree, you listen to eight options, you pick the option, it takes \nyou to another list, you pick another option, and then finally, after \nabout five levels, they connect you. They say: If you want an operator, \npress this, and you press it and you go to some call center in the \nPhilippines. They don't know what you are talking about. This is not \nconsumer-friendly.\n  Looking at the ingredient list takes 1 second. It is 10 minutes or \nmore when you call that 800 number, and maybe you get a message: I am \nsorry, we have a large call volume right now, and we will be able to \nanswer your call in 20 minutes. That is not consumer information; that \nis a scam and a sham.\n  That is not the only one that is in this DARK bill. The second sham \nis this idea of a quick response code, like this one in the picture, \nthis square code. Again, as a consumer you can't look at the \ningredients and see the answer, if there are GE ingredients, no. Now \nyou have to have not just a phone but a smartphone. You have to hope it \nhas a battery, that it has a photo appliance with it. You have to take \na picture of that code, and then that code takes you to some Web site \nwritten by the very producer who gives you the answer, maybe, or maybe \nthey lay out a whole architecture of stuff that obfuscates it, confuses \nyou, and you don't really get the answer, when all you needed was a \nlittle tiny symbol on the package that indicated whether it had GE \ningredients. So, again, how long does that take? Ten minutes per \nproduct? Thirty minutes for the first item on your shopping list as you \ncompare three products? That is not consumer-friendly--3 seconds versus \n30 minutes--and that is just the first item on your shopping list. \nThere is not one person in this Chamber who truly believes this is a \nfair substitute for consumer-friendly information. This is a sham and \nscam No. 2.\n  If this QR code had a message on it and this message right here \nwritten on the back said ``There are GE ingredients, and for details, \nscan this code,'' that is consumer-friendly. That is all the consumer \nwants to know. That is all we are asking for--a consumer-friendly \nalert. Then that QR code for more information is fine. That is \nperfectly fine. But without it, nobody even knows why it is there. What \nis it there for? Is this where you find out information about the \ncompany? Is this where you find out information about the new products \nthey are going to be putting out? Is this where you find information \nabout special sales that are going on? Nobody has any idea.\n  Well, the DARK bill doesn't stop with sham No. 1 and sham No. 2. No, \nit gives us even more fake labeling because we see it says that a form \nof labeling is to have no label but to put the information on your Web \nsite. Well, to call that a label is simply a misrepresentation--and \n``misrepresentation'' is a fancy word for ``lie''--because there is not \nany information that even appears on the product. None.\n  So we say: Well, I was told there would be an 800 number. I am not \nfinding it. I was told there might be a box, and I think it is for \nfinding out if there\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\nare GE ingredients. But I don't find that computer code box, no, \nbecause they have adopted door No. 3, and door No. 3 is to put \nsomething on some form of social media. But what social media? Are you \nsupposed to go to Instagram or Facebook or Twitter? Nobody has any \nidea.\n  So now there is nothing--let me repeat: nothing--on the product. So \nwhat could be learned in 1 second by a consumer, now the consumer has \nfully no idea. And because this whole thing is voluntary, lots of \nproducts may just choose to put nothing up.\n  The proponents of the DARK Act say: No, we have a pathway to more \ninformation. If companies don't put up information in the form of a \nbarcode or a phone number or something on a social media Web site, well \nthen we will require something in one of those three areas. That \nrequirement down the road still provides no consumer-friendly \ninformation. It is a pathway through a hall of mirrors that leads to a \nhall of mirrors. It never leads to concrete, simple information.\n\n  Don't you know that if you told consumers they would have to go to a \nWeb site to find out if there is vitamin D in the product, that would \nbe ridiculous? It should just be printed on the package.\n  Don't you know if someone were interested in high fructose corn syrup \nand they were told they had to dial a call center in the Philippines to \nfind out that information, consumers would say that is absurd? We all \nknow that is the case.\n  Ninety percent of Americans strongly believe--or believe when given \nthe choice--that there should be this information directly on the \nlabel. I am rounding up from 89 percent. Let's round it off. When \nquestioned as to whether there should be information on the label to \nsay whether there are genetically engineered ingredients, 9 out of 10 \nAmericans say yes, there should be, and 70 percent say they feel very \nstrongly about this. So here are our constituents, and 9 to 1, they \nwant us to provide information. But up here on Capitol Hill we have \nSenator after Senator who does not care what their constituents think. \nThey care only what big Monsanto and friends want, which is to deny \nAmericans the right to know. That is irresponsible. That is wrong.\n  When we look at this number, you can see by how high it is that this \nis not partisan because it would be impossible to have a big \ndifference--100 percent of one party and 80 percent of another might \nround off to 90 percent. But that is not the way it is. Whether you are \nan Independent, Democrat, or Republican, in all 3 groups, 9 out of 10 \nindividuals, plus or minus a few percentage points, say they want this \ninformation on the package.\n  So here we are with this vast difference in ideologies being \ndisplayed by the Presidential debate, from the tea party right to the \nfar left and everything in between. There is disagreement on all kinds \nof things, but on this, all the citizens agree--the right, left, \nmiddle, far left, far right--because it is a fundamental freedom in \nAmerica to use your dollars based on basic, accurate information. That \nis a basic freedom that a bunch of Senators on this floor want to take \naway. It is just wrong to take away the States' rights to answer that \nrequest, that need, that desire for information on GE ingredients and \nnot to replace it with a national standard. That is just wrong.\n  There are folks who say: Wait, I want to be on the side of science, \nand I don't think there is any kind of scientific information that \nthere is any kind of disadvantage to GE products. Well, that is \nfundamentally wrong. If you think there are no disadvantages, it is \nbecause you don't want to know.\n  There are benefits, and there are disadvantages. For example, \nrecognize that this tool can be used in ways that produce some good \nresults and some not so good results. That is why it is up to the \nconsumer to decide how they want to use their dollars.\n  On the good side, we can talk about golden rice. There are parts of \nthe world that primarily eat rice. If they have a vitamin A deficiency, \nthere is rice that can be grown that has been genetically modified to \nsupply more vitamin A and makes for a healthier community. That is a \npositive.\n  For example, sweet potatoes grown in South Africa are vulnerable to \ncertain viruses, but they have been genetically modified to resist \nthose viruses so there is more substantive food available to the \ncommunity. As far as we know, there are no particular side effects, so \nthat is a positive.\n  There are some interesting ideas that occur about edible vaccine \ntechnology. This is an alternative to traditional vaccines, and they \nare working to have transgenic plants used for the production of \nvaccines that stimulate the human body's natural immune response. \nWouldn't that be amazing if we could essentially inoculate against \nmajor diseases in the world through some type of GE, as long as there \nweren't side effects? Who knows, that may end up being a major benefit.\n  Just as there are scientifically documented positives, there are \nscientifically documented negatives. For example, let's talk about our \nwaterways. I put up a chart which shows that since the presentation or \nproduction of herbicide-resistant crops, the amount of herbicides put \non crops in America has soared. We have gone from 7.4 million pounds in \n1994 to 160 million pounds by 2012. It has gone up since. All of that \nglyphosate is basically being sprayed multiple times a year. It gets \ninto the air, it gets into the plants, it gets into the runoff from the \nfields, and it goes into our waterways. It has an impact because it is \na plant killer. That is what an herbicide is. It kills plants. If you \nput millions of pounds of herbicide into our rivers, it does a lot of \ndamage.\n  I will not go through all the studies that have noted this damage. \nLet me just explain that when you kill things at the base of the food \nchain, you change the entire food chain. This is true for micro-\norganisms in sea water, which we refer to as marine systems, and it is \nvery true in micro-organisms in freshwater systems.\n  Micro-organisms form the basis of food chains and provide ecological \nservices. There are a bunch of studies that show the impact of all this \nplant-killing herbicide running into our rivers. It affects the soil \ntoo. Quite frankly, it even creates some potential for an impact on \nhuman health.\n  Let me explain. Two-thirds of the air and rainfall samples tested in \nMississippi and Iowa in 2007 and 2008 contain glyphosate. Those are \nrain samples and air samples, two-thirds of which contained this \nherbicide. Well, what we know is that not only do humans absorb some \ntherefrom, but they also absorb some because of residuals in the food. \nA study published in the Journal of Environmental & Analytical \nToxicology found that humans who consumed glyphosate-treated GMO foods \nhave relatively high levels of glyphosate in their urine because it is \nin their bodies. We also know that glyphosate has been classified as a \nprobable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on \nCancer, part of the World Health Organization.\n  Here we have a probable carcinogen present in such vast quantities--\npresent in the rain, present in the air, present in the residuals on \nthe food. That is a legitimate concern to citizens. Does that mean that \nit is causing rampant outbreaks of cancer? No, I am not saying that. I \nam just saying there is a legitimate foundation for individual citizens \nto say: I am concerned about the runoff into our streams. I am \nconcerned about the heavy application and its impact on local plants \nand animals. I am concerned about the possibility of absorption of \nanything that might contribute to cancer. That is the citizens' freedom \nto have those opinions.\n  This is not a situation where Members of this body should say: We are \nsmarter than they are, and we don't care that they have scientific \nconcerns because, quite frankly, we want to suppress that information. \nWe don't want to give them a choice. We don't want to let them know. It \nis just wrong. It is wrong to take away States' rights to provide such \nbasic information and not have a consumer-friendly version at a \nnational level. I will absolutely support a 50-State standard so there \nis no confusion and no cost of overlapping standards or difficulties in \nwhat food goes from what warehouse to what grocery store--absolutely \nsupport that--but don't strip States from doing something 9 out of 10 \nAmericans care about and then proceed to bury that and not provide that \ninformation in the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues: Simply say no to this Monsanto Deny \nAmericans the Right to Know Act, the DARK Act. Simply say no. Stand up. \nHave some respect for this institution.\n  This is a bill that never went through committee. Not a single phrase \nof this bill went to committee. This is a new creation put on the floor \nwithout juris, without consideration on committee, and no open \namendment process. How many colleagues across the aisle cried foul over \nthe past years when Democrats were in charge and didn't allow an \namendment process? They insisted they would never vote for cloture \nunless there was a full amendment process that honored the ideas \npresented by different Senators. But there is no open amendment process \nhere. So there we are--a bad process, mega influence by Monsanto and \nfriends oppressing and stripping the freedom of American citizens. \nLet's not let that happen.\n  I have a host of letters I was planning to read, but I see my \ncolleague from Ohio is wanting to speak to this issue, and in fairness \nto all sides of this debate or ideas that he might want to present, I \nam going to stop here. If there is an opening later, I would like to \nreturn to the floor because of the calls and letters overwhelmingly \nfrom citizens stating they resent the Senators in this body trying to \nstrip them of their right to know.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Oregon, \nand I am sure he will be back on the floor again to talk about this \nissue.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I want to address a couple of other issues quickly. \nOne is the last act that this Senate took last week, which was passage \nof the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I didn't have a chance \nto speak on it because the Senate adjourned at that point, but I just \nwant to congratulate my colleagues for coming together as Republicans \nand Democrats. It was a vote of 94 to 1. That never happens around this \nplace. It is because people understand the significance of the \nchallenge of heroin and prescription drug abuse and addiction back in \nour States and wanted to stand up and put forward Federal legislation \nthat would help make the Federal Government a better partner with State \nand local governments and nonprofits that are out there in the trenches \ndoing their best, with law enforcement who are trying their darnedest, \nand others in the emergency medical response community who are trying \nto deal with this issue.\n  While traveling the State of Ohio the last 3 days, this Senator heard \nabout it constantly. Before I would give a speech, people would come up \nand say thank you for dealing with this issue because my daughter, my \ncousin, or my friend is affected. Today, I was with a group of young \npeople talking about other issues, and one said that his cousin at 23 \nyears old had just succumbed to an overdose--died from an overdose of \nheroin.\n  This a problem in all of our States. It is a problem where we can \nhelp make a difference. I want to congratulate my colleagues, Senator \nWhitehouse and others, for working with me to put this bill forward. We \nworked on it over 3 years in a comprehensive way, using the best \nexpertise from around the country.\n  Now I am urging my colleagues in the House of Representatives to \nfollow suit. Let's pass this legislation. Let's send it to the \nPresident's desk for his signature. Let's get this bill working to be \nable to help our constituents all over this country to better deal with \na very real epidemic in our communities.\n  Now the No. 1 cause of death in my State is overdoses--from these \ndeaths that are occurring from overdoses of heroin and prescription \ndrugs. Again, I congratulate the Senate for acting on that on a \nbipartisan basis and having thoughtful legislation that is going to \nmake a difference.\n\n\n                            Read Aloud Month\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to speak about something that also \naffects our young people, which is literacy and learning. This happens \nto be Read Aloud Month. This U.S. Senate has established the month of \nMarch as being the month that we hold up those who read aloud to their \nkids, because we found it is incredibly important for a child's \ndevelopment--particularly for the ability of a child to become adept at \nother subjects at school by just being read to and the literacy that \nresults from that.\n  There is a campaign called the Read Aloud campaign. I congratulate \nthem for the good work they do around the country. They started in my \nhometown of Cincinnati, OH, so I am very proud of them, but now it is a \nnational effort. In libraries and schools across the country, March is \nheld up as Read Aloud Month, where we encourage parents and other \nfamily members to get into the habit of reading to their children, if \nonly for 15 minutes a day. That is all the Read Aloud campaign is \nasking for. If parents and other caregivers read at least 15 minutes a \nday to their kids, what an incredible difference it would make.\n  There is one study that is now quite well known that shows, on \naverage, by the time a child born into poverty reaches age 3, he or she \nwill have heard 30 million fewer words than his or her peers who are \nnot in poverty. What does that mean, 30 million fewer words? It means \nthat those children born into poverty are at a severe disadvantage. It \nmeans they can have a lifetime of consequences that are negative for \nthem. The more we learn about the way the brain develops, the more \nclear it is that verbal skills--like other skills--develop as they are \nused and atrophy as they are neglected. The younger the children are, \nthe more important this is. So reading to children, particularly \nyounger children, is incredibly important to their development.\n  Even though this information is now out there and the Read Aloud \ncampaign is doing a great job of getting the education out there, even \nwith all this information we are told that in 40 percent of families in \nAmerica today parents and other caregivers are not reading to their \nkids.\n  There is a doctor at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Dr. Tzipi \nHorowitz-Kraus, who is a real expert on this topic. She stated: ``The \nmore you read to your child, the more you help the neurons in the brain \nto grow and connect.'' So that is the physiological change that occurs.\n  We also know a child's vocabulary is largely reflective of the \nvocabulary at home from their parents and caregivers. There is a 2003 \nstudy by Elizabeth Hart and Todd Risley studying the impact of this 30 \nmillion word gap we talked about between households in poverty and \nthose of their peers. They found that by age 3 the effects were already \napparent. Even at that young age, ``trends in the amount of talk, \nvocabulary growth, and style of interaction were well established and \nclearly suggested widening gaps to come.'' That is another study out \nthere about what the impact of this is.\n  There are a lot of adults who might not know how important reading \naloud is and don't feel they have enough to do it, but, again, 15 \nminutes a day is all they are asking. It adds up quickly and can help \nclose this word gap. As parents, it may be the most important single \nthing we can do to help our children to be able to learn.\n  Illiteracy or even what is called functional illiteracy--not being \nilliterate but not being able to read with proficiency--makes it so \nmuch harder to do everything, to earn a living, obviously to get a job, \nand to participate fully in society. It hurts self-esteem. It hurts \npersonal autonomy. Millions of our friends and neighbors are struggling \nwith these consequences every single day. According to the Department \nof Education, there are about 32 million adults in the United States \nwho can't read. Nearly one out of every five adults reads below a fifth \ngrade level. Nearly the same percentage of high school graduates cannot \nread. So one out of every five high school graduates not being able to \nread is an embarrassment for us as a country, our school system, and \ncertainly what is not going on in our families, which again can help to \nget these kids off to the right start. For these adults who are \nfunctionally illiterate or illiterate, they all started with this \ndisadvantage we are talking about, not having this opportunity at home.\n  Some parents may say: OK, Rob. How do we afford this, because \nchildren's books aren't inexpensive. How do you get the online \nresources you might want to be able to read to your kids, if\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nnot books? I have one simple answer for that, which is get a library \ncard. Our libraries in Ohio and around the country are all into this \neffort. They have all rallied behind it, and they are all eager to be a \npart of this.\n  My wife Jane and I made it a priority to read to our kids when they \nwere growing up, and a lot of that came from books we took out of the \nCincinnati and Hamilton County Libraries. It also had the consequence \nof introducing our kids to the libraries and helped them to become \nlifelong readers and learners. That is one way for those who are \nwondering how to begin. Get a library card, go to your library, and get \nstarted there.\n  I am proud Ohio has led the way in this effort. This campaign began \nin Cincinnati and is now becoming a national movement.\n  We do talk a lot in this body about education. On a bipartisan basis, \nwe recently passed legislation that had to do with K-12 education \nreform. I think it was an important step, but one thing it did is it \nreturned more power back to the States and back to our families, which \nI think is a good thing.\n  The new law also authorized grant funding for State comprehensive \nliteracy plans, including targeted grants for early childhood education \nprograms--what we are talking about here, early childhood. It made sure \nthose grants are prioritized for areas with disproportionate numbers of \nlow-income families. We also authorized professional development \nopportunities for teachers, literacy coaches, literacy specialists, and \nEnglish as a Second Language specialists. These grants will be helpful \nin empowering our teachers to do their part to help our young people to \nlearn to read. Clearly, our wonderful teachers have a role to play.\n  To my colleagues, while this is all fine, there is no substitute for \nthe family. There is no substitute for what can happen in a family \nbefore the child even goes to school and then while the child is \nstarting school to be able to give that child the advantage of being \nable to learn more easily. Although I supported that legislation--there \nare some good things in there--let's not forget the fundamental role \nall of us play as parents or aunts or uncles or grandparents or other \ncaregivers.\n  Washington may be the only place on Earth where 30 million words--\nwhich is this word gap we talked about, which is less than the length \nof our Tax Code and regulations--doesn't sound like a lot, but it is a \nlot, and there is no government substitute to close that 30 million \nword gap. Ultimately, it is going to be closed by parents, \ngrandparents, uncles, aunts, other caregivers, and brothers and sisters \nwith the help of librarians, teachers, and others. We need to call \nattention to this issue to let parents know that this 15 minutes a day \ncan make a huge difference. Every little bit counts. Every time you \nread to the child, you are giving him or her an educational advantage, \nyou are making it easier for them to learn, helping to instill in them \na love of learning that will last a lifetime.\n  Again, I thank the Read Aloud campaign. I am proud of their roots in \nmy hometown and in Ohio. I thank them for all they are doing every day \nfor our kids and for our future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish to continue sharing some \ninformation about Monsanto and the Deny Americans the Right to Know Act \nthat is on the Senate floor being debated right now.\n  The reason I want to turn to this is this is such an egregious \noverreach of the Federal Government, stripping States of the right to \nrespond to their citizens' desire for clear information, consumer-\nfriendly information, on GE--genetically engineered--ingredients and \nstripping American citizens of the right to know.\n  I have already gone through a number of the points that are important \nin this debate; that if you are going to eliminate the ability of \nStates to provide consumer-friendly information on their label--which \ncan be as simple as a tiny symbol or a letter such as Brazil uses--then \nthere has to be a national standard that provides consumer-friendly \ninformation. Certainly, the hall of mirrors embedded in the DARK Act, \nwhich says consumers have to call call centers somewhere around the \nworld and maybe they will eventually get an answer to their question \nabout GE ingredients or they have to own a smartphone and have a data \nplan and take a picture of a computer code and give up some of their \nprivacy in the process in order to try to find out this information or \nthey have to guess where on social media the company has posted some \ninformation about the ingredients they have in their product--those \nthree sets of components are completely unworkable, 100 percent \nunworkable.\n  Ask yourself if that would be a logical remedy to people trying to \nfind out about the calories in a product. Instead of finding out in one \nsecond, it could take them 10 minutes or, for that matter, an hour or \nthey may never even get an answer on the end of that call center \nbecause the call center is too busy.\n  The point is that 9 out of 10 Americans believe this information \nshould be easily available on the label. I went through those numbers \nbefore. The numbers are basically the same for Republicans, basically \nthe same for Democrats and Independents--slight variations. Throughout \nthe ideological spectrum, this is something American citizens agree on. \nAlong comes the Monsanto DARK Act and its proponents to say: We don't \ncare that the American people have finally found something to agree on \nthat goes to their core values about the right to know. We are going to \nstomp out their right to know because we simply don't work for the \nAmerican people. We don't work for our constituents. We work for some \npowerful special interest.\n  That is wrong. I hope the American citizens will let their Senators \nknow it is wrong. They are certainly letting me know how they feel, and \nI thought I would share some of those with you, but before I do that, I \nhad some inquiries about this situation of basically all citizens \nthroughout the ideological spectrum sharing this same point of view--9 \nout of 10. Is it also true for gender and age? Let me share that. \nSpecifically, there was a followup question which asked: Does a barcode \nwork to provide information on the label or do you want a physical \nlabel stating that there are GE ingredients? Physical label versus this \nbarcode--which people don't even know where it is on the package.\n  It turns out again it is 90 percent. It is 88 percent of Democrats, \n88 percent of Republicans, and 90 percent of Independents say: No, we \nwant the physical label, not some mysterious label that we have to use \nour smartphone to interpret and give up some of our privacy.\n  How about men and women--87 percent of men, 97 percent of women.\n  How about younger and older--those who are less than 50 years old, 86 \npercent; those who are over 50 years old, 90 percent. Again, basically \n9 out of 10 Americans, regardless of gender, regardless of age, \nregardless of ideology, say: No, this is a fundamental issue of \nAmerican freedom, my freedom to exercise my choices based on basic \ninformation that should be on the label.\n  Let's turn to some real constituents and some real letters so we are \nnot just talking numbers.\n  Bertha from Springfield writes:\n\n       I urge you to vote against SB 2609 concerning labeling of \n     foods that contain GMOs. Every American has the right to know \n     what they are putting in their bodies. You were elected to \n     represent all Oregonians and protect our rights, be assured I \n     will check yours and every other representatives' voting \n     records before I cast my votes in the future.\n\n  Let's turn to Eli from Medford, OR:\n\n       I want to hear you come out publicly against S. 2609. \n     Please lead the fight to get GMOs clearly labeled without \n     delay.\n\n  Well, Eli, that is exactly what I am doing. I hadn't read your letter \nbefore I started speaking out strongly because I fundamentally believe \nwe are here to represent our citizens--not to bow down to special \ninterests--and this is as clear as it gets. This is as straightforward \nas it could possibly be.\n  Let's turn to Ms. JC in Salem, OR:\n\n       Please, I am requesting you NOT to support (S. 2609) \n     (referred by some as the Dark Act) when it comes up for a \n     vote in the Senate. I know the Senate Agricultural Committee \n     voted 14-6 to pass the Dark Act S. 2609 last week. I believe \n     the government should protect OUR RIGHT TO KNOW what's in our \n     food. Please DO NOT VOTE to block GMO labeling.\n\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\n\n  She goes on:\n\n       Most European nations do not allow these types of food to \n     be grown or sold in their countries. This should give you \n     some information about how people in other countries view \n     genetically modified foods.\n       Please do not support this legislation. Your constituents \n     will appreciate your support for their right to know what's \n     in the foods we put on our plates to feed to our families.\n\n  That is a very personal issue: what you are putting in your mouth, \nwhat you are putting on your family's table for your partner and your \nchildren. That is a very powerful issue, and here we have Senators who \ndo not care and want to take away that right for something so close to \npeople's hearts.\n  Let's turn to Sheila in Pendleton, OR:\n\n       I want to urge Senator Merkley to vote against the S. 2609, \n     which would block mandatory labeling of genetically \n     engineered foods. I urge the Senator to stand up for states' \n     rights and individual rights to know. We have a right to know \n     what is in our food so that we can make educated decisions \n     about the food we eat.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       The free market can only work when consumers have the \n     information they need to make informed choices. Contrary to \n     what you hear from industry, GMO food labeling will not \n     increase food prices. Companies frequently change labels for \n     all sorts of reasons, without passing those costs on to \n     consumers.\n\n  Let me dwell on that point for a moment. It is completely reasonable \nnot to have 50 different State standards that are conflicting, but what \nis unreasonable is to say that putting simple information on the \nlabel--consumer-friendly information--costs a dime because that label \nis printed at the same cost whether or not it includes a symbol that \nsays ``This food contains GE ingredients.'' It doesn't cost any more to \nprint the calories on the label, doesn't cost any more to put the \nvitamin D content, doesn't cost any more to print a symbol or a phrase \nor an asterisk indicating there are GE ingredients. So let's just be \nthrough with that argument that somehow there is a cost issue.\n  Ronald from Medford writes:\n\n       Oppose S. 2609, the anti-GMO labeling bill. Allow States to \n     enact their own GMO labeling laws.\n\n  And that is a point--States' rights. I hear all the time from \ncolleagues here on this floor about States' rights, that the Federal \nGovernment should treat States as a laboratory to experiment with \nideas, to see if they work, to perfect ideas that might be considered \nfor national adoption. And isn't that exactly what Vermont is--a State \nlaboratory that is implementing a bill on July 1? And we could all \nwatch and see whether it works.\n  On July 1, there will be no conflicting State standards because there \nis only one State involved--Vermont. So we don't have to have confusing \nlabels going from different warehouses to different States because \nthere is just one State putting forward a standard. So it is an \nopportunity for us to view that as a laboratory and see how it works. \nOther States might want to copy if it works well, or they might want a \ndifferent version. Then the Senate could say: You know what, now we \nhave conflicting State standards, and let's address the core issue, \nwhich is a consumer-friendly indication on the package, and get rid of \nthe conflicting State standards. That would be a fair and appropriate \nrole for this Senate to play.\n  But to crush the only State laboratory that is about to come into \nexistence in exchange for nothing but a hall of mirrors that does not \ngive any reasonable opportunity for the consumer as a shopper to find \nout the information they need--the information they can get in 1 second \nby looking on the label but would instead take 10 minutes or 30 minutes \nor they may not even be able to get it at all while standing there in \nthe grocery store looking at the very first product on their list.\n  Joshua of Eugene says:\n\n       Please support the public's right to know what food has GMO \n     contained in it and work to defeat the DARK Act.\n       Additionally, I fully support also the public's right to \n     know where their food comes from, the country of origin, as \n     well as what nutritional content is in all food eaten in \n     restaurants.\n\n  So he is suggesting that we should expand this conversation to \nrestaurants. For now, let's talk about packaged foods. And he is also \ncommenting on country of origin.\n  I want to live in a nation where, if I choose to buy the produce \ngrown in America, I get to buy the produce grown in America. I want to \nlive in a nation where, if I choose to buy the meat raised in America \nand support American ranchers, I get to support American ranchers. It \nmay simply be because I want to help out my fellow countrymen. It may \nbe because I think they have superior produce or make a superior \nproduct, a type of meat. It may just be patriotism. But it should be my \nright to know where that food is grown.\n  We have a law, country-of-origin labeling, that does exactly that \nbecause consumers want to know. It isn't about what steak to put in \nyour mouth; it is about where the food was grown.\n  It so happens that we are part of a trade agreement--the World Trade \nOrganization--that says our labeling of where pork and beef are grown \nis a trade impediment. I couldn't disagree more. We have lost case \nafter case in the WTO over this topic. Finally, we had to take country-\nof-origin labeling off of our beef and off of our pork. We haven't had \nto take it off our other meats, other produce. I hope we get to the \npoint where we can fully restore our country-of-origin labeling because \nit matters to Americans.\n  What kind of country are we when we don't even have the right to buy \nour fellow citizens' produce and our fellow citizens' meat? Talk about \nstripping away freedom. Yet here comes a group of Senators on this \nfloor who want to further strip the rights of consumers. No wonder \nAmerican citizens are angry with their government. No wonder they are \nangry specifically with Congress, that they rate us so unfavorably, \nbelow 10 percent. No wonder they are cynical because of things like \nthis, where we ignore the fundamental desires of citizens and instead \ncave in to a powerful special interest. That is not the way it is \nsupposed to be in the United States of America.\n  Terry of Lake Oswego writes:\n\n       GMO free food is information we need to have. I need the \n     right to decide what to eat and feed my family. If the food \n     industry want[s] to produce foods without meeting certain \n     standards, using whatever they want to make their product, \n     sell foods to us, what protection do we have? Do we really \n     know the long term effects of altered food ingredients?\n\n  Well, Terry, no, we don't know all the effects, but we do know there \nis a series of potential benefits and a series of problems. Those \nproblems are the massive runoff of herbicide--which is a name for \nplant-killing chemicals--massive runoff of plant-killing chemicals into \nour streams. There are plants in our streams--algae, microorganisms--\nthat are the fundamental basis of the food chain, and that makes a \ndifference. We do know this herbicide is classified as a potential \nhuman carcinogen by the World Health Organization. We also know those \nwho eat GMO food end up with more glyphosate--that is herbicide--in \ntheir body.\n  But it is up to you, Terry, to decide whether you have concerns about \nthis. You should get to decide. No Senator can come to this floor, \nTerry, and say: I know better. I want to strip your ability to make a \ndecision because I know everything. And you know what. I don't care \nabout the scientific research; I just want to serve these powerful ad \ncompanies that don't want you to know. So too bad, Terry, and too bad \nto the 90 percent of Americans, 90 percent of Democrats, 90 percent of \nRepublicans, 90 percent of Independents, 90 percent of women, 90 \npercent of men--I am rounding off but pretty close--90 percent of the \nyoung. Too bad for all of that because Senators here want to deny you \nthe information on which to make the decision you are asking for.\n  Gail of Portland, OR, says:\n\n       Please do all you can to defeat S. 2609. It is my \n     understanding that under this bill, it would be illegal for \n     States to require GMO labeling, even though polls show that \n     93 percent of Americans support labeling efforts.\n\n  Well, Gail, I don't have the poll you have that says 93 percent of \nAmericans support labeling, but I do have this poll done in November \n2015 by a reputable pollster that says 89 percent. So let's take your \n93 percent and let's take this poll's 89 percent and just agree that \nbasically 9 out of 10 Americans want this information on the product. \nAnd when asked if they want it in the form of a mysterious barcode that \ncompromises\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\ntheir privacy if they use it--they don't even know why it is on the \nproduct--or they want it in terms of a simple statement or symbol, they \nwant the simple statement or symbol.\n  So, Gail, thank you for your letter.\n  William of Chemult, OR, said:\n\n       I was distressed to learn that the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee last week approved the voluntary GMO labeling. . . \n     . This would be a disaster if it became law. As your \n     constituent, I'm writing to ask you to oppose this and any \n     other scheme that would make GMO labeling voluntary.\n\n  William, I am sorry to report that it is even worse than voluntary \nbecause an actual label is banned by this bill. A State cannot put a \nreal label or symbol on the product. Instead, this is the anti-label \nbill. It says you have to put on things so the customer can't see there \nare GE ingredients. It has banned putting clear, simple, consumer-\nfriendly information on the product. Instead, it proposes a wild goose \nchase where you have to call some call center somewhere, some 800 \nnumber somewhere and hope that you can get through the phone tree; hope \nthat eventually they will stop saying: Because of call volume, it will \nbe another 30 minutes before we can talk to you; hope that somehow when \nyou get to that call center, it is not staffed by folks who speak the \nEnglish language with such an accent that you don't even understand \nwhat they are saying or they do not understand what you are saying.\n  It is even worse, William, because they want to put a barcode on as a \nsubstitute, with no indication for the purpose of this barcode, so that \nit is just a mystery. Why is this there? I don't know. Does this tell \nyou about their upcoming products? Does this tell you about \nadvertisements for discounts if you take your smartphone and you snap \non this? Because the only way that barcode has value--and every Senator \nin this room knows this fact--it only has value if you tell the \nconsumer why that barcode is on the package. If it says ``This product \nhas GE ingredients. For details, scan this bar code,'' then that is a \nvaluable contribution, but without that indication, this is just \nanother wild goose chase taking customers on a crazy adventure with no \nreal information when they could have had a symbol that in 1 second \nanswered their question.\n  And, William, it gets worse. If you can believe it, it gets worse, \nbecause under this voluntary standard, what counts as a nonlabel--not \nonly a 1-800 number or a barcode or a computer code of some sort--what \nalso counts is putting something in social media somewhere. Well, what \nsocial media? There are a hundred different social media companies. How \nare you possibly supposed to discover, even if you wanted to, what the \ninformation is on that product?\n  All of this is designed, William, to prevent you from getting the \ninformation you want right on the package with a simple little symbol--\nnot a symbol that is pejorative, not a symbol that is scary--chosen by \nthe FDA just to give you the information. Brazil uses a ``t'' in a \ntriangle. That would be fine. It doesn't really matter what the symbol \nis because citizens who want to know can find out that indicates there \nare GE ingredients. But, no, that would be giving you information, and \nthe goal of the Monsanto Deny Americans the Right to Know Act is to \nprevent you from getting information.\n  I want to turn to Anna in Beaverton, OR. Anna says:\n\n       I wanted to ask that you share with your colleagues that \n     this bill is insulting to the intelligence of Americans, \n     limits citizens the right to make safe choices when \n     purchasing food; hamstrings diet and medical professionals \n     who treat, among other things, food allergies and therefore \n     could result in an allergic person ingesting a food fraction \n     that could result in a serious, even fatal, allergic \n     reaction.\n\n  Here is the point: This bill is an insult to the intelligence of \nAmericans. Anna, you have this right. This is about Senators who do not \nrespect your intelligence, who do not honor your right to make a \ndecision as a consumer. They know that this is an incredibly popular \nidea to put a symbol or phrase on a package to indicate it has key \ningredients because citizens want to know. The Members here know this, \nand they don't care because they want to make the decision for you. \nThey do not want to allow you freedom to make your own choices. They do \nnot consider you to be an adult. They want to treat you like a child \nwho is fed only the information they want to give you.\n\n  So, Anna, I am deeply disturbed about this insulting legislation that \ntears down the intelligence of our American citizens, that says to the \n9 out of 10 Americans in every State in this Union that we want to \nstrip away your ability to make your own choice.\n  Keri from Eugene writes: ``Why are we protecting large conglomerates \nand processed food companies instead of protecting the American people \nand the land?''\n  Well, that is a good question, Keri. I suppose it is because these \ncompanies make huge donations under the constitutional decisions of our \nSupreme Court.\n  It is a very interesting story about the evolution of our country. \nWhen our forefathers got together to draft the Constitution, they had a \nvision of citizens having an equal voice. That decision was somewhat \nflawed, as we all know--flaws we corrected over time related to race, \nrelated to gender. But the fundamental principle was that citizens got \nto have an equal voice.\n  What they pictured was this: They pictured a town commons, which cost \nnothing to participate in, and each citizen could get up and share \ntheir view in that town commons, could share their view before the town \nvoted, or could share that view equally with the person representing \nthem in Congress. This is what Thomas Jefferson called the mother \nprinciple--that we are only a republic to the degree that the decisions \nwe make reflect the will of the people. He said for that to happen, the \ncitizens have to have an equal voice. Those are the words he used: \n``equal voice'' and ``mother principle.'' Lincoln talked about the same \nthing: equal voice as the foundation of our Nation.\n  So when you ask the question, Keri, about why are we protecting large \nconglomerates at the expense of where the American people stand, you \nhave to go back 40 years ago to a case called Buckley v. Valeo. In \nBuckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court stood this principle--the mother \nprinciple of equal voice--on its head because now we have a commons \nthat is for sale. The commons is the television. The commons is the \nradio. The commons is the information on Web sites.\n  They basically said that Americans could buy as much of that commons \nas they want. So instead of an equal voice, Jefferson's mother \nprinciple, we instead have a completely unequal voice. Those with \nfabulous wealth have the equivalent of a stadium sound system, and they \nuse it to drown out the voice of ordinary Americans.\n  Then a couple of years ago, on a 5-to-4 decision of the Supreme \nCourt, they doubled down on the destruction of our ``We the People'' \nNation. They tore those three words out of the start of our \nConstitution, and they did so by saying: You know what. We are going to \nallow the board members of a corporation to utilize their owners' money \nfor the political purposes that the board wants to use, and they don't \nhave to even inform the owners of the company that they are using their \nmoney for these political purposes. So we have this vast concentration \nof power in corporations because corporations are large. If they have a \nsmall board, the board says: We want to influence politics in this \nfashion, and we don't even have to tell the owners about it. So that is \na hugely additional destructive force on top of Buckley v. Valeo. There \nis nothing in the Constitution that comes close to saying that \ncorporations are people, and there certainly is nothing that says a few \npeople who sit in the decisionmaking capacity should be able to take \nother people's money and spend it for their own political purposes. It \nwas never envisioned.\n  Between these decisions over several decades, we have destroyed the \nvery premise of our Constitution, Thomas Jefferson's mother principle, \nthat we are only a republic to the degree that we reflect the will of \nthe people.\n  That is the best I can do, Keri, to explain how it is possible that \nthis bill, which flies in the face of 9 out of 10 Americans, has made \nit to this floor. This bill didn't go through committee. We have \nleadership in this body that pledged regular order. They were going to \nput things through committee and bring bills to the floor that had been \npassed by committee. But this hasn't been. That is how much, as Keri \nput it,\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n``large conglomerates'' are influencing what happens here in this \nSenate.\n  Judith of Grants Pass says:\n\n       Please do NOT support [this bill] that would block states \n     from requiring labels on genetically modified foods. People \n     have a right to know [whether or not they are considered \n     safe].\n\n  She is right. She is absolutely right. It is whether or not there \nthey are considered safe. This isn't a scientific debate. There is \nscience of concerns--science that I have laid out here on the floor. \nThere is also science about benefits. But that is not the issue. The \nissue is a citizen's right to make their own decision. If they are \nconcerned about the massive increase in herbicides and the destruction \nit does to the soil, they have a right to exercise that in the \nmarketplace. If they are concerned about the massive amount of runoff \nof herbicides affecting the basic food chains in our streams and \nrivers, they have that right. If they are concerned about the fact that \nthere has been some movement of genes from crops to related weeds that \nthen become resistant to herbicides, that is their business. If they \nare concerned that Bt corn is producing superbugs resistant to the \npesticide, that is their business.\n  These are not phantom ideas or phantom concerns. These are \nscientifically documented concerns. None of this says it is unsafe to \nput in your mouth. I hear that all the time: Well, it is not unsafe to \nput these GE things in your mouth. But here is the thing: That isn't \nthe basis on which we label. We label things people care about, and \nthere are implications to how things are grown and their impact.\n  For example, we have a Federal law that says grocery stores have to \nlabel the difference between wild fish and farmed fish. Why is that? \nWell, there are implications to what happens in different types of \nfarms, and citizens are given a heads-up by this law, and they can \ndecide. They can look into it and see if it is a concern. They may not \nbe at all concerned about how catfish are raised in a farm setting, but \nthey may be very concerned about how salmon are raised in farm settings \nbecause we find there are some bad effects of salmon raised in pens in \nthe ocean that transfer disease to wild salmon. That is their right. \nThey get to look into that. We give them that ability by requiring this \ninformation be on the package.\n  I don't hear anyone in this Chamber standing up right now and saying \nthey want to strip our packages of the information of wild fish versus \nfarmed fish. We have basic information on packages regarding whether \njuice is fresh or whether it is created from concentrate because \ncitizens care about the difference. So we give them this basic \ninformation to facilitate their choice. And that is the point: We \nfacilitate their choice.\n  Kimberly writes in:\n\n       I am writing you today to urge you to vote no on . . . \n     [anything that would] block Vermont's . . . [bill].\n       The right to know what we eat is critical.\n\n  Richard from Portland writes: ``I urge you to filibuster, if need be, \nto stop the `Dark Act.'''\n  Well, I would like to do that, Richard. I would like to do anything I \ncan to slow this down so the American people know what is going on. But \nhere is the level of cynicism in this Chamber: Last night, when the \nmajority leader filed this bill, which has never gone through \ncommittee, he simultaneously filed a petition to close debate. Under \nthe rules of the Senate, that means, after an intervening day, there is \ngoing to be a vote, and there is no way that my speaking here day and \nnight can stop it because it is embedded in the basic rules.\n  However, I can try to come to this floor several times and lay out \nthese basic arguments and hope to wake up America to what is being \nplotted and planned in this Chamber right now. So that is what I am \ntrying to do. I hope that it will have an impact. I hope that when the \nvote comes tomorrow morning after this intervening day--Tuesday being \nthe intervening day--that my colleagues will say this is just wrong--\nstripping from Americans the right to know something 9 out of 10 \nAmericans want, stripping States of the ability to respond to their \ncitizens' desires, shutting down a single State laboratory in Vermont \nwhen there is no conflict on labels at this point because only one \nState is implementing a law.\n  I hope that they will say: You know what. This should be properly \nconsidered in committee. This bill should be in committee. It should be \ngiven full opportunity when it does come to the floor--and I assume it \nwould--to be openly amended so that anyone who wants to put forward an \namendment would be able to do so. That is the way the Senate used to \nwork.\n  When I was here as an intern in 1976, I was asked to staff the Tax \nReform Act of that year. I sat up in the staff gallery. At that point \nthere was no television on this floor; therefore, nobody outside this \nroom could track what was going on. There were no cell phones. There \nwas no other way to convey what was occurring. So the staff sat up in \nthe staff gallery, and when a vote was called, you would go down the \nstaircase to the elevator just outside here. You would meet your \nSenator, and you would brief your Senator on the debate that was \nhappening on that amendment. That is what I did--amendment after \namendment, day after day. Then, as soon as that amendment was voted on, \nthere would be a group of Senators seeking recognition of the Presiding \nOfficer, and you would hear everyone simultaneously go, ``Mr. \nPresident,'' because the rule is that the Presiding Officer is supposed \nto recognize the very first person he or she hears, and so everyone \ntried to be first the moment that an amendment was done, the moment the \nvote was announced. Well, with all those people simultaneously seeking \nthe attention of the Chair, it is really impossible for the Chair to \nsort out exactly who is speaking first. So they call on someone on the \nleft side of the Chamber, and then, when that amendment was done an \nhour later--because they would debate it for an hour and hold the vote; \nwhen the vote was done, they called on somebody on the right side of \nthe Chamber. They worked it back and forth so that everyone got to have \ntheir amendment heard. That is an open amendment process.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues across the aisle call for that \nkind of process when the Democrats were in charge, and I support that \nkind of process. I supported it when I was in the majority; I support \nit when I am in the minority. Everything I have proposed or talked \nabout to make this Senate Chamber work better as a legislative body I \nhave supported consistently, whether I am in the majority or whether I \nam in the minority.\n  So here is the thing. We have the opposite of that right now. We \ndon't have the Senate of the 1970s, where Senators honor their right to \ndebate and have an open amendment process. That would really change \nthis. That would provide an opportunity for all viewpoints to be heard. \nWe would never have had a cloture motion filed within seconds of the \nbill first being put on the floor, and it would have been incredibly \nrare for a bill that had not gone through committee to be put on the \nfloor.\n  We have to reclaim the legislative process, and right now we don't \nhave it. So that is a great reason to vote no tomorrow morning. Voting \nno tomorrow morning is the right vote if you believe in States' rights. \nIt is the right vote if you believe in the consumers' right to know, \nthe citizens' right to know. And it is the right vote if you believe we \nshouldn't have a process in this Chamber that just jams through \nsomething for a powerful special interest at the expense of the 9 or 10 \nAmericans who want this information.\n  So tomorrow, colleagues, let's turn down this insult to the \nintelligence of Americans, this assault on States' rights, this \ndeprivation, this attack on the freedom of our citizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the next Supreme Court Justice could \ndramatically change the direction of the Court. And the majority of \nthis body believes the American people shouldn't be denied the \nopportunity to weigh in on this question. We believe there should be a \ndebate about the role of Supreme Court Justices in our constitutional \nsystem.\n  With that in mind, I wanted to spend a few minutes discussing the \nappropriate role of the Court. Before I turn to that, I wish to note \nthat the minority leader continues his daily missives on the Supreme \nCourt vacancy.\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n  Most of us around here take what he says with a grain of salt. So, I \nam not going to waste time responding to everything he says. I will \nnote that this is what he said in 2005 when the other side was \nfilibustering a number of circuit court nominations, and a few months \nbefore they filibustered the Alito nomination to the Supreme Court:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. It says \n     appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee \n     receives a vote.\n\n  With that, I will turn to the appropriate role of a Justice under our \nConstitution. Part of what makes America an exceptional Nation is our \nfounding document. It is the oldest written Constitution in the world. \nIt created a functioning republic, provided stability, protected \nindividual rights, and was structured so that different branches and \nlevels of government can resist encroachment into their areas of \nresponsibility. A written Constitution contains words with fixed \nmeanings. The Constitution, and in many ways the Nation, has survived \nbecause we have remained true to those words. And our constitutional \nrepublic is ultimately safeguarded by a Supreme Court that enforces the \nConstitution and its text.\n  Our Constitution creates a republic where the people decide who will \ngovern them, and by what rules. The Supreme Court can override the \npeople's wishes only where the Constitution prohibits what the people's \nelected officials have enacted. Otherwise, the Court's rulings are \nimproper. Stated differently, the Justices aren't entitled to displace \nthe democratic process with their own views. Where the Constitution is \nsilent, the people decide how they will be governed.\n  This fundamental feature of our republic is critical to preserving \nliberty. The temptation to apply their own views rather than the \nConstitution has always lurked among the Justices. This led to the Dred \nScott decision. It led to striking down many economic regulations early \nin the last century. And Americans know all too well in recent decades \nthat the Supreme Court has done this regularly. Justice Scalia believed \nthat to ensure objectivity rather than subjectivity in judicial \ndecision-making, the Constitution must be read according to its text \nand its original meaning as understood at the time those words were \nwritten.\n  The Constitution is law, and it has meaning. Otherwise, what the \nCourt offers is merely politics, masquerading as constitutional law. \nJustice Scalia wrote that the rule of law is a law of rules. Law is not \nJustices reading their own policy preferences into the Constitution. It \nis not a multifactor balancing test untethered to the text. We all know \nthat Justices apply these balancing tests to reach their preferred \npolicy results.\n  The Court is not, and should not, be engaged in a continuing \nConstitutional Convention designed to update our founding document to \nconform with the Justices' personal policy preference. The Constitution \nis not a living document. The danger with any Justice who believes they \nare entitled to ``update'' the Constitution is that they will always \nupdate it to conform with their own views. That is not the appropriate \nrole of a Justice. As Justice Scalia put it, ``The-times-they-are-a-\nchangin' is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty.''\n  Now, when conservatives say the role of Justices is to interpret the \nConstitution and not to legislate from the bench, we are stating a view \nas old as the Constitution itself. The Framers separated the powers of \nthe Federal Government.\n  In Federalist 78, Hamilton wrote, ``The interpretation of the laws is \nthe proper and peculiar province of the courts.'' It is up to elected \nrepresentatives, who are accountable to the people, to make the law. It \nis up to the courts to interpret it.\n  These views of the judicial role under the Constitution were once \nwidely held. But beginning with the Warren Court of the 1960s, the \nconcept took hold that the Justices were change agents for society. \nDemocracy was messy and slow. It was much easier for Justices to impose \ntheir will on society in the guise of constitutional interpretation.\n  Acting as a superlegislature was so much more powerful than deciding \ncases by reading the legal text and the record. The view took hold that \na Justice could vote on a legal question just as he or she would vote \nas a legislator. Perhaps the Framers underestimated what Federalist 78 \ncalled the ``least dangerous branch,'' one that ``can take no active \nresolution whatever.'' Since the days of the Warren Court, this \nactivist approach has been common: striking down as unconstitutional \nlaws that the Constitution doesn't even address.\n  Now, to his credit, President Obama has been explicit in his view \nthat Justices aren't bound by the law. While he usually pays lip \nservice to the traditional, limited, and proper role of the Court to \ndecide cases based on law and facts, he is always quick to add that on \nthe tough cases, a judge should look to her heart or rely on empathy.\n  The President's empathy standard is completely inconsistent with the \njudicial duty to be impartial. Asking a Justice to consider empathy in \ndeciding cases is asking a Justice to rule based on his or her own \npersonal notion of right and wrong, rather than law.\n  As I have said, everyone knows this President won't be filling the \ncurrent vacancy. Nonetheless, the President has indicated he intends to \nsubmit a nomination. That is ok. He is constitutionally empowered to \nmake the nomination. And the Senate holds the constitutional power to \nwithhold consent, as we will. But as we debate the proper role of the \nCourt, and what type of Justice the next President should nominate, it \nis instructive to examine what the President says he is looking for in \na nominee.\n  The President made clear his nominee, whoever it is, won't decide \ncases only on the law or the Constitution. He wrote that in ``cases \nthat reach the Supreme Court in which the law is not clear,'' the \nJustice should apply his or her ``life experience.''\n  This, of course, is just an updated version of the same standard we \nhave heard from this President before. It is the empathy standard. Of \ncourse, a Justice who reaches decisions based on empathy or life \nexperience has a powerful incentive to read every case as unclear, so \nthey have a free hand to rely on their life experiences to reach just \noutcomes.\n  The President also said any Justice he would nominate would consider \n``the way [the law] affects the daily reality of people's lives in a \nbig, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times. That, I \nbelieve, is an essential element for arriving at just decisions and \nfair outcomes.''\n  With all respect to the President, any nominee who supports this \napproach is advocating an illegitimate role for the Court. It is flatly \nnot legitimate for any Justice to apply his or her own personal views \nof justice and fairness.\n  Perhaps most troubling is the President's statement that any nominee \nof his must ``arrive[] at just decisions and fair outcomes.'' That is \nthe very definition of results-oriented judging. And it flies in the \nface of a judge as a fair, neutral, and totally objective decision-\nmaker in any particular case. A Justice is to question assumptions and \napply rigorous scrutiny to the arguments the parties advance, as did \nJustice Scalia.\n  Under the President's approach, a Justice will always arrive where he \nor she started. That isn't judging. That is a super-legislator in a \nblack robe. In our history, regrettably, we have had Justices who \nembraced this conception. Chief Justice Warren was infamous for asking, \n``Is it just? Is it fair?'' without any reference to law, when he \nvoted.\n  Justice Scalia's entire tenure on the Court was devoted to ending \nthis misplaced and improper approach. In reality, a Justice is no more \nentitled to force another American to adhere to his or her own moral \nviews or life experiences than any other ordinary American.\n  Imposition of such personal biases subjects citizens to decrees from \non high that they can't change, except through constitutional \namendment. And those decrees are imposed by officials they can't vote \nout of office.\n  This is not the constitutional republic the Framers created. The \nAmerican people deserve the opportunity during this election year to \nweigh in on\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\nwhether our next Justice should apply the text of the Constitution, or \nalternatively, whether a Justice should rely on his or her own life \nexperiences and personal sense of right and wrong to arrive at just \ndecisions and fair outcomes. Senate Republicans will ensure the \nAmerican people aren't denied this unique and historic opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I listened to what my good friend from Iowa \nsaid about the standards that he is afraid an Obama nominee would \nutilize. I note that in the dozens and dozens of cases--probably \nhundreds--that Obama nominees have been voted on, my friend from Iowa \ndid not mention a single case where they applied it to anything but the \nlaw, and I suspect that standard would apply to anybody the President \nwould nominate.\n  Now, Mr. President, on another matter, I want to set the record \nstraight. Contrary to the remarks of the Senate majority leader \nyesterday, Vermont has not recently passed a GE food-labeling law. I \nmention that because I am old-fashioned enough to like to have things \nclear and accurate in this Chamber.\n  It was in May 2014--nearly 2 years ago--that after 2 years of debate, \nmore than 50 committee hearings featuring testimony from more than 130 \nrepresentatives on all sides of the issue, the Vermont Legislature \npassed and the Governor of Vermont signed into law a disclosure \nrequirement for genetically engineered ingredients in foods.\n  Now, in this body: After one hearing 5 months ago that was only \ntangentially related to the issue, and without any open debate on the \nfloor, the Republican leadership has decided that it knows better than \nthe State of Vermont. Today we are being asked to tell Vermonters and \nconstituents in other States with similar laws that their opinion, \ntheir views, and their own legislative process simply doesn't matter \nbecause we can decide on a whim to ignore them. We are actually being \nasked to tell consumers that their right to know isn't, frankly, theirs \nat all.\n  I think in my State, in the Presiding Officer's State, and all the \nother Senators' States, consumers think they have a right to know. Now \nwe are telling them: Not so much.\n  I hear from Vermonters regularly and with growing frequency that they \nare proud of Vermont's Act 120. It is a law that simply requires food \nmanufacturers to disclose when the ingredients they use are genetically \nengineered. It doesn't tell them they can't use those ingredients; it \nsimply says: Consumers have a right to know. Tell us what you are \ndoing.\n  Vermonters are concerned and some are actually outraged that the \nCongress is trying to roll back their right to know what is in the food \nthat they give their families. Vermont is not the only State whose laws \nare under attack; we just happen to be the State with the fastest \napproaching deadline for implementation.\n  The bill we are considering today is a hasty reaction--a reaction \nwith no real, open hearing--in response to a 2-year-old law that is set \nto finally take effect and doesn't fully take effect until the end of \nthis year. Instead of protecting consumers and trying to find a true \ncompromise, this bill continues the status quo and tells the public: We \ndon't want you to have simple access to information about the foods you \nconsume. You don't need to know what is in the food. Trust us. We know \nbetter. We, Members of the Senate, know better than you do, so we are \nnot going to let you know what is going on. It is no wonder that people \nget concerned.\n  Vermont's law and others like it around the country are not an attack \non biotechnology. Vermont's law and others like it merely require \nfactual labeling intended to inform consumers. All we are saying is, if \nyou are going to buy something, you ought to know what you are getting. \nIf you want to buy it, go ahead. Nobody is stopping you. But you ought \nto be able to know what is in it.\n  Producers of food with GE products have nothing to hide. Let's take \nCampbell's, which is a multibillion-dollar brand. It is certainly one \nof the biggest brands in this country. They are already taking steps to \nlabel their products. They have to do that to comply with similar laws \nin other countries. They said: Sure, we will comply, and we will label \nour packages.\n  Our ranking member on the Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow, \nhas had commitments from other CEOs in the food industry who are ready \nand able to move ahead with labeling and national disclosure. They \nactually know that consumers really care about what they are getting. \nNow the U.S. Senate wants to tell those millions of consumers ``You \nhave no right to know. We are going to block your chance to know, and \nwe are going to keep you from knowing what is in your food.'' And some \nof these large companies are saying that they agree with the consumer. \nAn asterisk, a symbol, a factual notation on a product label is not \ngoing to send our economy into a tailspin and cause food prices to \nspiral out of control.\n  Again, let's get rid of the rhetoric. I heard some on the floor in \nthis Chamber argue that Vermont's labeling law will cost consumers an \naverage of $1,000 more per year on food purchases. Wow. The second \nsmallest State in the Nation passed a law that simply tells companies \nto disclose the ingredients in the food consumers are buying, and \nsomehow that law is going to cost consumers $1,000 more per year in \nfood purchases? If the claim wasn't so laughable, we might be able to \nignore it. But we found out where that cost estimate came from. It came \ndirectly from a study paid for by the Corn Refiners Association and is \nbased on every single food manufacturer in the United States \neliminating GE ingredients from their food. We are not asking anybody \nto eliminate anything--this is not what anyone is asking companies or \nfarmers to do. We are just saying: If I buy something and I am going to \nfeed it to my children--or in my case, my grandchildren--or my wife and \nI are going to eat it, I would kind of like to know what is in it. All \nwe are asking for is a simple label.\n  At a time when too much of the national discourse is hyperbolic at \nbest, why don't we set an example for the rest of the country? Try a \nlittle truth in this Chamber. GE labeling should be the least of our \nwoes.\n  In fact, the bill before us today is an attack on another Vermont \nlaw. That law has been on the books for only, well, 10 years. Oh my \nGod, the sky is falling. It is actually similar to a law that is on the \nbooks in Virginia these are genetically engineered seed labeling laws. \nFarmers in both Vermont and Virginia have benefited from this law, and \nthose selling seed to other States have complied with it. Why preempt \nState laws that have worked well for 10 years and with which companies \nare already complying? Are we going to do that because one or two \ncompanies that are willing to spend a great deal of money feel \notherwise?\n  GE labeling is about disclosure. It gives consumers more information, \nmore choices, and more control on what they feed themselves and their \nfamilies. If we hide information from the consumers, we limit a measure \nof accountability for producers and marketers.\n  I don't know what people are trying to hide. Our producers and \nmarketers in Vermont are proud to showcase not just the quality of \ntheir products but the methods by which they are produced. We are not \nblocking our markets to anybody, whether it is GE foods or otherwise. \nIf it works, we ought to give people a choice. Why have 100 people here \nsay: Oh no, we know better than all of you.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of Senator Merkley's bill. It provides for a \nstrong national disclosure standard. It would give manufacturers a \nwhole variety of options to disclose the presence of GE ingredients in \ntheir food, and they can pick and choose how they do it.\n  I am equally grateful to Senator Stabenow. She has fought hard to \nnegotiate a pathway toward a national disclosure standard. We should \nnot move forward with this bill without an open and full debate. We \nshouldn't just say to consumers throughout the country: We know better \nthan you.\n  I am not going to support any bill that takes away the right of \nVermont or any State to legislate in a way that advances consumer \nawareness. If we don't want to have a patchwork of State disclosure \nlaws, then let's move\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\nin the direction of setting a national mandatory standard. Some of the \nbiggest food companies in this country are moving forward and complying \nwith Vermont's law.\n  This week is Sunshine Week, so let's hope the Senate rejects efforts \nto close doors and not let the American public know what is in their \nfood. I hope they will oppose advancing this hastily crafted \nlegislation and work towards a solution that actually lets the \nconsumers in Texas, Iowa, Vermont, or anywhere else know what is in \ntheir food.\n  I see the distinguished majority deputy leader on the floor. I have \nmore to say, but I will save it for later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1494-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1494-S1496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, when the Senate passed the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, I spoke on this floor about \nthe good work that is getting done in the Senate since Republicans took \nover. Time and again, we have seen both sides of the aisle come \ntogether to find practical solutions to real problems facing the \nAmerican people.\n  That is the way the Senate is supposed to work, and we need to keep \nthat momentum as we move forward to tackle other critical issues.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I continue to be proud of the \nrole we have played in getting work done in a bipartisan manner.\n  Today, on the floor of the Senate, we are doing that once again. We \nare passing another Judiciary Committee bill that carries strong, \nbipartisan support. We are passing another Judiciary Committee bill \nthat solves real issues and is supported by folks on all ends of the \npolitical spectrum.\n  Don't get me wrong. Finding agreement on both sides of the aisle is \nno easy task. Even the most well-intentioned efforts can get bogged in \nthe details.\n  But the fact that we are here today is a testament to good-faith \nnegotiations and a commitment to make government work for the American \npeople. And it is another indication of what this institution can be \nand what it was meant to be.\n  The FOIA Improvement Act makes much-needed improvements to the \nFreedom of Information Act, and its passage marks a critically \nimportant step in the right direction toward fulfilling FOIA's promise \nof open government.\n  I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the FOIA Improvement Act, \nand I want to thank Senator Cornyn and the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for their tireless, bipartisan work \nto advance this bill through the Senate.\n  I am especially proud that the bill's passage occurs during this \nyear's Sunshine Week, an annual nationwide initiative highlighting the \nimportance of openness and transparency in government.\n  Every year, Sunshine Week falls around the birthday of James Madison, \nthe father of our Constitution. This isn't by mistake.\n  Madison's focus on ensuring that government answers to the people is \nembodied in the spirit of FOIA, so passing the FOIA Improvement Act \nthis week is a fitting tribute to his commitment to accountable \ngovernment and the protection of individual liberty. And it is an \nopportunity for us all to recommit ourselves to these same higher \nprinciples.\n  This year marks the 50th anniversary of FOIA's enactment. For over \nfive decades, FOIA has worked to help folks stay in the know about what \ntheir government is up to. The Supreme Court said it best when it \ndeclared: ``The basic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an informed \ncitizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to \ncheck against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the \ngoverned.''\n  To put it simply, FOIA was created to ensure government transparency, \nand transparency yields accountability.\n  After all, a government that operates in the dark, without fear of \nexposure or scrutiny, is one that enables misdeeds by those who govern \nand fosters distrust among the governed. By peeling back the curtains \nand allowing the sunlight to shine in, however, FOIA helps fight back \nagainst waste, fraud, and abuse of the taxpayer's dollar.\n  No doubt, FOIA has successfully brought to light numerous stories of \ngovernment's shortcomings. Through FOIA, folks have learned about \npublic health and safety concerns, mistreatment of our Nation's \nveterans, and countless other matters that without FOIA would not have \ncome to light.\n  But despite its successes, a continued culture of government secrecy \nhas served to undermine FOIA's fundamental promise.\n  For example, we have seen dramatic increases in the number of \nbacklogged FOIA requests. Folks are waiting longer than ever to get a \nresponse from agencies. Sometimes, they simply hear nothing back at \nall. And we have seen a record-setting number of FOIA lawsuits filed to \nchallenge an agency's refusal to disclose information.\n  More and more, agencies are simply finding ways to avoid their duties \nunder FOIA altogether. They are failing to proactively disclose \ninformation, and they are abusing exemptions to withhold information \nthat should be released to the public.\n  Problems with FOIA have persisted under both Republican and Democrat \nadministrations, but under President Obama, things have only worsened, \nand his commitment to a ``new era of openness'' has proven illusory at \nbest.\n  In January, the Des Moines Register published a scathing editorial, \noutlining the breakdowns in the FOIA system and calling on Congress to \ntackle the issue head-on.\n  The editorial described: ``In the Obama administration, federal \nagencies that supposedly work for the people have repeatedly shown \nthemselves to be flat-out unwilling to comply with the most basic \nrequirements of the Freedom of Information Act.''\n  It continued: ``At some federal agencies, FOIA requests are simply \nignored, despite statutory deadlines for responses. Requesters are \noften forced to wait months or years for a response, only to be denied \naccess and be told they have just 14 days to file an appeal.''\n  According to the editorial: ``Other administrations have engaged in \nthese same practices, but Obama's penchant for secrecy is almost \nunparalleled in recent history.''\n  These are serious allegations, and no doubt, there are serious \nproblems needing fixed.\n  So reforms are necessary to address the breakdowns in the FOIA \nsystem, to tackle an immense and growing backlog of requests, to \nmodernize the way folks engage in the FOIA process, and to ultimately \nhelp change the culture in government toward openness and transparency.\n  What we have accomplished with this bill--in a bipartisan manner--is \na strong step in the right direction.\n  First, the bill makes much-needed improvements to one of the most \noverused FOIA exemptions. It places a 25-year sunset on the \ngovernment's ability to withhold certain documents that demonstrate how \nthe government reaches decisions. Currently, many of these documents \ncan be withheld from the public forever, but this bill helps bring them \ninto the sunlight, providing an important and historical perspective on \nhow our government works.\n  Second, the bill increases proactive disclosure of information. It \nrequires agencies to make publicly available any documents that have \nbeen requested and released three or more times under FOIA. This will \ngo a long way toward easing the backlog of requests.\n  Third, the bill gives more independence to the Office of Government \nInformation Services. OGIS, as it is known, acts as the public's FOIA \nombudsman and helps Congress better understand where breakdowns in the \nFOIA system are occurring. OGIS serves as a key resource for the public \nand Congress, and this bill strengthens OGIS's ability to carry out its \nvital role.\n  Fourth, through improved technology, the bill makes it easier for \nfolks to submit FOIA requests to the government. It requires the \ndevelopment of a single, consolidated online portal through which folks \ncan file a request. But let me be clear: it is not a one-size-fits-all \napproach. Agencies will still be able to rely on request-processing \nsystems they have already built into their operations.\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n  Most importantly, the bill codifies a presumption of openness for \nagencies to follow when they respond to FOIA requests. Instead of knee-\njerk secrecy, the presumption of openness tells agencies to make \nopenness and transparency their default setting.\n  These are all timely and important reforms to the FOIA process, and \nthey will help ensure a more informed citizenry and a more accountable \ngovernment.\n  So I am pleased to see this bill move through the Senate. President \nObama has an opportunity to join with Congress in securing some of the \nmost substantive and necessary improvements to FOIA since its \nenactment.\n  On July 4 of this year, FOIA turns 50. Let's continue this strong, \nbipartisan effort to send a bill to the President's desk before then. \nLet's work together to help fulfill FOIA's promise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Iowa for \nhis remarks. As he knows, I have worked for years on improving FOIA \nalong with my friend, the senior Senator from Texas. We are celebrating \nSunshine Week, a time to pay tribute to one of our Nation's most basic \nvalues--the public's right to know. Our very democracy is built on the \nidea that our government should not operate in secret. James Madison, a \nstaunch defender of open government and whose birthday we celebrate \neach year during Sunshine Week, wisely noted that for our democracy to \nsucceed, people ``must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives.'' \nIt is only through transparency and access to information that the \nAmerican people can arm themselves with the information they need to \nhold our government accountable.\n  We are also celebrating the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the \nFreedom of Information Act, FOIA, our Nation's premier transparency \nlaw. I was actually at the National Archives yesterday, and I looked at \nthe actual bill signed into law in 1966 by then-President Johnson, Vice \nPresident Hubert Humphrey, and Speaker John McCormack, all who were \nhere long before I was. I was thinking that, 50 years ago, the Freedom \nof Information Act became the foundation on which all our sunshine and \ntransparency policies rest, so I can think of no better way to \ncelebrate both Sunshine Week and the 50th Anniversary of FOIA than by \npassing the FOIA Improvement Act.\n  This bipartisan bill, which I coauthored with Senator Cornyn, \ncodifies the principle that President Obama laid out in his 2009 \nexecutive order. He asked all Federal agencies to adopt a ``presumption \nof openness'' when considering the release of government information \nunder FOIA. That follows the spirit of FOIA put into place by President \nClinton, repealed by President Bush, and reinstated as one of President \nObama's first acts in office, but I think all of us felt we should put \nthe force of law behind the presumption of openness so that the next \nPresident, whomever he or she might be, cannot change that without \ngoing back to Congress. Congress must establish a transparency standard \nthat will remain for future administrations to follow--and that is what \nour bill does. We should not leave it to the next President to decide \nhow open the government should be. We have to hold all Presidents and \ntheir administrations accountable to the highest standard. I do not \nthink my friend, the senior Senator from Texas, will object if I \nmention that in our discussions we have both said words to the effect \nthat we need FOIA, whether it is a Democratic or Republican \nadministration. I do not care who controls the administration. When \nthey do things they think are great, they will release a sheath of \npress releases about them. However, it is FOIA that lets us know when \nthey are not doing things so well. The government works better if every \nadministration is held to the same standard.\n  The FOIA Improvement Act also provides the Office of Government \nInformation Services, OGIS, with additional independence and authority \nto carry out its work. The Office of Government and Information \nServices, created by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007, \nserves as the FOIA ombudsman to the public and helps mediate disputes \nbetween FOIA requesters and agencies. Our bill will provide OGIS with \nnew tools to help carry out its mission and ensure that OGIS can \ncommunicate freely with Congress so we can better evaluate and improve \nFOIA going forward. The FOIA Improvement Act will also make FOIA easier \nto use by establishing an online portal through which the American \npeople can submit FOIA requests, and it will ensure more information is \navailable to the public by requiring that frequently requested records \nbe made available online.\n  Last Congress, the FOIA Improvement Act, which Senator Cornyn and I \nwrote, passed the Senate unanimously. The House failed to take it up. \nSo as the new Congress came in, to show we are bipartisan with a change \nfrom Democratic leadership to Republican leadership, Senator Cornyn and \nI moved quickly to reintroduce our legislation in the new Congress. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved our bill in February \n2015. Sometimes it is hard for the Senate Judiciary Committee to \nunanimously agree that the sun rises in the east, but on this issue, we \ncame together. Our bill has been awaiting Senate action for over a \nyear. I urge its swift passage today. I want the House to take it up. I \nwant the President to sign it into law. I am proud to stand here with \nmy good friend, the senior Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague, the \nSenator from Vermont, for being together with me on what some people \nwould regard as the Senate's odd couple--people with very different \nviews on a lot of different things but who try to work together on \nlegislation such as this, freedom of information reform legislation, \nbut I can think of others that we worked on as well, such as patent \nreform and criminal justice reform.\n  I think most people are a little bit surprised when they see us \nfighting like cats and dogs on various topics, which we will--and those \nfights are important when they are based on principle--I think they are \na little bit surprised when they see us then come together and try to \nfind common cause, common ground on things such as this, but this is \nthe sort of thing that makes the Senate work. This is the sort of thing \nthat the American people deserve, when Republicans and Democrats, \npeople all along the ideological spectrum, work together to find common \nground.\n  I couldn't agree with the Senator more about, really, a statement of \nhuman nature. It is only human nature to try to hide your failures and \nto trumpet your successes. It is nothing more, nothing less than that. \nBut what the Freedom of Information Act is premised on is the public's \nright to know what their government is doing on their behalf.\n  I know some people might think, well, for somebody who is a \nconservative, this is a little bit of an odd position. Actually, I \nthink it is a natural fit. If you are a conservative like me, you think \nthat the government doesn't have the answer to all the challenges that \nface our country, that sometimes, as Justice Brandeis said, sunlight is \nthe best disinfectant.\n  Indeed, I know something else about human nature: that people act \ndifferently when they know others are watching than they do when they \nthink they are in private and no one can see what they are doing. It is \njust human nature.\n  So I have worked together with Mr. Leahy, the Senator from Vermont, \nrepeatedly to try to advance reforms of our freedom of information \nlaws, and I am glad to say that today we will have another milestone in \nthat very productive, bipartisan relationship on such an important \ntopic. This is Sunshine Week, a week created to highlight the need for \nmore transparent and open government.\n  Let me mention a couple of things this bill does. It will, of course, \nas we said, strengthen the existing Freedom of Information Act by \ncreating a presumption of openness. It shouldn't be incumbent on an \nAmerican citizen asking for information from their own government--\ninformation generated and maintained at taxpayer expense--they \nshouldn't have to come in and prove something to be able to get access \nto something that is theirs in the\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nfirst place. Now, there may be good reason--classified information \nnecessary to fight our Nation's adversaries, maybe personally private \ninformation that is really not the business of government, but if it \nis, in fact, government information bought for and maintained by the \ntaxpayer, then there ought to be a presumption of openness. This \nlegislation will, in other words, build on what our Founding Fathers \nrecognized hundreds of years ago: that a truly democratic system \ndepends on an informed citizenry to hold their leaders accountable. And \nin a form of government that depends for its very legitimacy on the \nconsent of the governed, the simple point is, if the public doesn't \nknow what government is doing, how can they consent? So this is also \nabout adding additional legitimacy to what government is doing on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  I just want to again thank the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. We had a pretty productive couple of weeks with passage of \nthe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which the Presiding \nOfficer was very involved in, and now passage of this legislation by, I \nhope, unanimous consent.\n\n\n                        Presumption of Openness\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Senator Cornyn and I have worked together \nto improve and protect the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA--our \nNation's premiere transparency law--for many years and look forward to \ncontinuing this partnership.\n  The bill we passed today codifies the principle that President Obama \nlaid out in his 2009 Executive order in which he asked all Federal \nagencies to adopt a ``presumption of openness'' when considering the \nrelease of government information under FOIA. This policy embodies the \nvery spirit of FOIA. By putting the force of law behind the presumption \nof openness, Congress can establish a transparency standard that will \nremain for generations to come. Importantly, codifying the presumption \nof openness will help reduce the perfunctory withholding of documents \nthrough the overuse of FOIA's exemptions. It requires agencies to \nconsider whether the release of particular documents will cause any \nforeseeable harm to an interest the applicable exemption is meant to \nprotect. If it will not, the documents should be released.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank Senator Leahy for his remarks and for working \ntogether on this important bill. This bill is a good example of the \nbipartisan work the Senate can accomplish when we work together toward \na common goal. I agree with Senator Leahy that the crux of our bill is \nto promote disclosure of government information and not to bolster new \narguments in favor of withholding documents under FOIA's statutory \nexemptions.\n  I want to clarify a key aspect of this legislation. The FOIA \nImprovement Act makes an important change to exemption (b)(5). \nExemption (b)(5) permits agencies to withhold documents covered by \nlitigation privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, attorney \nwork product, and the deliberative process privilege, from disclosure. \nOur bill amends exemption (b)(5) to impose a 25-year sunset for \ndocuments withheld under the deliberative process privilege. This \nshould not be read to raise an inference that the deliberative process \nprivilege is somehow heightened or strengthened as a basis for \nwithholding before the 25-year sunset. This provision of the bill is \nsimply meant to effectuate the release of documents withheld under the \ndeliberative process privilege after 25 years when passage of time \nundoubtedly dulls the rationale for withholding information under this \nexemption.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank Senator Cornyn for his comments, and I agree with \nhis characterization of the intent behind the 25-year sunset and the \ndeliberative process privilege. This new sunset should not form the \nbasis for agencies to argue that the deliberative process privilege \nsomehow has heightened protection before the 25-year sunset takes \neffect. Similarly, the deliberative process privilege sunset is not \nintended to create an inference that the other privileges--including \nattorney-client and attorney work product, just to name a few--are \nsomehow heightened in strength or scope because they lack a statutory \nsunset or that we believe they should not be released after 25 years. \nCourts should not read the absence of a sunset for these other \nprivileges as Congress's intent to strengthen or expand them in any \nway.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank Senator Leahy for that clarification and agree \nwith his remarks. If there is any doubt as to how to interpret the \nprovisions of this bill, they should be interpreted to promote, not \ndetract, from the central purpose of the bill which is to promote the \ndisclosure of government information to the American people.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar No. 17, S. 337.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 337) to improve the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cornyn \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3452) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (S. 337), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Again, let me express my gratitude to my partner in this longstanding \neffort. Since I have been in the Senate, Senator Leahy has worked \ntirelessly, together with me and my office and really the whole Senate, \nto try to advance the public's right to know by reforming and expanding \nour freedom of information laws.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Texas. He has worked tirelessly on this, and I think we both agree \nthat the best government is one where you know what they are doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1496-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1496-S1501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL SEA GRANT COLLEGE PROGRAM AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2015--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on another matter--and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida for not seeking recognition \nimmediately. I ask unanimous consent that as soon as I finish, I can \nyield to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Berta Caceres\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the woman in the photograph next to me is \nBerta Caceres, an indigenous Honduran environmental activist who was \nmurdered in her home on March 3.\n  Ms. Caceres was internationally admired, and in the 12 days since her \ndeath and since my remarks on the morning after and on the day of her \nfuneral on March 5, there has been an outpouring of grief, outrage, \nremembrances, denunciations, and declarations from people in Honduras \nand around the world.\n  Among the appalling facts that few people may have been aware of \nbefore this atrocity is that more than 100 environmental activists have \nreportedly been killed in Honduras just since 2010. It is an \nastonishing number that previously received little attention. One might \nask, therefore, why Ms. Caceres' death has caused such a visceral, \nexplosive reaction.\n  Berta Caceres, the founder and general coordinator of the Civic \nCouncil of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, COPINH, \nwas an extraordinary leader whose courage and commitment, in the face \nof constant threats against her life, inspired countless people. For \nthat she was awarded the prestigious 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize.\n  Her death is a huge loss for her family, her community, and for \nenvironmental justice in Honduras. As her family and organization have \nsaid, it illustrates ``the grave danger that human rights defenders \nface, especially those who defend the rights of indigenous people and \nthe environment against the exploitation of [their] territories.''\n  This is by no means unique to Honduras. It is a global reality. \nIndigenous\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\npeople are the frequent targets of threats, persecution, and \ncriminalization by state and non-state actors in scores of countries.\n  Why is this? Why are the world's most vulnerable people who \ntraditionally live harmoniously with the natural environment so often \nthe victims of such abuse and violence?\n  There are multiple reasons, including racism and other forms of \nprejudice, but I put greed at the top of the list. It is greed that \ndrives governments and private companies, as well as criminal \norganizations, to recklessly pillage natural resources above and below \nthe surface of land inhabited by indigenous people, whether it is \ntimber, oil, coal, gold, diamonds, or other valuable minerals. \nAcquiring and exploiting these resources requires either the \nacquiescence or the forcible removal of the people who live there.\n  In Berta Caceres' case, the threats and violence against her and \nother members of her organization were well documented and widely \nknown, but calls by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for \nprotective measures were largely ignored.\n  This was particularly so because the Honduran Government and the \ncompany that was constructing the hydroelectric project that Ms. \nCaceres and COPINH had long opposed were complicit in condoning and \nencouraging the lawlessness that Ms. Caceres and her community faced \nevery day.\n  The perpetrators of this horrific crime have not been identified. \nSince March 3, there has been a great deal of legitimate concern \nexpressed about the treatment of Gustavo Castro, the Mexican citizen \nwho was wounded and is an eyewitness, and who has ample reason to fear \nfor his life in a country where witnesses to crime are often stalked \nand killed. In the meantime, for reasons as yet unexplained, the \nHonduran Government suspended, for 15 days, Castro's lawyer's license \nto practice.\n  That concern extends to the initial actions of the Honduran police \nwho seemed predisposed to pin the attack on associates of Ms. Caceres. \nThis surprised no one who is familiar with Honduras's ignominious \npolice force.\n  The fact is we do not yet know who is responsible, but a \nprofessional, comprehensive investigation is essential, and the \nHonduran Government has neither the competence nor the reputation for \nintegrity to conduct it themselves.\n  There have been countless demands for such an investigation. Like her \nfamily, I have urged that the investigation be independent, including \nthe participation of international experts. With rare exception, \ncriminal investigations in Honduras are incompetently performed and \nincomplete.\n  They almost never result in anyone being punished for homicide. As \nMs. Caceres's family has requested, the Inter-American Commission is \nwell suited to provide that independence and expertise, but the \nHonduran authorities have not sought that assistance just as they \nrefused the family's request for an independent expert to observe the \nautopsy.\n  The family has also asked that independent forensic experts be used \nto analyze the ballistics and other evidence. The internationally \nrespected Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation, which has \nreceived funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development for \nmany years, would be an obvious option, but the Honduran Government has \nso far rejected this request, too.\n  Like Ms. Caceres's family, I have also urged that the concession \ngranted to the company for the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project be \ncancelled. It has caused far too much controversy, divisiveness, and \nsuffering within the Lenca community and the members of Ms. Caceres's \nfamily and organization. It clearly cannot coexist with the indigenous \npeople of Rio Blanco who see it as a ``permanent danger'' to their \nsafety and way of life. It is no wonder that two of the original \nfunders of the project have abandoned it. The Dutch, Finnish, and \nGerman funders should follow their example.\n  This whole episode exemplifies the irresponsibility of undertaking \nsuch projects without the free, prior, and informed consent of \nindigenous inhabitants who are affected by them. Instead, a common \npractice of extractive industries, energy companies, and governments \nhas been to divide local communities by buying off one faction, calling \nit ``consultation,'' and insisting that it justifies ignoring the \nopposing views of those who refuse to be bought.\n  When a majority of local inhabitants continue to protest against the \nproject as a violation of their longstanding territorial rights, the \ncompany and its government benefactors often respond with threats and \nprovocations, and community leaders are vilified, arrested, and even \nkilled. Then representatives of the company and government officials \nprofess to be shocked and saddened and determined to find the \nperpetrators, and years later, the crime remains unsolved and is all \nbut forgotten.\n  Last year, President Hernandez, Minister of Security Corrales, and \nother top Honduran officials made multiple trips to Washington to lobby \nfor Honduras' share of a U.S. contribution to the Plan of the Alliance \nfor Prosperity of the Northern Triangle of Central America. Among other \nthings, they voiced their commitment to human rights and their respect \nfor civil society, although not surprisingly they had neglected to \nconsult with representatives of Honduran civil society about the \ncontents of the plan.\n  The fiscal year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Act includes $750 million \nto support the plan, of which a significant portion is slated for \nHonduras. I supported those funds. In fact I argued for an amount \nexceeding the levels approved by the House and Senate appropriations \ncommittees because I recognize the immense challenges that widespread \npoverty, corruption, violence, and impunity pose for those countries.\n  Some of these deeply rooted problems are the result of centuries of \nself-inflicted inequality and brutality perpetrated by an elite class \nagainst masses of impoverished people. But the United States also had a \nrole in supporting and profiting from that corruption and injustice, \njust as today the market for illegal drugs in our country fuels the \nsocial disintegration and violence that is causing the people of \nCentral America to flee north.\n  I also had a central role in delineating the conditions attached to \nU.S. funding for the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity, and there is \nstrong, bipartisan support in Congress for those conditions. They are \nfully consistent with what the Northern Triangle leaders pledged to do \nand what the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment agree is necessary if the plan is to succeed.\n  I mention this because the assassination of Berta Caceres brings U.S. \nsupport for the plan sharply into focus. That support is far from a \nguarantee.\n  It is why a credible, thorough investigation is so important.\n  It is why those responsible for her death and the killers of other \nHonduran social activists and journalists must be brought to justice.\n  It is why Agua Zarca and other such projects that do not have the \nsupport of the local population should be abandoned.\n  And it is why the Honduran Government must finally take seriously its \nresponsibility to protect the rights of journalists, human rights \ndefenders, other social activists, COPINH, and civil society \norganizations that peacefully advocate for equitable economic \ndevelopment and access to justice.\n  Only then should we have confidence that the Honduran Government is a \npartner the United States can work with in addressing the needs and \nprotecting the rights of all the people of Honduras and particularly \nthose who have borne the brunt of official neglect and malfeasance for \nso many years.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I would just add to Senator Leahy's \ncomments that a year ago, unfortunately, Honduras was known as the \nmurder capital of the world, with the highest number of per capita \nmurders per 100,000 people. That has improved somewhat. But that \nlittle, poor nation, under its new President, is struggling to overcome \nthe drug lords, the crime bosses who prey on a country that is ravaged \nby poverty. It is such a tempting thing when all kinds of dollars are \nput in front of their noses in order to tempt them to get involved in \nthese crime syndicates that have a distribution network of whatever it \nis--drugs,\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\ntrafficking, human trafficking, other criminal elements--a distribution \nthat goes from south to north on up into the United States.\n  So I join Senator Leahy in his expression of grief and condolences \nfor the lady who was murdered.\n\n\n                   Drilling Off the Atlantic Seaboard\n\n  Madam President, this Senator has conferred with the administration \non its proposal for the drilling off the Atlantic seaboard. At least \nthe administration listened to this Senator and kept the Atlantic area \noff of my State of Florida from proposed drilling leases for this next \n5-year lease period. They did that last year. We are grateful they did \nthat for the reasons for which we have fought for years to keep \ndrilling off of the coast of Florida, not only because of what we \nimmediately anticipate--tourism, the environment--but also our military \ntraining and testing areas.\n  So this Senator made the argument to the Obama administration that if \nyou are coming out there with leases off the Atlantic seaboard, don't \nput it off of Florida. We have military and intelligence rockets coming \nout of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. We have the rockets coming out \nof the Kennedy Space Center for NASA. Obviously, we can't have oil rigs \nout there when we are dropping the first stages of these rockets. And \nthe administration complied.\n  But the administration then went on to offer for lease tracks of the \nAtlantic Ocean from the Georgia line all the way through the Carolinas, \nincluding up to the northern end of Virginia--very interesting. Just \nthis morning the administration has walked back the offering of those \nleases off the eastern seaboard of the United States.\n  Now, it is certainly good news not only for the fact that they never \ndid it in the first place off of Florida, but it is good news for the \nAtlantic coast residents who then fought so hard to keep the drilling \noff their coast. They first released this draft plan in January of \n2015, a year ago, and the Department of the Interior had suggested \nopening up these new areas of the Mid-Atlantic. As we would expect, \ncommunities up and down the Atlantic seaboard voiced their objection, \nand they did it in a bipartisan way. From Atlantic City to Myrtle \nBeach, cities and towns along the coast passed resolutions to make \nclear their opposition to the drilling off their shores. Obviously, \nthey weren't the only ones because--surprise, surprise--just this week \nthe Pentagon weighed in and voiced its concerns, having been just \ncorroborated in the Senate Armed Services Committee when I asked the \nquestion of the Secretary of the Navy about the concerns that drilling \nin the Mid-Atlantic region would impact the military's ability to \nmaintain offshore readiness because of the testing and training areas.\n  The Pentagon had voiced this concern two administrations ago with \nregard to drilling in the gulf off of Florida, which is the largest \ntesting and training area for our U.S. military in the world. So today, \nthere is the Interior Department's decision to remove the Atlantic from \nthe 5-year plan. Well, what about the next 5-year plan? And what about \nthe rigs already operating in other areas off of our coast, such as off \nof Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas in the gulf.\n  We have carried on this fight now for four decades, and today we \nstill have a renewed push to allow drilling off of these sensitive \nareas for the reasons I have mentioned. Some of our own colleagues are \noffering an amendment to a little energy bill that is about energy \nefficiency. It is a nongermane amendment. But what they want to do is \nto sweeten the pot with all of the revenues for offshore drilling that \nwould normally go to the Federal Government instead to go to the \nStates--another incentive to do that drilling by the oil industry. But \nwhat we saw was that the coastal communities--in this case the Mid-\nAtlantic seaboard--rise up and voice objections, regardless of their \npartisan affiliation.\n  We have seen again today that the Pentagon raised its objection, and, \nunfortunately, we have found a Federal safety regulator asleep at the \nswitch. It has been nearly 6 years since we faced one of the greatest \nnatural disasters that our country has ever seen, and that was the gulf \noilspill. Yet, according to the GAO report released just last week, we \nare no better off now than we were before that tragic accident. As a \nreaction to that accident, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion \nthat, I remind my colleagues, killed 11 men and sent up to almost 5 \nmillion barrels--not gallons, barrels--of oil gushing into the gulf, \nthere were a number of questions that were asked: How could this \nhappen? Where were the safety inspectors?\n\n  Well, it soon became clear that the agency in charge--a subdivision \nof the Department of the Interior, the Minerals Management Service--was \nso cozy with the oil and gas industry that the Interior Department's \nown inspector general considered it a conflict of interest. And in \nresponse to the IG's findings, the Interior Department decided to \nreorganize, and it split that agency--the Minerals Management Service--\ninto two, one in charge of leasing and the other in charge of safety.\n  Last Friday, the GAO--what is the GAO? It is the General Accounting \nOffice. It is the independent, nonpartisan research arm of Congress. \nThe GAO released a report that found that the ongoing restructuring--\nthat splitting into--actually ``reverses actions taken to address the \npost-Deepwater Horizon concerns, weakening its oversight.''\n  The report goes on to say that the Interior Department's newly \ncreated agency in charge of safety--one of the two that were split--the \nBureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, suffers--this is the \nreport's words--``a lack of coherent leadership'' and ``inconsistent \nguidance.''\n  So here we are 6 years after the gulf oilspill, and we are weakening \noversight--the very words of the report--6 years later. Obviously, this \nis inexcusable. That is why a number of us have asked the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to hold a hearing on this troubling report \nto get to the bottom of it.\n  Now, at some point, the objections of the vast majority of people who \nlive along the coast and the economies that depend on those \nenvironments and those white sandy beaches and crystal blue water and \nthe military bases that are utilizing the testing and training areas \nover those waters have to be heard. Their concerns have to be \naddressed. We can't continue to keep having a fight every time this \ncomes up every 5 years. There is too much at stake. Yet the fight goes \non. Now there is the new evidence mounted just last Friday and--lo and \nbehold--the results of that new evidence this morning--pulling the plug \non the leasing off the eastern coast of the United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I come to the floor today in support of \nthe biotechnology labeling solutions bill.\n  This legislation will avoid a patchwork of State labeling regulations \nand in so doing will save families thousands of dollars a year to \nprotect American jobs and provide consumers with accurate, transparent \ninformation about their food.\n  First of all, I wish to thank Chairman Pat Roberts for his leadership \non the issue of bioengineered food and for bringing forward his \nchairman's mark. Specifically, the biotechnology labeling solutions \nbill does three things. It immediately ends the problem of having a \npatchwork of inconsistent State GMO labeling programs. Second, it \ncreates a voluntary bioengineered labeling program within 1 year. So \nUSDA would set up a voluntary program within a year, and then within 3 \nyears, it requires the Department of Agriculture to create a mandatory \nbioengineering labeling program if there is insufficient information \navailable on products' bioengineered content.\n  So it makes sure that we don't have a patchwork of 50 State labeling \nlaws. It sets up a voluntary program within 1 year. Then, if the \ninformation isn't out there sufficient for consumers, it makes sure \nthat USDA follows up and ensures that the information is provided and \nthat it is provided in a variety of ways that work for consumers but \nalso work for our farmers and ranchers and for the food industry so \nthat we don't raise costs for our consumers.\n  This bill will ensure that the Vermont GE labeling law, which goes \ninto effect on July 1 of this year, does\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\nnot end up costing American families billions of dollars when they fill \nup their grocery carts. If we don't act soon, food companies will have \none of three options for complying with the Vermont law. No. 1, they \ncan order new packaging for products going to each individual State \nwith a labeling law; No. 2, they could reformulate products so that no \nlabeling is required; or No. 3, they can stop selling to States with \nmandatory labeling laws. Of course, all of these options or any of \nthese options would not only increase the cost of food to consumers but \ncould result in job losses in our ag communities.\n\n  For millions of Americans, the GMO or bioengineered food labeling \nissue will impact the affordability of their food. Testimony provided \nby the USDA, FDA, and the EPA to the Senate Agriculture Committee last \nfall made clear that foods produced with the benefit of biotechnology \nare safe. Nobody is disputing that the food is safe. The real risk is \nif we don't address the Vermont GMO law, real families will have a \ntougher time making ends meet, they will face higher costs, and they \nare going to have more challenges getting the foods they want.\n  In fact, if food companies have to apply Vermont's standards to all \nproducts nationwide, it will result in an estimated increase of over \n$1,050 per year per household. For families having a tough time paying \nbills, this is in essence a regressive tax. It will hurt people of low \nincomes more than it will hurt people with substantial means.\n  From a jobs perspective, the story is also concerning. It has been \ncalculated that if Vermont's law is applied nationwide, it will cost \nover $80 billion a year to switch products over to non-GMO supplies. \nThose billions of dollars a year in additional costs will hurt our ag \nand food industry that creates more than 17 million jobs nationwide. In \nmy home State of North Dakota alone, 94,000 jobs or 38 percent of our \nState's economy rely on the ag and food industry.\n  This is a bad time to make it more expensive to do business in the ag \nsector. Recently, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity testified that net farm income in 2015 is more than 50 percent \nless than it was in 2013, and it is expected to go down again in 2016. \nSo this is an issue that affects our family farms directly across the \ncountry.\n  If Vermont's law goes forward, many farmers who rely on biotech crops \nto increase productivity will be deprived of that critical tool. This \nSenator knows how hard our farmers work and how much they put on the \nline every year when they have to take out an operating loan for crops \nthat may or may not materialize. We shouldn't ask them to feed the \nNation with one hand tied behind their backs by taking away \nbiotechnology.\n  More than just overcoming the problems associated with having a \npatchwork of State regulations, I think it is important for Americans \nto know this legislation ensures that consumers have consistent, \naccurate information about the bioengineered content of their food. The \nbiotechnology labeling solutions bill creates greater transparency for \nconsumers by putting in place, within 1 year, a new voluntary \nbioengineered food labeling program to ensure products labeled as \nhaving been produced with biotechnology meet a uniform national \nstandard.\n  As I mentioned, food produced with the aid of bioengineering are, \naccording to the FDA, EPA, and USDA, safe. However, many consumers want \nto know if the food they are buying is produced using biotechnology, \nwhich is why this legislation's national voluntary bioengineering \nstandard makes so much sense. The voluntary program in this legislation \nwill ensure that a consumer who buys a food product with a \nbioengineering smart label in North Dakota is purchasing a product that \nis held at the same disclosure standards as food sold in New York, \nCalifornia, or North Carolina.\n  This voluntary program will let the marketplace respond to consumer \ndemand for information. You can look at the USDA organic food program, \na voluntary label many consumers look for in our grocery stores. Yet \nthis bill goes further to create a mandatory bioengineered food \ndisclosure program if the Secretary of Agriculture finds that there is \ninsufficient consumer access to information about bioengineered foods.\n  We need a solution, and this bill helps keep our Nation's food \naffordable, it supports jobs, and it provides consumers consistent \ninformation about bioengineered foods. I urge my colleagues to work \ntogether to support this bipartisan measure.\n\n\n                        National Agriculture Day\n\n  Madam President, I would like to take just a minute to acknowledge, \nrecognize, and thank our Nation's farmers on National Agriculture Day.\n  Today on National Agriculture Day, I want to celebrate and thank \nAmerica's ag producers. That includes those in my home State of North \nDakota who provide us with the lowest cost, highest quality food supply \nnot just in the world but in the history of the world. America's \ngrocery stores abound with fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. Our \ndinner tables are able to offer our families a greater variety of \nnutritious, flavorful foods than ever before. They are a testament to \nthe hard work, commitment, and innovation of our Nation's agricultural \nproducers. Agriculture and ag-related industries is also an important \npart of the American economy, contributing $835 billion to our Gross \nDomestic Problem in 2014.\n  Further, our America's food and ag sector provides jobs for 16 \nmillion people and contributes billions of dollars to the national \neconomy. Agriculture also has a positive balance of trade and produces \na financial surplus for our country.\n  I especially want to thank the men and women of North Dakota who farm \nand ranch. They made agriculture North Dakota's largest industry with \nnearly $11 billion in sales last year. I am proud to say North Dakota \nleads the Nation in the production of 9 important commodities and is \nfirst or second in 15. This includes half of all the duram and spring \nwheat, more than 90 percent of the Nation's flax, and more than 85 \npercent of the Nation's canola.\n  America's farmers and ranchers work through drought and floods, crop \ndisease, hail, and other challenges year in and year out. Yet they \nstill get up every morning, put on their boots, and go out in the field \nand pastures for our country. Our farmers and ranchers built America, \nand today they sustain it. On National Agriculture Day, we acknowledge \nthe enormous debt of gratitude we owe them.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for his comments, \nand I would like to be associated with all of them, in fact, \nparticularly recognizing our farmers in North Carolina. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota and I have had discussions about the friendly \ncompetition among the agriculture States and the hard work they are \ndoing to feed America and the world, but today I rise to express my \nsupport for Chairman Roberts' bill for the biotechnology labeling \nlegislation.\n  I am supporting Chairman Roberts' effort because it addresses a real \nproblem. The problem is that a small portion of the food industry is \ntrying to impose their policy preferences onto the entire food supply \nchain in the United States. We are where we are because the Vermont law \nis not written in a way that merely impacts the citizens of Vermont. It \nis astonishing to hear the misleading claim that the Vermont law is \nabout the right to know. If the Vermont law is about the right to know, \nwhy is it that the law exempts so many products?\n  Here are some examples of the absurdity of the Vermont law. Vegetable \ncheese lasagna would be labeled, but meat lasagna wouldn't. Soy milk \nwould need to be labeled, but cow's milk would not. Frozen pizza would \nneed to be labeled, but delivered pizza would not. Chocolate syrup \nwould need to be labeled, but maple syrup would not. Vegetable soup \nwould need to be labeled, but vegetable beef soup would not. Food at a \nrestaurant would be totally exempt, but not food at a grocery store. \nVegetarian chili would need to be labeled, but meat chili would not. \nVeggie burgers made with soy would need to be labeled, but \ncheeseburgers would not.\n  By my way of thinking, it is a patchwork that doesn't make sense if \nyou are trying to come up with a consistent way to communicate to \nconsumers what is in the food they are eating. The\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nVermont law is a classic case of the government picking winners and \nlosers and putting the burden of those decisions on the backs of hard-\nworking Americans.\n  I had this slide up to begin with, but this is something we have to \ncontinue to be focused on. If you were to take the Vermont law and have \na couple dozen States create their own variance and have all the \ncomplexity added, it is estimated the added cost of compliance would \nresult in a cost of some 1,000 additional dollars per household. In \nthis economy, how many families can afford another $1,000 a year for \nfood?\n  I am surprised that number is not higher. It most likely will be and \nhere is why: Manufacturers are subject to a $1,000 fine if one of their \nproducts is mistakenly or inadvertently found for sale in Vermont on a \nstore shelf. The food industry will have over 100,000 items in the \nState of Vermont--a State that has roughly 625,000 residents. If only 5 \npercent to 10 percent of those products are even unintentionally \nmislabeled, that means fines of as much as $10 million per day, in \naddition to the millions per year companies will have to pay to \nactually change their supply chains to comply with the law to serve a \npopulation of 625,000.\n  We are often told in this Chamber we need to be more cognizant of the \nscience. Those who are irresponsibly scaring the American people to \ndefend the Vermont mandatory labeling law need to understand the \nscience is against them. Late last year, the FDA rejected a petition \ncalling for mandatory labeling of foods from genetically engineered \nproducts stating that ``the simple fact that a plant is produced by one \nmethod over another does not necessarily mean that there will be a \ndifference in the safety or other characteristics of the resulting \nfoods. . . . To date, we have completed over 155 consultations for GE \nplant varieties. The numbers of consultations completed, coupled with \nthe rigor of the evaluations, demonstrate that foods from GE plants can \nbe as safe as comparable foods produced using conventional plant \nbreeding.''\n  During a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing last week, USDA \nSecretary Vilsack responded to questions regarding GMOs by emphasizing \nthat the mandatory labeling efforts are not about food safety, \nnutritional benefits, or sound science. Two weeks ago, the Secretary \nwas quoted at a conference referring to genetically modified products \nsaying, ``I am here to unequivocally say they are safe to consumers.''\n  Chairman Roberts' language does exactly what Congress should be doing \nwith regard to marketing standards; that is, setting rules of \nengagement that are consistent, balanced, and fair for all players in \nthe industry by providing consistent information to consumers about the \ncontent of their food. With the chairman's bill, the marketplace has an \nopportunity to find the best approaches to getting consumers the \ninformation they want without imposing new regulations that add costs \nto our food supply, complexity, and no more real information or \nclarity.\n  If we as a nation are going to have a discussion on the necessity of \nlabeling biotechnology products, fine, but the Vermont law is not the \ncatalyst for that debate, and that conversation should be with the \nAmerican people, not one State with roughly 625,000 people dictating to \nthe market of more than 317 million people.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize that we should do everything \nwe can to inform consumers about the content of their food. There is a \nright way to do it and there is a wrong way to do it. There is a more \ncostly way to do it as proposed by the Vermont law or there is a more \nstraightforward, effective, and consistent way, and that is what \nChairman Roberts is trying to accomplish with this bill. I encourage \neveryone to support it.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Presidential \nnominations. I think most people in this body know I am probably one of \nthe least partisan people--looking at the issues, working across the \naisle, always reaching out to my friends and colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. I don't look at the barrier a lot of people look at \nhere.\n  I know we are able to debate and we are able to advise and consent on \nnominations because we just did it. I have a tremendous problem in my \nState, and I think in all of our States--Colorado and all across the \ncountry--with opioid addiction and drug abuse. With that being said, I \ntruly believe that for us to fight this war, we have to have a cultural \nchange within the FDA. The President of the United States nominated Dr. \nRobert Califf, a very good man, but a person who came from within the \nindustry and who I did not think would bring a cultural change. Still, \nhe was the recommendation of the President.\n  The majority leader from Kentucky basically brought that to the floor \nfor a vote. I thought it was the wrong person, even though this was a \nnomination from a President of my party, and me being a Democrat. So I \nthink it is a misnomer for us to believe we are going to hold hard to \nparty lines.\n  I have said that I didn't think Dr. Califf would bring the cultural \nchange. I hope he proves me wrong. I am willing to work with him on \nthat, and I will fight to make sure we rid this country of the scourge \nof legal prescription drug abuse that is ruining families and \ndestroying lives. I think we have proved the President can bring people \nup, which is his responsibility, and we can look at that person and \nagree. In this case, I had only four votes on my side. The majority of \nall the Republicans but one--yes, all the Republicans but one--voted \nfor him. I still think it was wrong, but we are going to make the best \nof it that we can.\n  The bottom line is we did our job. We truly did our job, and I can \nlive with that decision. I look at the Constitution, and it is very \nclear. It says the President ``shall.'' It doesn't say ``may.'' Being \nin the legislature--and the Presiding Officer has been in the \nlegislature as well--the words ``shall'' and ``may'' are worlds apart. \nIt says ``shall,'' and we know he will nominate.\n  Why are we not willing to go through this process? I am as likely to \nfind someone he might recommend who I will not vote for as maybe the \nChair and maybe our other colleagues. I saw what happened when I first \ngot here. We got condemned for not voting at all. We weren't getting \nany votes because there was protection going on. Basically, for whoever \nis up in the cycle, tough votes make it very difficult for people to \nget reelected. We proved that to be wrong because basically we saw a \nbig switch in the Senate from the majority to the minority and the \nminority to the majority.\n  I have said very strongly that no vote is worse than a tough vote. A \nno vote in this body is worse than a tough vote. If you are saying that \nyou would rather not vote at all because it might cause a problem back \nhome, I think we have more problems if we don't do our job. That is why \nI can't figure this out.\n  If the President brings a person up, there is going to be 2 or 3 \nmonths, and if we can't find someone we can agree on--60 of us--that \nmeans it will take at least 14 Republicans to find someone they can \nagree on and they think is good for the country and move forward. If \nnot, then it will run right into the next administration, whoever that \nmay be. But basically we would be doing our job.\n  I just have a hard time on this one. I am going to evaluate that \nnominee based on their legal qualifications and judicial philosophy. I \nam going to look and basically see what type of jurist they have been, \nwhat types of decisions they have made, what types of social media they \nhave been on, and what they have talked about. I will look at all of \nthat, which is what we should be doing, to find out as much about that \nperson as I can and to see how they will govern and rule in the future. \nHopefully we will find someone who will look at the issues, look at the \nrule of law, and look at who we are as a country. I think we all can do \nthat. I know very well the Chair can. I know very well every one of our \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\non both sides of the aisle is able to do that.\n  I don't believe the President can count on all Democrats, just \nbecause he is a Democrat, falling in line. If that were the case, we \nwouldn't have had Senator Markey of Massachusetts, Dick Blumenthal, and \nI voting against Robert Califf, who was the President's nominee.\n  So we are going to have to find that right person. But if we never \nget the chance to evaluate the person, I don't know how we can do that. \nAgain, it truly gets down to the fact that this is the job we are \nsupposed to do. We talk about orderly business. We are getting things \ndone. I have heard people say: Oh, yes, we are getting things done now \nthat the Republicans are in the majority. The Chair has been here long \nenough to understand that the majority might set the agenda, but it is \nthe minority that drives the train as to whether we get on something or \nnot. So we have to work together.\n  We have proved the old game plan didn't work. The new game plan is \nfine. Let's have an open amendment process, let's go through it and \ndebate it, and then let it go up or down on its merits. That is what we \nare asking for on this. Let it go to committee. When the nomination \ncomes, let it go to the committee and look at the nomination. I mean \ndissect it in every way, shape, or form, whoever that person may be--he \nor she. I am willing to live with whatever the committee comes out \nwith, and I am going to do my own research. When it comes to the floor, \nthere is no guarantee that I am going to vote for that person--\nabsolutely not. And I have already proved that. All of us have proved \nthat we haven't just blindly followed party lines, nor should we. We \naren't expected to. Our constituents don't expect us to do that. They \ndo not want us to do it, that is for sure.\n\n  Again, the Constitution states that the President ``shall nominate, \nand by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint. . \n. . '' He can appoint only if we have the advice and consent of the \nSenate. There is no other way this President or any other President can \nmake that decision. We make the final decision.\n  Again, we are to the point now where the rhetoric is back and forth \nand it gets a little harsher and everybody gets ingrained, entrenched: \nBy golly, we are not going to take anybody up; we don't care who that \nperson will be. And I just hate to see that. We are all friends. We all \nknow each other, and we all truly, I believe, are here for the right \nreasons and want to do the best job we can. But we are still expected \nto do our job.\n  At the end of the day, did you do your job? Yes, we looked; the \nPresident gave us somebody; we didn't think that person was qualified; \nwe didn't think they were centrist enough; they didn't have the \nbackground or a record that we could extract what we felt their \nperformance would be in the future; and for those reasons, we voted \nagainst that person. Or the President gave us somebody who basically we \nfound did not have political ties to either side, who basically ruled \non the law--the best interpretation of the law--and with the \nConstitution always at the forefront. That is the person he gave us, \nand that is the person we would support. But if we never get a chance \nto look at whoever is given to us, there is no way we can move forward.\n  When I was Governor of my great State of West Virginia, I had to do \nthe job 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every minute of every day, every \nday of every week, every week of every month, every month of every \nyear. It was expected. That was my job, and I tried to do the best I \ncould. There were some times when I had to make some tough decisions. \nThere were times I drew people together and times when there was so \nmuch division that we had to basically let it cool off and then move \nforward. But we always kept trying to do a better job for the people of \nWest Virginia.\n  I think the American people expect us to do a better job. I really \ndo. I don't care who gets credit for it--Republicans, Democrats. \nBasically, it should be all of us because the way this body works, it \ntakes 60 votes to get on something, if we want to make that the \ncriteria.\n  With that being said, I can assure you there will not be a person the \nPresident of the United States gives us--whether it is this President \nor the next administration and the next President--who will be the \nperfect jurist. We are not going to find that perfect jurist. We are \nnot going to find someone slanted too far to the left or too far to the \nright so that we can't get 60 votes. We are going to have to find \nsomebody who has shown some common sense and has some civility about \nthem, basically using the Constitution as the basis and framework for \nthe decisions they made as a jurist, and show that is how they are \ngoing to govern in the highest Court in the land and be a model for the \nrest of the world, reflecting that we are still a government of rules. \nWe are a body where the rule of law means everything. It is hard for us \nto do that if we can't find someone who we feel is qualified to do the \njob.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues--all of my colleagues in \nthis great body and all of my dear Republican friends--to look and \nthink about this. If the right person is not there, don't vote for \nthem. As a matter of fact, I would probably vote against them too. I \nhave before. I think I am the most centrist Member of this body, and I \nam going to vote for what I think is good for my country and for the \nState of West Virginia. I think the people of West Virginia expect me \nto do that, and they expect me to do my job too.\n  With that, I hope we have another opportunity to think this over. The \nPresident probably will be giving us somebody in very short order. I \nwould hope we are able to move to where the Judiciary Committee is able \nto look at that person, give us their findings on that person, and \neither tell us why we should not advise the President we are going to \nconsent or find a person we can all agree upon and move forward.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the 75th anniversary of the \nNevada Parent Teacher Association. The Nevada PTA will formally \ncelebrate 75 years of advocacy and work for and on behalf of the \nchildren of Nevada, at various events in the State during the last week \nof April.\n  Since 1941, the Nevada PTA has been part of the Nation's largest \nvolunteer child advocacy association. The organization promotes \neducation, health, safety, and the arts to the children of Nevada and \nhas been instrumental in fostering the growth of countless students. \nThe Nevada PTA takes pride in ensuring that schools are a central part \nof the communities in which they reside. The organization has led \nefforts to curb childhood obesity, foster connections between children \nand the important men in their lives, and promote volunteering in \ninnovative ways.\n  Since its inception, they have also been a strong supporter of art \nprograms that allow children to grow as students and people. Working \nwith the national association, the Nevada PTA has participated in art \nprograms that allow children to create original works of art in \ncategories such as photography, film, and music composition. These \nprograms not only encourage students to be creative, but also allow \nconnections with fellow classmates that share common interests.\n  Nevada PTA exemplifies the broader objective of the National PTA, \nadvocacy for all children. Multiple schools in Nevada have been \nrecognized by the National PTA for the School of Excellence Awards \nwhich are granted to institutions that promote diversity, demonstrate \nclarity in academic standards,\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nand establish meaningful connections with their local parent teacher \nassociation.\n  I applaud President David Flatt and his team for his strong \nleadership in one of the most important organizations for children in \nthe State of Nevada. I am pleased that, through yours and other's \nselfless efforts, incalculable numbers of students, teachers, and \nparents have been positively affected by the Nevada PTA. This \norganization is an invaluable part of communities throughout the State, \nand I would like to extend my best wishes for continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1502-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, today I congratulate Casey Family \nPrograms for 50 years of public service to help vulnerable children and \nfamilies in the child welfare system. Founded in 1966 by Jim Casey, the \nfounder of United Parcel Service, UPS, this private operating \nfoundation has been working quietly and effectively on behalf of our \nmost vulnerable children and families.\n  At the beginning, Casey Family Programs started with a specific focus \non providing quality foster care. After gaining considerable experience \nin providing direct services, Casey Family Programs recognized that it \ncould help more families and children by working to support long-\nlasting improvements across entire child welfare systems. Today the \nfoundation provides strategic consultation, technical assistance, data \nanalysis, and independent research and evaluation at no cost to all 50 \nstates. It also serves county and tribal child welfare jurisdictions \nacross the Nation, including my State of Colorado.\n  Casey Family Programs seeks a unique partnership with the States by \nasking what jurisdictions hope to achieve as it relates to the \nfoundation's mission.\n  In my State of Colorado, this means helping State leaders implement \nColorado's Federal waiver program. It means developing initiatives to \nreduce reliance on congregate care, if other options may be more \nappropriate for the child and family. It means working with our Denver \ncourts with a judicial engagement team to enhance collaboration among \nthe courts, agencies, and families. Casey Family Programs also has a \nspecific team based in Denver dedicated to Indian Child Welfare.\n  At the Federal level, Casey Family Programs offers its experience, \nresearch, and data to help policymakers understand and address the \ncomplicated issues of child welfare and foster care. Over the years I \nhave been proud to work with Casey Family Programs, and I appreciate \ntheir dedication and commitment to the original vision of their \nfounder, Jim Casey.\n  I believe we all share this vision of helping children find a safe \nand stable home, but achieving it is more challenging than it seems. I \ncongratulate Casey Family Programs on 50 years of public service, and I \nlook forward to continue working with the foundation in Colorado and in \nCongress for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1502-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1502-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1502-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:59 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2426.

A bill to make college more affordable, reduce student debt, \nand provide greater access to higher education for all students of the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis of the utmost importance to me, Marylanders, and American families--\ncollege affordability.\n  I have said this often, but we in this country enjoy many freedoms: \nthe freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, and the freedom of \nreligion. But there is an implicit freedom our Constitution does not \nlay out in writing, but its promise has excited the passions, hopes, \nand dreams of people in this country since its founding. It is the \nfreedom to take whatever talents God has given you, to fill whatever \npassion is in your heart, to learn so you can earn and make a \ncontribution to society--the freedom to achieve.\n  The freedom to achieve should never be stifled in this country \nbecause of economic reasons. Your freedom to achieve should never be \ndetermined by the zip code you live in, by the color of your skin, or \nby the size of your family's wallet. It should be, in a democratic \ncountry, that everyone has access to be able to do that. That means \naffordable education. That means access to the opportunity ladder that \nstudents and families can count on, because we know a degree is \nsomething that no one can ever take away from you.\n  When I was a young girl at a Catholic all-girls school, my Mom and \nDad made it very clear that they wanted me to go to college. But, right \naround graduation, my family was going through a rough time because my \nfather's grocery store had suffered a terrible fire. I offered to put \noff college and work at the grocery store until the business got back \non its feet. My Dad said, ``Barb, you have to go. Your mother and I \nwill find a way, because no matter what happens to you, no one can ever \ntake that degree away from you. The best way I can protect you is to \nmake sure you can earn a living all of your life.'' My father gave me \nthe freedom to achieve.\n  When it comes to higher education, I believe in choice and \nopportunity. Anyone willing to work hard has a right to learn so you \ncan get a college degree or certificate. Millions of American students \nare graduating colleges and universities, but as they are handed their \ndiplomas, they are being handed a lifetime of debt.\n  More than 58 percent of Maryland college students have taken on an \naverage debt of $27,000 or more. Having this debt is like a first \nmortgage, making it hard to buy a home, start a business, or a family. \nI am worried about them, as should the rest of us, and what it means \nfor their future. College is a part of the American dream; it should \nnot be a part of the American financial nightmare.\n  That is why, over the last several months, I embarked on a college \naffordability tour across the state of Maryland. I wanted to find out \nwhat were some of the challenges students faced when it came to \ncollege. I wanted to know how the Federal Government can help them be \nsuccessful. The stories I heard were poignant, and were likely ones \nthat everyone in this chamber has heard time and time again.\n  I met a bright young woman last year. She had the financial support \nof her parents to attend college. Unfortunately, during her sophomore \nyear, her mother--who was a nurse--lost her job. To make sure she could \nstill go to college, her family made the decision to dip into their \nretirement savings to help pay. This goes to show that her family knew \nhow important it was that she continue her education. Even with this \nadditional financial support, she still had to rely on Federal \nfinancial aid to pay for books.\n  Or the young man who is the first in his family to go to college. He \nhopes he is not the last. He would not be where he is today had it not \nbeen for a strong support system in high school through participation \nin a college bound program that gave him the opportunity to be exposed \nto college classes. While he came to college academically prepared, he \nstill needed help navigating our complex Federal financial aid system.\n  This is just a small sample of the stories I heard. But they all say \nthe same thing: ``We need help.'' Many students and families are \nstressed and stretched, having to work and save to pay for college. \nThey want to know what Congress is doing for them. They need a Federal \nGovernment that is on their side.\n  Student loan debt is more than $1.3 trillion, exceeding total credit \ncard and car loan debt, and eclipsed only by mortgage debt. Family \nincomes are not keeping pace with inflation, which means they are less \nable to help with the costs of higher education.\n  Getting a college education is the core of the American dream. Let us \ncontinue to fight to make sure that every student in America, whether \nyou are in rural Eastern Shore or in big cities like Los Angeles, has \naccess to that dream. Let us work together to make sure that when \nstudents graduate, their first mortgage is not their student debt. \nCarrying the burden of student loans drags down young people's \nfinancial future, making it harder to buy a home, start a family, or \nsave for retirement.\n  It is my belief that this bill--the In The Red Act--will make college \na reality for millions of Americans. I am pleased to see that \nprovisions in this bill would allow eligible student borrowers the \nopportunity to refinance their Federal loans. I believe that if\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\nyou can refinance a yacht, you should be able to refinance your student \nloans. This will help more than 24 million students in the United \nStates, including more than 800,000 student borrowers in Maryland.\n  I am also pleased to see that this bill increases Pell Grants to keep \npace with rising costs. This will ensure that college students, who \nrely on Pell Grants, can pay for tuition, books, room and board, and \nother living expenses like child care.\n  The In The Red Act is absolutely a great bill for students, and it is \na great bill for America. It gives our students access to the American \ndream. It gives our young people access to the freedom to achieve, to \nbe able to follow their talents, and to be able to achieve higher \neducation in whatever field they will be able to serve this country. It \nis my hope that we come together to pass this bill in a swift, \nexpeditious, and uncluttered way.\n  While our work is not done when it comes to ensuring access to \naffordable higher education, this bill helps us get there. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nmove this issue forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 2685. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nmental and behavioral health services on campuses of institutions of \nhigher education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health on Campus \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2014 Association of University and College \n     Counseling Center Directors Survey found that the average \n     ratio of counselors to students on campus is nearly 1 to \n     1,833 and is often far higher on large campuses. The \n     International Association of Counseling Services \n     accreditation standards recommends 1 counselor per 1,000 to \n     1,500 students.\n       (2) College counselors report that 10 percent of enrolled \n     students sought counseling in 2014.\n       (3) More than 90 percent of counseling directors believe \n     there is an increase in the number of students coming to \n     campus with severe psychological problems; today, 44 percent \n     of the students who visit campus counseling centers are \n     dealing with severe mental illness, up from 16 percent in \n     2000, and 24 percent are on psychiatric medication, up from \n     17 percent in 2000.\n       (4) The majority of campus counseling directors report that \n     the demand for services and the severity of student needs are \n     growing without an increase in resources.\n       (5) Many students who need help never receive it. Only 15 \n     percent of college and university students who commit suicide \n     received campus counseling. Of students who seriously \n     consider suicide each year, only 52 percent of them seek any \n     professional help at all.\n       (6) A 2015 American College Health Association survey of \n     more than 93,000 college and university students revealed \n     that, within the last 12 months, 57 percent of students \n     report having felt overwhelming anxiety, 35 percent felt so \n     depressed it was difficult to function, and 48 percent felt \n     hopeless. However, only 12 percent of students reported \n     receiving professional treatment for anxiety within the past \n     12 months, and 11 percent reported receiving treatment for \n     depression within the past 12 months.\n       (7) The 2015 American College Health Association survey \n     also found that 9 percent of students have seriously \n     considered suicide in the past 12 months, a 20 percent \n     increase compared to 2012.\n       (8) Research conducted between 1997 and 2009, and presented \n     at the 118th annual convention of the American Psychological \n     Association found that more students are grappling with \n     depression and anxiety disorders than were a decade ago. The \n     study found that of students who sought college or university \n     counseling, 41 percent had moderate to severe depression in \n     2009, that number was 34 percent in 1997.\n       (9) A survey conducted by the student counseling center at \n     the University of Idaho in 2000 found that 77 percent of \n     students who responded reported that they were more likely to \n     stay in school because of counseling and that their school \n     performance would have declined without counseling.\n       (10) Students with psychological issues often struggle \n     academically and are at risk for dropping out of school. \n     Counseling has been shown to address these issues while \n     having a positive impact on students remaining in school. A \n     6-year longitudinal study found college and university \n     students receiving counseling to have a 11.4 percent higher \n     retention rate than the general college and university \n     population.\n       (11) A national survey of college and university students \n     living with mental health conditions, conducted by the \n     National Alliance on Mental Illness, found that 64 percent of \n     students who experience mental health problems in college or \n     university and withdraw from school do so because of their \n     mental health issues. The survey also found that 50 percent \n     of that group never accessed mental health services and \n     supports.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, an important consumer right is under \nattack, under siege today in the United States Senate. It is the right \nto know what is in your food. A lot of consumers take for granted that \nthey will read the ingredients on a package and they will know what is \nin their food. The right to know what you are putting in your body is a \nbasic right, especially what your children are putting in their bodies.\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\n  I understand that the Agriculture Committee has reported--and the \nmajority leader has indicated that he will bring to the floor--a \nmisguided anti-consumer measure that will not only dilute but decimate \nan essential aspect of that right to know. It is not the name of the \nbill its proponents are using, but I agree with Members of the House \nand this body who have called this bill the DARK Act. Why? Because it \ndenies Americans the right to know. Unfortunately, that is essentially \nwhat the bill does. It denies Americans the right to know.\n  I hold a pretty simple belief that labels on the food we buy should \naccurately reflect what is in the food. Whether it is the nutritional \ncontent, the ingredients--whether something is organic or not--\nconsumers should know what they are paying for and what they are \nputting in their bodies. That is how we keep the large corporations \nthat make most of our food from using ingredients that are \nunhealthful--unhealthful and, essentially, potentially deceptive.\n  Like the overwhelming majority of people in this country--and by the \nway, a poll released in December said it was about 90 percent--I \nsupport mandatory on-package labeling of food containing genetically \nmodified organisms, GMOs. This support cuts across geographic lines and \nparty lines because it is such a commonsense position. Leave it up to \nconsumers--you and me--to decide when we buy food products and when we \nconsume them. If they want to buy a particular product, let them do so, \nbut make sure they know what they are getting. This issue is of \nparticular importance to my constituents.\n  I am proud that Connecticut was the first State to enact legislation \nthat would require mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods. \nAnd as attorney general of Connecticut, I championed this measure, and \nit is a consummate example of consumer protection and consumer \neducation.\n  The DARK Act, by contrast, would strip my State of its ability to \nprotect our own people. It would prevent States, including Connecticut, \nMaine, and Vermont, which have already done so, from enacting laws \nrequiring the labeling of GMO foods. It would take away from States \ntheir right to pass laws to ensure their citizens have access to basic \ninformation about their food, and it would preempt longstanding State \nconsumer protection laws in all 50 States. These laws pertain to false \nadvertising, consumer protection, fraud, breach of warranty, or unfair \ntrade practices.\n  This measure is a sweeping and draconian proposal, and that would be \nbad enough, but the DARK Act actually goes further. It would also bar \nStates and local communities from enacting any kind of law overseeing \ngenetically modified crops. Several counties in California and Oregon, \nas well as the States of Washington and Hawaii, have restricted \nplanting of GMO crops, citing the health effects of the seeds and \neconomic effects of megacompanies that produce these seeds on local \nfarmers and the unknown long-term environmental consequences. But this \nbill would stop all of those efforts, State and local efforts. It would \nstop them dead in their tracks.\n  In addition to keeping information from consumers, the DARK Act would \naffect hard-working farmers who will have no way of knowing if the seed \nthey purchased is genetically engineered, and that is true even if the \nseeds are altered in any way that prevents crops from reproducing, \nforcing farmers to buy new seeds every season from the GMO company.\n  I don't mean to cast aspersions on the biotechnology industry. There \nis enormous potential in research on this front, and scientists have \nmade many, many contributions to our food supply. There may be \nscientific efforts under way in this area that have healthful and \neconomically beneficial results, but keeping consumers in the dark is \nharmful, and the rule ought to be first do no harm.\n  If there is scientific support for the health or environmental \nbenefits, why not let consumers know? Let consumers make knowledgeable \nand informed choices. Consumers are capable of those kinds of choices, \nand I am shocked that this deliberative body is considering a measure \nthat is crafted so purposefully and intentionally to, in effect, \ndeceive the American public and actively deny them the accurate \ninformation they deserve.\n  There is no question that this bill is nothing more than a carve-out \nfor big businesses and mega-GMO seed corporations. My view is that this \nbody ought to facilitate transparency. The Federal legislation should \npromote information and education, not inhibit or prevent it. That is \nwhy I have endorsed a bill that Senator Merkley and others of us are \nproposing and advocating that in a very commonsense way allows \nmanufacturers to choose from a menu of options to indicate to consumers \nwhether a product includes genetically engineered ingredients.\n  I want to make clear and emphasize we are not calling for some kind \nof skull and crossbones logo or black box warning label. In fact, we \nare not talking about a warning; we are talking about information. The \noptions on the menu that would be offered to food producers are \nnonjudgmental, clear, concise, and accurate. This information is \nimpartial and objective, allowing consumers to make informed decisions.\n  Last month, the Secretary of Agriculture convened a series of \nmeetings in an attempt to broker a compromise between industry and \nlabeling advocates, and I want to take a moment to commend the \nunflagging leadership of a number of groups in my State and one of my \nconstituents, Tara Cook-Littman, who by coincidence was the only woman \nat these meetings. She is the cofounder of Citizens for GMO Labeling. \nShe led the grassroots effort in Connecticut to pass the first-in-the-\nNation GMO labeling law. She is also the mother of three children whom \nI have met. Like most Americans, she cares deeply about what she and \nher family are eating.\n\n  As part of their innovation cycle, food companies often redesign and \nrelaunch products, adding new attributes to existing products, such as \nflavors and new ingredients, so they can handle the normal course of \nrelabeling and repackaging.\n  One of the most important points Tara has raised is that the \nindustry's proposed solution to include QR codes on GMO products is \nreally no solution at all. QR codes, which let customers use a \nsmartphone to scan a product to be linked to a Web page with \ninformation, are no substitute for clear, explicit labels that all \nconsumers can see with the transparency and objectivity they deserve \nand need. Relying on QR codes discriminates against people who are \nunable to afford a smartphone or a data plan. It threatens privacy by \nallowing industry to keep track of who is scanning what product--\ninformation that many of us might not want to be in the hands of \ncompanies and used to market to us--and, from a very practical \nstandpoint, may not be usable where reception is weak or nonexistent.\n  As anyone who has ever shopped with a baby or a child knows, shopping \nis hard enough under some circumstances, and forcing consumers to try \nto get the right scan of a product when information could simply appear \non the label is absurd. What is the reason for the QR code other than \nto make it more difficult for a consumer to know? What rationale could \nthere be other than creating a hurdle for that consumer to learn that \ninformation?\n  So I urge my colleagues, do not be fooled or tricked by the DARK Act \nclaims that food prices will rise with GMO labeling--not so. Food \nprocessors regularly make changes to these labels to meet changing \nconsumer demands or for other marketing or regulatory reasons. In fact, \nBen & Jerry's cofounder, Jerry Greenfield, confirmed: ``It's a normal \ncourse of business to be going through changes on your labels.'' And \nother responsible food companies have joined Ben & Jerry's, most \nprominently Campbell's Soup. I commend their leadership. My \nconstituents and all consumers should be aware that there are companies \nlike Campbell's that have stepped forward and want consumers to be more \ninformed, not less.\n  We are on the brink of potentially passing legislation as early as \ntomorrow morning that would ban States such as Connecticut from \nrequiring GMO labeling. That is a violation of the very essence of \nStates' rights to protect their citizens. It may well be that some \nStates would want to be stronger in protecting their citizens than \nothers, and they should have the\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\nright to do so. Preempting all State legislation in this area infringes \non that fundamental sovereignty and right of States to protect their \ncitizens.\n  As the American Association for Justice has stated, this legislation \nwill unjustly preempt State consumer protection laws. I know the \nimportance of that preemption doctrine as a former attorney general who \nhas fought consistently to allow States to set standards for consumer \nprotection and enforce those standards, both Federal and State.\n  I commend those manufacturers that have realized that now is the time \nto embrace GMO labeling, including Campbell's, Ben & Jerry's, Amy's \nKitchen, and Nature's Path. I hope we can work together with food \nmanufacturers to give American consumers, like consumers in 63 \ncountries around the world--63 countries around the world--a more \ntransparent food system by approving a mandatory on-packaging GMO \nlabeling system and rejecting this anti-consumer effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/15/senate-section/article/S1513-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:15 A.M.
