Mr. President, I join in my feelings about the Joe Biden \nfamily. I was saddened beyond words to hear of the passing of Beau. He \nwas such a fine young man. He was a devoted husband, father, son, a \ndedicated servant to the people of Delaware, and a faithful, honorable \nveteran of the United States, having served in the Middle East in Iraq.\n  I, of course, extend all of the sympathy I am capable of extending to \nhis family during this very difficult time. Beau left us far too soon. \nHe was only 46 years old, but I am certain his family will take solace \nin knowing he lived a selfless, noble life.\n  To my friend Joe Biden, whom I served with in Congress for so many \nyears, I extend my deepest thoughts and condolences to you, Joe.\n  There is a song ``Man of Constant Sorrow'' that certainly, if that \never applied to someone, it would be our friend Joe Biden. Not having \nbeen sworn in to the Senate, he experienced the tragic loss of his wife \nand little girl. Then, as to his two sons, Beau and Hunter, he spent \ntime on a train going back and forth to Delaware virtually every night \nso he could take care of those two fine young men until he was \nfortunate enough to meet Jill Biden, his beautiful wife.\n  I am very sorry Joe has had to go through this terrible ordeal now of \nlosing a son after having lost a daughter.\n  But, I repeat, there is no question that Delaware is a better place \nbecause of Beau, our country is a better place because of Beau, and the \nworld is better place because of Beau Biden.\n  I, and the entire Senate family, as Senator McConnell has indicated,\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nsend our deepest condolences as they grieve during this tragic time\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/31/senate-section/article/S3324-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here facing yet another manufactured \ncrisis with the vitally important PATRIOT Act provision set to expire \nin a matter of hours. In fact, we have less than 8 hours before the \nexpiration of this critical national security program. That is what we \nare faced with.\n  Tonight's deadline is certainly no surprise. As the junior Senator \nfrom Utah, a Republican, noted: ``We've known for four years that this \ndeadline was approaching.''\n  Like so many other occasions in which brinksmanship has pushed the \nSenate and our Nation to the precipice, the dilemma we now face was \ncompletely avoidable. The job of the leader is to have a plan. In this \ncase, it is clear the majority leader simply didn't have a plan. The \nmajority leader had 5 months to introduce a bill from committee that \nwould reform and extend the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions, but \ninstead he bypassed the committees altogether and brought this to the \nfloor unilaterally, with no committee hearing--none.\n  The majority leader recently said no more rule XIVs, but that pledge \nhas not lasted very long, has it. The majority leader had, I repeat, 5 \nmonths.\n  In fact, my friend, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and \na dean of the Senate, said this could have passed so easily in the last \n2 years. The majority leader had 5 months during the time he has been \nthe majority leader to coordinate with the House, which passed FISA \nreform weeks ago, but instead he went it alone.\n  In fact, it is as if the House and Senate Republican leaders appear \nto be on different pages. Everyone saw this coming. Weeks ago, it was \nclear the Senate didn't have adequate time to consider trade \nlegislation, surveillance legislation, and, of course, the highway bill \nbefore the Memorial Day recess. I said that and others said that.\n  Listen to what one Republican Congressman said. His name is Reid \nRibble.\n\n       He could have handled it better by being more prepared in \n     advance for it. They ran out the clock basically by working \n     on trade first; he probably should have ran the clock out on \n     [surveillance] instead. I don't know what his strategy is \n     here. I'm a little bit flummoxed.\n\n  I say to my friend, Congressman Ribble, that he is not the only one \nwho is flummoxed; so are we.\n  The Senate majority leader set up a collision course with no plan on \nhow to resolve it. It seems the only plan the majority leader had on \nFISA was to jam it through last Friday night; this, despite the fact \nthat an overwhelming majority of House Members oppose an extension, the \nPresident opposes an extension, and a dozen Senate Republicans oppose \nan extension and so voted last Friday.\n  Is it any wonder, then, that even the majority leader's own \nRepublican Senators felt it necessary to take matters into their own \nhands?\n  The majority leader was also caught off guard by a Member of his own \nRepublican conference last week who refused to allow the Senate to \nextend the provisions for a program that the Second Circuit has \ndetermined is illegal.\n  But, again, the junior Senator from Kentucky did not hide his \nthoughts. He was on the floor for 10 hours or so. I disagree with the \njunior Senator from Kentucky, but we are not in the mess today because \nof the junior Senator of Kentucky; we are in the mess we are today \nbecause of the majority leader.\n  The majority leader should have seen this coming. Everyone else did, \neven those in his own party. Meanwhile, the Republican leader has \nrepeatedly lectured this body as to how it should function, but his \nactions have helped the Senate to not function.\n  We can do without more lectures and defiant statements. We can do \nwith more strategy, planning, and open lines of communication because \nit is the majority leader's job to have a plan and to prioritize what \nmust get done over what he would like to get done.\n  In this case, my friend from Kentucky simply did not have a plan, and \nthat is why we are here staring down the barrel of yet another \nunnecessary manufactured crisis that threatens our national security.\n  We heard what the head of the CIA said today on a Sunday show. He \nsaid he is afraid something will happen when this act expires. That is \nnot just my assessment of the situation. This is from the head of the \nCIA. Senate Republicans even feel the same way.\n  The Republican junior Senator from Montana said yesterday:\n\n       We could have done this a week ago. And this is the nature \n     of Washington, D.C., always managing by crisis.\n\n  Fortunately, there is a clear way out: pass the USA FREEDOM Act, \nwhich the House overwhelmingly passed with 338 votes on a totally \nbipartisan basis. All we need are a few more Republican Senators to \nvote with Democrats and the bill will pass. Just three, maybe four, \nmaybe five--but a few Senators is all we need to bring this unnecessary \ncrisis to a screaming halt.\n  I am confident we can pass this bill if the majority leader will \nbring it to the floor for a fair vote.\n  Now, procedurally, it is going to be extremely difficult to not have \nthis bill--this law expire. This is not a bill; this is a law that is \nexpiring. Any other course than just passing this bill would require \nthe House to act before midnight. They are not here, so it is not going \nto happen. There is not a quorum of House Members, and there are House \nMembers who will object to a unanimous consent request anyway.\n  Passing the USA FREEDOM Act is the only way I can foresee where the \nPATRIOT Act provisions do not expire. Now is the time for the majority \nleader to do what is right for the privacy and security of all \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/31/senate-section/article/S3324-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The minority leader.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask, through the Chair, if the Democratic leader will \nyield to me for a comment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator for a \ncomment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was struck by what the Democratic leader \nsaid. He laid out the history of this. We are here in a manufactured, \nunnecessary crisis. It is a manufactured, unnecessary crisis\n  Last year, by an overwhelming majority, the Senate voted to make \nimprovements to the PATRIOT Act. The legislation made reforms to the \nprovisions that have now been declared illegal. We did that but could \nnot get past a filibuster. We had 58 votes. Normally, you think of 51 \nvotes being enough to pass a bill. The Democratic leader will recall \nhow hard he worked to try to get that bill through. The Republican \nleader said: No, we will wait until next year. Well, next year came. We \nhave wasted so much time. There has not been a single public hearing. \nThere has not been any action on an alternative to the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  But, I say to my friend from Nevada, he is absolutely right when he \nsays the House passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a 4 to 1 margin. It was an \noverwhelming vote, Republicans and Democrats together, to get rid of \nthe illegal parts of the PATRIOT Act, to pass an improvement. We ought \nto just take up the USA FREEDOM Act and pass it.\n  If we were allowed to have a straight up-or-down vote in this body, I \nguarantee you, a majority of Senators--both parties--would vote for it.\n  So I just wanted to say that while the leader was on the floor.\n  I now ask for recognition in my own right.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin my comments on the USA \nFREEDOM Act, I am going to speak for a moment on a personal matter.\n\n\n                         Remembering Beau Biden\n\n  Mr. President, Marcelle and I have known Beau Biden since he was a \nchild. I am the longest serving Member of this Senate. When I came \nhere, there was one Senator who was one term senior to me; that was Joe \nBiden. I knew of the tragedy his family had gone through, and I \ncherished the times, with his office right near mine, when his sons \nBeau and Hunter would be there with him. I watched them grow up. I saw \nBeau Biden become the epitome of what a State's attorney general should \nbe. That is a model all attorneys general throughout the country could \nhave followed. Progressive, worried about improving the law, improving \npeoples' lives--he did that.\n  I know how much we appreciated it when we would see him and Hallie at \nan event, when Marcelle and I would get a chance to talk with them. It \nwas like picking up a conversation that had ended just a few minutes \nbefore.\n  I remember one thing especially about Beau. I was in Iraq during the \nwar. It was a day when it was well over 100 degrees outside. I was \nbeing brought to a place where there was going to be a briefing, being \nzipped into this building. There were a number of soldiers wearing T-\nshirts, shorts, and sidearms playing ball outside in this 110-, 120-\ndegree heat. As I went to the door, one of them turned around and gave \nme a big wave with his arm blocking his face. I was not sure who it \nwas. I kind of waved back. Pretty soon, he came to the door. It was \nBeau Biden. I remember we gave each other a big hug. He was there as a \ncaptain in the Delaware Reserves. He was decorated for his service. We \ntalked about what he was doing. He was praising the men and women who \nworked there. Nothing about anything he might be doing; he was praising \neverybody else. It was such a refreshing moment being with him, and it \nwas so typical of who he was as a person.\n  I told him that I have a procedure that if I am in another country \nand I am with our military, that if there are Vermonters there, I \nalways take their names and I ask them if they have family back home in \nVermont. Most of them do. I get their phone number, and as soon as I \nget back, I call their mother or their father, their husband or their \nwife, brother or sister, whoever it might be, and say: I saw a member \nof your family; here is what they are doing; they look well, and all \nthat.\n  So I told Beau, I said: Look, I have known you since you were a \nyoungster. I will call your father as soon as I can and tell him you \nare behaving yourself, and you are doing a good job. We laughed at \nthat.\n  Shortly thereafter, I got on the phone we had available to us to go \nthrough the Whitehouse switchboard to reach the Vice President. Then I \nstarted to talk about the procedure I have, and Joe Biden started to \nlaugh. He said: I just got an email from Beau that he had seen you \nthere and that I should be expecting a call from you. We talked about \nwhat a great job Beau was doing. You could hear the pride in his \nfather's voice. You could hear his pride. It was a pride that was \ndeserved.\n  I remember Joe saying, when we were first here in the Senate--the two \nof us--he would be going home every night on the train. Why? Not as \nmuch even that the kids needed him, but he needed them.\n  Finally, when he met Jill, the boys were telling him: You should \nmarry her.\n  So I grieve for them. Marcelle and I sat there and cried last night \nwhen we heard the news. I think, what a wonderful family. I think about \na life cut too short--far too short.\n  Mr. President, I can and will say more later.\n  Mr. President, on the matter the distinguished Democratic leader was \ntalking about, the USA FREEDOM Act, let's just take it up and pass it. \nOpponents of this bipartisan, commonsense legislation have run out of \nexcuses. I see this as a manufactured crisis, and it is. This matter \nshould have been taken up and voted on up or down a month ago. There is \nonly one viable and responsible path remaining: Pass the USA FREEDOM \nAct that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. Pass it \nand send it to the President's desk and he will sign it. If we do not \npass it, then those parts of the PATRIOT Act that most of us agree on \nare going to expire at midnight.\n  The irony of it is that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is a carefully \ncrafted, bipartisan compromise that both protects Americans' privacy \nand keeps this country safe. Before they were talking about, we are \ngoing to keep the country safe but Americans' privacy--not so much. \nThis is a bill that does both.\n  The legislation would end the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' \nphone records. It adds significant new reforms to limit government \nsurveillance. It increases transparency and also promotes greater \naccountability and oversight--something the original PATRIOT Act did \nnot have.\n  The bill is the product of countless hours of painstaking \nnegotiations with key Members--both Republicans and Democrats--in the \nHouse and the Senate, men and women I respect so much because they want \nto do what is best for the country. We have negotiated with the NSA, \nthe FBI, the Justice Department, privacy and civil liberties groups, \nthe technology industry, and other key stakeholders. We brought \neverybody together. When we began, we wondered if that would be \npossible. We did it. That is why the USA FREEDOM Act has such strong \nsupport, including from groups as diverse as the National Rifle \nAssociation and the Center for American Progress.\n  This broad consensus is what we saw by the overwhelming support it \nreceived in the House. They passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 \nto 88. Some in this country say that no branch of government could have \na vote that strong to say the Sun rises in the east. Certainly there \nhas been no major piece of legislation in years where we have seen a \nvote such as that--338 to 88.\n  But now a minority in the Senate has now twice blocked the USA \nFREEDOM Act from even getting a debate on the Senate floor. We were \nsent here not to vote maybe but to vote yes or no.\n  Last November, even though we had had all kinds of committee hearings \non this, we heard complaints that there had not been enough of a \ncommittee process on the bill and that the Senate should wait to \naddress Section 215 under the new Republican leadership. So the \nRepublican leader led a successful filibuster against a bill which \nstill had a majority of Members in this body voting for it. But what \nhas happened in this Congress? Not a single public hearing on this \nissue; no committee process. And then last weekend, the Senate was \nblocked from even debating the House-passed bill and considering \namendments.\n  Opponents of reform have failed to introduce any legislative \nalternative to the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act, the bill which reforms \nmany problems of the PATRIOT Act. They have come up with no legislative \nalternative other than a clean extension, which we know has no chance \nof becoming law. Of course, it makes no difference because at midnight \nit stops being the law.\n  The time for excuses and inaction has passed. The American people and \nthe intelligence community professionals who strive to protect them \ndeserve better.\n  We have a few hours remaining to work things out and pass the USA \nFREEDOM Act, but there is no room for error. There is very little time. \nAgain, I said it is a manufactured crisis. The deadline to act is \nmidnight tonight. The House will not return to the Capitol until \ntomorrow, after the deadline has passed. We could talk about passing a \n100-year extension if we wanted; it makes no difference because the \ntime will have passed. So if the Senate does not pass the House-passed \nUSA FREEDOM Act or if we amend it in any way, the authorities are going \nto expire.\n  I have said repeatedly--and my cosponsor of the USA FREEDOM Act, \nSenator Lee, agrees with me--that we would like to have a debate on our \nbill and consider amendments. Because opponents of reform have run out \nthe clock and jammed the Senate, we are not left with very much time.\n  Let's get this done today. If we pass the USA FREEDOM Act, the \nPresident could sign it tonight and the intelligence community could \nmove forward\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nwith the certainty it needs to protect the American people.\n  Some may argue that if you had a short-term extension--which, of \ncourse, we do not have--they have said: Well, maybe we could work out \nsome kind of a compromise bill. But let there be no misunderstanding: \nThe USA FREEDOM Act is a solid, carefully negotiated compromise. For \nall those Senators on either side of the aisle who have not spent the \nhours and hours and hours, as Senator Lee and I and our staffs have \nspent, maybe they do not know the work that went into this--again, how \nyou get groups from the left to the right supporting it.\n  It would be irresponsible to kick the can down the road once again, \nrelying on the false hope that the House will agree to pass a short-\nterm extension--something they said they will not do--and that we will \nsomehow be able to agree on a half-baked alternative that has yet to be \nintroduced in either body and most assuredly would not pass the House.\n  So do not be fooled or tempted by the promise of a short-term \nextension. That would guarantee nothing. Well, wait a minute. I take \nthat back. Passing a short-term extension does guarantee something: It \nguarantees the expiration of these authorities at midnight tonight. It \nguarantees more uncertainty, more litigation, more risk for the \nintelligence community, and a repeat of the chaotic brinksmanship later \non down the road with another manufactured crisis.\n  I know there are some who worry that the bill does not go far enough \nwhen it comes to reform. Well, then where were they in coming up with a \nbetter idea? If this passes, the USA FREEDOM Act would be the most \nsignificant set of reforms to government surveillance since the PATRIOT \nAct was enacted. The reason we are here to even debate it is that then-\nmajority leader Dick Armey in the House and I put in sunset provisions. \nSo we will have to show responsibility and vote, as the House did by a \n4-to-1 margin.\n  Our bill--Senator Lee's and my bill--would not just end the NSA's \nbulk collection under Section 215, it would add new transparency and \noversight reforms to other surveillance authorities, and it would be a \nsolid foundation upon which we could build our future reform efforts.\n  I have been in the Senate for more than 40 years. I have learned that \nwhen there is a chance to make real progress, we ought to seize it. But \nI also know we cannot let this be the end of our fight for greater \nprivacy protections, transparency, and accountability. I remain \ncommitted to fighting that fight on behalf of Vermonters and all \nAmericans.\n  So the choices before us this evening are clear: Either let these \nauthorities expire completely or pass the USA FREEDOM Act. There is no \nmore time for political maneuvering or fearmongering or scare tactics. \nIt is time for us to do our jobs--to debate and then to vote. Don't \nduck the vote. Vote up or down on the bill the House gave us. Stand up \nand be counted either for or against it. As Senators, let's have the \ncourage to do that.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act is a reasonable, responsible way forward, and we \nshould pass it tonight. But don't duck behind not doing anything and \npretend that is a solution. I don't think there is a single American, \nRepublican or Democrat, who would believe that was a responsible \nsolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am back here during an unprecedented \nSunday session hoping we can avoid a totally unnecessary disaster \ntonight; hoping we will do what is right for the country: Pass the USA \nFREEDOM Act today. Right now.\n  I will let others speak to the merits of the USA FREEDOM Act. It is \nour best opportunity to protect the Nation while balancing between \nprivacy and constitutional surveillance.\n  I do support reforming the Patriot Act, but I do not support \nunilateral disarmament of our Nation's need to know what bad guys with \npredatory intent are planning against the United States of America.\n  But my comments today are not about standing up for the USA FREEDOM \nAct.\n  I am here to stand up for the men and women working for the NSA, FBI, \nand other intelligence agencies essential to protecting our country \nagainst terrorist attacks--whether it is a ``lone wolf'' or state \nsponsored. These dedicated, patriotic intelligence professionals want \nto operate under rule of law that is constitutional, legal, and \nauthorized.\n  They are ready to do their jobs, but Congress needs to do our job and \npass a bill that is constitutional, legal, and authorized.\n  Ever since Edward Snowden made his allegations, the men and women of \nour intelligence agencies have been vilified as if they were the enemy. \nThey thought they were doing their jobs protecting us against the \nenemy.\n  Let me tell you--the men and women of the NSA, FBI, and our other \nintelligence agencies are patriots who have been wrongly vilified by \nthose who don't bother to inform themselves about our national security \nstructures and the vital functions they perform.\n  Now a special word about the NSA, which is headquartered in my home \nState of Maryland. The 30,000 men and women in the NSA serve in \nsilence--without public accolades. They protect us from cyber attacks. \nThey protect us against terrorist attacks. They support our \nwarfighters. They are Ph.D.'s and scientists. They are linguists, cyber \ngeeks, and whiz kids--the treasured human capital of this Nation.\n  Remember that section 215 is such a small aspect of what the NSA, \nFBI, and other intelligence agencies do as they stand sentry in cyber \nspace stopping attacks. People act like that is all NSA does. They \nhaven't even bothered to educate themselves as to legality and \nconstitutionality.\n  Congress passed the Patriot Act. President George W. Bush told us it \nwas constitutional. We need good intelligence. In a world of ISIL, \nNusra Front, and al Qaeda, the NSA is our front line of defense and the \npeople of NSA make up that front line.\n  There is no evidence of abuse by NSA employees. The men and women of \nNSA have adhered to the law. They have submitted to oversight, audits, \nchecks and balances, and reviews from Congress and the courts.\n  The employees of NSA know that everything has to be constitutional, \nlegal, and authorized. They thought they were implementing the law, but \nsome in the media and even some in this body have made them feel like \nthey were wrongdoers. I find this infuriating and insulting. Morale has \nbeen devastated at NSA. Families have been harassed for working at the \nNSA and their kids are bullied at school.\n  They have also been devastated by actions of their own government. \nFirst, by sequester--then, by the government shutdown. Now, by \nCongress's failure to reform national security authorities that help \nthem keep our country safe.\n  It is wrong. I want people to remember that tonight as we discuss \nimportant reforms. Let us not let them down, once again, with our own \nfailure to act.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is greatly disappointing that the \nSenate is in session today to reconsider a vote we took before the \nMemorial Day recess to extend the three expiring provisions of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Instead of passing the USA FREEDOM Act a week ago and sending it to \nthe President, we are now poised to take the measure up this coming \nweek, after the FISA authorities have expired. The result is that our \nintelligence agencies will lose important tools to protect against \nterrorist attacks. This is a self-inflicted harm, and one that was \ntotally unnecessary.\n  As I did a week ago, I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the USA FREEDOM Act, and I intend to vote for the \nlegislation through the upcoming procedural votes. The bill is not \nperfect, but it extends the business records, lone wolf, and roving \nwiretap provisions and it institutes some important reforms to FISA.\n  Unfortunately, what we have on the floor of the Senate tonight is \npolitical gamesmanship at its worst. We should have had this debate \nweeks or months ago, not up against the deadline. Failing that, the \nmajority should not have defeated this motion last week when it is \nprepared today to pass it.\n  We should skip the unnecessary delay of voting separately on the \nmotion to proceed, cloture on the bill, and on the bill itself. Clearly \nthere are 60 votes in\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nthis chamber to pass the USA FREEDOM Act, whether we do it today or if \nwe do it next week.\n  So the question comes: why not pass this bill today, reform the \nbusiness records provision of FISA, and keep important intelligence \nauthorities in effect? Unfortunately, the answer is that one Senator is \nholding this process hostage for his own political benefit. It is a \ntravesty, and it is unconscionable.\n  We remain a nation under threat of terrorism. Our allies remain under \nthreat of terrorism.\n  This is not hypothetical. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant--\nISIL--is seeking to recruit individuals to conduct attacks against the \nUnited States. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters have entered Iraq \nand Syria to join ISIL. There are hundreds of people inside the United \nStates right now that ISIL is seeking to inspire, direct, and assist in \ncarrying out an attack.\n  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula--AQAP--is developing non-metallic, \nundetectable bombs for use on U.S. airliners and is teaching people how \nto make such devices themselves. These groups are competing to be worst \nof the worst in international terrorism and they are coming after us.\n  We aren't sending thousands of troops to confront ISIL in Iraq and \nSyria or to stop AQAP in Yemen. We aren't going to diminish their \nthreats through partnership with local governments.\n  The only way we are going to stop attacks against the United States \nand our people is by collecting good intelligence. To me, that means we \nneed to do everything lawful and effective in intelligence to identify \nand thwart those attacks.\n  The roving wiretap provision is important. It says that the FBI \ndoesn't have to stop surveillance against a terrorist or a foreign spy \nwhen he buys a new cell phone or changes his email account. Having to \ndo so in today's world would be ridiculous.\n  The ``lone wolf'' provision is important. To be clear--it hasn't been \nused. But to be equally clear, never before have we faced the exact \nthreat that this provision was written to address: the threat of an \nindividual, inside this country, plotting to kill Americans without \ntraveling abroad and training with a terrorist group first.\n  The business records provision is important. It includes both routine \nrequests for records--hotel bills, car rentals, travel information--\nthat are regular parts of law enforcement and national security \ninvestigations. It also authorizes the NSA's phone metadata program. \nUnder this provision, the NSA gets information about phone calls to \ninclude the numbers on either end of the line, the time, and the \nduration of the call. It does not include the words that are spoken as \npart of the phone conversation, the identities of the people involved, \nor their location.\n  What it does is help the Intelligence Community know more about \npeople for whom there is a ``reasonable articulable suspicion'' of \nbeing tied to terrorist groups. If there is a terrorist in Syria \ntalking to Americans at home, we want to know that. If a phone number, \nfor example, in Garland, TX, is in touch with an ISIL operations chief, \nwe need to know. That information allows the FBI to go to a court for a \nprobable cause warrant to conduct electronic and physical surveillance \nof a suspect.\n  This program is conducted under strict oversight and operational \nlimitations. The number of people at NSA with access to the data is \nsmall--it was 22 in 2013. They have to get approval each time they do a \nquery of the phone records; today that approval comes from the FISA \nCourt. The query only returns information on what numbers were called \nby, and called, the phone number in question, and then a second hop \nfrom that number. There were 288 phone numbers approved for queries in \n2012, and those queries led to 12 probable cause warrants by the FBI.\n  The program is overseen within the NSA by multiple officials, \nincluding the inspector general and the privacy and civil liberties \nofficer. It is overseen by the Department of Justice, which reviews \nevery single query, and by the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence. It is overseen by the Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees of the House and the Senate, and it is overseen for \ncompliance purposes by the FISA Court.\n  So these are important tools that, because of Senate inaction and \nrecalcitrance, will expire tonight. As a result, we make ourselves more \nvulnerable.\n  I very much regret this situation that the Senate has created, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to quickly enact the USA \nFREEDOM Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also regret that we are where we are.\n\n\n                         Remembering Beau Biden\n\n  I would also like to defer for just a moment, before I make my \nremarks that I came to the floor to make, to add my condolences to Vice \nPresident Biden, his wife, and his family. I just learned the tragic \nnews this morning. Some may have known that Beau was dealing with a \nform of cancer. I did not know that. It came as a shock to hear that \ninformation.\n  Having served with the current Vice President in the U.S. Senate and \nhaving gotten to know him and his family, establishing a relationship--\na professional relationship as well as a friendship--I still cannot \nbegin to comprehend the grief that comes from the loss of a child. I \nknow there are Members in this body who have experienced that. I am \nfortunate that Marsha and I have not experienced that. But any parent's \nperhaps deepest fear is that they will outlive their children. That is \nnot the natural order of things. It is not how we think. And the grief \nthat comes from the death of a child, the death of a son or a daughter, \nis truly deep and has significant impact.\n  It was impossible not to feel the emotion and shed tears early this \nmorning in our home in Indianapolis when we heard the news. Our \ncondolences and deep sharing of grief that we can't even begin to fully \ncomprehend because we haven't had to deal with it--all of that comes \nacross. I think every Member of this body reaches out to them with our \nthoughts and our prayers as they go through this very tragic situation.\n  Mr. President, I am a little surprised to hear the Senator from \nVermont talking about how the Senate ought to just completely concede \nto whatever the House sends to the Senate. The fact is that we had a \nvery significant discussion and debate on this issue all week before \nthe Memorial Day break and it had gone on for months, if not years, \nbefore in the Intelligence Committee on which I serve and among Members \ngenerally.\n  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will have \nto deal with. It was drafted and spawned as a result of 9/11 when the \nAmerican people said: Are we doing everything we possibly can to \nprevent something such as this from happening again?\n  Congress debated extensively the PATRIOT Act and the tools the \nintelligence community suggested we give them the authority to use to \ntry to prevent that catastrophe from ever happening again and doing \neverything we could to prevent terrorist attacks. Along the way, there \nhave been modifications, and there have been changes.\n  Recently, there has been significant national debate over whether one \nof these many essential tools that help us gather the intelligence to \ntry to prevent and to understand the nature of the threat should be \nused. There clearly is a difference of opinion among Members here in \nthe Senate and even in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Senate \ndid pass a reform measure that I think is flawed, personally. I think \nit diminishes--it doesn't eliminate, but it diminishes and some even \nbelieve it eliminates the usefulness of this particular program. We \nwent back and forth on that for a significant part of the week before \nwe adjourned.\n  The Senator from Vermont comes to the floor and basically says: Look, \nthe House passed this; so therefore we ought to just go ahead and pass \nit. He said there was no other alternative presented, but that is not \nthe case. We had a procedural vote on the House bill, and we had a vote \non the bill to extend this program, so we can come spend a little more \ntime to try to figure out how best to deal with this issue. Neither of \nthose passed, indicating that the Senate did not have the same \nconsensus the House reached, which was a partial consensus. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about. We are not just a rubberstamp for the \nHouse.\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\n  What is really ironic is the fact that for 4 years, under Democratic \nleadership of this Senate, the House, under Republican leadership, sent \nus hundreds of pieces of legislation, and if we followed the admonition \nto us of the Senator from Vermont, we would have just rubberstamped \nthose. The House passed it, so why wouldn't we go forward? I don't \nthink that argument makes a lot of sense.\n  Senators are here to address issues in the U.S. Senate. Are there \nmany bills the House passes that I agree with? Yes. My party controls \nthe House. Are there bills here that I don't agree with that they have \npassed? Yes. We, as Senators, use our prerogative in terms of where we \nstand, and ultimately we take a vote and we either win or we lose. \nSometimes it coordinates with the House of Representatives and other \ntimes it doesn't, so then we go to conference and we pass an \nalternative. But to say there hasn't been debate relative to this \nprogram in the House-passed bill is simply not true.\n  Unfortunately, there has been such a significant misrepresentation of \nwhat this program is and what this program isn't, and that has caused a \nlot of angst which we are trying to deal with. Much of the public--at \nleast some portion of the public--is convinced that the government is \nlistening to every phone call they make. It has been said on this floor \nthat they are listening to all our phone calls, that they are \ncollecting all kinds of data. They know everything about us. That is \nthe furthest from the point of this program and the operation of this \nprogram that we can conceive of. Yet, a portion of the public has been \nled to believe that Big Government is in their bedroom, in their house, \nin their car, in their phone, and tracks them wherever they go; that \nthey are collecting everything about people, including what they buy at \nCostco and the movies people rent through Netflix. Private industry \ndoes collect that kind of stuff, but it is not the government. It is \nnot done under this program.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell my colleagues \nthat we have spent hundreds of hours dealing with this program to \nensure that it doesn't violate anyone's privacy. It has more oversight \nthrough all three branches of government. The executive branch, the \njudicial branch, and the legislative branch oversee this program. There \nare six layers within NSA itself that it has to go through, that \nattorneys have to look at, that legal experts have to look at before \nthey can even proceed to suspect and then take that suspicion to a \ncourt to have a judge say: Yes, you might have something here.\n  It has been said and it is true that unless a person's phone number \nis in communication with a foreign phone number that is at least \nstrongly suspected of belonging to a terrorist organization--and \nultimately the court has to make that decision--a member of Al Qaeda, \nISIS, or some group overseas that is attempting to do harm to the \nUnited States--why is this particular phone number--not the name of the \nperson who owns the phone number--why is this particular phone number \nbeing called by someone in Yemen or being called by what we strongly \nsuspect is a foreign operative through ISIS, Al Qaeda, Yemen, or other \npoints where we know terrorist activity is rampant?\n  There is a signal that comes up that matches phone numbers, and they \nsay: We better look into this. But before they can look into it, it has \nto be vetted by a court. It has to be taken to a FISA Court or an \nintelligence court and judged by that court as something viable to \npursue. At that point, it is similar to what a court would order if \nthere were a warrant to go and find more information to see whether \nthis suspicion actually is reality.\n  We read about it every day and we watch it on television--``Law and \nOrder'' and all the shows and so forth--about how law enforcement \nsuspects that this particular activity is a criminal organization or \nthis is a drug house or they have reason to believe the perpetrator of \nthe crime is this individual. They can't go raiding their house. They \ncan't go downloading information about them until they go to a court \nand receive approval from a judge saying: Yes, here you are, here is \nyour warrant. You can go and check this out.\n  Well, this intelligence program is based on the same principle; that \nis, nobody can collect any information on anybody unless that court \napproves that operation. Then it is turned over to the FBI, and they \nlook to see if it is the real thing. It is a tool that has been of \nimportance and has been a contribution to our ability to address the \npotential of terrorist threats and to thwart them before they happen. \nIt has always been used as a way of proving the negative; that is, no, \nthis is OK, we don't need to follow up on this.\n  The best example is the Boston bombing. When the Tsarnaev brothers' \nphone was accessed and it was run against the numbers, there was some \nsuspicion that additional terrorist activity would take place in New \nYork. It was proven that was not the case because there were no \nconnections made. So it became a valuable tool in that regard. Instead \nof shutting down New York, putting them on a high terrorist alert--\nperhaps the Nation's largest economy in operation there--we were able \nto quickly determine that wasn't the case.\n  In response to those who basically say this has never stopped a \nterrorist attack, two things: No. 1, this is one of the many methods we \nuse to collect the threads of intelligence that come from different \nsources to try to put together a mosaic or a puzzle as to whether this \nis something we need to deal with and take seriously. It is a major \npiece of that puzzle we obtain from the 215 program, which is the \ncollection of phone numbers. We do not collect the names of people who \nown those numbers. It is the collection of what is called metadata. It \nhas been described as simply the same data that is on our telephone \nbills that the Supreme Court has said is not a breach of the Fourth \nAmendment. It is not privileged for privacy purposes. It shows the date \nthe call was made, the duration of the call, the number that was \ncalled, and that is it. And those numbers are put into a system whereby \nwe can check against that a number that suspiciously is talking to a \nforeign operative in a foreign country. That then automatically \ntriggers that you better look at this--it is kind of a ping--you better \nlook at this one. Nobody has access, at this point, to any content \nrelated to the name of the individual until it reaches a level of \nsuspicion that is vetted through six layers of oversight and then is \nsent to a court that looks at it to say: We agree with you or we don't \nagree with you. And if we agree with you, then it is the FBI who is \nalerted that they better look into this.\n\n  Now, there has never been a time since 9/11 when we have dealt with a \nhigher threshold than we currently are dealing with. You hear about it \nevery day. You read about it every day. ISIS has recruited more than \n20,000, it is estimated--significantly more than that are those from 90 \ndifferent foreign countries. It has made a direct threat toward the \nUnited States and its citizens. It is sponsoring and encouraging \nindividuals to not only come over and train and join ISIS and then come \nback here and wreak havoc on the American people; it is also inspiring \nthose, saying if you don't want to travel over here, just go out and \nkill somebody. Join the jihad from afar. You can be a part of what we \nare trying to accomplish simply by doing your own thing. We saw that \nhappen down in Texas. We will see that in other places as people are \ninspired through ISIS, for whatever sick reason, to take up arms, to \ncause destruction, and to randomly kill and wreak havoc on the American \npublic.\n  It has been offered that the House fix--the reform, which did have \nbipartisan support and did pass the House without a lot of debate--is \nthe solution to this problem. Some agree it goes too far; some agree it \ndoesn't go far enough. But there are problems with that particular \nFREEDOM Act, which the Senator from Vermont says is the golden grail \nhere and will solve all the problems.\n  It is clear, and it is the testimony we have received from numerous \nofficials in the counterterrorism business and in the intelligence \nbusiness, that there are issues with this so-called FREEDOM Act fix \nthat could render--well, No. 1, that do render the program less \neffective and could render it totally inoperative.\n  The fact that the NSA has not yet been able to come up with a program\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nwhich would ensure that we could have the kind of collection we need in \nthe timeframe we need it--some of this is urgent, some of this is \npending, some of this is imminent, and it already goes through layers \nthat delay coming to a conclusion and this adds more.\n  Also, they have indicated the system is untested and exists in name \nonly. We don't know how the new program would be implemented and we \ndon't know how it would be operated. That is why many of us said: Look, \nfor whatever reason, yes, we are at this point, and, yes, it expires at \nmidnight. What we were trying to do before we left was get a short-term \nextension. We were negotiating. We think it should have been for a \nsignificant amount of time, until NSA could test out its program, but \nwe were willing to go much less than that so we could have an \nopportunity to come back and debate this further and get to the bottom \nof some of the misrepresented information that has been sent out to the \nAmerican people and have an opportunity to counter that and also work \ntogether to find ways, through working with the House of \nRepresentatives, to come up with a more effective bill that wouldn't \nput the country in more jeopardy or, as some experts have said, would \nundermine the entire program.\n  We obviously will be less agile with the House bill. It requires an \nexpansive regulatory system to amass the level of oversight over the \ncurrent program. I think the real problem is it requires no data \nretention mandate. The USA FREEDOM Act does not require companies to \nhold the data sought by the government. Therefore, the USA FREEDOM Act \ncould be operationally useless as companies update their business model \nin response to changes in technology or market demand. The telephone \ncompanies--all 1,400 of them--many don't want to go through the \nexpensive process of the oversight they need to have in the process. \nThey want to sell phones. And they are hearing a lot from customers who \nbasically say: I don't want to buy your phone if it is going to be \nsubject to them listening to everything I do and say--being collected.\n  Well, first of all, that is factually wrong, but it is an error that \nhas been said over and over on this floor by some Members. That is \nabsolutely wrong. It is false. If we are going to go forward here, we \nneed intellectual honesty about what the program is and what it isn't, \nand it shouldn't be labeled as something it isn't. I will address that \nat a later point in time.\n  But the USA FREEDOM Act, by not allowing retention for a fixed period \nof time, also lessens our ability to make this program effective. So I \nhave much more to say on this, and I know we are going into caucus as a \nparty to see how we might go forward, given where we are.\n  It was not necessary that we be here on a Sunday with the clock \nticking toward midnight. We could have continued or we could have gone \nforward without getting to this particular point in time. But now we \nwill have the opportunity--and, unfortunately, what it looks like is we \nwill have the opportunity to debate this while the program expires.\n  That is a bet I didn't want to take--the bet being that nothing will \nhappen if we don't have this tool in the amount of time that is going \nto be taken to now address this. That is running a risk I am not sure \nMembers want to take. I don't want to be part of somebody who says this \nisn't important enough; therefore, we will let it expire and we will \nnot extend it for a day or an hour or a month or a sufficient amount of \ntime to come to a reasonable conclusion as to how we retain this very \nimportant intelligence-gathering tool to keep us safe from terrorists. \nTo go dark on this is a risk of Americans' lives. It is a risk that we \nare taking, and we are going to be responsible for our vote, whatever \nthat vote is. I, personally, don't want the responsibility of saying: \nOh, don't worry. Nothing is going to happen out there. The hundreds of \nhours that I spend in the Intelligence Committee tells me there is a \nlot that can happen out there.\n  Members have every right, if they are not on that committee--every \nright to access what we access. We have invited people to come down and \nsee it for themselves, so they at least understand what it is and what \nit isn't. To my knowledge, only two have taken us up on that. There may \nbe more I have missed. But some of those who have stated this program \nin a totally false way have the siren song to the people out there who \nthink Big Government is in their bedroom, Big Government is taking \nevery piece of information they have about themselves, and Big \nGovernment is storing this and ``listening to all your phone calls.'' \nThat is a bunch of hokum and it is wrong.\n  And for those who refuse to stand up and acknowledge that--because \nthey have had access to the program and refused to take that access--\nhave to bear the responsibility of sowing this wild theory and idea \nabout Big Government in your bedroom and Big Government in your car and \nBig Government on your phone and Big Government collecting your emails \nand Big Government doing everything and storing it until the time that \nBig Government will come and take everything away from you.\n  I didn't come here to do that and this Senate isn't here to do that \nand we will not do that. That is why this program has more oversight \nthan any other program in the entire United States Government, and we \nwill put more oversight on there if that is necessary. I will stay up \nall night and stand over at NSA and make sure they are not listening to \nyour phone calls. But it is irresponsible misrepresentation--\nirresponsible misrepresentation--to factually state a falsity and not \ntell the truth.\n  It is time we told the truth and it is time we stood up to this thing \nand make sure we are doing everything we can to protect Americans from \nthreats of a lot of people and a lot of organizations that want to kill \nus all, that would like to see our heads on the chopping block. This is \nreal in our country, as people who are trained by ISIS not only flock \nback here from Syria, but they inspire people here to pick up weapons \nand do harm to the American people.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona has a question.\n  Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. I have not yielded the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order, and I want to \nask the Senator from Indiana a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for \na question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe the Senator from Kentucky should know the rules of \nthe Senate, that the Senator from Indiana has the floor and the \ngentleman is open to respond to a question.\n  My question to the Senator from Indiana--and I want to say that his \nwords are powerful and accurate.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the clock for the \nRepublican side?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator from Indiana if he has seen--\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Chair has made very clear that the \nSenator from Indiana has the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I know the Senator from Kentucky understands that when a Senator has \nthe floor, they are entitled to speak because he has used that rule \nhimself.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Twice the Senator from Kentucky has not observed the \nrules of the Senate.\n  I would ask the Senator from Indiana, you have seen the events lately \nthat are transpiring. ISIS has taken Palmyra. They are in the streets \nburning bodies, killing people, going to destroy 2,000-year-old \nantiquities, and at the same time Ramadi has fallen with thousands of \ninnocent men, women, and children being massacred. At this time, isn't \nthis program as critical as it has ever been since its inception, given \nthe fact that the Middle East is literally on fire and we are losing \neverywhere?\n  Mr. COATS. It is more essential than ever, in response to the \nquestion from the Senator from Arizona. It is more necessary than ever, \nas we have seen a higher threat level since 9/11. Of course, we didn't \nknow what the threat was in 9/11, so I don't know how far we have to\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\ngo back. But our intelligence today, whether it is any aspect of any of \nour intelligence agencies, they are sounding the alarm that we need to \nbe as vigilant as possible. We need to, within the law--and we are \noperating within the law--use every tool possible to try to stop an \nattack on the American people. What happened on 9/11 was a catastrophe \nthat none of us could have comprehended. A 9/11 with the possession of \nnuclear, radioactive, biological or chemical weapons would make New \nYork look like just a small incident. It would be 3 million people \ninstead of 3,000 people. I think we have an obligation to do what we \ncan without invading anyone's privacy.\n  What we are trying to find is this balance between protecting privacy \nand protecting ourselves from terrorist attacks--protecting Americans \nfrom terrorist attacks. We have done this with this program. If what \nhas been said about this program were true, if the falsehoods that have \nbeen said were true, I would be the first to line up and say: No, we \ncan't breach the privacy of the American people by doing what they are \ndoing. But the fact is none of it is true. There has not been one act \nof abuse of this program over the years it has been in place. It has \nmore oversight and layers of oversight. As former Attorney General \nMukasey said: For the government to violate and bypass this, it would \nmake Watergate look like kindergarten activity. It would be a \nconspiracy that would include hundreds of people, and they would all \nhave to swear that they would not breach their conspiratorial process \nhere--a program that is overseen by the Judiciary Committee, by the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee, the \nbody of the Senate has access to this and the body of the House--that \nis 535 people--by the executive branch, a program that was endorsed by \nBarack Obama, until he changed his mind, apparently, because the public \nwas going the other way based on false information. People are out here \nbasically making the accusations that they are making to try to take \nthis program down and all we are trying to do is work with the House to \nfind a reasonable way of keeping this tool alive--keeping Americans \nsafe.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend?\n  Under the previous order, all time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, my understanding is there is still 5 minutes \nremaining on the opposition side. I request that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how can we have an objection when we already \nhave a consent agreement that says we have 30 minutes of equally \ndivided time and you still have 5 minutes remaining on the opposite \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was divided in the usual form, and \nthe time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the time could not have been divided \nequally, because apparently somebody must have given one side more time \nthan the other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of time that was allotted to the \nDemocratic side was unused, and it was equally divided at 23 minutes \napiece.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I was here for 30 minutes of the Republican \nside speaking. I sat at my seat for 30 minutes. It was not 23 minutes \nof equally divided time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regular order--obviously people don't know \nthe rules of the Senate. Maybe they should learn them.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I request the remaining 5 minutes of time on \nthe opposite side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I challenge the ruling of the Chair and \nrequest the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. PAUL. I request a live quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes--the 5 minutes that was remaining on the opposition side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let us be very clear about why we are here \nthis evening. We are here this evening because this is an important \ndebate. This is a debate over the Bill of Rights. This is a debate over \nthe Fourth Amendment. This is a debate over your right to be left \nalone. Justice Brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the \nmost cherished of rights. The right to be left alone is the most prized \nto civilized men.\n  Let us be clear. We are here tonight because the President continues \nto conduct an illegal program. The President has been rebuked by the \ncourt. In explicit terms, the President has been told that the program \nhe is conducting is illegal. Now, the President opines on television. \nThe President wants to blame--he says: Anybody but me.\n  But you know what. The President started this program without \ncongressional permission. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act say that \nthe PATRIOT Act in no way gives authority to the President to collect \nall of your phone records all of the time. If there ever was a general \nwarrant, if there ever was a generalized collection of information from \npeople about whom there is no suspicion, this is it.\n  We are not collecting the information of spies. We are not collecting \nthe information of terrorists. We are collecting all American citizens' \nrecords all of the time. This is what we fought the Revolution over. \nAre we going to so blithely give up our freedom? Are we going to so \nblithely go along and just say: Take it. Well, I am not going to take \nit anymore. I do not think the American people are going to take it \nanymore.\n  Eighty percent of those under 40 say we have gone too far--that this \nwhole collection of all of our records all the time is too much. The \ncourt has said: How can records be relevant to an investigation that \nhas not started? The court has said that even under these lower \nstandards, even under these standards of saying that it would be \nrelevant, all of the stuff they are collecting is precisely irrelevant.\n  Now people say: Well, they are not looking at it. They are not \nlistening to it. It is the tip of the iceberg, what we are talking \nabout here. Realize that they were dishonest about the program until we \ncaught them. They kept saying over and over: We are not doing this. We \nare not collecting your records.\n  They were. The head of the intelligence agency lied to the American \npeople, and he still works there. We should be upset. We should be \nmarching in the streets and saying: He has to go. We cannot allow this. \nWe cannot allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we live in an \narbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want \nanytime they want.\n  This is the tip of the iceberg. They are collecting records through \nExecutive order. They are collecting records through section 702. \nPeople say: How will we protect ourselves without these programs? What \nabout using the Constitution? What about using judicial warrants? About \nthe Tsarnaev boy, the Boston Bomber, they say: How will we look at his \nphone records? Get a warrant. Put his name on it. You can get a \nwarrant. There is no reason in the world--the guy had already bombed \nus. Do you think anybody was going to turn down a warrant? We should \nhave gotten a warrant before.\n  Get warrants on people we have suspicion on. The Simpson guy that was \nshot in Garland had already been arrested. We had suspicion.\n  Let's hire 1,000 more FBI agents. Let's hire people to do the \ninvestigation and quit wasting time on innocent American people. Let's \nbe very clear why we are here: President Obama set up this program, the \nPresident Obama who once was against the PATRIOT Act. President Obama \nonce said: You know what; we should have judges write warrants.\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\n  President Obama, who once believed in the Fourth Amendment, is the \nPresident who is now scooping up all of your records illegally. Then he \nfeigns concern and says: Oh, we need to pass this new bill. He could \nstop it now. Why won't someone ask the President: Why do you continue? \nWhy won't you stop this program now? The President has every ability to \ndo it. We have every ability to keep our Nation safe. I intend to \nprotect the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/31/senate-section/article/S3324-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3324-S3331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 87, H.R. 2048, a bill to \n     reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require \n     the production of certain business records, conduct \n     electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace \n     devices, and use other forms of information gathering for \n     foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal \n     purposes, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask, through the Chair, if the Democratic leader will \nyield to me for a comment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator for a \ncomment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was struck by what the Democratic leader \nsaid. He laid out the history of this. We are here in a manufactured, \nunnecessary crisis. It is a manufactured, unnecessary crisis\n  Last year, by an overwhelming majority, the Senate voted to make \nimprovements to the PATRIOT Act. The legislation made reforms to the \nprovisions that have now been declared illegal. We did that but could \nnot get past a filibuster. We had 58 votes. Normally, you think of 51 \nvotes being enough to pass a bill. The Democratic leader will recall \nhow hard he worked to try to get that bill through. The Republican \nleader said: No, we will wait until next year. Well, next year came. We \nhave wasted so much time. There has not been a single public hearing. \nThere has not been any action on an alternative to the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  But, I say to my friend from Nevada, he is absolutely right when he \nsays the House passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a 4 to 1 margin. It was an \noverwhelming vote, Republicans and Democrats together, to get rid of \nthe illegal parts of the PATRIOT Act, to pass an improvement. We ought \nto just take up the USA FREEDOM Act and pass it.\n  If we were allowed to have a straight up-or-down vote in this body, I \nguarantee you, a majority of Senators--both parties--would vote for it.\n  So I just wanted to say that while the leader was on the floor.\n  I now ask for recognition in my own right.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin my comments on the USA \nFREEDOM Act, I am going to speak for a moment on a personal matter.\n\n\n                         Remembering Beau Biden\n\n  Mr. President, Marcelle and I have known Beau Biden since he was a \nchild. I am the longest serving Member of this Senate. When I came \nhere, there was one Senator who was one term senior to me; that was Joe \nBiden. I knew of the tragedy his family had gone through, and I \ncherished the times, with his office right near mine, when his sons \nBeau and Hunter would be there with him. I watched them grow up. I saw \nBeau Biden become the epitome of what a State's attorney general should \nbe. That is a model all attorneys general throughout the country could \nhave followed. Progressive, worried about improving the law, improving \npeoples' lives--he did that.\n  I know how much we appreciated it when we would see him and Hallie at \nan event, when Marcelle and I would get a chance to talk with them. It \nwas like picking up a conversation that had ended just a few minutes \nbefore.\n  I remember one thing especially about Beau. I was in Iraq during the \nwar. It was a day when it was well over 100 degrees outside. I was \nbeing brought to a place where there was going to be a briefing, being \nzipped into this building. There were a number of soldiers wearing T-\nshirts, shorts, and sidearms playing ball outside in this 110-, 120-\ndegree heat. As I went to the door, one of them turned around and gave \nme a big wave with his arm blocking his face. I was not sure who it \nwas. I kind of waved back. Pretty soon, he came to the door. It was \nBeau Biden. I remember we gave each other a big hug. He was there as a \ncaptain in the Delaware Reserves. He was decorated for his service. We \ntalked about what he was doing. He was praising the men and women who \nworked there. Nothing about anything he might be doing; he was praising \neverybody else. It was such a refreshing moment being with him, and it \nwas so typical of who he was as a person.\n  I told him that I have a procedure that if I am in another country \nand I am with our military, that if there are Vermonters there, I \nalways take their names and I ask them if they have family back home in \nVermont. Most of them do. I get their phone number, and as soon as I \nget back, I call their mother or their father, their husband or their \nwife, brother or sister, whoever it might be, and say: I saw a member \nof your family; here is what they are doing; they look well, and all \nthat.\n  So I told Beau, I said: Look, I have known you since you were a \nyoungster. I will call your father as soon as I can and tell him you \nare behaving yourself, and you are doing a good job. We laughed at \nthat.\n  Shortly thereafter, I got on the phone we had available to us to go \nthrough the Whitehouse switchboard to reach the Vice President. Then I \nstarted to talk about the procedure I have, and Joe Biden started to \nlaugh. He said: I just got an email from Beau that he had seen you \nthere and that I should be expecting a call from you. We talked about \nwhat a great job Beau was doing. You could hear the pride in his \nfather's voice. You could hear his pride. It was a pride that was \ndeserved.\n  I remember Joe saying, when we were first here in the Senate--the two \nof us--he would be going home every night on the train. Why? Not as \nmuch even that the kids needed him, but he needed them.\n  Finally, when he met Jill, the boys were telling him: You should \nmarry her.\n  So I grieve for them. Marcelle and I sat there and cried last night \nwhen we heard the news. I think, what a wonderful family. I think about \na life cut too short--far too short.\n  Mr. President, I can and will say more later.\n  Mr. President, on the matter the distinguished Democratic leader was \ntalking about, the USA FREEDOM Act, let's just take it up and pass it. \nOpponents of this bipartisan, commonsense legislation have run out of \nexcuses. I see this as a manufactured crisis, and it is. This matter \nshould have been taken up and voted on up or down a month ago. There is \nonly one viable and responsible path remaining: Pass the USA FREEDOM \nAct that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. Pass it \nand send it to the President's desk and he will sign it. If we do not \npass it, then those parts of the PATRIOT Act that most of us agree on \nare going to expire at midnight.\n  The irony of it is that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is a carefully \ncrafted, bipartisan compromise that both protects Americans' privacy \nand keeps this country safe. Before they were talking about, we are \ngoing to keep the country safe but Americans' privacy--not so much. \nThis is a bill that does both.\n  The legislation would end the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' \nphone records. It adds significant new reforms to limit government \nsurveillance. It increases transparency and also promotes greater \naccountability and oversight--something the original PATRIOT Act did \nnot have.\n  The bill is the product of countless hours of painstaking \nnegotiations with key Members--both Republicans and Democrats--in the \nHouse and the Senate, men and women I respect so much because they want \nto do what is best for the country. We have negotiated with the NSA, \nthe FBI, the Justice Department, privacy and civil liberties groups, \nthe technology industry, and other key stakeholders. We brought \neverybody together. When we began, we wondered if that would be \npossible. We did it. That is why the USA FREEDOM Act has such strong \nsupport, including from groups as diverse as the National Rifle \nAssociation and the Center for American Progress.\n  This broad consensus is what we saw by the overwhelming support it \nreceived in the House. They passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 \nto 88. Some in this country say that no branch of government could have \na vote that strong to say the Sun rises in the east. Certainly there \nhas been no major piece of legislation in years where we have seen a \nvote such as that--338 to 88.\n  But now a minority in the Senate has now twice blocked the USA \nFREEDOM Act from even getting a debate on the Senate floor. We were \nsent here not to vote maybe but to vote yes or no.\n  Last November, even though we had had all kinds of committee hearings \non this, we heard complaints that there had not been enough of a \ncommittee process on the bill and that the Senate should wait to \naddress Section 215 under the new Republican leadership. So the \nRepublican leader led a successful filibuster against a bill which \nstill had a majority of Members in this body voting for it. But what \nhas happened in this Congress? Not a single public hearing on this \nissue; no committee process. And then last weekend, the Senate was \nblocked from even debating the House-passed bill and considering \namendments.\n  Opponents of reform have failed to introduce any legislative \nalternative to the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act, the bill which reforms \nmany problems of the PATRIOT Act. They have come up with no legislative \nalternative other than a clean extension, which we know has no chance \nof becoming law. Of course, it makes no difference because at midnight \nit stops being the law.\n  The time for excuses and inaction has passed. The American people and \nthe intelligence community professionals who strive to protect them \ndeserve better.\n  We have a few hours remaining to work things out and pass the USA \nFREEDOM Act, but there is no room for error. There is very little time. \nAgain, I said it is a manufactured crisis. The deadline to act is \nmidnight tonight. The House will not return to the Capitol until \ntomorrow, after the deadline has passed. We could talk about passing a \n100-year extension if we wanted; it makes no difference because the \ntime will have passed. So if the Senate does not pass the House-passed \nUSA FREEDOM Act or if we amend it in any way, the authorities are going \nto expire.\n  I have said repeatedly--and my cosponsor of the USA FREEDOM Act, \nSenator Lee, agrees with me--that we would like to have a debate on our \nbill and consider amendments. Because opponents of reform have run out \nthe clock and jammed the Senate, we are not left with very much time.\n  Let's get this done today. If we pass the USA FREEDOM Act, the \nPresident could sign it tonight and the intelligence community could \nmove forward\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nwith the certainty it needs to protect the American people.\n  Some may argue that if you had a short-term extension--which, of \ncourse, we do not have--they have said: Well, maybe we could work out \nsome kind of a compromise bill. But let there be no misunderstanding: \nThe USA FREEDOM Act is a solid, carefully negotiated compromise. For \nall those Senators on either side of the aisle who have not spent the \nhours and hours and hours, as Senator Lee and I and our staffs have \nspent, maybe they do not know the work that went into this--again, how \nyou get groups from the left to the right supporting it.\n  It would be irresponsible to kick the can down the road once again, \nrelying on the false hope that the House will agree to pass a short-\nterm extension--something they said they will not do--and that we will \nsomehow be able to agree on a half-baked alternative that has yet to be \nintroduced in either body and most assuredly would not pass the House.\n  So do not be fooled or tempted by the promise of a short-term \nextension. That would guarantee nothing. Well, wait a minute. I take \nthat back. Passing a short-term extension does guarantee something: It \nguarantees the expiration of these authorities at midnight tonight. It \nguarantees more uncertainty, more litigation, more risk for the \nintelligence community, and a repeat of the chaotic brinksmanship later \non down the road with another manufactured crisis.\n  I know there are some who worry that the bill does not go far enough \nwhen it comes to reform. Well, then where were they in coming up with a \nbetter idea? If this passes, the USA FREEDOM Act would be the most \nsignificant set of reforms to government surveillance since the PATRIOT \nAct was enacted. The reason we are here to even debate it is that then-\nmajority leader Dick Armey in the House and I put in sunset provisions. \nSo we will have to show responsibility and vote, as the House did by a \n4-to-1 margin.\n  Our bill--Senator Lee's and my bill--would not just end the NSA's \nbulk collection under Section 215, it would add new transparency and \noversight reforms to other surveillance authorities, and it would be a \nsolid foundation upon which we could build our future reform efforts.\n  I have been in the Senate for more than 40 years. I have learned that \nwhen there is a chance to make real progress, we ought to seize it. But \nI also know we cannot let this be the end of our fight for greater \nprivacy protections, transparency, and accountability. I remain \ncommitted to fighting that fight on behalf of Vermonters and all \nAmericans.\n  So the choices before us this evening are clear: Either let these \nauthorities expire completely or pass the USA FREEDOM Act. There is no \nmore time for political maneuvering or fearmongering or scare tactics. \nIt is time for us to do our jobs--to debate and then to vote. Don't \nduck the vote. Vote up or down on the bill the House gave us. Stand up \nand be counted either for or against it. As Senators, let's have the \ncourage to do that.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act is a reasonable, responsible way forward, and we \nshould pass it tonight. But don't duck behind not doing anything and \npretend that is a solution. I don't think there is a single American, \nRepublican or Democrat, who would believe that was a responsible \nsolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am back here during an unprecedented \nSunday session hoping we can avoid a totally unnecessary disaster \ntonight; hoping we will do what is right for the country: Pass the USA \nFREEDOM Act today. Right now.\n  I will let others speak to the merits of the USA FREEDOM Act. It is \nour best opportunity to protect the Nation while balancing between \nprivacy and constitutional surveillance.\n  I do support reforming the Patriot Act, but I do not support \nunilateral disarmament of our Nation's need to know what bad guys with \npredatory intent are planning against the United States of America.\n  But my comments today are not about standing up for the USA FREEDOM \nAct.\n  I am here to stand up for the men and women working for the NSA, FBI, \nand other intelligence agencies essential to protecting our country \nagainst terrorist attacks--whether it is a ``lone wolf'' or state \nsponsored. These dedicated, patriotic intelligence professionals want \nto operate under rule of law that is constitutional, legal, and \nauthorized.\n  They are ready to do their jobs, but Congress needs to do our job and \npass a bill that is constitutional, legal, and authorized.\n  Ever since Edward Snowden made his allegations, the men and women of \nour intelligence agencies have been vilified as if they were the enemy. \nThey thought they were doing their jobs protecting us against the \nenemy.\n  Let me tell you--the men and women of the NSA, FBI, and our other \nintelligence agencies are patriots who have been wrongly vilified by \nthose who don't bother to inform themselves about our national security \nstructures and the vital functions they perform.\n  Now a special word about the NSA, which is headquartered in my home \nState of Maryland. The 30,000 men and women in the NSA serve in \nsilence--without public accolades. They protect us from cyber attacks. \nThey protect us against terrorist attacks. They support our \nwarfighters. They are Ph.D.'s and scientists. They are linguists, cyber \ngeeks, and whiz kids--the treasured human capital of this Nation.\n  Remember that section 215 is such a small aspect of what the NSA, \nFBI, and other intelligence agencies do as they stand sentry in cyber \nspace stopping attacks. People act like that is all NSA does. They \nhaven't even bothered to educate themselves as to legality and \nconstitutionality.\n  Congress passed the Patriot Act. President George W. Bush told us it \nwas constitutional. We need good intelligence. In a world of ISIL, \nNusra Front, and al Qaeda, the NSA is our front line of defense and the \npeople of NSA make up that front line.\n  There is no evidence of abuse by NSA employees. The men and women of \nNSA have adhered to the law. They have submitted to oversight, audits, \nchecks and balances, and reviews from Congress and the courts.\n  The employees of NSA know that everything has to be constitutional, \nlegal, and authorized. They thought they were implementing the law, but \nsome in the media and even some in this body have made them feel like \nthey were wrongdoers. I find this infuriating and insulting. Morale has \nbeen devastated at NSA. Families have been harassed for working at the \nNSA and their kids are bullied at school.\n  They have also been devastated by actions of their own government. \nFirst, by sequester--then, by the government shutdown. Now, by \nCongress's failure to reform national security authorities that help \nthem keep our country safe.\n  It is wrong. I want people to remember that tonight as we discuss \nimportant reforms. Let us not let them down, once again, with our own \nfailure to act.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is greatly disappointing that the \nSenate is in session today to reconsider a vote we took before the \nMemorial Day recess to extend the three expiring provisions of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Instead of passing the USA FREEDOM Act a week ago and sending it to \nthe President, we are now poised to take the measure up this coming \nweek, after the FISA authorities have expired. The result is that our \nintelligence agencies will lose important tools to protect against \nterrorist attacks. This is a self-inflicted harm, and one that was \ntotally unnecessary.\n  As I did a week ago, I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the USA FREEDOM Act, and I intend to vote for the \nlegislation through the upcoming procedural votes. The bill is not \nperfect, but it extends the business records, lone wolf, and roving \nwiretap provisions and it institutes some important reforms to FISA.\n  Unfortunately, what we have on the floor of the Senate tonight is \npolitical gamesmanship at its worst. We should have had this debate \nweeks or months ago, not up against the deadline. Failing that, the \nmajority should not have defeated this motion last week when it is \nprepared today to pass it.\n  We should skip the unnecessary delay of voting separately on the \nmotion to proceed, cloture on the bill, and on the bill itself. Clearly \nthere are 60 votes in\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nthis chamber to pass the USA FREEDOM Act, whether we do it today or if \nwe do it next week.\n  So the question comes: why not pass this bill today, reform the \nbusiness records provision of FISA, and keep important intelligence \nauthorities in effect? Unfortunately, the answer is that one Senator is \nholding this process hostage for his own political benefit. It is a \ntravesty, and it is unconscionable.\n  We remain a nation under threat of terrorism. Our allies remain under \nthreat of terrorism.\n  This is not hypothetical. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant--\nISIL--is seeking to recruit individuals to conduct attacks against the \nUnited States. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters have entered Iraq \nand Syria to join ISIL. There are hundreds of people inside the United \nStates right now that ISIL is seeking to inspire, direct, and assist in \ncarrying out an attack.\n  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula--AQAP--is developing non-metallic, \nundetectable bombs for use on U.S. airliners and is teaching people how \nto make such devices themselves. These groups are competing to be worst \nof the worst in international terrorism and they are coming after us.\n  We aren't sending thousands of troops to confront ISIL in Iraq and \nSyria or to stop AQAP in Yemen. We aren't going to diminish their \nthreats through partnership with local governments.\n  The only way we are going to stop attacks against the United States \nand our people is by collecting good intelligence. To me, that means we \nneed to do everything lawful and effective in intelligence to identify \nand thwart those attacks.\n  The roving wiretap provision is important. It says that the FBI \ndoesn't have to stop surveillance against a terrorist or a foreign spy \nwhen he buys a new cell phone or changes his email account. Having to \ndo so in today's world would be ridiculous.\n  The ``lone wolf'' provision is important. To be clear--it hasn't been \nused. But to be equally clear, never before have we faced the exact \nthreat that this provision was written to address: the threat of an \nindividual, inside this country, plotting to kill Americans without \ntraveling abroad and training with a terrorist group first.\n  The business records provision is important. It includes both routine \nrequests for records--hotel bills, car rentals, travel information--\nthat are regular parts of law enforcement and national security \ninvestigations. It also authorizes the NSA's phone metadata program. \nUnder this provision, the NSA gets information about phone calls to \ninclude the numbers on either end of the line, the time, and the \nduration of the call. It does not include the words that are spoken as \npart of the phone conversation, the identities of the people involved, \nor their location.\n  What it does is help the Intelligence Community know more about \npeople for whom there is a ``reasonable articulable suspicion'' of \nbeing tied to terrorist groups. If there is a terrorist in Syria \ntalking to Americans at home, we want to know that. If a phone number, \nfor example, in Garland, TX, is in touch with an ISIL operations chief, \nwe need to know. That information allows the FBI to go to a court for a \nprobable cause warrant to conduct electronic and physical surveillance \nof a suspect.\n  This program is conducted under strict oversight and operational \nlimitations. The number of people at NSA with access to the data is \nsmall--it was 22 in 2013. They have to get approval each time they do a \nquery of the phone records; today that approval comes from the FISA \nCourt. The query only returns information on what numbers were called \nby, and called, the phone number in question, and then a second hop \nfrom that number. There were 288 phone numbers approved for queries in \n2012, and those queries led to 12 probable cause warrants by the FBI.\n  The program is overseen within the NSA by multiple officials, \nincluding the inspector general and the privacy and civil liberties \nofficer. It is overseen by the Department of Justice, which reviews \nevery single query, and by the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence. It is overseen by the Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees of the House and the Senate, and it is overseen for \ncompliance purposes by the FISA Court.\n  So these are important tools that, because of Senate inaction and \nrecalcitrance, will expire tonight. As a result, we make ourselves more \nvulnerable.\n  I very much regret this situation that the Senate has created, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to quickly enact the USA \nFREEDOM Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also regret that we are where we are.\n\n\n                         Remembering Beau Biden\n\n  I would also like to defer for just a moment, before I make my \nremarks that I came to the floor to make, to add my condolences to Vice \nPresident Biden, his wife, and his family. I just learned the tragic \nnews this morning. Some may have known that Beau was dealing with a \nform of cancer. I did not know that. It came as a shock to hear that \ninformation.\n  Having served with the current Vice President in the U.S. Senate and \nhaving gotten to know him and his family, establishing a relationship--\na professional relationship as well as a friendship--I still cannot \nbegin to comprehend the grief that comes from the loss of a child. I \nknow there are Members in this body who have experienced that. I am \nfortunate that Marsha and I have not experienced that. But any parent's \nperhaps deepest fear is that they will outlive their children. That is \nnot the natural order of things. It is not how we think. And the grief \nthat comes from the death of a child, the death of a son or a daughter, \nis truly deep and has significant impact.\n  It was impossible not to feel the emotion and shed tears early this \nmorning in our home in Indianapolis when we heard the news. Our \ncondolences and deep sharing of grief that we can't even begin to fully \ncomprehend because we haven't had to deal with it--all of that comes \nacross. I think every Member of this body reaches out to them with our \nthoughts and our prayers as they go through this very tragic situation.\n  Mr. President, I am a little surprised to hear the Senator from \nVermont talking about how the Senate ought to just completely concede \nto whatever the House sends to the Senate. The fact is that we had a \nvery significant discussion and debate on this issue all week before \nthe Memorial Day break and it had gone on for months, if not years, \nbefore in the Intelligence Committee on which I serve and among Members \ngenerally.\n  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will have \nto deal with. It was drafted and spawned as a result of 9/11 when the \nAmerican people said: Are we doing everything we possibly can to \nprevent something such as this from happening again?\n  Congress debated extensively the PATRIOT Act and the tools the \nintelligence community suggested we give them the authority to use to \ntry to prevent that catastrophe from ever happening again and doing \neverything we could to prevent terrorist attacks. Along the way, there \nhave been modifications, and there have been changes.\n  Recently, there has been significant national debate over whether one \nof these many essential tools that help us gather the intelligence to \ntry to prevent and to understand the nature of the threat should be \nused. There clearly is a difference of opinion among Members here in \nthe Senate and even in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Senate \ndid pass a reform measure that I think is flawed, personally. I think \nit diminishes--it doesn't eliminate, but it diminishes and some even \nbelieve it eliminates the usefulness of this particular program. We \nwent back and forth on that for a significant part of the week before \nwe adjourned.\n  The Senator from Vermont comes to the floor and basically says: Look, \nthe House passed this; so therefore we ought to just go ahead and pass \nit. He said there was no other alternative presented, but that is not \nthe case. We had a procedural vote on the House bill, and we had a vote \non the bill to extend this program, so we can come spend a little more \ntime to try to figure out how best to deal with this issue. Neither of \nthose passed, indicating that the Senate did not have the same \nconsensus the House reached, which was a partial consensus. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about. We are not just a rubberstamp for the \nHouse.\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\n  What is really ironic is the fact that for 4 years, under Democratic \nleadership of this Senate, the House, under Republican leadership, sent \nus hundreds of pieces of legislation, and if we followed the admonition \nto us of the Senator from Vermont, we would have just rubberstamped \nthose. The House passed it, so why wouldn't we go forward? I don't \nthink that argument makes a lot of sense.\n  Senators are here to address issues in the U.S. Senate. Are there \nmany bills the House passes that I agree with? Yes. My party controls \nthe House. Are there bills here that I don't agree with that they have \npassed? Yes. We, as Senators, use our prerogative in terms of where we \nstand, and ultimately we take a vote and we either win or we lose. \nSometimes it coordinates with the House of Representatives and other \ntimes it doesn't, so then we go to conference and we pass an \nalternative. But to say there hasn't been debate relative to this \nprogram in the House-passed bill is simply not true.\n  Unfortunately, there has been such a significant misrepresentation of \nwhat this program is and what this program isn't, and that has caused a \nlot of angst which we are trying to deal with. Much of the public--at \nleast some portion of the public--is convinced that the government is \nlistening to every phone call they make. It has been said on this floor \nthat they are listening to all our phone calls, that they are \ncollecting all kinds of data. They know everything about us. That is \nthe furthest from the point of this program and the operation of this \nprogram that we can conceive of. Yet, a portion of the public has been \nled to believe that Big Government is in their bedroom, in their house, \nin their car, in their phone, and tracks them wherever they go; that \nthey are collecting everything about people, including what they buy at \nCostco and the movies people rent through Netflix. Private industry \ndoes collect that kind of stuff, but it is not the government. It is \nnot done under this program.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell my colleagues \nthat we have spent hundreds of hours dealing with this program to \nensure that it doesn't violate anyone's privacy. It has more oversight \nthrough all three branches of government. The executive branch, the \njudicial branch, and the legislative branch oversee this program. There \nare six layers within NSA itself that it has to go through, that \nattorneys have to look at, that legal experts have to look at before \nthey can even proceed to suspect and then take that suspicion to a \ncourt to have a judge say: Yes, you might have something here.\n  It has been said and it is true that unless a person's phone number \nis in communication with a foreign phone number that is at least \nstrongly suspected of belonging to a terrorist organization--and \nultimately the court has to make that decision--a member of Al Qaeda, \nISIS, or some group overseas that is attempting to do harm to the \nUnited States--why is this particular phone number--not the name of the \nperson who owns the phone number--why is this particular phone number \nbeing called by someone in Yemen or being called by what we strongly \nsuspect is a foreign operative through ISIS, Al Qaeda, Yemen, or other \npoints where we know terrorist activity is rampant?\n  There is a signal that comes up that matches phone numbers, and they \nsay: We better look into this. But before they can look into it, it has \nto be vetted by a court. It has to be taken to a FISA Court or an \nintelligence court and judged by that court as something viable to \npursue. At that point, it is similar to what a court would order if \nthere were a warrant to go and find more information to see whether \nthis suspicion actually is reality.\n  We read about it every day and we watch it on television--``Law and \nOrder'' and all the shows and so forth--about how law enforcement \nsuspects that this particular activity is a criminal organization or \nthis is a drug house or they have reason to believe the perpetrator of \nthe crime is this individual. They can't go raiding their house. They \ncan't go downloading information about them until they go to a court \nand receive approval from a judge saying: Yes, here you are, here is \nyour warrant. You can go and check this out.\n  Well, this intelligence program is based on the same principle; that \nis, nobody can collect any information on anybody unless that court \napproves that operation. Then it is turned over to the FBI, and they \nlook to see if it is the real thing. It is a tool that has been of \nimportance and has been a contribution to our ability to address the \npotential of terrorist threats and to thwart them before they happen. \nIt has always been used as a way of proving the negative; that is, no, \nthis is OK, we don't need to follow up on this.\n  The best example is the Boston bombing. When the Tsarnaev brothers' \nphone was accessed and it was run against the numbers, there was some \nsuspicion that additional terrorist activity would take place in New \nYork. It was proven that was not the case because there were no \nconnections made. So it became a valuable tool in that regard. Instead \nof shutting down New York, putting them on a high terrorist alert--\nperhaps the Nation's largest economy in operation there--we were able \nto quickly determine that wasn't the case.\n  In response to those who basically say this has never stopped a \nterrorist attack, two things: No. 1, this is one of the many methods we \nuse to collect the threads of intelligence that come from different \nsources to try to put together a mosaic or a puzzle as to whether this \nis something we need to deal with and take seriously. It is a major \npiece of that puzzle we obtain from the 215 program, which is the \ncollection of phone numbers. We do not collect the names of people who \nown those numbers. It is the collection of what is called metadata. It \nhas been described as simply the same data that is on our telephone \nbills that the Supreme Court has said is not a breach of the Fourth \nAmendment. It is not privileged for privacy purposes. It shows the date \nthe call was made, the duration of the call, the number that was \ncalled, and that is it. And those numbers are put into a system whereby \nwe can check against that a number that suspiciously is talking to a \nforeign operative in a foreign country. That then automatically \ntriggers that you better look at this--it is kind of a ping--you better \nlook at this one. Nobody has access, at this point, to any content \nrelated to the name of the individual until it reaches a level of \nsuspicion that is vetted through six layers of oversight and then is \nsent to a court that looks at it to say: We agree with you or we don't \nagree with you. And if we agree with you, then it is the FBI who is \nalerted that they better look into this.\n\n  Now, there has never been a time since 9/11 when we have dealt with a \nhigher threshold than we currently are dealing with. You hear about it \nevery day. You read about it every day. ISIS has recruited more than \n20,000, it is estimated--significantly more than that are those from 90 \ndifferent foreign countries. It has made a direct threat toward the \nUnited States and its citizens. It is sponsoring and encouraging \nindividuals to not only come over and train and join ISIS and then come \nback here and wreak havoc on the American people; it is also inspiring \nthose, saying if you don't want to travel over here, just go out and \nkill somebody. Join the jihad from afar. You can be a part of what we \nare trying to accomplish simply by doing your own thing. We saw that \nhappen down in Texas. We will see that in other places as people are \ninspired through ISIS, for whatever sick reason, to take up arms, to \ncause destruction, and to randomly kill and wreak havoc on the American \npublic.\n  It has been offered that the House fix--the reform, which did have \nbipartisan support and did pass the House without a lot of debate--is \nthe solution to this problem. Some agree it goes too far; some agree it \ndoesn't go far enough. But there are problems with that particular \nFREEDOM Act, which the Senator from Vermont says is the golden grail \nhere and will solve all the problems.\n  It is clear, and it is the testimony we have received from numerous \nofficials in the counterterrorism business and in the intelligence \nbusiness, that there are issues with this so-called FREEDOM Act fix \nthat could render--well, No. 1, that do render the program less \neffective and could render it totally inoperative.\n  The fact that the NSA has not yet been able to come up with a program\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nwhich would ensure that we could have the kind of collection we need in \nthe timeframe we need it--some of this is urgent, some of this is \npending, some of this is imminent, and it already goes through layers \nthat delay coming to a conclusion and this adds more.\n  Also, they have indicated the system is untested and exists in name \nonly. We don't know how the new program would be implemented and we \ndon't know how it would be operated. That is why many of us said: Look, \nfor whatever reason, yes, we are at this point, and, yes, it expires at \nmidnight. What we were trying to do before we left was get a short-term \nextension. We were negotiating. We think it should have been for a \nsignificant amount of time, until NSA could test out its program, but \nwe were willing to go much less than that so we could have an \nopportunity to come back and debate this further and get to the bottom \nof some of the misrepresented information that has been sent out to the \nAmerican people and have an opportunity to counter that and also work \ntogether to find ways, through working with the House of \nRepresentatives, to come up with a more effective bill that wouldn't \nput the country in more jeopardy or, as some experts have said, would \nundermine the entire program.\n  We obviously will be less agile with the House bill. It requires an \nexpansive regulatory system to amass the level of oversight over the \ncurrent program. I think the real problem is it requires no data \nretention mandate. The USA FREEDOM Act does not require companies to \nhold the data sought by the government. Therefore, the USA FREEDOM Act \ncould be operationally useless as companies update their business model \nin response to changes in technology or market demand. The telephone \ncompanies--all 1,400 of them--many don't want to go through the \nexpensive process of the oversight they need to have in the process. \nThey want to sell phones. And they are hearing a lot from customers who \nbasically say: I don't want to buy your phone if it is going to be \nsubject to them listening to everything I do and say--being collected.\n  Well, first of all, that is factually wrong, but it is an error that \nhas been said over and over on this floor by some Members. That is \nabsolutely wrong. It is false. If we are going to go forward here, we \nneed intellectual honesty about what the program is and what it isn't, \nand it shouldn't be labeled as something it isn't. I will address that \nat a later point in time.\n  But the USA FREEDOM Act, by not allowing retention for a fixed period \nof time, also lessens our ability to make this program effective. So I \nhave much more to say on this, and I know we are going into caucus as a \nparty to see how we might go forward, given where we are.\n  It was not necessary that we be here on a Sunday with the clock \nticking toward midnight. We could have continued or we could have gone \nforward without getting to this particular point in time. But now we \nwill have the opportunity--and, unfortunately, what it looks like is we \nwill have the opportunity to debate this while the program expires.\n  That is a bet I didn't want to take--the bet being that nothing will \nhappen if we don't have this tool in the amount of time that is going \nto be taken to now address this. That is running a risk I am not sure \nMembers want to take. I don't want to be part of somebody who says this \nisn't important enough; therefore, we will let it expire and we will \nnot extend it for a day or an hour or a month or a sufficient amount of \ntime to come to a reasonable conclusion as to how we retain this very \nimportant intelligence-gathering tool to keep us safe from terrorists. \nTo go dark on this is a risk of Americans' lives. It is a risk that we \nare taking, and we are going to be responsible for our vote, whatever \nthat vote is. I, personally, don't want the responsibility of saying: \nOh, don't worry. Nothing is going to happen out there. The hundreds of \nhours that I spend in the Intelligence Committee tells me there is a \nlot that can happen out there.\n  Members have every right, if they are not on that committee--every \nright to access what we access. We have invited people to come down and \nsee it for themselves, so they at least understand what it is and what \nit isn't. To my knowledge, only two have taken us up on that. There may \nbe more I have missed. But some of those who have stated this program \nin a totally false way have the siren song to the people out there who \nthink Big Government is in their bedroom, Big Government is taking \nevery piece of information they have about themselves, and Big \nGovernment is storing this and ``listening to all your phone calls.'' \nThat is a bunch of hokum and it is wrong.\n  And for those who refuse to stand up and acknowledge that--because \nthey have had access to the program and refused to take that access--\nhave to bear the responsibility of sowing this wild theory and idea \nabout Big Government in your bedroom and Big Government in your car and \nBig Government on your phone and Big Government collecting your emails \nand Big Government doing everything and storing it until the time that \nBig Government will come and take everything away from you.\n  I didn't come here to do that and this Senate isn't here to do that \nand we will not do that. That is why this program has more oversight \nthan any other program in the entire United States Government, and we \nwill put more oversight on there if that is necessary. I will stay up \nall night and stand over at NSA and make sure they are not listening to \nyour phone calls. But it is irresponsible misrepresentation--\nirresponsible misrepresentation--to factually state a falsity and not \ntell the truth.\n  It is time we told the truth and it is time we stood up to this thing \nand make sure we are doing everything we can to protect Americans from \nthreats of a lot of people and a lot of organizations that want to kill \nus all, that would like to see our heads on the chopping block. This is \nreal in our country, as people who are trained by ISIS not only flock \nback here from Syria, but they inspire people here to pick up weapons \nand do harm to the American people.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona has a question.\n  Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. I have not yielded the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order, and I want to \nask the Senator from Indiana a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for \na question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe the Senator from Kentucky should know the rules of \nthe Senate, that the Senator from Indiana has the floor and the \ngentleman is open to respond to a question.\n  My question to the Senator from Indiana--and I want to say that his \nwords are powerful and accurate.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the clock for the \nRepublican side?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator from Indiana if he has seen--\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Chair has made very clear that the \nSenator from Indiana has the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I know the Senator from Kentucky understands that when a Senator has \nthe floor, they are entitled to speak because he has used that rule \nhimself.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Twice the Senator from Kentucky has not observed the \nrules of the Senate.\n  I would ask the Senator from Indiana, you have seen the events lately \nthat are transpiring. ISIS has taken Palmyra. They are in the streets \nburning bodies, killing people, going to destroy 2,000-year-old \nantiquities, and at the same time Ramadi has fallen with thousands of \ninnocent men, women, and children being massacred. At this time, isn't \nthis program as critical as it has ever been since its inception, given \nthe fact that the Middle East is literally on fire and we are losing \neverywhere?\n  Mr. COATS. It is more essential than ever, in response to the \nquestion from the Senator from Arizona. It is more necessary than ever, \nas we have seen a higher threat level since 9/11. Of course, we didn't \nknow what the threat was in 9/11, so I don't know how far we have to\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\ngo back. But our intelligence today, whether it is any aspect of any of \nour intelligence agencies, they are sounding the alarm that we need to \nbe as vigilant as possible. We need to, within the law--and we are \noperating within the law--use every tool possible to try to stop an \nattack on the American people. What happened on 9/11 was a catastrophe \nthat none of us could have comprehended. A 9/11 with the possession of \nnuclear, radioactive, biological or chemical weapons would make New \nYork look like just a small incident. It would be 3 million people \ninstead of 3,000 people. I think we have an obligation to do what we \ncan without invading anyone's privacy.\n  What we are trying to find is this balance between protecting privacy \nand protecting ourselves from terrorist attacks--protecting Americans \nfrom terrorist attacks. We have done this with this program. If what \nhas been said about this program were true, if the falsehoods that have \nbeen said were true, I would be the first to line up and say: No, we \ncan't breach the privacy of the American people by doing what they are \ndoing. But the fact is none of it is true. There has not been one act \nof abuse of this program over the years it has been in place. It has \nmore oversight and layers of oversight. As former Attorney General \nMukasey said: For the government to violate and bypass this, it would \nmake Watergate look like kindergarten activity. It would be a \nconspiracy that would include hundreds of people, and they would all \nhave to swear that they would not breach their conspiratorial process \nhere--a program that is overseen by the Judiciary Committee, by the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee, the \nbody of the Senate has access to this and the body of the House--that \nis 535 people--by the executive branch, a program that was endorsed by \nBarack Obama, until he changed his mind, apparently, because the public \nwas going the other way based on false information. People are out here \nbasically making the accusations that they are making to try to take \nthis program down and all we are trying to do is work with the House to \nfind a reasonable way of keeping this tool alive--keeping Americans \nsafe.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend?\n  Under the previous order, all time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, my understanding is there is still 5 minutes \nremaining on the opposition side. I request that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how can we have an objection when we already \nhave a consent agreement that says we have 30 minutes of equally \ndivided time and you still have 5 minutes remaining on the opposite \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was divided in the usual form, and \nthe time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the time could not have been divided \nequally, because apparently somebody must have given one side more time \nthan the other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of time that was allotted to the \nDemocratic side was unused, and it was equally divided at 23 minutes \napiece.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I was here for 30 minutes of the Republican \nside speaking. I sat at my seat for 30 minutes. It was not 23 minutes \nof equally divided time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regular order--obviously people don't know \nthe rules of the Senate. Maybe they should learn them.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I request the remaining 5 minutes of time on \nthe opposite side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I challenge the ruling of the Chair and \nrequest the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. PAUL. I request a live quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes--the 5 minutes that was remaining on the opposition side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let us be very clear about why we are here \nthis evening. We are here this evening because this is an important \ndebate. This is a debate over the Bill of Rights. This is a debate over \nthe Fourth Amendment. This is a debate over your right to be left \nalone. Justice Brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the \nmost cherished of rights. The right to be left alone is the most prized \nto civilized men.\n  Let us be clear. We are here tonight because the President continues \nto conduct an illegal program. The President has been rebuked by the \ncourt. In explicit terms, the President has been told that the program \nhe is conducting is illegal. Now, the President opines on television. \nThe President wants to blame--he says: Anybody but me.\n  But you know what. The President started this program without \ncongressional permission. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act say that \nthe PATRIOT Act in no way gives authority to the President to collect \nall of your phone records all of the time. If there ever was a general \nwarrant, if there ever was a generalized collection of information from \npeople about whom there is no suspicion, this is it.\n  We are not collecting the information of spies. We are not collecting \nthe information of terrorists. We are collecting all American citizens' \nrecords all of the time. This is what we fought the Revolution over. \nAre we going to so blithely give up our freedom? Are we going to so \nblithely go along and just say: Take it. Well, I am not going to take \nit anymore. I do not think the American people are going to take it \nanymore.\n  Eighty percent of those under 40 say we have gone too far--that this \nwhole collection of all of our records all the time is too much. The \ncourt has said: How can records be relevant to an investigation that \nhas not started? The court has said that even under these lower \nstandards, even under these standards of saying that it would be \nrelevant, all of the stuff they are collecting is precisely irrelevant.\n  Now people say: Well, they are not looking at it. They are not \nlistening to it. It is the tip of the iceberg, what we are talking \nabout here. Realize that they were dishonest about the program until we \ncaught them. They kept saying over and over: We are not doing this. We \nare not collecting your records.\n  They were. The head of the intelligence agency lied to the American \npeople, and he still works there. We should be upset. We should be \nmarching in the streets and saying: He has to go. We cannot allow this. \nWe cannot allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we live in an \narbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want \nanytime they want.\n  This is the tip of the iceberg. They are collecting records through \nExecutive order. They are collecting records through section 702. \nPeople say: How will we protect ourselves without these programs? What \nabout using the Constitution? What about using judicial warrants? About \nthe Tsarnaev boy, the Boston Bomber, they say: How will we look at his \nphone records? Get a warrant. Put his name on it. You can get a \nwarrant. There is no reason in the world--the guy had already bombed \nus. Do you think anybody was going to turn down a warrant? We should \nhave gotten a warrant before.\n  Get warrants on people we have suspicion on. The Simpson guy that was \nshot in Garland had already been arrested. We had suspicion.\n  Let's hire 1,000 more FBI agents. Let's hire people to do the \ninvestigation and quit wasting time on innocent American people. Let's \nbe very clear why we are here: President Obama set up this program, the \nPresident Obama who once was against the PATRIOT Act. President Obama \nonce said: You know what; we should have judges write warrants.\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\n  President Obama, who once believed in the Fourth Amendment, is the \nPresident who is now scooping up all of your records illegally. Then he \nfeigns concern and says: Oh, we need to pass this new bill. He could \nstop it now. Why won't someone ask the President: Why do you continue? \nWhy won't you stop this program now?

The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the recess, I tried to get a \nshort-term extension of three provisions that\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\nwill expire at midnight tonight: section 215, business records; section \n206, roving wiretap authority; and the ``lone wolf'' provision. \nUnfortunately, those efforts were unsuccessful.\n  ``Lone wolf'' and roving wiretap are not--I repeat, not--the subject \nof controversy with the House bill. So I would propose that we extend \nat least the ``lone wolf'' and the roving wiretap authorities while we \ncontinue to litigate the differing views on section 215. More \nspecifically, I would propose that we extend those two provisions--\n``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps--for up to 2 weeks.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at \nthe desk, to extend the expiring provisions relating to ``lone wolf'' \nand roving wiretaps for 2 weeks, and that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the \npromises that was given when the PATRIOT Act was originally passed was \nthat, in exchange for allowing a less than constitutional standard, we \nwould only use the actions against----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PAUL. Terrorists and against foreigners. We found that 99 percent \nof the time, section 213 is used for domestic crime. I believe that no \nsection of the PATRIOT Act should be passed unless our targets are \nterrorists--not Americans.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky----\n  Mr. COTTON. Regular order.\n  Mr. PAUL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, I proposed giving the \nIntelligence Committee the time it would need to work toward the kind \nof bipartisan legislative compromise Americans deserve--a compromise \nthat would preserve important counterterrorism tools necessary to \nprotect American lives. That effort was blocked.\n  Just now, I proposed an even narrower extension that would have only \nextended some of the least controversial--least controversial--but \nstill critical tools to ensure they do not lapse as Senators work \ntoward a more comprehensive legislative outcome. But even that very \nnarrow offer was blocked. I think it should be worrying for our country \nbecause the nature of the threat we face is very serious. It is \naggressive, it is sophisticated, it is geographically dispersed, and it \nis not--not--going away.\n  As the LA Times reported, ``the Obama administration has dramatically \nstepped up warnings of potential terrorist attacks on American soil \nafter several years of relative calm.'' The paper reported that this is \noccurring in the wake of ``FBI arrests of at least 30 Americans on \nterrorism-related charges this year in an array of `lone wolf' plots.''\n  So these aren't theoretical threats. They are not theoretical \nthreats. They are with us every day. We have to face up to them. We \nshouldn't be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more \nsophisticated and aggressive, and we certainly should not be doing so \nbased on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the \nwake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden, who was last seen in \nRussia.\n  The opponents of this program have not been able to provide any--\nany--examples of the NSA abusing the authorities provided under section \n215. And the record will show that, in fact, there has not been one \ndocumented instance of abuse of it.\n  I think it is also important to remember that the contents of calls \nare not captured. That is the general view, but it is an incorrect one. \nI will say it again: The contents of calls are not captured. I say this \nto the American people: If you have been told that, that is not \ncorrect. That is what I mean about a campaign of disinformation. The \nonly things in question are the number dialed, the number from which \nthe call was made, the length of the call, and the date. That is it. \nThat is it. Detailed oversight procedures have been put in place, too, \nin order to protect the privacy of Americans.\n  Now, I believe this is a program that strikes a critical balance \nbetween privacy on the one hand and national security on the other. \nThat doesn't mean the Senate still shouldn't have the opportunity to \nmake some changes to it. That is precisely the outcome I had been \nhoping to facilitate by seeking several short-term extensions. And \nconsidering all that has come to light about the House-passed bill in \nrecent weeks, I believe this was more than reasonable.\n  The administration's inability to answer even the most basic \nquestions about the alternate bulk data system it would have to build \nunder that legislation is, to say the least, pretty troubling--pretty \ntroubling. And that is not just my view. That is the view of many in \nthis body, including colleagues who have been favorably predisposed to \nthe House bill.\n  In particular, I know Senators from both parties have been disturbed \nby the administration's continuing inability to guarantee whether the \nnew system would work as well as the current one or whether there would \neven be any data available to analyze. While the administration has let \nit be known that this nonexistent system could only be built in time if \ntelephone providers cooperated in building it, providers have made it \nabundantly clear that they are not going to commit to retaining the \ndata. They are not going to commit to retaining the data for any period \nof time unless legally required to do so, and there is no such \nrequirement in the House-passed bill--none at all.\n  Here is how one provider put it: ``[We are] not prepared to commit to \nvoluntarily retain documents for any particular period of time pursuant \nto the proposed USA Freedom Act if not required by law''--if not \nrequired by law.\n  Now, these are just a few of the reasons I thought it prudent to try \nto give the Senate more space to advance better legislation through \ncommittee consideration and regular order, with input from both sides. \nBut, my colleagues, it is now clear that will not be possible in the \nface of a determined opposition from those who simply wish to end the \ncounterterrorism program altogether. No time to try to improve the \nHouse-passed bill will be allowed because some would like to end the \nprogram altogether.\n  So this is where we find ourselves. This is the reality. So it \nessentially leaves us with two options. Option one is to allow the \nprogram to expire altogether without attempting to replace it. That \nwould mean disarming completely and arbitrarily, based on a campaign of \ndisinformation, in the face of growing, aggressive, and sophisticated \nthreats--growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats. That is a \ntotally unacceptable outcome--a completely and totally unacceptable \noutcome. So we won't be doing that.\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\n  So we are left with option two, the House-passed bill. It is \ncertainly not ideal. But along with votes on some modest amendments \nthat attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised, it is \nnow the only realistic way forward. So I remain determined to continue \nworking toward the best outcome for the American people possible under \nthe circumstances.\n  This is where we are, colleagues. We have the House-passed bill with \nsome serious flaws and an inability to get a short-term extension to \ntry to improve the House-passed bill in the way we normally do this--\nthrough some kind of consultative process.\n  So bearing that in mind, I move to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider vote No. 194, the vote by which cloture was not invoked on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 2048.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Chair inform me when I have 5 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, tonight begins the process of ending bulk \ncollection. The bill will ultimately pass. We always look for silver \nlinings. I think the bill may be replacing one form of bulk collection \nwith another, but the government, after this bill passes, will no \nlonger collect our phone records. My concern is that the phone \ncompanies still may do the same thing. Currently, my understanding is \nthe NSA is at the phone company sucking up the phone records and \nsending them to Utah. My concern is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Senate, please. The Senator \ndeserves to be heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. My concern is that under the new program, the records will \nstill be sucked up into NSA computers, but the computers will be at the \nphone company, not in Utah. So the question is, Will it be a \ndistinction without a difference? The question also will be, Will this \nbe individualized?\n  One of the issues about the Fourth Amendment that was the biggest \npart of the Fourth Amendment for our Founding Fathers was that a \nwarrant should be individualized. General warrants were what we fought \nthe Revolution over. James Otis fought a famous case in the 1760s, and \nhe fought against the British soldiers writing their own warrants.\n  What is interesting is that part of the PATRIOT Act allows our police \nto write their own warrants. We have something called national security \nletters. These have been done by the hundreds of thousands. \nInterestingly, when the President was in the Senate, he was opposed to \nnational security letters and said that they should have judicial \nwarrants. Now, it is interesting that in this bill that will pass, it \nis supported by the President, supported by the Director of National \nIntelligence, and now supported in a wide bipartisan fashion.\n  It concerns me whether or not----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Will the Senator please suspend.\n  The Senate will be in order. Please take your conversations out of \nthe well, out of the Chamber. The Senator deserves to be heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. It concerns me that the President, who supports the bulk \ndata collection and has been performing it illegally for 6 years, now \nsupports this bill. The devil is in the details.\n  The question is, Will the new bill still allow bulk collection by the \nphone companies? Will they be able to put into the search engine not an \nindividual about whom we have suspicion but an entire corporation? This \nis what was revealed when we saw the warrant that had Tsarnaev's name \non it.\n  The Director of National Intelligence came before the American \npeople, came before Congress and swore under oath that they weren't \ndoing this. Part of my problem with the intelligence-gathering in our \ncountry is it is hard for me to have trust. It is hard for me to have \ntrust in the people to whom we are giving great power.\n  They also insist we won't be able to catch terrorists. They insist \nthe bulk collection allowed them to catch terrorists. But then it \nturned out, when it was investigated, when we looked at the classified \ndocuments, when the President's bipartisan privacy and civil liberties \ncommission looked at this, when his review board looked at this, and \nthen when the Department of Justice inspector general looked at this,\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\nthey all found that there was no unique data, there was no great \ndiscovery, there was no great breaking up of a terrorist ring.\n  People have brought up the Boston Bomber, the Tsarnaev boy. They say: \nWell, we need this. We need the PATRIOT Act after the bombing to get \nhis phone records.\n  That is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. He has already \ncommitted a bombing. In fact, I think he was dead at that point, and \nthey are saying we couldn't get a warrant to look at his phone records? \nIt is absolutely absurd.\n  I had a meeting with somebody from the intelligence community about 6 \nmonths ago, and I asked them this question: How do we get more \ninformation about terrorists--with a warrant with their name on it, \nwhere we can go as deep into the details as we want, or this metadata \ncollection that uses a less-than-constitutional standard? And he said: \nWithout question, we get more information with a warrant than we do \nthrough the metadata.\n  When someone commits an act of atrocity, there is no question we \nwould get a warrant, but I would go even further. I would say that I \nwant to get more warrants on people before they blow up things. I would \nsay that we need more money spent on FBI agents analyzing data and \ntrying to find out whom we have suspicion about so we can investigate \ntheir records. I think we spend so much money on people about whom \nthere is no suspicion that we don't have enough time and money left to \ngo after the people who would actually harm us.\n  The people who argue that the world will end at midnight tonight----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend.\n  Order in the Chamber. Please take your conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. The people who argue that the world will end and that we \nwill be overrun by jihadists tonight are trying to use fear. They want \nto take just a little bit of our liberty, but they get it by making us \nafraid. They want us to fear and give up our liberty. They tell us that \nif we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. That is a far cry \nfrom the standard we were founded upon--innocent until proven guilty.\n  One of the objections I tried to bring forward earlier but was \ninterrupted repeatedly was that the PATRIOT Act was originally intended \nto go after foreigners and terrorists. We allowed a less-than-\nconstitutional standard. We didn't ask for probable cause; we just said \nit had to be relevant, the information had to be relevant to an \ninvestigation about terrorists. But here is the problem, and this is \none of the big problems I have with the PATRIOT Act.\n  We now use parts of the PATRIOT Act to arrest people for domestic \ncrime. Section 213, sneak-and-peek, where the government can come into \nyour house, place listening devices, never announce they were ever in \nyour house, and then leave and monitor your behavior and never let you \nknow they were there, is being used 99.5 percent of the time for \ndomestic crime.\n  So, little by little, we have allowed our freedom to slip away. We \nallowed the Fourth Amendment to be diminished. We allowed the narrowing \nloss of something called probable cause.\n  People say: Well, how would we get terrorists with that?\n  The vast majority of warrants are approved in our country--the vast \nmajority of warrants that are Fourth Amendment warrants where we \nindividualized and put a name on it and asked probable cause. If \ntonight the police are looking for a rapist or a murderer, they will go \nto the house, and if they suspect the person is inside but nothing is \nimminently happening, they will stand on the curb and they almost \nalways get a warrant.\n  Do you think there is a judge in this land who would not grant a \nwarrant--particularly after the Boston bombing--to look at the Tsarnaev \nbrothers' records? There is not a judge in the land who would say no. I \nwould venture to say that in advance there is not much chance that a \njudge would say no if you went to them and said: The Russians have \ngiven us indication and evidence that he has been radicalized and has \nassociated overseas with people who are training to attack us.\n  There is no reason why the Constitution can't be used. But we just \nhave to not let those who are in power make us cower in fear. They use \nfear to take your freedom, and we have to be very, very careful of \nthis.\n  Now, some are saying I am misrepresenting this, that I am saying the \ngovernment is listening to your phone calls. I am saying they are \ncollecting your phone records. There are programs, though, in which \nthere may be looking at content--emails, for example. The current law \nsays that after 6 months even the content of your email has no \nprotection. We have a very good piece of legislation to try to fix \nthat. But realize that those who are loud, those who are really wanting \nyou to give up your freedom, don't believe the Fourth Amendment \nprotects your records at all.\n  And this is a big debate. We went to the court. The Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals--the highest court in the land just below the Supreme \nCourt--said that what they are doing is illegal, but we don't yet have \na ruling on whether it is constitutional.\n  One of my fears about the bill we are going to pass--the sort of in-\nbetween step some think may be better--is that it could moot the case. \nThis means the court case will never get heard by the Supreme Court. I \nhave a court case against the NSA. There is another district court that \nhas ruled against the NSA. We now have an appellate ruling against the \nNSA. The court may well look at the activity of the Senate and say: \nWell, you guys have fixed the problem. We don't need to look at it \nanymore. It is no longer relevant.\n  My other concern about this new bill that is going to pass is that \nthe same people will judge it who judged the previous system. These \npeople are called the rubberstamp courtroom, also known as FISA. \nRealize that the FISA Court is the court that said the collection of \nall Americans' records is relevant. The appellate court basically \nlaughed at this notion and said that it sort of destroys any meaning to \nthe word ``relevant'' if you collect everybody's records. It is not \neven a modifier. Instead of saying ``relevant,'' they should have said \n``You can have everyone's records all the time.''\n  One of my other concerns about the in-between solution we are going \nto choose is that some are conjecturing--and you have to be suspicious \nof a government that often lies about their purpose--some are \nconjecturing that they are going to collect more phone data under the \nnew system. One of the complaints last week, as there was discussion \nabout this--in the newspaper, it was reported that really they were \nonly collecting about 20 to 30 percent of your cell phone data. They \nwere trying to collect all of your land line data, but they weren't for \nsome reason collecting all of your cell phone data. One of my concerns \nis that as we go to this new system, they may actually be better at \ncollecting our phone records and they may well be able to collect all \nof our cell phone data.\n  Unless we go to a system where we individualize the warrants, unless \nwe go to a system where a person's name is on the warrant, I am going \nto be very, very concerned.\n  Now, we will present amendments on this bill. We tried to negotiate \nto be allowed to present amendments, but there wasn't a lot of \nnegotiating that went on in the last week--in fact, there was none. We \nwill still try. We will put amendments forward, and we will try to get \namendments to make the bulk collection less bad when it does occur. One \nof the things we would like to do is to say that when they search the \nphone records, they can't put the name of a corporation in there; they \nwould have to put in an individual's name.\n  It is kind of tricky, the way these things are worded. The wording of \nthis bill will say they can only put a U.S. person into the selector \nterm to search all phone records. The problem is that they define \n``U.S. person'' as also meaning corporation or association or grouping. \nSo there is a little bit of looseness to the language. So if we are \nstill going to allow corporations, what is to stop them from going back \nand putting AT or Verizon in the selection? Once again they will be \nlooking at all the phone records, and all we will have done is \ntransferred the phone records from government control in Utah to phone \ncompany control in another location. Will we be trading bulk collection \nin Utah for bulk collection under the phone companies?\n  There are good people who believe this bill will reform, and I think \nthey\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\nare well-intended. I think they are good people who really think that \nwe will end bulk collection and that it won't happen. My fear, though, \nis of the people who interpret this work at a place known as the \nrubberstamp factory over at FISA. It is a secret court, and it is a \ncourt in which 99.5 percent of the time they approve warrants. Warrants \nare simply rubberstamped over there. In fact, they approved that \n``relevant'' meant all of your records. So my question is, If they put \nAT as a selector item, will we have the same thing, just in a \ndifferent location?\n  I have several amendments I am interested in if we are able to amend \nthe bill.\n  One is that the search would have to be an individual. That is more \nconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.\n  Another one would change the standard to the constitutional standard, \nwhich would be that there would have to be probable cause, which is a \nhigher standard than simply saying it is relevant. Then we would \nactually be sending a new signal to the FISA Court.\n  Another amendment I have, which I think would go a long way toward \nmaking the PATRIOT Act less bad--I think is the best way to put it--\nwould be to say that any information gathered under a less-than-\nconstitutional standard could only be used for foreigners and \nterrorists. See, that was the promise. At the time, there were people \nwho opposed the PATRIOT Act--not enough, but there were a few--and when \nthey opposed the PATRIOT Act, they said their fear was that it would be \nused against American citizens.\n  They said: No, no, we are only going after terrorists. But the law \nallows them to do it, and we now have sections of the PATRIOT Act which \n99.5 percent of the time are being used for domestic crime. We have \nalso seen that the Drug Enforcement Agency--it is alleged--is using \ninformation gathered under the PATRIOT Act to then go back and recreate \ncases against people for domestic crime.\n  The question we have to ask ourselves is, Are we so frightened that \nwe are willing to give up our freedom? Are we really willing to trade \nliberty for security?\n  I think the U.S. Court of Appeals had some great points that they \nmade when they ruled against the government, and I think what is \nimportant to know is that the President has continued to do this \nillegally. You have seen him on television. The President has been \nsaying: Well, Congress is just getting in the way. If Congress would \njust do their job and get rid of this, everything would be OK. But the \ntruth is that Congress never authorized this. Even the authors of the \nPATRIOT Act said this was not something Congress ever even \ncontemplated. The court is now saying that as well. This was done by \nthe executive branch--admittedly, both a Republican executive branch \nand a Democratic executive branch--but this wasn't created by Congress.\n  So when the President says ``Well, Congress should just do this,'' \nthe question that has never been asked by anyone in the media is ``Why \ndoesn't he stop it?'' Everybody who has given advice has said he would, \nand he will come out and say he believes in a balanced solution, but he \nreally is just abdicating the solution and has never discontinued the \nprogram, even when he has been told explicitly by the court that the \nprogram is an illegal program.\n  This is what the U.S. court of appeals said in the case ACLU v. \nClapper:\n\n       We agree with the appellants that such an expansive concept \n     of ``relevance'' is unprecedented and unwarranted. . . . The \n     records demanded are not those of suspects under \n     investigation, or of people or businesses that have contact \n     with such subjects, or of people or businesses that have \n     contact with others who are in contact with the subjects.\n\n  So even two steps removed, we are gathering records that are \ncompletely irrelevant to the investigation. We are gathering up the \nphone records of innocent Americans.\n  The other side will say: Well, we are not looking at them.\n  So I have been thinking about this. Our Founders objected to the \nBritish soldiers writing warrants. They objected to them coming into \ntheir house and grabbing their papers. Do you think our Framers would \nhave been happy if the British Government said: OK, we are just \nbreaking your door down, we are just getting your papers, but we are \nnot going to look at them. Do you think that would have changed the \nmindset of the Framers? So the fact that they say they are not looking \nat our records--is that any comfort or should it be any comfort? The \nact of violation is in taking your records. The act of violation is in \nallowing the police or a form of the police--the FBI--to write warrants \nthat are not signed by a judge.\n  The court goes on to say: ``The interpretation that the government \nasks us to adopt defies any limiting principle.'' The idea of a \nlimiting principle when the court looks at things is that, the way I \nsee it, is the difference between something being arbitrary, where \nthere is no sort of principle that confines what would happen--if you \nhave a law that has no limiting principle, it is essentially arbitrary.\n  This is what Hayek wrote about in ``The Road to Serfdom.'' Hayek \ntalked about the difference between the rule of law and having an \narbitrary interpretation of the law.\n  The danger of having an arbitrary interpretation of the law and the \ndanger of having general warrants is that they have been used in the \npast with bias. People have brought their own bias into this. In the \nsixties, the bias was against civil rights activists and against \nVietnam war activists. In the forties, the bias was in incarcerating \nand interring Japanese Americans. But what was consistent in all of \nthese circumstances was that there was a generalization--a \ngeneralization based on the color of your skin, whether you were Asian \nAmerican or African American, and also about the shade of your \nideology. There is a danger in allowing the government to generalize \nwithout suspicion and to disobey the Fourth Amendment, and the danger \ncomes that the government could one day generalize and bias could enter \ninto things.\n  We have on our records right now laws that allow an American citizen \nto be detained. It is not specifically a part of the PATRIOT Act, but \nit is along the same lines as this, that you are getting rid of the due \nprocess amendments and the ability of the Bill of Rights to protect an \nindividual. When we allow an individual to be detained without a trial, \nwhat happens is that there is the possibility that someone could decide \nwe don't like ``those'' people. And when you say that could never \nhappen, think about the times in our history when it has.\n  Richard Jewell, everybody said he was the Olympic Bomber. He was \nconvicted on TV. Within hours, people said: Richard Jewell is guilty. \nThink about if he had been a Black man in 1920 in the South what may \nhave happened to him. Think about the possibility for bias entering \ninto our government. Think about what Madison said about government \nis--Madison said that we restrain government because we are worried \nthat government may not be comprised of angels. If government were \ncomprised of angels, we would not have to worry about restraining \ngovernment.\n  Patrick Henry said that the Constitution was about restraining \ngovernment, not the people. It is not enough for people to say: Oh, I \nam a good man or I am a good person or the NSA would never do this. The \nother problem that makes us doubtful is that the NSA has not been \nhonest with us. If they want to develop trust again, the President \nshould have immediately let the person who lied to us go, the Director \nof National Intelligence.\n  The appeals court concluded by saying that the government's bulk \ncollection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of what Congress has \nauthorized and therefore violates section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Some \nwill try to argue that this debate was not worth the time we took on \nit. I could not disagree more. I am like everybody else. You know, I \nprize my time with my family and being at home on the weekends. I wish \nwe would have done this in a more sensitive way, where we would have \nhad more time and had an open amendment process.\n  But we waited until the end. We waited until the final deadline. This \nis a characteristic of government. It is a flaw in government, frankly. \nWe lurch from deadline to deadline. People wonder why Congress is so \nunpopular. It is because we go from deadline to deadline and then it \nis: Hurry up. We have no time to debate. We just must pass it as is.\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\n  The biggest debate against amendments is--and it finally convinced \npeople who did not like this. They so much dislike amendments and \nslowing down the process, they are just going to take it. Even though \nthey don't like it, they are going to pass what the House passed. It is \nunlikely any amendments will pass.\n  But the thing is, we need to get away from lurching from deadline to \ndeadline. What happens, with budget or spending or any of these bills, \nis we are presented with thousand-page bills with only hours to go. \nAbout a year ago this came up. At that time, we were presented with a \n1,000-page bill with 2 hours to go. I read the Senate rules. It said: \nWe are supposed to be presented with the bill for 48 hours in advance.\n  So I raised my hand and made a motion. The motion I made was: Guys, \nwe are breaking the rules here. Men and women, we are breaking the \nrules here. So they just voted to amend the rules for that bill and \nignore the rules. This is why the American people are so frustrated. \nPeople here in town think I am making a huge mistake. Some of them, I \nthink, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they \ncan blame it on me. One of the people in the media the other day came \nup to me and said: Oh, when there is a great attack, are you going to \nfeel guilty that you caused this great attack?\n  The people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us. Do we \nblame the police chief for the attack by the Boston Bombers? The thing \nis, is that there can be attacks even if we use the Constitution. But \nthere have been attacks while collecting your bulk data. So the ones \nwho say: Well, when an attack occurs, it is going to be all your fault, \nare any of them willing to accept the blame? We have bulk collection \nnow. Are any of them willing to accept the blame for the Boston \nbombing, for the recent shooting in Garland?\n  No, but they will be the first to point fingers and say: Oh, yes, it \nis all your fault. We never should have given up on this great program. \nI am completely convinced that we can obey the Constitution, use the \nFourth Amendment as intended, spirited letter of the law, and catch \nterrorists. When we look objectively at this program, when they \nanalyzed the classified information, they found that there was no \nunique data. We had to fight them tooth and nail because they started \nout saying that 52 cases were cracked by the bulk data program.\n  But then when the President's own bipartisan commission looked at it, \nit turned out that none of that was true. This gets back to the trust \nissue. If we are going to be lied to by the Director of National \nIntelligence, it is hard for us to believe them when they come forward \nand they say: Oh, this is protecting us. We have to have it. But what \nwe are hearing is information from someone who really did not think it \nwas a big deal to lie to us about whether the program even existed.\n  Mark my words, the battle is not over. There are some--and I talked \nwith one of the, I would say, smarter people in Silicon Valley, \nsomebody who knows this from an intimate level, how things work, and \nhow the codes and programs work.\n  He maintains that the bulk collection of phone data is the tip of the \niceberg, that there is more information in other data pools that are \nclassified. Some of this is done through an Executive order called \n12333. I am not sure I know everything in it. I have had no briefings \non it. So anything I will tell you is from the newspaper alone. But the \nthing is, is that I would like to know: Are we also collecting your \ncredit card information? Are we collecting your texts? Are we \ncollecting your emails?\n  They have already told us the Fourth Amendment does not protect your \nemails, even the content, after 6 months. In fact, really they have \ntold you, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to your records at all. \nSo be very careful about the people who say: Trust us. We will never \nviolate your freedom. We will never take advantage of things. The \nPresident's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's conclusion \nwas that:\n\n       Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act has shown minimal value in \n     safeguarding the Nation from terrorism. We have not \n     identified any single instance involving a threat to the \n     United States in which the program made a concrete difference \n     in the outcome.\n\n  The President's privacy board went on to say:\n\n       The government's collection of a person's entire telephone \n     calling history has a significant and detrimental effect on \n     individual privacy.\n\n  When they talked about whether the phone records were relevant to an \ninvestigation, the President's Commission said this:\n\n       First, the telephone records acquired under the program \n     have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the \n     time of their collection. Second, because the records are \n     collected in bulk, potentially encompassing all telephone \n     calling records across the Nation, they cannot be regarded as \n     relevant to any FBI investigation.\n\n  Here is the continuing danger to us, though: It is, I think, maybe a \nminor success that we are going to prevent the government from \ncollecting these records. But realize that the interpretation of this \nwill still occur in secret in the FISA Court. This is the FISA Court \nthat said that collecting everyone's records was relevant.\n  It completely destroys the notion that the word ``relevant'' has any \nmeaning at all. This will be the question: Whether we can trust the \nFISA Court to make an interpretation that is at a higher degree of \ndiscernment than the one in which they said ``relevant'' can mean \nanything. The original USA FREEDOM Act, as passed originally by the \nHouse committee, was a better bill. It was gradually watered down until \neven the Director of National Intelligence, the one who lied about the \nprogram, now supports it, which gives me some misgivings.\n  But the records that will be collected--the question is, How will we \nhave an interpretation by the FISA Court? The original bill had an \nadvocate. I thought this was a good part of the original bill. There \nwould be a judicial advocate who would argue on the side of those who \nwere having their records taken. So there would be an adversarial \ncourt, lawyers on both sides.\n  Many people who write about jurisprudence and trying to find justice \nsay that one of the essential functions of a court system, in order to \nfind justice, is that there has to be a lawyer on both sides. There has \nto be an advocate on both sides. The truth is not always easy to find. \nThe truth is presentation of facts by one side, presentation of \ncontrary facts by the other side, and someone has to figure out which \nfacts are more believable or which facts trump other facts.\n  So I think a judicial advocate would have been good. They are still \ngoing to have it. They call it by a different name now, but it will be \noptional at the discretion of the FISA Court. So the court that ruled \nthat all of your records are relevant now will have a choice as to \nwhether to give you an advocate. That does not give me a great deal of \ncomfort.\n  There are other ways we could do this. We occasionally do look at \nterrorism cases in regular Federal court. When names come up that could \njeopardize someone's safety at our intelligence agency or a secret, \nFederal courts can go into secret session. I have heard the Senator \nfrom Oregon often mention this. I think it is a great point that no one \nwants to reveal the names of anyone or the code or the secrets of how \nwe do this. But if we are talking about constitutional principles, we \nwant to do it in the open. Laws should not be discussed in secret.\n  As we move forward, the PATRIOT Act will expire tonight. It will only \nbe temporary. They will ultimately get their way. But I think the \nmajority of the American people actually do believe the government has \ngone too far. In Washington, it is the opposite, but I think Washington \nis out of touch. There will be 80 votes, you know, to say: Continue the \nPATRIOT Act--maybe more.\n  But if you go into the general public, if you get outside the beltway \nand visit America, you find it is completely the opposite. There was a \npoll a couple of weeks ago that said: Over 80 percent of people under \nage 40--over 80 percent of them--think that the government collecting \nyour phone records is wrong and should not occur. So I think really \nthis will be useful. People say: You are destroying yourself. You \nshould have never done this. The American people will not side with \nyou.\n  People wished me harm and wished that this would be unsuccessful. But \nyou know what, I came here to defend the Bill of Rights and to defend \nthe\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nConstitution, popular or not. But I frankly think that the Bill of \nRights and the Constitution are very popular, very important, and I \nwill continue, as long as I have breath and as long as I am here to \ndefend them.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to \nmake sure, having worked with Senator Paul for many, many months now, \nthat I especially appreciate his efforts in the last few days in this \nweek to try to accommodate this body with respect to amendments. My \ncolleague has said repeatedly that he was very interested in a short \nlist of amendments, that he hoped to have some modest time that would \nbe available for these amendments.\n  He and I have worked together on a number of them. I think it is a \nreflection, as people think about this debate and on a topic that is of \nsuch enormous importance, that my colleague from Kentucky, especially \nwith respect to this amendment issue, has tried continually to be \nreasonable and to be accommodating to this body.\n  Until just a few hours ago, I was at home in Oregon having townhall \nmeetings, flew all night to be here for this extremely important \nsession. Of course, the topic we discussed this evening was front and \ncenter in terms of my constituents.\n  The message from Oregonians at these townhall meetings was very \nclear. The people whom I have the honor to represent in the Senate want \npolicies that advance their security and protect their liberties. The \nprogram we have been talking about tonight in the Senate really does \nnot deliver either. It does not make us safer. It chips away at our \nliberties.\n  I am going to spend a little bit of time this evening making the case \nfor those kinds of arguments and laying out the challenge for the days \nahead.\n  Now, with respect to this safety issue, all of us understand--\nparticularly the Presiding Officer, who has been on the Intelligence \nCommittee, as I have, for over 14 years--that it is a dangerous world. \nAnyone who serves on the Intelligence Committee knows that beyond any \nkind of debate.\n  So we want policies that really deliver both security and liberty. \nThis is what the President's own experts had to say with respect to \nthis program that involves collecting millions and millions of phone \nrecords on law-abiding Americans. This was a group that was appointed \nand spent a considerable amount of time looking at the bulk phone \nrecords collection program. They issued a report, and will I just \nparaphrase what is the central finding, on page 104 of their report: As \nto information contributed to terrorist investigations by the use of \nsection 215 telephony metadata--that is the collecting all of these \nmillions and millions of phone records--these experts say that ``could \nreadily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional \nSection 215 orders.''\n  Now, the reason that is important is it spells out and recognizes \nthat those who signed this report are individuals with some of the most \npristine antiterror credentials in this country--Mike Morell, for \nexample, the former Acting Director of the CIA; Richard Clarke, who \nheld an extremely important position in two administrations and served \nwith both Republicans and Democrats. Both of them are signatories to \nthis important report.\n  Beyond that--and it has not received much attention--the reality is \nthat our government, on top of everything else, has emergency \nauthorities so that when those who are charged with protecting our \ncountry believe there is a threat to the Nation, they are allowed to \nissue an emergency authorization to get the information they need right \naway, and then they can go back and get the warrant approved after the \nfact.\n  Nobody is talking about eliminating that emergency authority. So what \nwe have is a program that the most authoritative antiterror experts in \nthe country believe does not make our Nation any safer. I read the most \nsignificant finding in their report.\n  On top of that, as I just indicated, emergency authorities are still \npreserved. In fact, I have indicated to our President and to those who \nwork in the intelligence agencies that if at any point the executive \nbranch and, particularly, the intelligence agencies feel that their \nemergency authorities are inadequate to protect the country, I \npersonally would be willing to support efforts to ensure that those \nemergency capabilities are reformed and our country can take the steps \nit needs when it is necessary.\n  On top of this question, with respect to the issue of our safety, I \nwant to talk about what I heard at some length earlier today with \nrespect to how the program worked. I heard a number of Senators say \nthat nobody in government is listening to these calls. That was \nrepeated a number of times on the floor of this body.\n  When the government, under this program, knows whom you called, when \nyou called, and where you called from, in many instances the government \ndoesn't need to be listening. If the government knows, under this \nprogram, that a person called a psychiatrist 3 times in 36 hours--twice \nafter midnight--that is a lot of private and personal information. The \ngovernment doesn't need to be listening to that call.\n  So as to this notion that some who have wanted to make sure that our \ncountry would have both security and liberty are saying that it is a \nfantasy that the government is listening to calls, I could tell you \nthat those who have been trying to reform the program have said, in \neffect, that the government doesn't need to listen to those calls. If \nthe government has that amount of private and personal information, the \ngovernment knows a lot about you, and it really doesn't need to listen. \nCertainly, if you are talking about a land line, then the government \nknows where you are calling from if they have a phone book.\n  So with respect to this question of the government listening, I want \nit particularly understood that a program such as this, when the \ngovernment has this kind of information, I believe, represents a threat \nto our liberty. The reason why I think so is that hardly a week goes by \nwhen databases aren't violated. No. 1, we see that reported regularly \nin the press. No. 2, we have known about unfortunate times in our \nhistory--J. Edgar Hoover comes to mind--when this kind of information \ncould be used. And, No. 3, I have been very concerned, given what our \nformer colleague, Senator Udall, and I had to do with respect to bulk \nphone record collection of email. We battled to end this. Of course, \nthis was email that could be read by government agencies. We battled \nwith various intelligence leaders saying that we felt this was a \nviolation of people's rights and it wasn't effective. They asserted for \nmonths and months that it was. Finally, one day they woke up and said \nthe program wasn't needed any more.\n  None of this would have even happened had not Senator Udall and I \nmade that case repeatedly. The intelligence leadership knew that we \nwere not going to give it up, but that is what goes on if there isn't a \ncheck on some of these kinds of procedures.\n  Senator Paul made mention of the fact that the intelligence \nleadership has not exactly been straight with the American people on \nthese issues. I emphasize that we are not talking about the thousands \nand thousands of law-abiding patriotic, dedicated, wonderful people who \nwork in the intelligence field. Day in and day out they do so much for \nour country. We are so appreciative of all they do. They are the ones \nwho do the hard work, for example, to capture Bin Laden and day in and \nday out to make us safer. But the intelligence leadership, on the other \nhand, as noted by our colleague from Kentucky, has not always been \nstraight with the American people. I spent many months trying to \ndecipher what the former NSA Director meant when he said the government \ndoesn't collect any dossiers on millions of Americans.\n  I pointed out I had been on the Intelligence Committee for a long \ntime and I had never heard the term ``dossier'' used. So I tried to \nlearn more about it, used private opportunities and public \nopportunities, and just couldn't get the information. So, finally, I \nsaid: I have to ask this question in public.\n  On the Intelligence Committee you don't get but perhaps 20 or 25 \nminutes a year to ask questions in public, to hold intelligence leaders \naccountable\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\non policy matters--not secret operations, because secret operations \nhave to stay secret, but policy matters.\n  So, after being stonewalled for many months--many months--I finally \nsaid I have to ask this question in public. So to make sure no one \nwould feel ambushed, I sent the question to the Director of National \nIntelligence, Mr. Clapper. I sent it a day ahead of time.\n  Then I didn't hear anything about its being inappropriate or in \nviolation of classification rules. So I asked in public: Does the \ngovernment collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of \nmillions of Americans? I was told no, and that answer was obviously \nfalse. I tried to get it corrected, and we still couldn't get it \ncorrected.\n  Of course, then Mr. Snowden spoke out publicly and pointed that out. \nSince that time, the Director of National Intelligence and his \nrepresentatives have given these five different explanations for why \nthat answer was given. So that is why you have to ask the hard \nquestions. You have to ask the hard questions about these issues.\n  I see my friend and colleague Senator Heinrich has joined us tonight. \nI am so pleased that he has joined the Intelligence Committee. Senator \nHeinrich is one of those Senators who subscribes to that view that I \njust mentioned--that it is our job to ask the hard questions. It may be \nuncomfortable. It is not designed in any way to convey disrespect. We \nsee it as our job to ask the hard questions.\n  I would be interested in my colleague's thoughts with respect to this \nissue and to have him be given a chance to participate in this \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. First, I thank my friend from Oregon and I recognize \nthe substantial leadership he has shown on this issue over the years. \nLong before I came to the Intelligence Committee and long before Edward \nSnowden began to steal documents, Senator Wyden, along with Senator \nMark Udall and others, were doing everything they could--without \ndisclosing classified information--to shine a light on the fact that \nthe U.S. Government was collecting massive volumes of data on millions \nof law-abiding American citizens. My friend from Oregon deserves our \nthanks for that leadership.\n\n  Now, after the bulk call data collection program was revealed to the \npublic, the government, frankly, defended it and defended it \nvigorously. It took a number of months for the intelligence community \nand the rest of the administration to take a deep breath and really \nassess whether bulk metadata collection was necessary, whether it was \neffective, and to consider whether there were other less intrusive, \nmore constitutionally grounded ways to accomplish these same goals.\n  Starting with the President's Review Group on Intelligence and \nCommunications Technologies, the administration began to agree that \n``some of the authorities that were expanded or created in the \naftermath of September 11 unduly sacrifice fundamental interests in \nindividual liberty, personal privacy, and democratic governance.'' And \nthey recommended changing those authorities in order to ``strike a \nbetter balance between the competing interests and providing for the \ncommon defense and securing `the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and \nour Posterity.' ''\n  Following that, multiple efforts have been made to update and reform \nFISA and to update and reform the USA PATRIOT Act. None of those have \nbeen successful. But now we are forced to come to a resolution through \na combination of, frankly, procrastination, and, I think, misguided \nhope that the American people would look the other way while the \ngovernment continued to vacuum up and store their personal information \nand data as part of a program that even the intelligence community \nacknowledges can be accomplished through less intrusive means.\n  I will be honest. The current USA FREEDOM Act isn't what I consider \nperfect. For example, I prefer that it include strong reform of section \n702 collection, but I accept that circumstances require us to be \npragmatic, require us to govern and move forward and to work with one \nanother in both parties to find compromise. That is what the USA \nFREEDOM Act is. It is a product of bipartisan compromise.\n  That is why it passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 338 \nto 88. And let's be blunt, many of those who voted against it didn't do \nso because they support bulk collection. They did so because they want \nto see section 215 wither and die in its entirety. That is the \npolitical reality we face today, and we need to accept it rather than \ndemanding a continuation of a program that the appeals court has \ndetermined is illegal.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his statements and would just \nwant to explore this a little bit further. I hope that those who are \nfollowing this debate understand that my colleague from New Mexico is a \nreal rising star in the Senate. He and I would like the USA FREEDOM Act \nto go further, and we both worked together on legislation that would \nmake additional reforms. Certainly, our colleagues on the Intelligence \nCommittee and here in the Senate can expect to see us continuing to \nwork together to advance these additional reforms over the coming \nmonths and years. For now, the two of us are saying we ought to support \nthe USA FREEDOM Act and then move on--move on to other critical areas.\n  I particularly want to see closed what is called the backdoor search \nloophole, which my colleague from New Mexico talked about. What this \nmeans, colleagues, is that when you are engaged in a lawful search of \nsomeone who is a threat overseas, pursuant to section 702 of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, very often law-abiding Americans \ncan get swept up in this search and have their emails looked at.\n  This is a problem today, and my view is it is likely to be a growing \nconcern in the future because, increasingly, communications systems \naround the world are becoming globally integrated, so the amount of \nemails that are reviewed of Americans is likely to grow. But we can't \nget that change here tonight. So, as my colleague from New Mexico has \nmentioned, the USA FREEDOM Act would make several worthwhile reforms, \nsuch as increasing transparency, reducing the government's reliance on \nsecret laws. But from my perspective, the centerpiece of it is ending \nthe bulk collection of Americans' information under the PATRIOT Act.\n  I have been trying to close this particular loophole for close to a \ndecade now. Some of our colleagues have said the bulk collection has \nnever been abused; that no one's rights have been violated. My own view \nis--and I will ask what my colleague thinks--that vacuuming up all this \ninformation, particularly when databases get violated all the time--we \nhave seen historically instances where there has been improper conduct \nby the government. I believe dragnet surveillance violates the rights \nof millions of our people every day.\n  Vacuuming up the private phone records of millions of Americans with \nno connection to wrongdoing is simply a violation of their rights.\n  And vacuuming up Americans' email records, which I pointed out before \nmy colleague came to the floor--which he and our former colleague \nSenator Udall and I battled--is surely a violation of the rights of \nAmericans as well. Colleagues, that wouldn't have been pointed out at \nall--it wouldn't have been pointed out at all--unless Senator Udall and \nI, with the help of our friend from New Mexico, hadn't been pushing \nback on it. Finally, one day the government said: Well, we will get rid \nof it because it wasn't effective. They got rid of it because they saw \nthey were going to get hard questions, the kinds of questions my friend \nfrom New Mexico has been asking.\n  Now, with respect to the legality of this program, I know my \ncolleague and I actually filed a legal brief, along with our former \ncolleague Mark Udall, when the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nwas examining that program. In our brief, it was argued that we were \nable to debunk many of the claims that had been made about the \neffectiveness of the program.\n  I think it would be helpful if my colleague from New Mexico laid out \nsome of that analysis here tonight. I would ask the Senator from New \nMexico to begin, and I would encourage him to start by addressing the \nclaim that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records is essential \nfor stopping terrorist attacks. My question to my colleague is, Is \nthere any evidence, any\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nreal concrete evidence, to support that claim?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon and begin by saying that \ndespite what we may have heard from talking heads on the Sunday shows \nand on the cable news networks, the answer is no. There is simply no \nevidence to support those claims.\n  When this mass surveillance was first revealed to the public 2 years \nago, the executive branch initially responded to questions like this by \nclaiming that various post-9/11 authorities had resulted in the \nthwarting of approximately ``54 terrorist events in the U.S. homeland \nand abroad.''\n  Now, a number of us, including my friend from Oregon and my former \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, began to pull on that thread to \nreally parse down and see just what the executive branch was talking \nabout. First, of those 54 terrorist events, it turned out that only 13 \nwere actually focused in the United States. But more importantly, those \nnumbers conflated multiple different programs, including authorities \nunder section 215 and different authorities under section 702.\n  On June 19, 2013, my colleague from Oregon and Senator Udall pointed \nout that ``it appears that the bulk phone records collection program \nunder section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act played little or no role in \nmost of these disruptions. Saying that `these programs' have disrupted \n`dozens of potential terrorist plots' is misleading if the bulk phone \nrecords collection program is actually providing little or no unique \nvalue.''\n  Of the original 54 instances the executive branch pointed to, every \none of them crumbled under scrutiny. None of them actually justified \nthe continued existence of the bulk collection program.\n  Let me take a moment, with the indulgence of our colleagues, and read \nwhat was written by Judge Leon of the District Court for the District \nof Columbia, when he ruled in the Klayman v. Obama case. This is a \nlittle long, but I think it is important this be part of the official \nrecord of this debate.\n  Judge Leon writes:\n\n       [T]he Government does not cite a single instance in which \n     analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually \n     stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the Government \n     in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature. \n     In fact, none of the three ``recent episodes'' cited by the \n     Government that supposedly ``illustrate the role that \n     telephony metadata analysis can play in preventing and \n     protecting against terrorist attack'' involved any apparent \n     urgency.\n\n  He continues to write that:\n\n       []In the first example, the FBI learned of a terrorist plot \n     still ``in its early stages'' and investigated that plot \n     before turning to the metadata ``to ensure that all potential \n     connections were identified.'' []Assistant Director Holley \n     does not say that the metadata revealed any new information--\n     much less time-sensitive information--that had not already \n     come to light in the investigation up to that point.\n\n  The judge continues:\n\n       []In the second example, it appears that the metadata \n     analysis was used only after the terrorist was arrested ``to \n     establish [his] foreign ties and put them in context with his \n     U.S. based planning efforts.'' []And in the third, the \n     metadata analysis ``revealed a previously unknown number for \n     [a] co-conspirator . . . and corroborated his connection to \n     [the target of the investigation] as well as to other U.S.-\n     based extremists.''\n\n  Continuing to quote Judge Leon:\n\n       []Again, there is no indication that these revelations were \n     immediately useful or that they prevented an impending \n     attack. Assistant Director Holley even concedes that bulk \n     metadata analysis only ``sometimes provides information \n     earlier than the FBI's other investigative methods and \n     techniques.''\n\n  Finally, Judge Leon writes:\n\n       []Given the limited record before me at this point in the \n     litigation--most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a \n     terrorist attack has ever been prevented because of searching \n     the NSA database was faster than other investigative \n     tactics--I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the \n     metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-\n     sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats \n     of terrorism.\n\n  That is where the judge leaves off. And I will turn back to the \nSenator from Oregon to address the three cases we discussed in more \ndetail in our amicus brief to the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. The first of these examples--and \nthey really are kind of overblown examples about the effectiveness of \nbulk collection--is the case of an individual named Najibullah Zazi. \nMr. Zazi was a known terrorism suspect, and a number of people have \nsuggested that bulk phone records collection was somehow essential to \nstopping him because a query of the bulk phone records database for \nnumbers linked to Mr. Zazi returned a previously unknown number \nbelonging to another terrorism suspect.\n  However, since the government had already identified Zazi as a \nterrorism suspect prior to querying the bulk phone records database, it \nhad all the evidence it needed to obtain the phone records of Zazi and \nhis associates using an individualized section 215 order or other legal \nauthorities.\n  In the second case, some have pointed to Mr. Moalin, the San Diego \nman convicted of sending $8,500 to support al-Shabaab in Somalia. The \nintelligence community has indicated that information from the bulk \nphone records database ``established a connection between a phone \nnumber known to be used by an extremist overseas . . . and an unknown \nSan Diego-based number'' that belonged to Mr. Moalin. Yet there are \nample existing authorities under which the United States can conduct \nsurveillance on a phone number known to be used by extremists overseas \nand other phone numbers in contact with that phone number.\n  The argument that Mr. Moalin's case is an example of a unique value \nof bulk phone records collection is just not accurate. My view is this \nis yet another case that offers a misleading exaggeration with respect \nto the effectiveness of bulk phone records collection.\n  Finally, several supporters of the bulk metadata program have claimed \nthat ``[i]f we had had [the bulk phone-records] program in place at the \ntime [of the September 11, 2001 attacks,] we would have been able to \nidentify'' the phone number of one of the hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar.\n  Just as in these other cases, however, the record indicates that Mr. \nMihdhar's phone number could also have been obtained by the government \nusing a variety of alternate means. Before September 11, the government \nwas surveilling a safe house in Yemen but failed to realize that Mr. \nMihdhar, who was in contact with the safe house, was actually inside \nthe United States. The government could have used any number of \nauthorities to determine whether anyone in our country was in contact \nwith the safe house it was already targeting. It didn't need a record \nof every Americans' phone calls to establish that simple connection.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I wish to expound on that point a bit, about the many \nother ways the government can legitimately acquire phone records of \nterrorism suspects, because I think this is a very important point to \nunderstand the tools that already exist that have been very effective \nand have proven themselves over time.\n  There are actually a number of legal authorities that can get the \nsame information without the government collecting billions of call \nrecords--billions of call records that, in large part, belong to \ninnocent Americans.\n  For example, the Stored Communications Act permits the government to \nobtain precisely the same call records that are now acquired through \nbulk collection under section 215 when they are ``relevant and material \nto an ongoing criminal investigation.''\n  Additionally, national security letters, which I point out do not \nrequire a court order, can also be used by the government to obtain \ncall records for intelligence purposes.\n  Further, the government can also acquire telephony metadata on a \nreal-time basis by obtaining orders from either regular Federal courts \nor the FISC for the installation of pen registers or trap-and-trace \ndevices.\n  Finally, individualized orders for phone records, as opposed to \norders authorizing broad bulk collection, can also be obtained under \nsection 215.\n  I think those of us early in this debate thought that was what was \ngoing to occur under the PATRIOT Act in the first place. But that is \nwhat the USA FREEDOM Act seeks to require while prohibiting the bulk \ncollection of millions of personal records. It even includes emergency \nauthorization authority for the government to get records prior to \ngetting court approval, subject to later court approval, in an \nemergency.\n  The government can use any of these authorities without any more \nevidence\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\nthan what is currently required to use the bulk phone records database, \nwith less impact, I would point out, on the privacy interests of \nmillions of innocent Americans.\n  I think at this point the Senator from Oregon and I have laid out our \ncase as to why this dragnet bulk surveillance program fails to make our \ncountry measurably safer and why it should end. I am pleased to say \nthat a number of people have finally come around to our way of thinking \non this.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will wrap up and then give the \nlast word to my friend from New Mexico on the subject. He is absolutely \nright that some of the most authoritative leaders in our country--\nexperts on terror--have reached the same judgment we have. I made \nmention of the President's Review Group on Intelligence and \nCommunications Technologies, and I really would encourage colleagues \nwho are following this debate and citizens across the country--that \nreport is available online, and it is available in our office. Page 104 \nof that report is very explicit. It says that the information that \nwould otherwise be obtained in collecting all of these phone records--\nmillions of phone records of law-abiding Americans, people such as Mike \nMorell, former Acting Director of the CIA, and Richard Clark, who \nserved in two administrations--they said it could have been obtained \nthrough conventional processes.\n  This is a program that is not making us safer. And it is not my \njudgment that ought to be the last word; it should be that of people \nlike those I just quoted.\n  The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's report on the \ntelephone records program said pretty much the same thing:\n\n       [T]he Section 215 program has shown minimal value in \n     safeguarding the nation from terrorism. Based on the \n     information provided to the Board, including classified \n     briefings and documentation, we have not identified a single \n     instance involving a threat to the United States in which the \n     program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a \n     counterterrorism investigation.\n\n  I will close by way of saying--and I touched on this before my friend \nfrom New Mexico arrived--I would like to do a lot more than I believe \nis likely to happen here quickly in the Senate. I do want to see us \nfinally throw in the dustbin of history this bulk phone records \ncollection program because it doesn't make us safer and it compromises \nour liberty. But, as I indicated to my friend from New Mexico, I would \nalso like to close this backdoor search loophole in the FISA Act, which \nis going to be a bigger problem in the days ahead given the evolution \nof communications systems and how they have become globally integrated.\n  I will close by saying that one of the most important issues we are \ngoing to have to tackle in the days ahead is going to deal with \nencryption. Encryption, of course, is the encoding of data and messages \nso that they cannot be easily read. The reason this will be an \nenormously important issue--and my colleague and I have talked about \nthis--is because of the NSA overreach, the collection of all these \nphone records of law-abiding people. A lot of our most innovative, \ncutting-edge companies have found their customers raising real \nquestions about whether their products can be used safely, and a lot of \nthe purchasers who buy their products around the world are saying: \nMaybe we shouldn't trust them. Maybe we should try to start taking \ncontrol over their servers and have local storage requirements and that \nsort of thing. So what our companies did, because they saw the effect \nof the overreach by the NSA, was they started to use encryption to \nprotect the data and messages of the consumers who buy their products.\n  Most recently, the head of the FBI, Mr. Comey, rather than try to \ncome back with a solution that protected both our privacy and our \nsecurity, he said he was interested in requiring companies to build \nweaknesses into their products. Just think about that--requiring \ncompanies to build weaknesses into their products. So the government--\nwhich, in effect, caused this problem with the overreach--in effect, \nrather than trying to find a solution that worked for both security and \nliberty, said: We will start talking about requiring companies to \nactually build weaknesses into their products.\n  I and others have pointed out that once you do that, hang on to your \nhat. When the good guys have the keys, that is one thing, but when \ncompanies are required to build weaknesses into their products, the bad \nguys are going to get the keys in a hurry, too. And with all the cyber \nhacking and the risks we already have, we ought to be really careful \nabout going where Mr. Comey, our FBI Director, has proposed to go.\n  But that is not for tonight. Tonight is not an occasion where we will \nbe able to, on a bipartisan basis, close the backdoor-search loophole \nor where we will be able to come up with a sensible policy with respect \nto encryption rather than requiring companies to actually build \nweaknesses in their products. We will not be able to do that tonight. \nBut we will now have a chance here in the Senate to take steps that \nhave been bipartisan both here in the Senate and in the other body, in \nthe House of Representatives, to end the bulk phone records collection \nprogram because it doesn't make us safer and it threatens our \nliberties.\n  I always like to close by thinking about Ben Franklin, who said that \nanybody who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't \ndeserve either.\n  I am so pleased to have a chance to serve with my colleague from New \nMexico on the Intelligence Committee, who is going to be a thoughtful \nadvocate for these kinds of policies, in my view, for many years to \ncome. I thank him for his involvement tonight and would be happy to \ngive him the last word of our colloquy at this time.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon. I think he could not \nhave chosen a more appropriate way to end than to reference what Ben \nFranklin said so many years ago, that great quote that ``those who \nwould give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, \ndeserve neither Liberty nor Safety.''\n  While many reforms still lie in front of us, I think, as we move \nforward to approving the USA FREEDOM Act, we move a lot closer to the \nbalance that Ben Franklin articulated so well over 200 years ago. I \nlook forward to working with my colleague from Oregon and all of our \ncolleagues in achieving that balance and standing up for our \nconstituents.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we did not have to end up here, just hours \naway from the midnight expiration of three surveillance authorities, \nand having just moved to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I have tried since last year to move legislation through the Senate \nto address these sunsets. In November, Senator Reid brought the USA \nFREEDOM Act to the floor but the Republican leadership of the Senate \nblocked debate on it. When they took over the Senate, they assured us \nthat they would send bills--including this one--through appropriate \ncommittee process. There were promises that the new leadership would \nnot fill the amendment tree, and would use a transparent legislative \nprocess. But not one of those promises has been fulfilled with respect \nto any legislation dealing with the upcoming sunsets.\n  Once again this year, I proposed with Senator Lee a new version of \nthe USA FREEDOM Act. That bill had significant process in the House, \nwhere it passed by an overwhelming margin earlier this month. And once \nagain, the bipartisan coalition here in the Senate tried to get the \nbill passed. Two Fridays ago, the Senate Republican leadership did not \nallow us to debate the bill.\n  Tonight, the Senate did the right thing by invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I am glad to see several \nRepublicans switched their votes. This is significant progress, but it \nis late in coming.\n  We should have proceeded to this bill two Fridays ago. Had we done \nso, we could have stayed here to do our work, considered amendments, \nand passed the bill well in advance of tonight's sunset. Instead, we \nare hours away from expiration and just now considering legislation \nthat many of us have been working on for years. Our intelligence \ncommunity needs predictability and certainty, not a manufactured \ncrisis.\n  If all Senators cooperate, we can finish this bill tonight. We can \nconsider a\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nhandful of amendments under a time agreement, and pass this bill before \nmidnight. That would be the responsible thing to do.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know of no further debate on the \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/31/senate-section/article/S3331-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the recess, I tried to get a \nshort-term extension of three provisions that will expire at midnight \ntonight: section 215, business records; section 206, roving wiretap \nauthority; and the ``lone wolf'' provision. Unfortunately, those \nefforts were unsuccessful.\n  ``Lone wolf'' and roving wiretap are not--I repeat, not--the subject \nof controversy with the House bill. So I would propose that we extend \nat least the ``lone wolf'' and the roving wiretap authorities while we \ncontinue to litigate the differing views on section 215. More \nspecifically, I would propose that we extend those two provisions--\n``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps--for up to 2 weeks.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at \nthe desk, to extend the expiring provisions relating to ``lone wolf'' \nand roving wiretaps for 2 weeks, and that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the \npromises that was given when the PATRIOT Act was originally passed was \nthat, in exchange for allowing a less than constitutional standard, we \nwould only use the actions against----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PAUL. Terrorists and against foreigners. We found that 99 percent \nof the time, section 213 is used for domestic crime. I believe that no \nsection of the PATRIOT Act should be passed unless our targets are \nterrorists--not Americans.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky----\n  Mr. COTTON. Regular order.\n  Mr. PAUL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, I proposed giving the \nIntelligence Committee the time it would need to work toward the kind \nof bipartisan legislative compromise Americans deserve--a compromise \nthat would preserve important counterterrorism tools necessary to \nprotect American lives. That effort was blocked.\n  Just now, I proposed an even narrower extension that would have only \nextended some of the least controversial--least controversial--but \nstill critical tools to ensure they do not lapse as Senators work \ntoward a more comprehensive legislative outcome. But even that very \nnarrow offer was blocked. I think it should be worrying for our country \nbecause the nature of the threat we face is very serious. It is \naggressive, it is sophisticated, it is geographically dispersed, and it \nis not--not--going away.\n  As the LA Times reported, ``the Obama administration has dramatically \nstepped up warnings of potential terrorist attacks on American soil \nafter several years of relative calm.'' The paper reported that this is \noccurring in the wake of ``FBI arrests of at least 30 Americans on \nterrorism-related charges this year in an array of `lone wolf' plots.''\n  So these aren't theoretical threats. They are not theoretical \nthreats. They are with us every day. We have to face up to them. We \nshouldn't be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more \nsophisticated and aggressive, and we certainly should not be doing so \nbased on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the \nwake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden, who was last seen in \nRussia.\n  The opponents of this program have not been able to provide any--\nany--examples of the NSA abusing the authorities provided under section \n215. And the record will show that, in fact, there has not been one \ndocumented instance of abuse of it.\n  I think it is also important to remember that the contents of calls \nare not captured. That is the general view, but it is an incorrect one. \nI will say it again: The contents of calls are not captured. I say this \nto the American people: If you have been told that, that is not \ncorrect. That is what I mean about a campaign of disinformation. The \nonly things in question are the number dialed, the number from which \nthe call was made, the length of the call, and the date. That is it. \nThat is it. Detailed oversight procedures have been put in place, too, \nin order to protect the privacy of Americans.\n  Now, I believe this is a program that strikes a critical balance \nbetween privacy on the one hand and national security on the other. \nThat doesn't mean the Senate still shouldn't have the opportunity to \nmake some changes to it. That is precisely the outcome I had been \nhoping to facilitate by seeking several short-term extensions. And \nconsidering all that has come to light about the House-passed bill in \nrecent weeks, I believe this was more than reasonable.\n  The administration's inability to answer even the most basic \nquestions about the alternate bulk data system it would have to build \nunder that legislation is, to say the least, pretty troubling--pretty \ntroubling. And that is not just my view. That is the view of many in \nthis body, including colleagues who have been favorably predisposed to \nthe House bill.\n  In particular, I know Senators from both parties have been disturbed \nby the administration's continuing inability to guarantee whether the \nnew system would work as well as the current one or whether there would \neven be any data available to analyze. While the administration has let \nit be known that this nonexistent system could only be built in time if \ntelephone providers cooperated in building it, providers have made it \nabundantly clear that they are not going to commit to retaining the \ndata. They are not going to commit to retaining the data for any period \nof time unless legally required to do so, and there is no such \nrequirement in the House-passed bill--none at all.\n  Here is how one provider put it: ``[We are] not prepared to commit to \nvoluntarily retain documents for any particular period of time pursuant \nto the proposed USA Freedom Act if not required by law''--if not \nrequired by law.\n  Now, these are just a few of the reasons I thought it prudent to try \nto give the Senate more space to advance better legislation through \ncommittee consideration and regular order, with input from both sides. \nBut, my colleagues, it is now clear that will not be possible in the \nface of a determined opposition from those who simply wish to end the \ncounterterrorism program altogether. No time to try to improve the \nHouse-passed bill will be allowed because some would like to end the \nprogram altogether.\n  So this is where we find ourselves. This is the reality. So it \nessentially leaves us with two options. Option one is to allow the \nprogram to expire altogether without attempting to replace it. That \nwould mean disarming completely and arbitrarily, based on a campaign of \ndisinformation, in the face of growing, aggressive, and sophisticated \nthreats--growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats. That is a \ntotally unacceptable outcome--a completely and totally unacceptable \noutcome. So we won't be doing that.\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\n  So we are left with option two, the House-passed bill. It is \ncertainly not ideal. But along with votes on some modest amendments \nthat attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised, it is \nnow the only realistic way forward. So I remain determined to continue \nworking toward the best outcome for the American people possible under \nthe circumstances.\n  This is where we are, colleagues. We have the House-passed bill with \nsome serious flaws and an inability to get a short-term extension to \ntry to improve the House-passed bill in the way we normally do this--\nthrough some kind of consultative process.\n  So bearing that in mind, I move to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider vote No. 194, the vote by which cloture was not invoked on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 2048.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Chair inform me when I have 5 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, tonight begins the process of ending bulk \ncollection. The bill will ultimately pass. We always look for silver \nlinings. I think the bill may be replacing one form of bulk collection \nwith another, but the government, after this bill passes, will no \nlonger collect our phone records. My concern is that the phone \ncompanies still may do the same thing. Currently, my understanding is \nthe NSA is at the phone company sucking up the phone records and \nsending them to Utah. My concern is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Senate, please. The Senator \ndeserves to be heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. My concern is that under the new program, the records will \nstill be sucked up into NSA computers, but the computers will be at the \nphone company, not in Utah. So the question is, Will it be a \ndistinction without a difference? The question also will be, Will this \nbe individualized?\n  One of the issues about the Fourth Amendment that was the biggest \npart of the Fourth Amendment for our Founding Fathers was that a \nwarrant should be individualized. General warrants were what we fought \nthe Revolution over. James Otis fought a famous case in the 1760s, and \nhe fought against the British soldiers writing their own warrants.\n  What is interesting is that part of the PATRIOT Act allows our police \nto write their own warrants. We have something called national security \nletters. These have been done by the hundreds of thousands. \nInterestingly, when the President was in the Senate, he was opposed to \nnational security letters and said that they should have judicial \nwarrants. Now, it is interesting that in this bill that will pass, it \nis supported by the President, supported by the Director of National \nIntelligence, and now supported in a wide bipartisan fashion.\n  It concerns me whether or not----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Will the Senator please suspend.\n  The Senate will be in order. Please take your conversations out of \nthe well, out of the Chamber. The Senator deserves to be heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. It concerns me that the President, who supports the bulk \ndata collection and has been performing it illegally for 6 years, now \nsupports this bill. The devil is in the details.\n  The question is, Will the new bill still allow bulk collection by the \nphone companies? Will they be able to put into the search engine not an \nindividual about whom we have suspicion but an entire corporation? This \nis what was revealed when we saw the warrant that had Tsarnaev's name \non it.\n  The Director of National Intelligence came before the American \npeople, came before Congress and swore under oath that they weren't \ndoing this. Part of my problem with the intelligence-gathering in our \ncountry is it is hard for me to have trust. It is hard for me to have \ntrust in the people to whom we are giving great power.\n  They also insist we won't be able to catch terrorists. They insist \nthe bulk collection allowed them to catch terrorists. But then it \nturned out, when it was investigated, when we looked at the classified \ndocuments, when the President's bipartisan privacy and civil liberties \ncommission looked at this, when his review board looked at this, and \nthen when the Department of Justice inspector general looked at this,\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\nthey all found that there was no unique data, there was no great \ndiscovery, there was no great breaking up of a terrorist ring.\n  People have brought up the Boston Bomber, the Tsarnaev boy. They say: \nWell, we need this. We need the PATRIOT Act after the bombing to get \nhis phone records.\n  That is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. He has already \ncommitted a bombing. In fact, I think he was dead at that point, and \nthey are saying we couldn't get a warrant to look at his phone records? \nIt is absolutely absurd.\n  I had a meeting with somebody from the intelligence community about 6 \nmonths ago, and I asked them this question: How do we get more \ninformation about terrorists--with a warrant with their name on it, \nwhere we can go as deep into the details as we want, or this metadata \ncollection that uses a less-than-constitutional standard? And he said: \nWithout question, we get more information with a warrant than we do \nthrough the metadata.\n  When someone commits an act of atrocity, there is no question we \nwould get a warrant, but I would go even further. I would say that I \nwant to get more warrants on people before they blow up things. I would \nsay that we need more money spent on FBI agents analyzing data and \ntrying to find out whom we have suspicion about so we can investigate \ntheir records. I think we spend so much money on people about whom \nthere is no suspicion that we don't have enough time and money left to \ngo after the people who would actually harm us.\n  The people who argue that the world will end at midnight tonight----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend.\n  Order in the Chamber. Please take your conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. The people who argue that the world will end and that we \nwill be overrun by jihadists tonight are trying to use fear. They want \nto take just a little bit of our liberty, but they get it by making us \nafraid. They want us to fear and give up our liberty. They tell us that \nif we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. That is a far cry \nfrom the standard we were founded upon--innocent until proven guilty.\n  One of the objections I tried to bring forward earlier but was \ninterrupted repeatedly was that the PATRIOT Act was originally intended \nto go after foreigners and terrorists. We allowed a less-than-\nconstitutional standard. We didn't ask for probable cause; we just said \nit had to be relevant, the information had to be relevant to an \ninvestigation about terrorists. But here is the problem, and this is \none of the big problems I have with the PATRIOT Act.\n  We now use parts of the PATRIOT Act to arrest people for domestic \ncrime. Section 213, sneak-and-peek, where the government can come into \nyour house, place listening devices, never announce they were ever in \nyour house, and then leave and monitor your behavior and never let you \nknow they were there, is being used 99.5 percent of the time for \ndomestic crime.\n  So, little by little, we have allowed our freedom to slip away. We \nallowed the Fourth Amendment to be diminished. We allowed the narrowing \nloss of something called probable cause.\n  People say: Well, how would we get terrorists with that?\n  The vast majority of warrants are approved in our country--the vast \nmajority of warrants that are Fourth Amendment warrants where we \nindividualized and put a name on it and asked probable cause. If \ntonight the police are looking for a rapist or a murderer, they will go \nto the house, and if they suspect the person is inside but nothing is \nimminently happening, they will stand on the curb and they almost \nalways get a warrant.\n  Do you think there is a judge in this land who would not grant a \nwarrant--particularly after the Boston bombing--to look at the Tsarnaev \nbrothers' records? There is not a judge in the land who would say no. I \nwould venture to say that in advance there is not much chance that a \njudge would say no if you went to them and said: The Russians have \ngiven us indication and evidence that he has been radicalized and has \nassociated overseas with people who are training to attack us.\n  There is no reason why the Constitution can't be used. But we just \nhave to not let those who are in power make us cower in fear. They use \nfear to take your freedom, and we have to be very, very careful of \nthis.\n  Now, some are saying I am misrepresenting this, that I am saying the \ngovernment is listening to your phone calls. I am saying they are \ncollecting your phone records. There are programs, though, in which \nthere may be looking at content--emails, for example. The current law \nsays that after 6 months even the content of your email has no \nprotection. We have a very good piece of legislation to try to fix \nthat. But realize that those who are loud, those who are really wanting \nyou to give up your freedom, don't believe the Fourth Amendment \nprotects your records at all.\n  And this is a big debate. We went to the court. The Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals--the highest court in the land just below the Supreme \nCourt--said that what they are doing is illegal, but we don't yet have \na ruling on whether it is constitutional.\n  One of my fears about the bill we are going to pass--the sort of in-\nbetween step some think may be better--is that it could moot the case. \nThis means the court case will never get heard by the Supreme Court. I \nhave a court case against the NSA. There is another district court that \nhas ruled against the NSA. We now have an appellate ruling against the \nNSA. The court may well look at the activity of the Senate and say: \nWell, you guys have fixed the problem. We don't need to look at it \nanymore. It is no longer relevant.\n  My other concern about this new bill that is going to pass is that \nthe same people will judge it who judged the previous system. These \npeople are called the rubberstamp courtroom, also known as FISA. \nRealize that the FISA Court is the court that said the collection of \nall Americans' records is relevant. The appellate court basically \nlaughed at this notion and said that it sort of destroys any meaning to \nthe word ``relevant'' if you collect everybody's records. It is not \neven a modifier. Instead of saying ``relevant,'' they should have said \n``You can have everyone's records all the time.''\n  One of my other concerns about the in-between solution we are going \nto choose is that some are conjecturing--and you have to be suspicious \nof a government that often lies about their purpose--some are \nconjecturing that they are going to collect more phone data under the \nnew system. One of the complaints last week, as there was discussion \nabout this--in the newspaper, it was reported that really they were \nonly collecting about 20 to 30 percent of your cell phone data. They \nwere trying to collect all of your land line data, but they weren't for \nsome reason collecting all of your cell phone data. One of my concerns \nis that as we go to this new system, they may actually be better at \ncollecting our phone records and they may well be able to collect all \nof our cell phone data.\n  Unless we go to a system where we individualize the warrants, unless \nwe go to a system where a person's name is on the warrant, I am going \nto be very, very concerned.\n  Now, we will present amendments on this bill. We tried to negotiate \nto be allowed to present amendments, but there wasn't a lot of \nnegotiating that went on in the last week--in fact, there was none. We \nwill still try. We will put amendments forward, and we will try to get \namendments to make the bulk collection less bad when it does occur. One \nof the things we would like to do is to say that when they search the \nphone records, they can't put the name of a corporation in there; they \nwould have to put in an individual's name.\n  It is kind of tricky, the way these things are worded. The wording of \nthis bill will say they can only put a U.S. person into the selector \nterm to search all phone records. The problem is that they define \n``U.S. person'' as also meaning corporation or association or grouping. \nSo there is a little bit of looseness to the language. So if we are \nstill going to allow corporations, what is to stop them from going back \nand putting AT or Verizon in the selection? Once again they will be \nlooking at all the phone records, and all we will have done is \ntransferred the phone records from government control in Utah to phone \ncompany control in another location. Will we be trading bulk collection \nin Utah for bulk collection under the phone companies?\n  There are good people who believe this bill will reform, and I think \nthey\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\nare well-intended. I think they are good people who really think that \nwe will end bulk collection and that it won't happen. My fear, though, \nis of the people who interpret this work at a place known as the \nrubberstamp factory over at FISA. It is a secret court, and it is a \ncourt in which 99.5 percent of the time they approve warrants. Warrants \nare simply rubberstamped over there. In fact, they approved that \n``relevant'' meant all of your records. So my question is, If they put \nAT as a selector item, will we have the same thing, just in a \ndifferent location?\n  I have several amendments I am interested in if we are able to amend \nthe bill.\n  One is that the search would have to be an individual. That is more \nconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.\n  Another one would change the standard to the constitutional standard, \nwhich would be that there would have to be probable cause, which is a \nhigher standard than simply saying it is relevant. Then we would \nactually be sending a new signal to the FISA Court.\n  Another amendment I have, which I think would go a long way toward \nmaking the PATRIOT Act less bad--I think is the best way to put it--\nwould be to say that any information gathered under a less-than-\nconstitutional standard could only be used for foreigners and \nterrorists. See, that was the promise. At the time, there were people \nwho opposed the PATRIOT Act--not enough, but there were a few--and when \nthey opposed the PATRIOT Act, they said their fear was that it would be \nused against American citizens.\n  They said: No, no, we are only going after terrorists. But the law \nallows them to do it, and we now have sections of the PATRIOT Act which \n99.5 percent of the time are being used for domestic crime. We have \nalso seen that the Drug Enforcement Agency--it is alleged--is using \ninformation gathered under the PATRIOT Act to then go back and recreate \ncases against people for domestic crime.\n  The question we have to ask ourselves is, Are we so frightened that \nwe are willing to give up our freedom? Are we really willing to trade \nliberty for security?\n  I think the U.S. Court of Appeals had some great points that they \nmade when they ruled against the government, and I think what is \nimportant to know is that the President has continued to do this \nillegally. You have seen him on television. The President has been \nsaying: Well, Congress is just getting in the way. If Congress would \njust do their job and get rid of this, everything would be OK. But the \ntruth is that Congress never authorized this. Even the authors of the \nPATRIOT Act said this was not something Congress ever even \ncontemplated. The court is now saying that as well. This was done by \nthe executive branch--admittedly, both a Republican executive branch \nand a Democratic executive branch--but this wasn't created by Congress.\n  So when the President says ``Well, Congress should just do this,'' \nthe question that has never been asked by anyone in the media is ``Why \ndoesn't he stop it?'' Everybody who has given advice has said he would, \nand he will come out and say he believes in a balanced solution, but he \nreally is just abdicating the solution and has never discontinued the \nprogram, even when he has been told explicitly by the court that the \nprogram is an illegal program.\n  This is what the U.S. court of appeals said in the case ACLU v. \nClapper:\n\n       We agree with the appellants that such an expansive concept \n     of ``relevance'' is unprecedented and unwarranted. . . . The \n     records demanded are not those of suspects under \n     investigation, or of people or businesses that have contact \n     with such subjects, or of people or businesses that have \n     contact with others who are in contact with the subjects.\n\n  So even two steps removed, we are gathering records that are \ncompletely irrelevant to the investigation. We are gathering up the \nphone records of innocent Americans.\n  The other side will say: Well, we are not looking at them.\n  So I have been thinking about this. Our Founders objected to the \nBritish soldiers writing warrants. They objected to them coming into \ntheir house and grabbing their papers. Do you think our Framers would \nhave been happy if the British Government said: OK, we are just \nbreaking your door down, we are just getting your papers, but we are \nnot going to look at them. Do you think that would have changed the \nmindset of the Framers? So the fact that they say they are not looking \nat our records--is that any comfort or should it be any comfort? The \nact of violation is in taking your records. The act of violation is in \nallowing the police or a form of the police--the FBI--to write warrants \nthat are not signed by a judge.\n  The court goes on to say: ``The interpretation that the government \nasks us to adopt defies any limiting principle.'' The idea of a \nlimiting principle when the court looks at things is that, the way I \nsee it, is the difference between something being arbitrary, where \nthere is no sort of principle that confines what would happen--if you \nhave a law that has no limiting principle, it is essentially arbitrary.\n  This is what Hayek wrote about in ``The Road to Serfdom.'' Hayek \ntalked about the difference between the rule of law and having an \narbitrary interpretation of the law.\n  The danger of having an arbitrary interpretation of the law and the \ndanger of having general warrants is that they have been used in the \npast with bias. People have brought their own bias into this. In the \nsixties, the bias was against civil rights activists and against \nVietnam war activists. In the forties, the bias was in incarcerating \nand interring Japanese Americans. But what was consistent in all of \nthese circumstances was that there was a generalization--a \ngeneralization based on the color of your skin, whether you were Asian \nAmerican or African American, and also about the shade of your \nideology. There is a danger in allowing the government to generalize \nwithout suspicion and to disobey the Fourth Amendment, and the danger \ncomes that the government could one day generalize and bias could enter \ninto things.\n  We have on our records right now laws that allow an American citizen \nto be detained. It is not specifically a part of the PATRIOT Act, but \nit is along the same lines as this, that you are getting rid of the due \nprocess amendments and the ability of the Bill of Rights to protect an \nindividual. When we allow an individual to be detained without a trial, \nwhat happens is that there is the possibility that someone could decide \nwe don't like ``those'' people. And when you say that could never \nhappen, think about the times in our history when it has.\n  Richard Jewell, everybody said he was the Olympic Bomber. He was \nconvicted on TV. Within hours, people said: Richard Jewell is guilty. \nThink about if he had been a Black man in 1920 in the South what may \nhave happened to him. Think about the possibility for bias entering \ninto our government. Think about what Madison said about government \nis--Madison said that we restrain government because we are worried \nthat government may not be comprised of angels. If government were \ncomprised of angels, we would not have to worry about restraining \ngovernment.\n  Patrick Henry said that the Constitution was about restraining \ngovernment, not the people. It is not enough for people to say: Oh, I \nam a good man or I am a good person or the NSA would never do this. The \nother problem that makes us doubtful is that the NSA has not been \nhonest with us. If they want to develop trust again, the President \nshould have immediately let the person who lied to us go, the Director \nof National Intelligence.\n  The appeals court concluded by saying that the government's bulk \ncollection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of what Congress has \nauthorized and therefore violates section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Some \nwill try to argue that this debate was not worth the time we took on \nit. I could not disagree more. I am like everybody else. You know, I \nprize my time with my family and being at home on the weekends. I wish \nwe would have done this in a more sensitive way, where we would have \nhad more time and had an open amendment process.\n  But we waited until the end. We waited until the final deadline. This \nis a characteristic of government. It is a flaw in government, frankly. \nWe lurch from deadline to deadline. People wonder why Congress is so \nunpopular. It is because we go from deadline to deadline and then it \nis: Hurry up. We have no time to debate. We just must pass it as is.\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\n  The biggest debate against amendments is--and it finally convinced \npeople who did not like this. They so much dislike amendments and \nslowing down the process, they are just going to take it. Even though \nthey don't like it, they are going to pass what the House passed. It is \nunlikely any amendments will pass.\n  But the thing is, we need to get away from lurching from deadline to \ndeadline. What happens, with budget or spending or any of these bills, \nis we are presented with thousand-page bills with only hours to go. \nAbout a year ago this came up. At that time, we were presented with a \n1,000-page bill with 2 hours to go. I read the Senate rules. It said: \nWe are supposed to be presented with the bill for 48 hours in advance.\n  So I raised my hand and made a motion. The motion I made was: Guys, \nwe are breaking the rules here. Men and women, we are breaking the \nrules here. So they just voted to amend the rules for that bill and \nignore the rules. This is why the American people are so frustrated. \nPeople here in town think I am making a huge mistake. Some of them, I \nthink, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they \ncan blame it on me. One of the people in the media the other day came \nup to me and said: Oh, when there is a great attack, are you going to \nfeel guilty that you caused this great attack?\n  The people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us. Do we \nblame the police chief for the attack by the Boston Bombers? The thing \nis, is that there can be attacks even if we use the Constitution. But \nthere have been attacks while collecting your bulk data. So the ones \nwho say: Well, when an attack occurs, it is going to be all your fault, \nare any of them willing to accept the blame? We have bulk collection \nnow. Are any of them willing to accept the blame for the Boston \nbombing, for the recent shooting in Garland?\n  No, but they will be the first to point fingers and say: Oh, yes, it \nis all your fault. We never should have given up on this great program. \nI am completely convinced that we can obey the Constitution, use the \nFourth Amendment as intended, spirited letter of the law, and catch \nterrorists. When we look objectively at this program, when they \nanalyzed the classified information, they found that there was no \nunique data. We had to fight them tooth and nail because they started \nout saying that 52 cases were cracked by the bulk data program.\n  But then when the President's own bipartisan commission looked at it, \nit turned out that none of that was true. This gets back to the trust \nissue. If we are going to be lied to by the Director of National \nIntelligence, it is hard for us to believe them when they come forward \nand they say: Oh, this is protecting us. We have to have it. But what \nwe are hearing is information from someone who really did not think it \nwas a big deal to lie to us about whether the program even existed.\n  Mark my words, the battle is not over. There are some--and I talked \nwith one of the, I would say, smarter people in Silicon Valley, \nsomebody who knows this from an intimate level, how things work, and \nhow the codes and programs work.\n  He maintains that the bulk collection of phone data is the tip of the \niceberg, that there is more information in other data pools that are \nclassified. Some of this is done through an Executive order called \n12333. I am not sure I know everything in it. I have had no briefings \non it. So anything I will tell you is from the newspaper alone. But the \nthing is, is that I would like to know: Are we also collecting your \ncredit card information? Are we collecting your texts? Are we \ncollecting your emails?\n  They have already told us the Fourth Amendment does not protect your \nemails, even the content, after 6 months. In fact, really they have \ntold you, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to your records at all. \nSo be very careful about the people who say: Trust us. We will never \nviolate your freedom. We will never take advantage of things. The \nPresident's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's conclusion \nwas that:\n\n       Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act has shown minimal value in \n     safeguarding the Nation from terrorism. We have not \n     identified any single instance involving a threat to the \n     United States in which the program made a concrete difference \n     in the outcome.\n\n  The President's privacy board went on to say:\n\n       The government's collection of a person's entire telephone \n     calling history has a significant and detrimental effect on \n     individual privacy.\n\n  When they talked about whether the phone records were relevant to an \ninvestigation, the President's Commission said this:\n\n       First, the telephone records acquired under the program \n     have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the \n     time of their collection. Second, because the records are \n     collected in bulk, potentially encompassing all telephone \n     calling records across the Nation, they cannot be regarded as \n     relevant to any FBI investigation.\n\n  Here is the continuing danger to us, though: It is, I think, maybe a \nminor success that we are going to prevent the government from \ncollecting these records. But realize that the interpretation of this \nwill still occur in secret in the FISA Court. This is the FISA Court \nthat said that collecting everyone's records was relevant.\n  It completely destroys the notion that the word ``relevant'' has any \nmeaning at all. This will be the question: Whether we can trust the \nFISA Court to make an interpretation that is at a higher degree of \ndiscernment than the one in which they said ``relevant'' can mean \nanything. The original USA FREEDOM Act, as passed originally by the \nHouse committee, was a better bill. It was gradually watered down until \neven the Director of National Intelligence, the one who lied about the \nprogram, now supports it, which gives me some misgivings.\n  But the records that will be collected--the question is, How will we \nhave an interpretation by the FISA Court? The original bill had an \nadvocate. I thought this was a good part of the original bill. There \nwould be a judicial advocate who would argue on the side of those who \nwere having their records taken. So there would be an adversarial \ncourt, lawyers on both sides.\n  Many people who write about jurisprudence and trying to find justice \nsay that one of the essential functions of a court system, in order to \nfind justice, is that there has to be a lawyer on both sides. There has \nto be an advocate on both sides. The truth is not always easy to find. \nThe truth is presentation of facts by one side, presentation of \ncontrary facts by the other side, and someone has to figure out which \nfacts are more believable or which facts trump other facts.\n  So I think a judicial advocate would have been good. They are still \ngoing to have it. They call it by a different name now, but it will be \noptional at the discretion of the FISA Court. So the court that ruled \nthat all of your records are relevant now will have a choice as to \nwhether to give you an advocate. That does not give me a great deal of \ncomfort.\n  There are other ways we could do this. We occasionally do look at \nterrorism cases in regular Federal court. When names come up that could \njeopardize someone's safety at our intelligence agency or a secret, \nFederal courts can go into secret session. I have heard the Senator \nfrom Oregon often mention this. I think it is a great point that no one \nwants to reveal the names of anyone or the code or the secrets of how \nwe do this. But if we are talking about constitutional principles, we \nwant to do it in the open. Laws should not be discussed in secret.\n  As we move forward, the PATRIOT Act will expire tonight. It will only \nbe temporary. They will ultimately get their way. But I think the \nmajority of the American people actually do believe the government has \ngone too far. In Washington, it is the opposite, but I think Washington \nis out of touch. There will be 80 votes, you know, to say: Continue the \nPATRIOT Act--maybe more.\n  But if you go into the general public, if you get outside the beltway \nand visit America, you find it is completely the opposite. There was a \npoll a couple of weeks ago that said: Over 80 percent of people under \nage 40--over 80 percent of them--think that the government collecting \nyour phone records is wrong and should not occur. So I think really \nthis will be useful. People say: You are destroying yourself. You \nshould have never done this. The American people will not side with \nyou.\n  People wished me harm and wished that this would be unsuccessful. But \nyou know what, I came here to defend the Bill of Rights and to defend \nthe\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nConstitution, popular or not. But I frankly think that the Bill of \nRights and the Constitution are very popular, very important, and I \nwill continue, as long as I have breath and as long as I am here to \ndefend them.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to \nmake sure, having worked with Senator Paul for many, many months now, \nthat I especially appreciate his efforts in the last few days in this \nweek to try to accommodate this body with respect to amendments. My \ncolleague has said repeatedly that he was very interested in a short \nlist of amendments, that he hoped to have some modest time that would \nbe available for these amendments.\n  He and I have worked together on a number of them. I think it is a \nreflection, as people think about this debate and on a topic that is of \nsuch enormous importance, that my colleague from Kentucky, especially \nwith respect to this amendment issue, has tried continually to be \nreasonable and to be accommodating to this body.\n  Until just a few hours ago, I was at home in Oregon having townhall \nmeetings, flew all night to be here for this extremely important \nsession. Of course, the topic we discussed this evening was front and \ncenter in terms of my constituents.\n  The message from Oregonians at these townhall meetings was very \nclear. The people whom I have the honor to represent in the Senate want \npolicies that advance their security and protect their liberties. The \nprogram we have been talking about tonight in the Senate really does \nnot deliver either. It does not make us safer. It chips away at our \nliberties.\n  I am going to spend a little bit of time this evening making the case \nfor those kinds of arguments and laying out the challenge for the days \nahead.\n  Now, with respect to this safety issue, all of us understand--\nparticularly the Presiding Officer, who has been on the Intelligence \nCommittee, as I have, for over 14 years--that it is a dangerous world. \nAnyone who serves on the Intelligence Committee knows that beyond any \nkind of debate.\n  So we want policies that really deliver both security and liberty. \nThis is what the President's own experts had to say with respect to \nthis program that involves collecting millions and millions of phone \nrecords on law-abiding Americans. This was a group that was appointed \nand spent a considerable amount of time looking at the bulk phone \nrecords collection program. They issued a report, and will I just \nparaphrase what is the central finding, on page 104 of their report: As \nto information contributed to terrorist investigations by the use of \nsection 215 telephony metadata--that is the collecting all of these \nmillions and millions of phone records--these experts say that ``could \nreadily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional \nSection 215 orders.''\n  Now, the reason that is important is it spells out and recognizes \nthat those who signed this report are individuals with some of the most \npristine antiterror credentials in this country--Mike Morell, for \nexample, the former Acting Director of the CIA; Richard Clarke, who \nheld an extremely important position in two administrations and served \nwith both Republicans and Democrats. Both of them are signatories to \nthis important report.\n  Beyond that--and it has not received much attention--the reality is \nthat our government, on top of everything else, has emergency \nauthorities so that when those who are charged with protecting our \ncountry believe there is a threat to the Nation, they are allowed to \nissue an emergency authorization to get the information they need right \naway, and then they can go back and get the warrant approved after the \nfact.\n  Nobody is talking about eliminating that emergency authority. So what \nwe have is a program that the most authoritative antiterror experts in \nthe country believe does not make our Nation any safer. I read the most \nsignificant finding in their report.\n  On top of that, as I just indicated, emergency authorities are still \npreserved. In fact, I have indicated to our President and to those who \nwork in the intelligence agencies that if at any point the executive \nbranch and, particularly, the intelligence agencies feel that their \nemergency authorities are inadequate to protect the country, I \npersonally would be willing to support efforts to ensure that those \nemergency capabilities are reformed and our country can take the steps \nit needs when it is necessary.\n  On top of this question, with respect to the issue of our safety, I \nwant to talk about what I heard at some length earlier today with \nrespect to how the program worked. I heard a number of Senators say \nthat nobody in government is listening to these calls. That was \nrepeated a number of times on the floor of this body.\n  When the government, under this program, knows whom you called, when \nyou called, and where you called from, in many instances the government \ndoesn't need to be listening. If the government knows, under this \nprogram, that a person called a psychiatrist 3 times in 36 hours--twice \nafter midnight--that is a lot of private and personal information. The \ngovernment doesn't need to be listening to that call.\n  So as to this notion that some who have wanted to make sure that our \ncountry would have both security and liberty are saying that it is a \nfantasy that the government is listening to calls, I could tell you \nthat those who have been trying to reform the program have said, in \neffect, that the government doesn't need to listen to those calls. If \nthe government has that amount of private and personal information, the \ngovernment knows a lot about you, and it really doesn't need to listen. \nCertainly, if you are talking about a land line, then the government \nknows where you are calling from if they have a phone book.\n  So with respect to this question of the government listening, I want \nit particularly understood that a program such as this, when the \ngovernment has this kind of information, I believe, represents a threat \nto our liberty. The reason why I think so is that hardly a week goes by \nwhen databases aren't violated. No. 1, we see that reported regularly \nin the press. No. 2, we have known about unfortunate times in our \nhistory--J. Edgar Hoover comes to mind--when this kind of information \ncould be used. And, No. 3, I have been very concerned, given what our \nformer colleague, Senator Udall, and I had to do with respect to bulk \nphone record collection of email. We battled to end this. Of course, \nthis was email that could be read by government agencies. We battled \nwith various intelligence leaders saying that we felt this was a \nviolation of people's rights and it wasn't effective. They asserted for \nmonths and months that it was. Finally, one day they woke up and said \nthe program wasn't needed any more.\n  None of this would have even happened had not Senator Udall and I \nmade that case repeatedly. The intelligence leadership knew that we \nwere not going to give it up, but that is what goes on if there isn't a \ncheck on some of these kinds of procedures.\n  Senator Paul made mention of the fact that the intelligence \nleadership has not exactly been straight with the American people on \nthese issues. I emphasize that we are not talking about the thousands \nand thousands of law-abiding patriotic, dedicated, wonderful people who \nwork in the intelligence field. Day in and day out they do so much for \nour country. We are so appreciative of all they do. They are the ones \nwho do the hard work, for example, to capture Bin Laden and day in and \nday out to make us safer. But the intelligence leadership, on the other \nhand, as noted by our colleague from Kentucky, has not always been \nstraight with the American people. I spent many months trying to \ndecipher what the former NSA Director meant when he said the government \ndoesn't collect any dossiers on millions of Americans.\n  I pointed out I had been on the Intelligence Committee for a long \ntime and I had never heard the term ``dossier'' used. So I tried to \nlearn more about it, used private opportunities and public \nopportunities, and just couldn't get the information. So, finally, I \nsaid: I have to ask this question in public.\n  On the Intelligence Committee you don't get but perhaps 20 or 25 \nminutes a year to ask questions in public, to hold intelligence leaders \naccountable\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\non policy matters--not secret operations, because secret operations \nhave to stay secret, but policy matters.\n  So, after being stonewalled for many months--many months--I finally \nsaid I have to ask this question in public. So to make sure no one \nwould feel ambushed, I sent the question to the Director of National \nIntelligence, Mr. Clapper. I sent it a day ahead of time.\n  Then I didn't hear anything about its being inappropriate or in \nviolation of classification rules. So I asked in public: Does the \ngovernment collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of \nmillions of Americans? I was told no, and that answer was obviously \nfalse. I tried to get it corrected, and we still couldn't get it \ncorrected.\n  Of course, then Mr. Snowden spoke out publicly and pointed that out. \nSince that time, the Director of National Intelligence and his \nrepresentatives have given these five different explanations for why \nthat answer was given. So that is why you have to ask the hard \nquestions. You have to ask the hard questions about these issues.\n  I see my friend and colleague Senator Heinrich has joined us tonight. \nI am so pleased that he has joined the Intelligence Committee. Senator \nHeinrich is one of those Senators who subscribes to that view that I \njust mentioned--that it is our job to ask the hard questions. It may be \nuncomfortable. It is not designed in any way to convey disrespect. We \nsee it as our job to ask the hard questions.\n  I would be interested in my colleague's thoughts with respect to this \nissue and to have him be given a chance to participate in this \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. First, I thank my friend from Oregon and I recognize \nthe substantial leadership he has shown on this issue over the years. \nLong before I came to the Intelligence Committee and long before Edward \nSnowden began to steal documents, Senator Wyden, along with Senator \nMark Udall and others, were doing everything they could--without \ndisclosing classified information--to shine a light on the fact that \nthe U.S. Government was collecting massive volumes of data on millions \nof law-abiding American citizens. My friend from Oregon deserves our \nthanks for that leadership.\n\n  Now, after the bulk call data collection program was revealed to the \npublic, the government, frankly, defended it and defended it \nvigorously. It took a number of months for the intelligence community \nand the rest of the administration to take a deep breath and really \nassess whether bulk metadata collection was necessary, whether it was \neffective, and to consider whether there were other less intrusive, \nmore constitutionally grounded ways to accomplish these same goals.\n  Starting with the President's Review Group on Intelligence and \nCommunications Technologies, the administration began to agree that \n``some of the authorities that were expanded or created in the \naftermath of September 11 unduly sacrifice fundamental interests in \nindividual liberty, personal privacy, and democratic governance.'' And \nthey recommended changing those authorities in order to ``strike a \nbetter balance between the competing interests and providing for the \ncommon defense and securing `the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and \nour Posterity.' ''\n  Following that, multiple efforts have been made to update and reform \nFISA and to update and reform the USA PATRIOT Act. None of those have \nbeen successful. But now we are forced to come to a resolution through \na combination of, frankly, procrastination, and, I think, misguided \nhope that the American people would look the other way while the \ngovernment continued to vacuum up and store their personal information \nand data as part of a program that even the intelligence community \nacknowledges can be accomplished through less intrusive means.\n  I will be honest. The current USA FREEDOM Act isn't what I consider \nperfect. For example, I prefer that it include strong reform of section \n702 collection, but I accept that circumstances require us to be \npragmatic, require us to govern and move forward and to work with one \nanother in both parties to find compromise. That is what the USA \nFREEDOM Act is. It is a product of bipartisan compromise.\n  That is why it passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 338 \nto 88. And let's be blunt, many of those who voted against it didn't do \nso because they support bulk collection. They did so because they want \nto see section 215 wither and die in its entirety. That is the \npolitical reality we face today, and we need to accept it rather than \ndemanding a continuation of a program that the appeals court has \ndetermined is illegal.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his statements and would just \nwant to explore this a little bit further. I hope that those who are \nfollowing this debate understand that my colleague from New Mexico is a \nreal rising star in the Senate. He and I would like the USA FREEDOM Act \nto go further, and we both worked together on legislation that would \nmake additional reforms. Certainly, our colleagues on the Intelligence \nCommittee and here in the Senate can expect to see us continuing to \nwork together to advance these additional reforms over the coming \nmonths and years. For now, the two of us are saying we ought to support \nthe USA FREEDOM Act and then move on--move on to other critical areas.\n  I particularly want to see closed what is called the backdoor search \nloophole, which my colleague from New Mexico talked about. What this \nmeans, colleagues, is that when you are engaged in a lawful search of \nsomeone who is a threat overseas, pursuant to section 702 of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, very often law-abiding Americans \ncan get swept up in this search and have their emails looked at.\n  This is a problem today, and my view is it is likely to be a growing \nconcern in the future because, increasingly, communications systems \naround the world are becoming globally integrated, so the amount of \nemails that are reviewed of Americans is likely to grow. But we can't \nget that change here tonight. So, as my colleague from New Mexico has \nmentioned, the USA FREEDOM Act would make several worthwhile reforms, \nsuch as increasing transparency, reducing the government's reliance on \nsecret laws. But from my perspective, the centerpiece of it is ending \nthe bulk collection of Americans' information under the PATRIOT Act.\n  I have been trying to close this particular loophole for close to a \ndecade now. Some of our colleagues have said the bulk collection has \nnever been abused; that no one's rights have been violated. My own view \nis--and I will ask what my colleague thinks--that vacuuming up all this \ninformation, particularly when databases get violated all the time--we \nhave seen historically instances where there has been improper conduct \nby the government. I believe dragnet surveillance violates the rights \nof millions of our people every day.\n  Vacuuming up the private phone records of millions of Americans with \nno connection to wrongdoing is simply a violation of their rights.\n  And vacuuming up Americans' email records, which I pointed out before \nmy colleague came to the floor--which he and our former colleague \nSenator Udall and I battled--is surely a violation of the rights of \nAmericans as well. Colleagues, that wouldn't have been pointed out at \nall--it wouldn't have been pointed out at all--unless Senator Udall and \nI, with the help of our friend from New Mexico, hadn't been pushing \nback on it. Finally, one day the government said: Well, we will get rid \nof it because it wasn't effective. They got rid of it because they saw \nthey were going to get hard questions, the kinds of questions my friend \nfrom New Mexico has been asking.\n  Now, with respect to the legality of this program, I know my \ncolleague and I actually filed a legal brief, along with our former \ncolleague Mark Udall, when the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nwas examining that program. In our brief, it was argued that we were \nable to debunk many of the claims that had been made about the \neffectiveness of the program.\n  I think it would be helpful if my colleague from New Mexico laid out \nsome of that analysis here tonight. I would ask the Senator from New \nMexico to begin, and I would encourage him to start by addressing the \nclaim that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records is essential \nfor stopping terrorist attacks. My question to my colleague is, Is \nthere any evidence, any\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nreal concrete evidence, to support that claim?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon and begin by saying that \ndespite what we may have heard from talking heads on the Sunday shows \nand on the cable news networks, the answer is no. There is simply no \nevidence to support those claims.\n  When this mass surveillance was first revealed to the public 2 years \nago, the executive branch initially responded to questions like this by \nclaiming that various post-9/11 authorities had resulted in the \nthwarting of approximately ``54 terrorist events in the U.S. homeland \nand abroad.''\n  Now, a number of us, including my friend from Oregon and my former \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, began to pull on that thread to \nreally parse down and see just what the executive branch was talking \nabout. First, of those 54 terrorist events, it turned out that only 13 \nwere actually focused in the United States. But more importantly, those \nnumbers conflated multiple different programs, including authorities \nunder section 215 and different authorities under section 702.\n  On June 19, 2013, my colleague from Oregon and Senator Udall pointed \nout that ``it appears that the bulk phone records collection program \nunder section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act played little or no role in \nmost of these disruptions. Saying that `these programs' have disrupted \n`dozens of potential terrorist plots' is misleading if the bulk phone \nrecords collection program is actually providing little or no unique \nvalue.''\n  Of the original 54 instances the executive branch pointed to, every \none of them crumbled under scrutiny. None of them actually justified \nthe continued existence of the bulk collection program.\n  Let me take a moment, with the indulgence of our colleagues, and read \nwhat was written by Judge Leon of the District Court for the District \nof Columbia, when he ruled in the Klayman v. Obama case. This is a \nlittle long, but I think it is important this be part of the official \nrecord of this debate.\n  Judge Leon writes:\n\n       [T]he Government does not cite a single instance in which \n     analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually \n     stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the Government \n     in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature. \n     In fact, none of the three ``recent episodes'' cited by the \n     Government that supposedly ``illustrate the role that \n     telephony metadata analysis can play in preventing and \n     protecting against terrorist attack'' involved any apparent \n     urgency.\n\n  He continues to write that:\n\n       []In the first example, the FBI learned of a terrorist plot \n     still ``in its early stages'' and investigated that plot \n     before turning to the metadata ``to ensure that all potential \n     connections were identified.'' []Assistant Director Holley \n     does not say that the metadata revealed any new information--\n     much less time-sensitive information--that had not already \n     come to light in the investigation up to that point.\n\n  The judge continues:\n\n       []In the second example, it appears that the metadata \n     analysis was used only after the terrorist was arrested ``to \n     establish [his] foreign ties and put them in context with his \n     U.S. based planning efforts.'' []And in the third, the \n     metadata analysis ``revealed a previously unknown number for \n     [a] co-conspirator . . . and corroborated his connection to \n     [the target of the investigation] as well as to other U.S.-\n     based extremists.''\n\n  Continuing to quote Judge Leon:\n\n       []Again, there is no indication that these revelations were \n     immediately useful or that they prevented an impending \n     attack. Assistant Director Holley even concedes that bulk \n     metadata analysis only ``sometimes provides information \n     earlier than the FBI's other investigative methods and \n     techniques.''\n\n  Finally, Judge Leon writes:\n\n       []Given the limited record before me at this point in the \n     litigation--most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a \n     terrorist attack has ever been prevented because of searching \n     the NSA database was faster than other investigative \n     tactics--I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the \n     metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-\n     sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats \n     of terrorism.\n\n  That is where the judge leaves off. And I will turn back to the \nSenator from Oregon to address the three cases we discussed in more \ndetail in our amicus brief to the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. The first of these examples--and \nthey really are kind of overblown examples about the effectiveness of \nbulk collection--is the case of an individual named Najibullah Zazi. \nMr. Zazi was a known terrorism suspect, and a number of people have \nsuggested that bulk phone records collection was somehow essential to \nstopping him because a query of the bulk phone records database for \nnumbers linked to Mr. Zazi returned a previously unknown number \nbelonging to another terrorism suspect.\n  However, since the government had already identified Zazi as a \nterrorism suspect prior to querying the bulk phone records database, it \nhad all the evidence it needed to obtain the phone records of Zazi and \nhis associates using an individualized section 215 order or other legal \nauthorities.\n  In the second case, some have pointed to Mr. Moalin, the San Diego \nman convicted of sending $8,500 to support al-Shabaab in Somalia. The \nintelligence community has indicated that information from the bulk \nphone records database ``established a connection between a phone \nnumber known to be used by an extremist overseas . . . and an unknown \nSan Diego-based number'' that belonged to Mr. Moalin. Yet there are \nample existing authorities under which the United States can conduct \nsurveillance on a phone number known to be used by extremists overseas \nand other phone numbers in contact with that phone number.\n  The argument that Mr. Moalin's case is an example of a unique value \nof bulk phone records collection is just not accurate. My view is this \nis yet another case that offers a misleading exaggeration with respect \nto the effectiveness of bulk phone records collection.\n  Finally, several supporters of the bulk metadata program have claimed \nthat ``[i]f we had had [the bulk phone-records] program in place at the \ntime [of the September 11, 2001 attacks,] we would have been able to \nidentify'' the phone number of one of the hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar.\n  Just as in these other cases, however, the record indicates that Mr. \nMihdhar's phone number could also have been obtained by the government \nusing a variety of alternate means. Before September 11, the government \nwas surveilling a safe house in Yemen but failed to realize that Mr. \nMihdhar, who was in contact with the safe house, was actually inside \nthe United States. The government could have used any number of \nauthorities to determine whether anyone in our country was in contact \nwith the safe house it was already targeting. It didn't need a record \nof every Americans' phone calls to establish that simple connection.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I wish to expound on that point a bit, about the many \nother ways the government can legitimately acquire phone records of \nterrorism suspects, because I think this is a very important point to \nunderstand the tools that already exist that have been very effective \nand have proven themselves over time.\n  There are actually a number of legal authorities that can get the \nsame information without the government collecting billions of call \nrecords--billions of call records that, in large part, belong to \ninnocent Americans.\n  For example, the Stored Communications Act permits the government to \nobtain precisely the same call records that are now acquired through \nbulk collection under section 215 when they are ``relevant and material \nto an ongoing criminal investigation.''\n  Additionally, national security letters, which I point out do not \nrequire a court order, can also be used by the government to obtain \ncall records for intelligence purposes.\n  Further, the government can also acquire telephony metadata on a \nreal-time basis by obtaining orders from either regular Federal courts \nor the FISC for the installation of pen registers or trap-and-trace \ndevices.\n  Finally, individualized orders for phone records, as opposed to \norders authorizing broad bulk collection, can also be obtained under \nsection 215.\n  I think those of us early in this debate thought that was what was \ngoing to occur under the PATRIOT Act in the first place. But that is \nwhat the USA FREEDOM Act seeks to require while prohibiting the bulk \ncollection of millions of personal records. It even includes emergency \nauthorization authority for the government to get records prior to \ngetting court approval, subject to later court approval, in an \nemergency.\n  The government can use any of these authorities without any more \nevidence\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\nthan what is currently required to use the bulk phone records database, \nwith less impact, I would point out, on the privacy interests of \nmillions of innocent Americans.\n  I think at this point the Senator from Oregon and I have laid out our \ncase as to why this dragnet bulk surveillance program fails to make our \ncountry measurably safer and why it should end. I am pleased to say \nthat a number of people have finally come around to our way of thinking \non this.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will wrap up and then give the \nlast word to my friend from New Mexico on the subject. He is absolutely \nright that some of the most authoritative leaders in our country--\nexperts on terror--have reached the same judgment we have. I made \nmention of the President's Review Group on Intelligence and \nCommunications Technologies, and I really would encourage colleagues \nwho are following this debate and citizens across the country--that \nreport is available online, and it is available in our office. Page 104 \nof that report is very explicit. It says that the information that \nwould otherwise be obtained in collecting all of these phone records--\nmillions of phone records of law-abiding Americans, people such as Mike \nMorell, former Acting Director of the CIA, and Richard Clark, who \nserved in two administrations--they said it could have been obtained \nthrough conventional processes.\n  This is a program that is not making us safer. And it is not my \njudgment that ought to be the last word; it should be that of people \nlike those I just quoted.\n  The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's report on the \ntelephone records program said pretty much the same thing:\n\n       [T]he Section 215 program has shown minimal value in \n     safeguarding the nation from terrorism. Based on the \n     information provided to the Board, including classified \n     briefings and documentation, we have not identified a single \n     instance involving a threat to the United States in which the \n     program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a \n     counterterrorism investigation.\n\n  I will close by way of saying--and I touched on this before my friend \nfrom New Mexico arrived--I would like to do a lot more than I believe \nis likely to happen here quickly in the Senate. I do want to see us \nfinally throw in the dustbin of history this bulk phone records \ncollection program because it doesn't make us safer and it compromises \nour liberty. But, as I indicated to my friend from New Mexico, I would \nalso like to close this backdoor search loophole in the FISA Act, which \nis going to be a bigger problem in the days ahead given the evolution \nof communications systems and how they have become globally integrated.\n  I will close by saying that one of the most important issues we are \ngoing to have to tackle in the days ahead is going to deal with \nencryption. Encryption, of course, is the encoding of data and messages \nso that they cannot be easily read. The reason this will be an \nenormously important issue--and my colleague and I have talked about \nthis--is because of the NSA overreach, the collection of all these \nphone records of law-abiding people. A lot of our most innovative, \ncutting-edge companies have found their customers raising real \nquestions about whether their products can be used safely, and a lot of \nthe purchasers who buy their products around the world are saying: \nMaybe we shouldn't trust them. Maybe we should try to start taking \ncontrol over their servers and have local storage requirements and that \nsort of thing. So what our companies did, because they saw the effect \nof the overreach by the NSA, was they started to use encryption to \nprotect the data and messages of the consumers who buy their products.\n  Most recently, the head of the FBI, Mr. Comey, rather than try to \ncome back with a solution that protected both our privacy and our \nsecurity, he said he was interested in requiring companies to build \nweaknesses into their products. Just think about that--requiring \ncompanies to build weaknesses into their products. So the government--\nwhich, in effect, caused this problem with the overreach--in effect, \nrather than trying to find a solution that worked for both security and \nliberty, said: We will start talking about requiring companies to \nactually build weaknesses into their products.\n  I and others have pointed out that once you do that, hang on to your \nhat. When the good guys have the keys, that is one thing, but when \ncompanies are required to build weaknesses into their products, the bad \nguys are going to get the keys in a hurry, too. And with all the cyber \nhacking and the risks we already have, we ought to be really careful \nabout going where Mr. Comey, our FBI Director, has proposed to go.\n  But that is not for tonight. Tonight is not an occasion where we will \nbe able to, on a bipartisan basis, close the backdoor-search loophole \nor where we will be able to come up with a sensible policy with respect \nto encryption rather than requiring companies to actually build \nweaknesses in their products. We will not be able to do that tonight. \nBut we will now have a chance here in the Senate to take steps that \nhave been bipartisan both here in the Senate and in the other body, in \nthe House of Representatives, to end the bulk phone records collection \nprogram because it doesn't make us safer and it threatens our \nliberties.\n  I always like to close by thinking about Ben Franklin, who said that \nanybody who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't \ndeserve either.\n  I am so pleased to have a chance to serve with my colleague from New \nMexico on the Intelligence Committee, who is going to be a thoughtful \nadvocate for these kinds of policies, in my view, for many years to \ncome. I thank him for his involvement tonight and would be happy to \ngive him the last word of our colloquy at this time.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon. I think he could not \nhave chosen a more appropriate way to end than to reference what Ben \nFranklin said so many years ago, that great quote that ``those who \nwould give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, \ndeserve neither Liberty nor Safety.''\n  While many reforms still lie in front of us, I think, as we move \nforward to approving the USA FREEDOM Act, we move a lot closer to the \nbalance that Ben Franklin articulated so well over 200 years ago. I \nlook forward to working with my colleague from Oregon and all of our \ncolleagues in achieving that balance and standing up for our \nconstituents.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we did not have to end up here, just hours \naway from the midnight expiration of three surveillance authorities, \nand having just moved to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I have tried since last year to move legislation through the Senate \nto address these sunsets. In November, Senator Reid brought the USA \nFREEDOM Act to the floor but the Republican leadership of the Senate \nblocked debate on it. When they took over the Senate, they assured us \nthat they would send bills--including this one--through appropriate \ncommittee process. There were promises that the new leadership would \nnot fill the amendment tree, and would use a transparent legislative \nprocess. But not one of those promises has been fulfilled with respect \nto any legislation dealing with the upcoming sunsets.\n  Once again this year, I proposed with Senator Lee a new version of \nthe USA FREEDOM Act. That bill had significant process in the House, \nwhere it passed by an overwhelming margin earlier this month. And once \nagain, the bipartisan coalition here in the Senate tried to get the \nbill passed. Two Fridays ago, the Senate Republican leadership did not \nallow us to debate the bill.\n  Tonight, the Senate did the right thing by invoking cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I am glad to see several \nRepublicans switched their votes. This is significant progress, but it \nis late in coming.\n  We should have proceeded to this bill two Fridays ago. Had we done \nso, we could have stayed here to do our work, considered amendments, \nand passed the bill well in advance of tonight's sunset. Instead, we \nare hours away from expiration and just now considering legislation \nthat many of us have been working on for years. Our intelligence \ncommunity needs predictability and certainty, not a manufactured \ncrisis.\n  If all Senators cooperate, we can finish this bill tonight. We can \nconsider a\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nhandful of amendments under a time agreement, and pass this bill before \nmidnight. That would be the responsible thing to do.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Ed has a long track record in Iowa \nand Washington as a leading advocate in health care policy reform. He \nalso served in numerous leadership roles at the American Medical Group \nAssociation, chairing its public policy committee for 4 years and \nserving as chairman of its board.\n  Mr. Brown has had a distinguished career in health care in Iowa, \nwhere he has served for the last 21 years as chief executive officer of \nthe Iowa Clinic, a multispecialty group practice in Des Moines. The \nIowa Clinic is the largest physician-owned multispecialty group in \ncentral Iowa, with nearly 200 physicians and health care providers \npracticing in 40 specialties. The clinic serves a population area of \n1.1 million, averaging 400,000 patient visits each year.\n  Ed has a long list of achievements in delivering cutting edge, \nquality-focused health care to the benefit of Iowans, and his \nachievements include the Iowa Clinic's adoption of electronic medical \nrecords and information technology systems. He holds a bachelor's \ndegree in nursing from the University of Evansville and a master's \ndegree in health administration from Washington University in St. \nLouis. Also, he is a fellow of the American College of Healthcare \nExecutives, with more than 30 years of experience in executive and \nsenior levels of health care management.\n  As an advocate for multispecialty medical groups and AMGA, Ed has \nbeen a leader in promoting a model of care delivery and an organization \nthat represents some of the Nation's highest quality and most \nprestigious health care delivery systems. It is wonderful to see \nsomeone with such a distinguished health care record in Iowa recognized \nat the national level as a dedicated leader who is committed to \nimproving health care at such an important time for our Nation's health \ncare delivery system.\n  Ed's voice has been an invaluable contribution to the health care \ndebate in this country, and I congratulate him on this deserved \nrecognition for his countless achievements in the public policy realm. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/31/senate-section/article/S3341-5", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate on January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 26, 2015, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Harris) has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1690.

Res. 188\n\n       Whereas American Craft Beer Week is celebrated annually in \n     breweries, brew pubs, restaurants, and beer stores by craft \n     brewers, home brewers, and beer enthusiasts nationwide;\n       Whereas in 2015, American Craft Beer Week is celebrated \n     from May 11 to May 17;\n       Whereas craft brewers are a vibrant affirmation and \n     expression of the entrepreneurial\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\n     traditions of the United States, operating as community-based \n     small businesses, providing employment for 115,000 full- and \n     part-time workers, and generating annually more than \n     $3,000,000,000 in wages and benefits;\n       Whereas the United States has craft brewers in every State \n     and more than 3,500 craft breweries nationwide, each \n     producing fewer than 6,000,000 barrels of beer annually;\n       Whereas in 2014, 615 new breweries opened in the United \n     States, creating jobs and improving economic conditions in \n     communities across the United States;\n       Whereas in 2014, craft breweries in the United States \n     produced more than 22,000,000 barrels of beer, which is \n     3,300,000 more barrels than craft breweries produced in 2013;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States now export \n     more than 383,000 barrels of beer and are establishing new \n     markets abroad, which creates more domestic jobs to meet the \n     growing international demand for craft beer from the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States support \n     United States agriculture by purchasing barley, malt, and \n     hops that are grown, processed, and distributed in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States produce more \n     than 100 distinct styles of flavorful beers, including many \n     sought-after new and unique styles ranging from smoked \n     porters to pumpkin peach ales that--\n       (1) contribute to a favorable balance of trade by reducing \n     United States dependence on imported beers;\n       (2) support United States exports; and\n       (3) promote United States tourism;\n\n       Whereas craft beers from the United States consistently win \n     international quality and taste awards;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States strive to \n     educate the people of the United States who are of legal \n     drinking age about the differences in beer flavor, aroma, \n     color, alcohol content, body, and other complex variables, \n     the gastronomic qualities of beer, beer history, and \n     historical brewing traditions dating back to colonial times \n     and earlier;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States champion the \n     message of responsible enjoyment to their customers and work \n     within their communities and the industry to prevent alcohol \n     abuse and underage drinking;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States are \n     frequently involved in local communities through \n     philanthropy, volunteerism, and sponsorship opportunities, \n     including parent-teacher associations, Junior Reserve \n     Officers' Training Corps (JROTC), hospitals for children, \n     chambers of commerce, humane societies, rescue squads, \n     athletic teams, and disease research;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States are fully \n     vested in the future success, health, welfare, and vitality \n     of their communities as local employers who provide a diverse \n     array of quality local jobs that will not be outsourced, who \n     contribute to the local tax base; and who keep money in the \n     United States by reinvesting in their businesses; and\n       Whereas increased Federal, State, and local support of \n     craft brewing is important to fostering the continued growth \n     of an industry of the United States that creates jobs, \n     greatly benefits local economies, and brings international \n     accolades to small businesses in the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate--\n       (1) appreciates the goals of American Craft Beer Week, \n     established by the Brewers Association, which represents the \n     small craft brewers of the United States;\n       (2) recognizes the significant contributions of the craft \n     brewers of the United States to the economy and to the \n     communities in which the craft brewers are located; and\n       (3) commends the craft brewers of the United States for \n     providing jobs, supporting United States agriculture, \n     improving the balance of trade, and educating the people of \n     the United States and beer lovers around the world about the \n     history and culture of beer while promoting the legal and \n     responsible consumption of beer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/31/senate-section/article/S3342-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1441.
