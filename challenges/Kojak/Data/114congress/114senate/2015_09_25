Mr. President, grace under pressure; country and \ninstitution before self. These are the things that come to mind when I \nthink of John Boehner. He is an ally, he is a friend, and he took over \nas Republican leader at a very difficult time for his party.\n  When some said Republicans could never recover, he never gave up. \nWhen some gave into defeatism, he kept up the fight. And because he \ndid, Speaker Boehner was able to transform a broken and dispirited \nRepublican minority into the largest Republican majority since the \n1920s. That is a legacy few can match.\n  He flew across the country more times than he can count to support \nMembers of his conference and to recruit new Members to the cause. As \nthe leader of a new majority, he turned the tide in Congress and \nbrought conservative reform in many areas. He worked tirelessly to \nprovide hope to those who dreamed of a better life and to middle-class \nfamilies who struggled under the weight of this administration.\n  John knows what it is like to struggle and to dream of something \nbetter. He has lived it. That a young man from Reading, OH, wielding a \nbar towel could one day wield the gavel of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives reminds us of the continuing promise of this country.\n  We all know yesterday was an incredibly important event for the \nSpeaker. It was his aim to bring the same spirit of grace to others \nthat has always guided his life. One only had to look out onto the \nCapitol lawn to see what he achieved. And that he chose this moment to \nmake this decision means he is willing to leave us in a similar spirit.\n  I know we will all have more to say then. But for now, thank you, my \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/senate-section/article/S6951-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I, like most of America, was stunned this \nmorning to learn that John Boehner is going to resign in the next few \nweeks. I have had a relationship with John Boehner for a long time. His \nbecoming Speaker, of course, made those relations much more close.\n  I have not always agreed, and I wasn't always happy with what John \ntold me, but he never ever misled me. He never told me something that \nwasn't true, and I accepted that. I got to where I understood John \nBoehner very well. His word was always good.\n  John and I had a lot of dealings--so-called back-channel meetings. \nEveryone knows that a lot of things we do are not in the public eye. \nAnd certainly some things we worked on together perhaps wouldn't have \nworked out very well in the public eye, but there were things we had to \ndo to get things done.\n  I had a very good relationship with John Boehner. My staff got along \nwith his. He has had two chiefs of staff and they have both been \nterrific to work with. My staff has reached out to them on so many \noccasions in very difficult times, and they had a good relationship.\n  I have no doubt that everything John Boehner has done has been done \nwith the fact in mind that he was doing his best for the people of his \ndistrict in\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\nOhio and for our country. He had a very difficult job.\n  I know the Presiding Officer served under John Boehner and so he \nknows what a tough job he had. He had this faction, that faction, \nanother faction, and a couple more. But ousting a man like John \nBoehner--a good man like John Boehner. John Boehner is a conservative \nRepublican, but his problem is that John Boehner has been pragmatic. He \nhas realized there comes a time when you have to make a deal.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer and everyone within the sound of my \nvoice, although I didn't know General Eisenhower, President \nEisenhower--never met him, never saw him--but I was here when Ronald \nReagan was President and he had conservative credentials. Ronald Reagan \nwas somebody who understood the art of compromise. Who else could have \nworked out something with the Soviet Union? I am not sure there is \nanybody, but Ronald Reagan was able to do that.\n  I am so concerned. I am seeing the Republican Party--not the party of \nDwight Eisenhower, as I have studied him, or the man Ronald Reagan as I \nknew him. I just think it is very, very sad the Tea Party Caucus the \nRepublican leaders have embraced to win in 2010, I guess, now have \ntaken over control of the party.\n  To say I will miss John Boehner is a tremendous understatement. I \nlooked out for him in ways I could, and he looked out for me in the \nways he could. I will always consider John Boehner my friend, and I \nlook forward to working with him until he leaves. I understand it is \ngoing to be in late October, but I will continue to work with him, as I \nhave in the past, to do what I think is the right thing for the \ncountry, as I am confident he will. Hopefully, we will continue \nsomeplace in the middle to get things done. I have gotten things done \nwith John Boehner that I wasn't happy with, and he wasn't happy with \nwhat we had to come up with, but sometimes you do the best you can.\n  I wish John Boehner the very best in the future. Whatever I can do to \nmake his life more pleasant, I will be happy to do that. Whether it is \nsetting up a golf game for him in Las Vegas or helping in some \ngovernment matter, I will do whatever I can because John Boehner, as \nfar as I am concerned, is a good man, and it is a gross underestimate \nto say I will miss him. I will.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to say a few words \nabout a critical challenge and opportunity facing the United States. \nFor months many of us have been on the floor debating some of the \nimportant foreign policy and national security issues that our Nation \nfaces--whether it is Islamic terrorism, ISIS, the President's flawed \nand dangerous Iran agreement or a resurgent Russia in Europe and the \nArctic. The list of these issues is long, and it is growing. But one \nissue that has not really gotten much attention--I believe the \nattention that it deserves--and that I would like to speak about this \nafternoon is the long-term national security and foreign policy \nconsequences of the rise of China.\n  China's President Xi Jinping is in town right now. He is visiting \nAmerica. He is going to meet with President Obama on a state visit, and \nsome of us in Congress will have an opportunity to meet with him later \ntoday. It is an opportunity to start seriously thinking about the \nchallenges and opportunities that a rising China presents to the world \nand to the United States.\n  Perhaps we are not talking about this issue as much as we should on \nthe floor because it doesn't seem to be an immediate issue. It is a bit \nof a longer term matter. But it is also something that in historical \nterms is happening so fast. I will give one statistic.\n  In 1980 China's economy was smaller than that of the Netherlands. \nLast year, just the incremental growth of China's economy was as large \nas the Netherlands' economy. They have had incredible growth. But some \nof our country's most deep and strategic thinkers and historians agree \nthat the rise of China is--over the next decade or two--the paramount \nissue for us to focus on in the United States.\n  As far back as 2005, 10 years ago almost to the day, then-Deputy \nSecretary of State Bob Zellick, who went on to be the president of the \nWorld Bank and a former U.S. Trade Representative for the United \nStates, a very strategic thinker, gave what was called the \n``responsible stakeholders'' speech, a very well-renowned speech that \npeople are still reading on U.S.-China relations.\n  In that speech 10 years ago, he said: ``How the United States deals \nwith China's rising power is a central question in American foreign \npolicy.''\n  Just a few months ago in testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee, Harvard Professor Graham Allison gave testimony that in many \nways is reflected in an article he just published in the Atlantic \nyesterday on the eve of the visit of the President of China. He states \nin that article and in his testimony from a couple of months ago:\n\n       The preeminent geostrategic challenge of this era is not \n     violent Islamic extremists, or a resurgent Russia. It is the \n     impact that China's ascendance will have on the U.S.-led \n     national order.\n\n  More specifically, Professor Allison writes that ``the defining \nquestion about global order for this generation is whether China and \nthe United States can escape''--what he refers to as ``the Thucydides \ntrap.''\n  He is referencing the renowned ancient Greek historian.\n  Professor Allison coined this term to describe the strategic dilemma \nand dangers that occur when a rising power rivals a ruling power, as \nwhen--an example he gives in ancient Greece--Athens challenged Sparta \nin ancient Greece which ultimately led to the Peloponnesian War.\n  Professor Allison has caught the attention of many, including \nPresident Xi Jinping of China, who in a speech just a few days ago in \nSeattle actually referenced this term--the ``Thucydides trap''--when \ntalking about U.S.-China relations. Now, both Professor Allison and \nPresident Xi, in his speech, make it clear that conflict between the \nUnited States and China is certainly not inevitable, regardless of what \nhe says with regard to the Thucydides trap, and I certainly would agree \nwith that. Professor Allison, however, does appear to draw some very \nsobering conclusions in his recent article that should make all of us \ntake serious pause. He concludes in his article written yesterday: \n``War between the U.S. and China is more likely than recognized at the \nmoment.'' These are his words, not mine. This is one of the most \ndistinguished professors of international relations in the United \nStates.\n  I think these words underscore the need for those of us in the Senate \nto give due attention to the importance of the U.S.-China relationship \nand the attendant risks of Graham Allison's Thucydides trap.\n  Fortunately, I believe we are well-positioned as an institution in \nthe Senate to do this. In the Federalist Papers, Madison talks about \none of the roles of the U.S. Senate with its Members having 6-year \nterms to be able to ensure lasting relations between the United States \nand other nations through the institution of the Senate. Perhaps more \nthan any other part of the Federal Government, this institution has the \nopportunity to think strategically and act for the long-term interests \nof our country.\n  Fortunately, we also have many experts, historians, professors, and \npractitioners, whether it is people such as Bob Zoellick or Graham \nAllison or Henry Kissinger or a new generation of scholars, such as \nMike Green at CSIS, who have been thinking about these issues--the \nAsia-Pacific, the rise in China--for decades. Their articles, books, \nand speeches are critical to devising national strategies to advance \nAmerica's interests in the region.\n  This is a long-term endeavor for all of us. It is imperative that it \nremains on our radar screens through the\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\ncourse of State visits, through the course of elections, through the \ncourse of changing administrations. Contrary to what some say, we as a \ncountry do have the capacity to think and act in our long-term \nstrategic interests as a government.\n  Our successful bipartisan strategy dealing with the Soviet Union, \nstarted by Kennan's famous ``X'' telegram, which created the strategy \nof containment over the course of decades, over the course of several \nadministrations and several different Congresses--it was a successful \nlong-term strategy for the United States.\n  From my perspective, as we look at this issue--the Asia-Pacific--its \nimportance--the rise of China--I think a few key touchstones are \nimportant to remember. First, America is an Asia-Pacific power. My \nState of Alaska is an Asia-Pacific State. The United States has strong \nnetworks of alliances throughout the Asia-Pacific, and our country has \nbuilt the post-World War II architecture that has enabled this dynamic \nregion of the world to thrive in terms of peace and in terms of \nprosperity. In fact, when we look at the last 70 years of history in \nthat region, we have been the linchpin of that peace and prosperity for \nall countries in the region, whether our strongest allies such as Japan \nand Korea and Australia or other countries--countries even like China--\nand we have earned the trust of our allies for our commitment. So we \nneed to maintain that trust as we move forward and we need to listen to \nour allies in the region.\n  Second, we need to understand the history of the region and our \ninvolvement there better as we think through what the strategy is \nmoving forward. I have had the opportunity to go to the National \nArchives a number of times already since I joined the Senate, and there \nis a statue outside the National Archives and it has a command on it. \nIt says simply: ``Study the past.'' Study the past. Again, I think that \nas we are looking at our strategy in that region, it is critical that \nwe need to be doing that. Professor Allison's article, as well as \nbooks, is a good start, and I think all of us need to continue that \nfocus.\n  Third, no matter what strategy we end up using vis-a-vis China and \nthe Asia-Pacific region, we have to be strong again at home. My biggest \nsurprise as a new freshman Senator--my biggest surprise in this body is \nhow little we, or certainly for that matter the Obama administration, \ntalk about our economy, talk about the strength or the lack thereof of \nour economy. Perhaps because the performance of our economy has been so \nlackluster, we have even doubled down expectations.\n  They have this term now in Washington called ``the new normal.'' \nAmerican growth rates have typically been at 3, 3.5, 4 percent GDP \ngrowth throughout most of our history. Over the last 6 years, we can \nbarely break 2 percent GDP growth; 1.5, 2 percent. Two quarters ago, we \nwent back into recession. They are now calling this the new normal and \nwe need to accept this. We rarely hear the President or even the \nTreasury Secretary come out to the American people and say: No, we have \nto grow traditional levels of American growth--3.5, 5 percent, 4 \npercent GDP growth. The Presiding Officer knows this. He has focused on \nthis issue. We are not doing that. We have to get back to strength at \nhome because a continued weak U.S. economy--the new normal--growing at \n1.5 percent for the next 5, 10 years will create all kinds of \nadditional challenges for us and in my view will make the Thucydides \ntrap that Professor Allison talks about more likely for the United \nStates and China.\n\n  Yes, China has certain advantages, but in so many areas--in so many \nareas--the United States holds all the cards--in so many different \nareas. If we were in a global poker match and we were all at the \ntable--all the big countries--we would look at our hand and we would \nsee aces. Let me just name a few.\n  The high-tech sector, still the envy of the world; not just Silicon \nValley, all over America.\n  Our agriculture sector. We feed the world.\n  Universities. We have the best universities in the world, by far--by \nfar. Certain States in America have better top universities than all of \nChina.\n  Finance and commercial aspects of our economy, the best \nentrepreneurs.\n  Energy. We have a renaissance in energy where we are now the largest \nproducer of oil and gas in the world and the largest producer of \nrenewables. This is a huge advantage. It is creating a rebirth of \nmanufacturing in America.\n  Fisheries. We harvest some of the most amazing seafood, more than \nalmost any other country in the world.\n  Foreign relations. We look at our allies in Asia, they are coming to \nthe United States in terms of wanting to deepen their relationship with \nus.\n  And, of course, the U.S. military, the finest in the world right now. \nIt is right now. I had the opportunity to go down to the World War II \nMemorial this morning and I saw a couple of Honor Flights coming in, \nseeing those veterans of ours who fought and defended this great Nation \nin World War II. We have had the best military for decades, and we are \ngoing to continue to do that.\n  The key is we have to unleash our economic might once again, which \nhas been so dormant during the Obama administration. We have to do \nthis. If we do this, we can view the rise of China from a standpoint of \nstrength, confidence, and opportunity, not trepidation.\n  As Bob Zoellick mentioned 10 years ago in his ``Responsible \nStakeholders'' speech: ``You hear voices that perceive China solely \nthrough the lens of fear, but America succeeds when we look to the \nfuture as an opportunity, not when we fear what the future might \nbring.''\n  I have had the opportunity to view the U.S.-China relationship from a \nvariety of lenses, including economic, diplomatic, and even to some \ndegree military. I previously served as the commissioner of natural \nresources and energy in Alaska and was able to take a trip over there \nwith some Alaskans to look at ways to deepen our economic, trade, and \nenergy relationship between my State and China and have them visit \nAlaska and participate in those meetings. I served in terms of \ndiplomacy as an assistant secretary of state and have had numerous \nopportunities to travel to China with some of our top U.S. Government \nleaders--at the time Bob Zoellick, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, \nand Secretary of State Rice--to discuss ways in which to deepen \neconomic relationships and work on the U.S.-China relationship.\n  Even many years ago as a U.S. marine aboard an amphibious assault \nship in the East and South China Sea during the third Taiwan Strait \ncrisis, I was a very, very, very small player in an episode that once \nagain demonstrated American resolve and commitment in the region.\n  There is a long tradition from Alaska Senators in keeping a focus on \nthe importance of the Asia-Pacific, from both the Alaska and the U.S. \nperspective.\n  Former Senator Ted Stevens served in World War II as a Flying Tiger, \nflying the Hump in that part of the world, and his subsequent focus \nthroughout his career was very much on the Asia-Pacific, as was Frank \nMurkowski's expertise and experience, particularly with regard to our \nrelationship with Taiwan.\n  The focus on the Asia-Pacific and the rise of China is certainly one \nthat in many ways we can view as an opportunity, certainly in my State. \nLast year, China became the No. 1 export market for Alaskan goods: $1.4 \nbillion of goods exported from Alaska to China--an 18-percent increase. \nSo I believe maintaining this focus--and we have this visit today with \nthe President of China--is critically important not only to my State, \nnot only to our country but also to our allies in the region.\n  We should all try to put more focus and our best thinking on these \ncritical foreign policy and national security issues which, although \nthey are not always on the front page of the papers, I believe are some \nof the most important long-term strategic challenges and opportunities \nwe face in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/senate-section/article/S6954-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JENNY DAVIS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, Louisianians are committed to \npreserving the traditions that make us profoundly unique as a State and \nas a nation. This is especially true in the Louisiana Purchase's oldest \ncity Natchitoches, LA, home to Small Business of the Week, the Judge \nPorter House Bed and Breakfast.\n  Nestled in the Cane River National Heritage Area, the Judge Porter \nHouse Bed and Breakfast offers a unique experience to its guests. Built \nin 1912, the establishment originally served as the home of ``Judge'' \nThomas Fitzgerald Porter and his wife, Wilhelmina. While not an actual \njudge, judge Porter was a prominent figure who worked at the parish \ncourthouse, and during the course of his life, he enjoyed the honorary \ntitle. Over the next few decades, the home was sold to various families \nwho contributed to the effort of restoring the property to its original \nstate. By 1987, while in the care of Mark Rachal and his wife, Sharon, \nthey remodeled the interior and revamped the landscaping for the home's \ngrand reopening in 1996 as a part of the Natchitoches Historic \nFoundation's Annual Fall Pilgrimage.\n  Today, under the management and care of Charles LaCaze, Jr., the \n3,000-square-foot property incorporates many turn-of-the-century \narchitectural elements throughout its five guest rooms, two parlors, \nand the Queen Anne-style gallery that wraps around the house. Each \nyear, the Judge Porter House Bed and Breakfast hosts guests from around \nthe Nation. Located in downtown Natchitoches, LA, visitors can walk to \nvarious local restaurants and shops, as well as visit nearby national \nparks and fish hatcheries after enjoying a traditional southern-style \nbreakfast.\n  Congratulations to Judge Porter Bed and Breakfast for being selected \nas Small Business of the Week. Thank you for your commitment to the \npreservation of Louisiana's rich history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/25/senate-section/article/S6954-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:06 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 261.
