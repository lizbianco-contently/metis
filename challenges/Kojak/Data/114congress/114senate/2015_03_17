Mr. President, in about an hour the Democratic Party \nwill confront a momentous choice. Will Democrats launch a historic \nfilibuster against helping oppressed victims of modern slavery because \nleftwing lobbyists appear to demand it? Will they do that at the behest \nof these leftwing lobbyists?\n  Democrats filibustering help for terrified children and abused women \nwould represent a new low in the Senate. Filibustering help for \nterrified children and abused women certainly represents a new low for \nthe Senate, and the American people will not soon forget it--nor should \nthey. It is hard to even keep straight anymore why Democrats would \nfilibuster this human rights bill.\n  The bill Democrats apparently now oppose was introduced months ago by \na Democrat and a Republican. The bill Democrats now oppose was \noriginally cosponsored by 13 of our Democratic friends. Thirteen of \nthem cosponsored it. The bill Democrats now oppose was approved by \nevery Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Every single Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee supported the bill.\n  The bill Democrats now oppose was brought to the floor last Monday \nafter Democrats agreed unanimously to do that. But that was Monday. By \nTuesday, Democrats were threatening to launch a historic filibuster \nagainst helping the abused and the enslaved--launching a filibuster \nagainst the abused and the enslaved.\n  Democrats' supposed rationale was that they had not bothered to read \nthe very bill they introduced, cosponsored, and voted for. That in \nitself is a stunning admission. But as embarrassing as this admission \nmight be for Democrats, it doesn't tell the full story. It is obviously \nabsurd to believe that not a single one of the 13 Democrats who \noriginally cosponsored this bill and not a single member of any of \nthese Democrats' well-educated staff would have read this bill before \nagreeing to support it. It is really hard to believe; isn't it?\n  The bipartisan Hyde language Democrats now cite as the basis for \ntheir human rights filibuster would not have been hard to find. It was \nsitting right there on page 4.\n  Democrats would have recognized the bipartisan Hyde provision easily \nbecause so many Democrats voted to support the same bipartisan \nprovision just 3 months ago in December. It was in the CRomnibus that \nmost of our Democratic friends voted for in December--the very same \nlanguage. So they surely would have recognized it sitting right there \non page 4.\n  The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee certainly would have \nnoticed the Hyde provision he supported in December. He actually \noffered an unrelated amendment to the very same page as the provision \nhe now objects to.\n  The bipartisan Hyde language is supported by about 7 in 10 Americans. \nHow do the American people feel about the Hyde language? The Hyde \nlanguage is supported by 7 out of 10 Americans as a policy principle \nand has been part and parcel of the legislating process for decades. It \nappears in just about every funding bill we consider, and it appears in \nnumerous authorizing bills that have received bipartisan support.\n  Not surprisingly, the leadership of the House of Representatives said \nlast\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nnight that ``any House-Senate agreement on a trafficking bill that \nincludes a victims fund will'' have to contain ``the Hyde Amendment, as \nwe have done for nearly 40 years.'' So the House of Representatives \nsays that any bill that passes the House will also include this \nlanguage.\n  What about that great bastion of conservatism--the Washington Post? \nThe Washington Post recently noted in an editorial that ``the Hyde Act \nhas been in force for four decades,'' and pointedly asked whether the \ninclusion of this bipartisan provision ``justifies the defeat of this \nimportant legislation.'' Given the long legislative history of this \nbipartisan provision and the overwhelmingly popular support for what it \ndoes, the answer, obviously, is no. No, most of our colleagues on the \nother side voted for this very same provision 3 months ago.\n  Let's remember what this debate should really be about. It should not \nbe about what leftwing lobbyists want. It should be about helping the \nvictims of modern slavery--victims such as Melissa, whom my colleague \nSenator Cornyn has spoken about before. She was sold into the sex trade \nwhen she was just 12 years old. She was beaten regularly and chained to \na bed in a warehouse. She was even set on fire by those who enslaved \nher. That is Melissa's story. She said she just wanted to die.\n  When Melissa finally escaped the grasp of her tormenters, she was not \ntreated like a victim. Melissa was treated like a criminal by our \njustice system. It is stories such as Melissa's that should motivate \nevery Member of this Chamber to act.\n  The victims who suffer in dark warehouses may not have the same clout \nas the lobbyists who appear to oppose this bill, but these victims need \nour help, and they need it now. So if there truly are Senators who are \nconcerned with removing a bipartisan provision they have supported so \nmany times in the past, they should offer an amendment to strike it and \nthen stop blocking this human rights bill. I offered them a chance to \ndo just that last week.\n  Let's have a vote--a simple majority vote--on a measure they now \nbelatedly find they object to, having supported it in the past, and \nthen, as an official with the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women \nput it: ``Win or lose and move on.'' But as it stands now, in her \nwords, ``Senate Democrats are choosing a phantom problem over real \nvictims.'' That is the spokesman for the Coalition Against Trafficking \nin Women.\n  The White House needs to get involved here too. So far the White \nHouse has barely lifted a finger to help us pass this legislation, and \nthat needs to change. I think the White House should do this because it \nis the right thing to do. But if that is not enough, they should also \nconsider the consequences of Democrats making a historic mistake.\n  If Democrats actually vote to filibuster help for oppressed victims \nof modern slavery, I cannot imagine that the American people will \nforget it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1560-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the longest serving Member of this body is \nthe President pro tempore emeritus of the Senate, Patrick Leahy of \nVermont. He came to this body in January of 1975, 40 years and 2 months \nago. But nipping at his heels is an individual well-known in this \nChamber, Ruby Paone. Ruby came to the Senate right out of college and \nhas worked in the Reception Room and other places in the Senate for \ndecades--four decades, in fact.\n  Today marks Ruby's 40th anniversary of working in the Senate. To put \nthat in perspective, she has worked through 7 different Presidential \nadministrations, 16 different Sergeants at Arms, and has seen 383 \nSenators serve in this Chamber during her time.\n  After working with 383 different Senators, one would think that maybe \nshe could not remember these names and faces, but that is not Ruby. She \nknows everyone and remembers everything during her time here in the \nSenate.\n  During these 40 years in the Senate, a lot has happened, not the \nleast of which is meeting her husband, whom we all know, Marty. Marty \nalso worked in the Senate for many, many years, eventually serving as \nthe secretary of the majority, and we all depended on him so much.\n  In fact, Ruby and Marty were both here in the Capitol working on \ntheir wedding day. The Senate was in session until 12 p.m. that day. \nMarty and Ruby decided to get married 3 hours later, and they did.\n  Ruby and Marty have three wonderful children. I can remember their \ncareers in soccer and working their way through school. Their children \nare Alexander, Stephanie, and Tommy. Ruby and Marty are rightly very \nproud of these three fine young people, one girl, Stephanie, and the \ntwo boys.\n\n  No words can adequately sum up the 40 years of service to our \ncountry, but Adlai Stevenson came close when he said: ``Patriotism is \nnot a short and frenzied outburst of emotion but the tranquil and \nsteady dedication of a lifetime.''\n  I appreciate very much Ruby's steadfast dedication. I admire her \ncontinued support of this institution that is very dear to so many of \nus. Thank you, Ruby, for your 40 years of faithful service, and we look \nforward to many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1560-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1560-S1561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that \nappeared and was posted last night at 7:14 p.m. in the Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 16, 2015]\n\n    Affordable Care Act Adds 16.4 Million to Health Insurance Rolls\n\n                          (By Lenny Bernstein)\n\n       About 16.4 million adults have been added to health \n     insurance rolls under the Affordable Care Act, which provided \n     especially robust gains in coverage for minorities and states \n     that expanded their Medicaid programs, administration \n     officials announced Monday.\n       The total includes 14.1 million adults who joined the \n     insurance rolls since October 2013 and 2.3 million younger \n     adults ages 19 to 25 who were able to remain on their \n     parents' health insurance plans since October 2010, when that \n     provision of Obamacare went into effect.\n       Richard Frank, the assistant secretary for planning and \n     evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     called the gains ``historic,'' comparing the impact to the \n     creation of Medicare and Medicaid in the mid-1960s.\n       HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said she was \n     ``pleased'' with the numbers but added that the government \n     still can enroll greater numbers of African Americans and \n     Latinos.\n       ``African American, Latino [rates] are not exactly where \n     you want to be, because the [uninsured] numbers are still \n     high,'' Burwell said. ``I believe we can do more.''\n       The Latino uninsured rate dropped by 12.3 percentage points \n     between the first quarter of 2014 and the same period in 2015 \n     as 4.2 million adults gained coverage. That ethnic group, \n     however, continues to have the lowest rate of insurance \n     coverage.\n       About 2.3 million African Americans enrolled, dropping that \n     group's uninsured rate by 9.2 percentage points, and 6.6 \n     million whites obtained coverage, a decline of 5.3 percentage \n     points.\n       The data are based on surveys conducted for HHS. The totals \n     do not show whether an individual obtained coverage through \n     the new insurance marketplaces, a private employer or some \n     other method. No numbers on children were included.\n       States that decided to expand their Medicaid insurance \n     programs for the poor recorded bigger gains than those that \n     didn't, reducing their uninsured rate by 7.4 percentage \n     points as compared with 6.9 points for states that declined \n     to expand.\n       Meena Seshamani, director of HHS's Office of Health Reform, \n     said the 16.4 million newly covered adults no longer need to \n     put off health care ``because they can't afford it'' or \n     ``worry about going broke'' if they face a serious illness.\n       ``Today's news is good for the health and financial \n     security of millions of Americans,'' she said.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, referring to this article just printed in \nthe Record: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released \nsome very good news, further proof that ObamaCare is working and \ninsuring millions of Americans--16.4 million to be exact.\n  Reading from the Washington Post report that is now part of this \nRecord, I state:\n\n       About 16.4 million adults have been added to health \n     insurance rolls under the Affordable Care Act, which provided \n     especially robust gains in coverage for minorities--\n\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\n\n  And everyone, in fact--\n\n     and states that expanded their Medicaid programs, \n     administration officials announced Monday.\n       The total includes 14.1 million adults who joined the \n     insurance rolls since October 2013 and 2.3 million younger \n     adults ages 19 to 25 who were able to remain on their \n     parents' health insurance plans since October 2010, when that \n     provision of Obamacare went into effect.\n\n  As if that weren't enough good news, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services also reported that uninsured rates for minorities are \nplunging.\n  Quote:\n\n       The Latino uninsured rate dropped by 12.3 percentage points \n     between the first quarter of 2014 and the same period in 2015 \n     as 4.2 million adults gained coverage. . . .\n       About 2.3 million African Americans enrolled, dropping that \n     group's uninsured rate by 9.2 percentage points, and 6.6 \n     million whites obtained coverage, a decline of 5.3 percentage \n     points.\n\n  So it is clear that the Affordable Care Act is working just as \nCongress intended.\n  Not only are record numbers of Americans gaining health coverage, but \nhistorically underinsured communities are now getting access to quality \nhealth care.\n  At some point, my Republican colleagues need to face reality. \nObamaCare is helping their constituents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1561-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION AND LORETTA LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to speak a little bit about human \ntrafficking and Loretta Lynch.\n  The Republican leader is right. In an hour or so the Senate will vote \nto end debate on the human trafficking and child pornography \nlegislation. That vote is going to fail. The Republican leader knows it \nis going to fail, just as I do. It is going to fail because Republicans \nhave chosen to manufacture a political fight that has nothing to do \nwith human trafficking.\n  Abortion legislation has no place in human trafficking legislation. \nThe Republican Congressman who drafted this version of the human \ntrafficking bill in the House said as much. Congressman Erik Paulsen \nsaid: ``There is no reason it should be included in these bills. This \nissue is far too important to tie it up with an unrelated fight with \npolitics as usual.''\n  We have a long piece out of the New York Times. My friend quoted \npartially from the Washington Post. But let's be realistic. There has \nbeen a sleight of hand here to get the abortion language in this bill.\n  As this article indicates:\n\n       This legislation, which sailed through committee in \n     February, stalled last week when Democrats noticed a \n     provision that would prohibit money in the fund from being \n     used to pay for abortions. The original Senate bill, \n     introduced in the last Congress, made no reference to \n     abortion. Nor did the House's version of the bill, introduced \n     by Representative Erik Paulsen. Paulsen said, ``there is no \n     reason it should be.'' He said last week, ``This issue is far \n     too important to tie it up with an unrelated fight with \n     politics as usual.''\n       Republicans say they routinely add the abortion language to \n     bills, but Democrats say Republicans operated in bad faith--\n     not to mention in violation of Senate norms--by \n     misrepresenting the bill's contents.\n\n  This dispute has nothing to do with the needs of the Justice \nDepartment. It is beyond irresponsible to strand the Department without \na leader, sowing instability and uncertainty in an important executive \nagency.\n  The chief law enforcement officer of our country is being detained \nbecause of this fight between us, Democrats and Republicans, over \nwhether abortion should be in this bill. We believe it shouldn't be; \nRepublicans believe it should be.\n  This is a good person who deserves our immediate attention. The \nLoretta Lynch nomination should be done immediately. There is no reason \nwe can't do this now, today.\n  Would the Presiding Officer tell us the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1561-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, at 11 a.m. this morning we will be having \na very important vote on human trafficking in an important piece of \nlegislation, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. I am glad this \nissue is finally getting the kind of attention it deserves, but I would \nbe lying to you if I said I wasn't disappointed in the way this bill \nhas become a political football for people who want to cause the Senate \nto cease to function entirely or to relitigate issues that have been \nresolved 40 years ago such as the Hyde amendment.\n  We in the Senate have an opportunity to do a great deal of good for \nthousands of people, including children who are victims of sex \ntrafficking, many of whom are young girls not even of high school age. \nOn average the typical victim of human trafficking is between the age \nof 12 and 14.\n  But instead of voting to pass this bill last week, as I had \noriginally hoped, the minority leader, the Democratic leader, blocked \nthe vote, and he has consistently taken the position that they are not \ngoing to allow us to progress with this legislation. The majority \nleader offered to give the other side a vote to strip out the language \nwhich they find offensive, but that was declined; and instead, the \nobstruction and the blocking of this legislation continues.\n  I would like to come back to the question that I have asked myself \nprivately and I have asked here publicly repeatedly, and that is, Why \nare so many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle objecting \nto language they have repeatedly voted for time and time and time \nagain? Why do they want to make this an issue on this piece of \nlegislation, which is one of the rare islands of bipartisan comity, \ncooperation, and collaboration we have seen in recent times? Most \nimportantly, why are Democrats going to the wall to block a bill that \nwould help thousands of innocent victims of sex trafficking across the \ncountry who are crying out for our help? It truly baffles me, but that \nis what is going on.\n  Of course, we know human trafficking is a problem all across the \ncountry, including my home in Texas. I was recently reminded of a \ncouple of Texas stories about how important it is that we pass this \nlegislation, including a recent story out of Waco, TX, involving the \nBorder Patrol, where it was reported that over the last 5 months the \nBorder Patrol has apprehended 144 known sex offenders trying to sneak \nback into the United States illegally. So reportedly 100,000 people are \ntrafficked each year, according to the Washington Post. They say an \nestimated 100,000 children are trafficked each year for sex. Why in the \nworld can't we find some way to set these differences aside, to fight \nthem another day, and to move on doing some good where we can by \npassing this legislation?\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  It has, unfortunately, become clear that this obstruction is about \npolitics, plain and simple, because you know there is actually a whole \nlot of agreement about the importance of this legislation. For example, \nwe have 12 Democratic cosponsors to this legislation. This bogus story \nyou have heard about language being slipped in the bill that they \ndidn't know was there is just that, completely bogus. Each of these \nDemocrats has highly skilled professional staff, and they themselves \nweren't born last night, didn't fall off the turnip truck. They know \nwhat the legislation included, and it had language in it they had voted \nin favor of repeatedly in previous pieces of legislation.\n  Then there is the fact that all 20 Members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee voted in favor of this legislation, including 9 Democrats, \nall Members of the Judiciary Committee. Then when it came to the floor \nlast week, all 100 Senators basically consented to bring this \nlegislation forward. So why is it that after so much bipartisan \ncooperation and trying to work together to solve a real problem and \nhelp the victims of human trafficking--particularly those 100,000 \nchildren trafficked for sex--how is it this legislation became a \npolitical football to relitigate the Hyde amendment? Well, \nunfortunately, we know the abortion lobby has been working very hard to \nderail this legislation. Why? Because they care about these victims of \nhuman trafficking? Absolutely not, because everyone knows the Hyde \namendment language contains an exception for rape and the health of the \nmother. So under this act, these limitations on spending wouldn't have \nanything to do with the services available to help those victims of \nhuman trafficking.\n  I know that Members of the Senate on the Democratic side care deeply \nabout this issue. I know the ranking member, the former chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, cares deeply about this \nissue. I believe all 12 Democratic cosponsors of this legislation care \ndeeply about this issue, and all Members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--all 20 of us who voted in favor of the legislation--care \ndeeply about this issue. But there is one person who appears not to \ncare one bit about this issue, and that is the senior Senator from \nNevada, the Democratic leader. He apparently doesn't care at all about \nthe victims of human trafficking. If he did, then I think he would find \na way to work with us to pass this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, we are going to have a vote here at 11:00 which is \ngoing to be very telling. I hold out some hope that our Democratic \ncolleagues who cosponsored this legislation or who previously voted for \nlegislation that includes this same type of language or the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee who voted to support this bill at the committee \nmarkup will find a way to vote for cloture to allow us to progress to \nfinal passage of this legislation.\n  There is going to be a very important choice. The choice is simply \nbetween the victims or party and lobbyists and outside groups who are \ntrying to blow this piece of legislation up in order to relitigate the \nsettled law of the land for the last 40 years.\n  In fact, the Washington Post editorial yesterday I think stated the \nissue very well. They said, at the conclusion of their editorial, ``the \nquestion is whether the Senators who want to accomplish something can \novercome the advocacy groups and politicians who would rather use this \ncontroversy as one more opportunity to raise funds and to sharpen \ndivisions.''\n  That is absolutely pathetic, that someone would use the plight of \nthese victims of human trafficking to raise funds and to drive \ndivisions between Americans.\n  So we will find out what the choice is and what Democrats choose. \nWill they follow the lead of the Democratic leader who apparently does \nnot care about the consequences of this obstruction, and will they find \na way in their heart to do what they know is right? Because they voted \nfor this legislation previously, they have agreed to cosponsor it, and, \nof course, as I said, they voted for previous language that is \nidentical to that contained in this bill.\n  I will quote from a Texas newspaper, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, \nwhich published an editorial with the headline ``Anti-Trafficking bill \nis nothing to bicker about.'' That should be obvious, but \nunfortunately, the obvious has to be said, apparently time and time \nagain.\n  The editorial closes with this line, which I find to be poignant. It \nsays:\n\n       This fight is supposed to be against human trafficking. \n     Distracting attention from that fight is shameful.\n\n  It is shameful.\n  Scripture reminds us that it does not profit a person to gain the \nwhole world and lose your soul, and I worry that the Senate is losing \nits soul and its unique role as an institution where we can actually \nwork out our differences, we can have debate, and we can have votes, \nand we can actually make some discernible progress forward on behalf of \nthe people we represent.\n  This is an important time of choosing for Members of the Senate. At \n11 o'clock when we have this vote, we will need a handful of brave and \ncourageous Members of the Senate on the other side of the aisle who \nwill say to their leader: This is a bridge too far. We are not going to \nmarch in lockstep with the leader and take what could be legislation \nthat will help these victims of human trafficking and turn it into a \nfailure.\n  This is a time for choosing. I know there are Senate Democrats who \ncare deeply about the victims of human trafficking. Unfortunately, not \neverybody does, or else we would not be having this obstruction. So I \nhope that our colleagues, in thinking about this vote today--or perhaps \nduring a sleepless moment last night as they were contemplating this \nvery important time of choosing--I hope that they will examine their \nconscience and that they will reflect on the reason why they came to \nthe Senate in the first place. Was it to play these kinds of partisan \npolitical games to advance the fundraising interests of the abortion \nlobby or some other group who wants us to derail this legislation or to \nrelitigate issues that were settled 40 years ago? That is not the \nreason why I believe the overwhelming number of the Senators came to \nthe Senate. They came here because they wanted to do something good, \nsomething positive, something that would help the most vulnerable among \nus.\n  We will have that opportunity here today with this vote at 11 \no'clock. Shame on us if we cannot rise to the occasion, if we cannot \ntranscend this sort of partisan division and the tug at our sleeves by \nthe outside groups who want to derail this important piece of \nlegislation. Shame on us.\n  There is going to be a time of choosing. Everybody who votes will \nmake a record. That record will be part of their permanent legacy in \nthis body. History will reflect whom they chose in this fight--the \n100,000 children who are trafficked for sex in America who might \nbenefit from this legislation or the abortion lobby that wants us to \nrelitigate this issue based on language that every single Democrat has \nvoted for in one fashion or another time and time again.\n  This is a phony fight and a phony issue. We ought to do what is \nright. We ought to pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope we will do what is right, but I hope \nwe will step back from either partisan name-calling or ascribing \nmotives to people. Even though my dear friend from Texas voted against \nthe Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, I am never going to say \nhe is for violence against women or for human trafficking, even though \nthat bill had the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act as \nan amendment in it.\n  While he and the distinguished majority leader, Senator McConnell, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Grassley, and others voted against the Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act, I would not ascribe to them a motive \nthat they believe in violence against women or in human trafficking. \nEven though that legislation had a strong anti-human trafficking \namendment in it, I do not ascribe their vote against the bill as \nadmitting they are for violence against women or human trafficking.\n  One of the lessons that I have learned in my time as a Senator is \nthat if you listen to the people you serve, really listen to them, you \nwill almost always do the right thing. This morning, as\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nsome Senators are trying to shut off debate and end our efforts to \nprovide a comprehensive, victim-centered response to the horrible crime \nof human trafficking, I ask that we stop and listen. Listen to the \nvoices of the survivors. What they are saying is clear: Stop playing \npolitics with our lives.\n  Holly Austin Smith, a survivor, a girl who ran away at the age of 14, \nwho was bought and sold for sex, put it this way:\n\n       Politics should not govern the options available to victims \n     of sex trafficking, especially when such victims often have \n     had their basic human rights taken away by criminals who had \n     only their own agendas in mind.\n\n  We ought to stand with these survivors and put aside our agendas. The \nsurvivors are asking us to vote against this bill because it includes \nunnecessary and destructive, partisan language.\n  A letter signed by the Alliance To End Slavery & Trafficking, \nRights4Girls, Shared Hope International, and nearly 100 other anti-\ntrafficking groups says this:\n\n       We urge all members of the Senate to turn away from this \n     divisive debate and find a bipartisan approach to this new \n     initiative to protect and serve the needs of survivors.\n\n  Two years ago the Senate came together and passed an expansive new \nauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. I realize some in this \nbody who now say we must vote for this bill voted against the Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act. But I worked for months with the \nremarkable people of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic \nViolence, a coalition of thousands of organizations representing \nmillions of victims of domestic and sexual violence.\n  They spent hours upon hours explaining what we needed to do to ensure \nthat we protected all victims--and we listened. Together, we crafted a \nbill that responded to those needs. I trust these advocates. They have \ndedicated their lives to making sure survivors have a voice.\n  And here is what they are telling us:\n\n       We write today to express our deep concern about the \n     controversy of inserting the Hyde provision into the Justice \n     for Victims of Trafficking Act. The House passed a version of \n     that Act that did not include this new Hyde provision and we \n     ask the Senate to do the same.\n\n  They are right. The highly partisan House passed a version of the \nvery bill we are debating today that does not contain this unnecessary \nand destructive provision. That deeply divided body came together and \nthey passed this bill with a unanimous vote just a few weeks ago, \nwithout this divisive language that Senator Cornyn has insisted be in \nthe Senate bill. I am confident that if we did the same, we could also \npass it easily.\n  I want to make clear to everyone who is paying attention to this \nvote, the partisan provision embedded in the Senate version of this \nbill is not something the survivors of human trafficking are asking \nfor. It is not something the experts in the field who work with them \nevery day are asking for. In fact, those who are closest to the damage \nwreaked by this terrible crime are asking us to take the provision out.\n  We are not talking about taxpayer money; we are talking about money \ncollected from the various offenders who have already controlled too \nmuch of the lives of these women and girls. These survivors deserve \nmore options, not fewer. It is in response to the request of these \nhuman trafficking survivors that I am opposing cloture on this version \nof the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. I support the rest of \nthis bill, and that is why I included it in the comprehensive \nsubstitute amendment I filed last week.\n  Also included in my substitute is a vital component to prevent human \ntrafficking by focusing on runaway and homeless youth. These children \nare exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers and we must not turn \nour backs on them.\n  If we are serious about helping to end this heinous crime, we must \nstop playing politics and start listening. Let's listen to the people \nwho suffer from the trafficking. Let's listen to the victims. Let's \nlisten to the experts who have always stood with us on this. They say: \nTake this provision out. Let's do so. The Republican-controlled House \ncame together and they passed the House version of this legislation \nunanimously without this divisive language. Shouldn't we do the same \nthing? This is not a question of whether you are for or against \ntrafficking. I do not think there is anybody who is for it. Those who, \nlike me, actually prosecuted these cases know how important it is. So \nlisten to the victims. They say: Take out this language and let's move \nforward. I will vote no on cloture so that we can move forward and \nreturn to the bipartisan path that we have always walked on this issue.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Washington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor with a simple message \nfor our Republican colleagues: Enough is enough. The bill we are \ndebating today, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, should \nwithout question be bipartisan because the bill about combating \ntrafficking is no place for politics. That means it is no place for \nharmful, partisan measures that restrict women's respective health \noptions. So it is deeply disappointing that over the last week, \nRepublicans have insisted on including such a provision in this Justice \nfor Victims of Trafficking Act. Then, instead of working with us to \ntake this provision out, get this bill done, and move on to other \nimportant work, they have dug in their heels.\n  Democrats want to work with Republicans on this legislation and get \nit back on track. We put forward a substitute that takes out the \npolitics and focuses on what matters in this debate, which is helping \nthe survivors of trafficking get the justice they deserve. It would be \nshocking if Senate Republicans refused to support this alternative just \nbecause it does not include an expansion of the so-called Hyde \namendment that restricts women's access to health services--especially, \nby the way, since the House has already passed this bill without this \nharmful women's health provision, just as the Senate did last year. So \nwe know Republicans can support an antitrafficking bill that does not \nhurt women. There is no reason why we should not be able to shift this \nback to something that both sides can support.\n  What makes all of this even worse is that the majority leader is now \ninsisting on even more gridlock and dysfunction. He has said that in \nefforts to continue a political attack on women's health, he will not \nonly hold up the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act but also the \nconfirmation of a highly qualified nominee for Attorney General. That \nis indefensible. Loretta Lynch deserves a vote. She has been waiting \nlonger than any of the last five nominees for Attorney General. She has \nbeen confirmed by the Senate twice already for her position for \nprevious roles. She deserves to be able to get to work.\n  The majority leader has said the Senate will not move to her \nnomination until we finish the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. \nI would like to note that we voted last night on two other nominations, \nso it seems pretty absurd to say that we cannot work on both at the \nsame time.\n  The bottom line is that Senate Republican have a choice today--\npolitics as usual or working with us to get this done. They can \ncontinue to hold up important work, to draw out a political fight we \nhave had again and again, or they can work with us to get our nominee \nfor Attorney General on the job, pass the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, and move on to tackle the many other challenges our \ncountry faces today. I really hope they will choose to work with \nDemocrats, fight human trafficking, and help women across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

On this vote, the yeas are 55, the nays are \n43.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning was a sad day for the Senate, \nwhen a straightforward bill designed to help the 100,000 or so children \nwho are sex trafficked in America goes down because of the advocacy of \na group that wants to turn this into an abortion debate and to change \nthe settled law of the last 39 years.\n  As I said before the vote, I really feel as if this is a time when \nthe very soul of the Senate is being tested. Are we going actually to \nbreak out of these shackles that we seem to be bound by, which say that \nwe are going to turn every issue--no matter how sensitive or how much \ngood could be done--into a political issue that divides us? I would \nhave thought of all the topics where there would be bipartisan \nconsensus, it would be combating the crime of human trafficking.\n  Indeed, everything that went on before today seemed to give me hope \nthat we would be able to do that. For example, there is the fact that \nthere were 12 Democratic cosponsors of the underlying legislation. In \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, there were 20 votes, a unanimous vote \nincluding 9 Democrats, in favor of the bill in committee, and it came \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, ordinarily we would have to jump \nthrough some procedural hoops. But thanks to the consent of 100 \nSenators, we did not have to do that so we could get on the bill and \nbegin the open amendment process without having to jump through those \nhoops. At least that is what I thought. Then somehow, somewhere, \nsomebody decided they wanted to pick a fight on something that has been \nthe settled law for 39 years; and that is the Hyde amendment.\n  The Hyde amendment basically says that no taxpayer funds can be used \nto fund abortion except in the case of rape and in the case of the \nhealth of the mother being in jeopardy, as certified by a physician. So \none might wonder why people want to fight over the Hyde amendment when \nthe Hyde amendment itself has an exception for sexual assault, which \nobviously would be the major concern on behalf of any of these victims \nof human trafficking. That is why this has been called a phantom issue. \nI would use another word. I would say it is a phony issue. It is a fake \nfight in order to derail legislation which would demonstrate that we, \non a bipartisan basis, can work together and try to solve a real \nproblem and make progress.\n  I suspect the Presiding Officer had the same experience I did during \nthis last election. Back in Texas, people would say: Can't you guys and \ngals get anything done in Washington, DC? Why is it so broken and so \ndysfunctional? Why can't you find common cause on something and make \nsome progress and\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\ndeal with real problems that confront the people of Texas or the people \nof Oklahoma or the people of the United States of America?\n  Now, that doesn't mean we come up here and leave our principles \nbehind. It is just the opposite. I am not suggesting for a minute, in \nthe interest of compromise, that we leave our principles behind, but \nthere is a lot we can do, consistent with our principles, to help pass \nlegislation which will have a very positive impact on the American \npeople.\n  The President mentioned issues such as trade as something we can work \non together. But little did I imagine that the powers that be would \npick on an anti-human trafficking bill in order to try to divide the \nSenate--in order to peel off the 12 Democratic cosponsors who didn't \neven vote. Many of them didn't even vote for the bill.\n  In other words, they were for the bill--enough to cosponsor it--and \nthen this morning they did not vote to see the bill progress to final \npassage. I don't know how they can explain that or, frankly, how they \ncan reconcile that in their own conscience, recognizing that this \nlegislation was designed to help vulnerable children, by and large, who \nare victims of what we call modern day slavery--sexual, economic \nbondage.\n  This legislation was designed not only to rescue them but to help \nthem heal and begin a path toward a better, more productive life. That \nis why this morning I said I really felt this was a vote for the soul \nof the Senate.\n  I cannot imagine any Senator who does everything they have to do to \nbe elected to get to serve here--the hardship for your family, raising \nmoney, and all the stuff you have to do to get here--and then to \nsquander it by refusing to take a step to help the most vulnerable \npeople who exist in our country. It is just beyond my imagination.\n  But I am afraid this is more than about a piece of legislation. There \nis an idea here in the Democratic leadership that they really don't \nwant the Senate to be able to function. They don't really want us to be \nable to pass legislation or solve problems. What they want to do is to \nhave the talking point that after the last election nothing has really \nchanged in the Senate--that it is just as dysfunctional as it was when \nthey were in charge.\n  I am happy to say I am optimistic--despite this morning's vote--that \nwe will begin to make some progress as soon as next week, when we will, \nI think, take the first step to pass a budget. It will be the first \ntime a budget has been passed since 2009.\n  I am grateful to the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, for \nsaying that we are going to come back and vote again and again and \nagain on this human trafficking bill until it passes. He is not going \nto schedule the nomination confirmation vote on the next Attorney \nGeneral until such time as we get this passed.\n  Unfortunately, that is what this place has degenerated into--\neverybody looking for leverage to try to get a little bit more of what \nthey want, and in the process, the very people we are supposed to be \ntrying to work for and trying to help get lost.\n  I am very disappointed. This is not why I came to the Senate. This is \nnot the kind of Senate I want to serve in. This is not what my \nconstituents--the 26.9 million people I work for in Texas--sent me here \nto do. They expect more of us. They deserve more of us. I hope, now \nthat this initial vote has been cast--thank goodness for the four \nDemocrats who broke ranks with their leadership on that side of the \naisle and decided to vote to advance this legislation, but we still \nneed two more. We still need two more brave Democratic Senators who are \ngoing to defy their leadership and not simply follow them off the \ncliff.\n\n  This is what, from a practical political standpoint, I don't \nunderstand. One reason why Republicans are in the majority now is \nbecause, frankly, the President's policies were repudiated in the last \nelection and the people who ran for reelection as incumbent Senators \ndidn't have a record of accomplishment they could point to. So what \nthey were left with was a referendum on the President's record which \nthey followed down the line, and they had nothing else they could point \nto that they actually had done on the Senate floor because the Senate \nhad been locked down and no amendments, no good ideas, no votes \noccurred. We literally had a U.S. Senator from Alaska, for example, who \nwas running for reelection after serving in the Senate for 6 years who \ncould not point to a single bill or amendment that bore his name that \nhad been passed. So when people wondered, What are the issues in this \nelection, they were left with the President of the United States \nsaying: My policies are on the ballot, even though my name is not. Then \nwe had the incumbent U.S. Senator with no record of accomplishments \nseparate and apart from that referendum on the President's policies, \nand that referendum--the President's policies--lost and the people who \nenabled them and supported them.\n  Frankly, I really don't understand the calculation of our colleagues \non the other side who have now slavishly voted according to the \ndictates of their party leadership and said no to the victims of human \ntrafficking who would have benefited from that legislation. I don't \nknow how they reconcile that in their minds. I don't know whether they \nhave had sleepless nights worrying about it or whether their hearts \nhave become so hardened, whether they have become so accustomed to this \nsort of mindless partisanship that they don't even think about it \nanymore.\n  Thanks to the majority leader, we are going to have another \nopportunity for them to rectify their ``no'' vote. All we need is two \nadditional Senators who will vote to progress this legislation given \nthe next opportunity. So I hope our colleagues will reconsider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1565-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   The Future Of Colorado And America\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, in 1893 Katharine Lee Bates made her way \nup the slopes of Pikes Peak and first wrote the words to one of \nAmerica's greatest patriotic hymns, poeticizing ``purple mountain \nmajesties'' and ``amber waves of grain.''\n  One hundred years ago, Enos Mills helped preserve ``mountain scenes \nof exceptional beauty and grandeur,'' giving to the country the crown \njewel of American splendor, Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  For over a century, visionaries such as John Iliff helped to settle \nthe high plains of Colorado, described by Ian Frazier as a ``heroic \nplace,'' an expanse of splendid isolation with unparalleled sense of \nspace and generations of pioneers.\n  This is Colorado. From west to east and north to south, the beauty, \nheritage, and vitality of Colorado calls and beckons across our Nation \nand the world to those looking and longing for a place to call home, to \nlive and work, to visit and vacation.\n  Our love for Colorado drives us to be better stewards of the land, to \nreach for solutions to great challenges, and to find optimism in every \nvale and valley. For generations, we have challenged our sons and \ndaughters to always look up--look up to that great\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nRocky Mountain horizon--as our ever-young State and our ever-hopeful \nattitude live peak to peak--the honor of living in the west, a land of \nopportunity and new beginnings.\n  It is this constant drive for a better future for our great State and \nNation that leads me to the floor of the Senate to speak for the first \ntime, where my duties as Colorado's newest Senator begin, walking in \nthe footsteps of Colorado's first Senators, Jerome Chaffee and Henry \nTeller, and alongside my colleague Senator Michael Bennet. It is an \nincredible and heavy obligation to fulfill to well and faithfully \ndischarge the duties of the office, defending our Constitution with \nfaith and allegiance to the rights we cherish, but an obligation and \nduty every person in Colorado expects us not just to fulfill but to \nexcel at--from Beecher Island to the Book Cliffs, from Fisher's Peak to \nthe Pawnee. Somewhere in between is my hometown of Yuma, home to hardy \npioneers that have seen the high plains through great success and \nrecord harvests, depression and dust bowls, drought and tragedy. Yet \nthrough it all, the good times and challenges, it is still called home \nby generations who would live nowhere else.\n  It is here in this little eastern plains town, weatherworn and always \nthirsty, that Jaime and I are raising our children, Alyson, Thatcher, \nand Caitlyn, in a home that once belonged to their great-great-\ngrandparents and are surrounded in town by family, Lala and Papa, \ngreat-grandparents, and more.\n  No matter where across Colorado's four corners you live or across \nthis great Nation, we all hope for the same thing for our children--to \nlive in a loving community that values every citizen, where they learn \nthe value of hard work and perseverance, where hard work is met with \nmerited reward, and that they find a Nation of liberty and freedom that \nthey help make a little more free and a little more perfect to carry on \nthe tradition of our Founding Fathers, always endeavoring to be better \ntomorrow than they are today.\n  Our Nation has always understood that this endeavor is not something \nthat is just passed on, hoping someone else does the work for us. It is \nsomething we ourselves have to fight for today. We are responsible for \nthe starting point we hand to the next generation, and we have a moral \nobligation to make it the best point possible, always advancing.\n  To accomplish this I have laid out a Four Corners plan representing \nall areas of Colorado and those issues that matter most to the people \nof this country: growing our economy and getting this Nation back to \nwork in the kinds of jobs with the kind of salary that allows people to \nachieve their dreams, to develop North American energy security while \nenhancing the protection and appreciation of our environment, and \nmaking sure that we give our children the tools they need to succeed in \na world growing both in its complexity and its interconnectedness.\n  In rural America we must work not only to keep the generations of \nfamilies who grew up there on the farm and ranch but to find new ways \nto bring new families back to the farms, ranches, and small towns \nthroughout our great State. We must revitalize Main Streets that are \nslowly losing their place as the heart and soul of the community--\nboarded up and forgotten. To do this I will introduce legislation that \nwill help provide ways to infuse new investments and life into our \nrural communities, called the Rural Philanthropy Act. It will help \nstruggling businesses to find new private sector partners to serve \ntheir community, whether it is a smalltown newspaper or a local \nclothing store. It will help grow jobs and create more opportunities \nfor startups and innovation.\n  We must look to reimagine burdensome rules and regulations that tie \nthe hands of people who want to start a business by revitalizing Main \nStreet and breathing new life into a tired city block. Doing good \nthings shouldn't be so difficult, and we need a government that \nrecognizes this.\n  Colorado's economy will also benefit from value-added trade \nopportunities with the passage of new trade agreements opening up new \nmarkets and eliminating barriers to growing markets. I will work to \nensure that small businesses have the resources they need to \nparticipate in trade, making sure the benefit of new markets doesn't \njust stop at the biggest corporations.\n  Through my First in Space Initiative, we will focus on policies that \npromote and grow Colorado's leading aerospace economies, launching new \njobs in space, engineering, and aeronautics.\n  A healthy economy means that everyone benefits--not just those who \nalready have found success. That is why I will work to expand the \nearned-income tax credit. By eliminating the waste, fraud, and abuse \nall too common within the EITC, we can save billions of dollars and \nthen use that money to expand the credit, making a program that has \nalready lifted millions of people out of poverty to do even more good \nfor people throughout Colorado and in our urban centers. Measuring a \nsuccessful economy shouldn't simply be a matter of looking to see \nwhether the haves have more but about what policies we have put in \nplace to actually help the poor lift themselves out of poverty.\n  We are living in a veneered economy. While the numbers on Wall Street \nlook good and profits are looking up, scratch the surface and too many \npeople continue to suffer, endlessly searching for jobs they \ndesperately need and earning the kinds of salary they need to help \nachieve their family's goals. While parts of Colorado may be \nsucceeding, others are struggling. True success means that every part \nof our State's economy flourishes.\n  Thanks to our State's energy economy, parts of the State that seem to \nhave been left behind are now thriving. A national policy geared \ntowards North American energy independence will not only boost jobs and \nprovide abundant and affordable energy upon which our economy relies, \nbut it will boost our national security by providing to our allies \nabroad the energy partner they need that presents an alternative to \nnations such as Russia and Iran.\n  I look forward to continuing my push for an expedited export process \nfor LNG, allowing Mesa and La Plata County energy producers the \nopportunity to play a leading role in national security while creating \njobs at home.\n  Commonsense Colorado energy solutions also means focusing on \nrenewable energy as well. Harnessing the winds in Weld, the sun in San \nLuis, and the power of water in the West, we can lessen pollution and \nhelp clean up the air. Working across the aisle with Senator Chris \nCoons from Delaware, I will focus on energy-savings performance \ncontracts, an often overlooked private sector tool that has the \npotential to create thousands of jobs and save the taxpayer billions of \ndollars while helping to reduce pollution.\n  Reducing pollution and protecting our environment is a cornerstone of \nColorado. I look forward to working with Congressman Scott Tipton on \nlegislation to help preserve and restore our great forest lands and to \nprotect Colorado landscapes. Whether it is healthy forest legislation, \nreducing the maintenance backlog in our national parks or finding \ncollaborative solutions to challenging land conflicts, we owe it to \nfuture generations of Coloradans to pass on an environment that is \ncleaner when they receive it than the one which we inherited.\n  Future generations of Coloradans also deserve the opportunity to \nreceive an education. Whether that is fighting to restore local control \nto States, school districts, and parents or working to make the dream \nof a college degree a reality, our future depends on our ability to \nprovide the skills and training for the next generation of leaders and \nentrepreneurs.\n  I will continue work on my legislation called the Making College \nAffordable Act. This will help families save for college and meet \nexpenses in primary and secondary education. I look forward to \npromoting STEM education opportunities and transforming our immigration \nsystem from one that sends the best and brightest students back home to \ncompete against us to one that allows them the opportunity to stay here \nin the United States to create jobs and innovation that we will \ncontinue to benefit from.\n  There is no doubt in the next 6 years many issues will arise that \nfall outside these Four Corner issues, and I look forward to meeting \nevery single one of these challenges by finding new opportunities that \nwill help make Colorado a better place.\n  I look forward to working with Congressman Mike Coffman to finish the\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\nVA hospital in Aurora, a hospital earned through sacrifice but \ntarnished by delay. When it is completed, it will give veterans a far \nbetter place for the care they deserve. That always must be our focus, \nmaking Colorado and the United States a better place, giving the people \nof this country the confidence that we can work together to achieve \ncommon goals, to strive for brighter horizons, to deliver to the \nAmerican people a government they can be proud of again. I will work \nwith Senator Bennet and anyone who is committed to these common goals.\n  Too many people believe that government can no longer address the \ngreat challenges of our time--an $18 trillion debt, mounting \nentitlement costs, a health care crisis that continues into the next \ncentury, and seemingly overwhelming policy challenges. Some leaders \nwould have us believe they can't do anything about it, that a managed \ndecline is better than a rapid decline.\n  The American people know better. They don't have to--and indeed, they \nwill not--accept second best. A government that we can be proud of is \none that solves the greatest challenges of our time, balances our \nbudget, and puts in place solutions that rise above the rhetoric. A \ngovernment we can be proud of again means an America that is always \nadvancing and never in retreat.\n  Our search for solutions, our search for a government we can be proud \nof comes from the common bond--regardless of color, gender or creed, \nand, yes, even party--that we as Americans all hold: the shared story \nof our lives, the unrelenting American spirit. This is the American \nstory.\n  We owe our Nation to the sacrifices made by millions of men and women \nfor freedom for each other, to countless generations in the past and \npresent who have worn a uniform in the defense of our Nation--a nation \nmade exceptional by pioneering people, a nation of innovation and \nopportunity, a nation that imagines and inspires, a nation that rises \nabove to be better tomorrow than we are today.\n  I grew up working at the family implement dealership, a family \nbusiness that was started by my great-grandfather 100 years ago. \nSweeping the floors and cleaning the bathrooms, I learned what it takes \nto make a business work. I learned about the employees who made the \nbusiness function and how we succeed as a business when our employees \nsucceed--the hard-working men and women who hope their aspirations will \nbe fulfilled.\n  I learned from my grandma, the real life Rosie the Riveter who welded \nliberty ships in World War II alongside her husband, my grandpa. They \ngave up everything, moving their family and all they had in life to be \npart of the effort to win the war and to provide their four children \nwith the opportunity to succeed and to build their own futures for \ntheir own families in a free world.\n  A few weeks ago, when going through some old boxes--a random \ncollection of endless material, pictures--I discovered a stack of \nletters that were written by my grandfather to his parents and to my \ngrandmother during World War II. The letters were written in near \nperfect cursive. Others were typed on an old hammer-strike typewriter \nthey undoubtedly used to the last days of the implement dealership. He \ntalked about the loneliness for home, new friends he had made during \nthe war, questions about his young son, and the new countries he was \nvisiting in France and beyond.\n  I would like to share parts of one of those letters today because it \nshares part of our American story. It was written on August 15, 1945.\n\n       Dear Folks,\n       Aha, that day, 14 August, is indeed a history making day, \n     and last night at twelve o'clock when at last all the rumors \n     were confirmed that the world was at peace I said a silent \n     prayer and know that it won't be long until we are all \n     together again. If you pull those reins hard enough, maybe I \n     will be home for Xmas, mother, certainly have a good chance \n     of making it now, although anything can still happen and \n     there are thousands of miles to cover, but one can't help but \n     be optimistic.\n\n  It must have been an incredible feeling to know that the war you had \nbeen fighting, the war that had consumed the world and taken our \nNation's young men and women thousands of miles away from home was \nover, to have received word that ``the rumors were confirmed that the \nworld was at peace.'' And after years of battle and weariness and a \nsilent prayer, the optimism of one soldier and that soldier's Nation \npersevered.\n  There are countless families across this country who share a similar \nstory. One of their aunts or uncles, parents or siblings are people who \nshare the honor and the obligation of wearing a uniform for the United \nStates of America with all of the responsibility that comes along with \nit.\n  They are people whom we will most likely never meet, nor will we ever \nbe able to fully thank them, but they still fought for all of us. \nThrough the words of one simple letter, we recognize the power of peace \nover conflict, of love for family and country. A silent prayer, no \ndoubt of thanks, thanks for answering so many other silent prayers, \nsilent prayers for a day of peace and homecoming. What it must have \nbeen like to know that the great darkness of war which threatened \nfreedom not for some but for all had finally come to an end. Just like \nthat, you will be home as if nothing ever happened.\n  Somewhere in that silent prayer, under the new calm of a war-torn \nhorizon was the thanksgiving of a soldier for his victorious nation, a \nsoldier looking to go home a civilian to live out his dreams far away \nfrom harm, in the arms of his family.\n  While we may disagree on the details of policy and the tactics of \ndirection, let us make no mistake in our charge--to ensure that we have \na nation that is worthy of the sacrifice so many have made; to refuse \nto pass on to future generations a nation in retreat or decline; to \nmake sure ours is a nation that is always worth fighting for. This is \nColorado. This is the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Remembering Edward William Brooke III\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on January 3, the Nation lost a courageous \npublic servant--actually, an icon of the 20th century: Massachusetts \nSenator Edward William Brooke III. He was 95 years old.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with more than 350 Senators since \nVermonters first elected me to represent them in this Chamber. There is \na very special list of those with whom I have served, and it is a \nprivilege to count among those on that special list Senator Edward \nBrooke. We were both elected representatives of Northeastern States, \neven though we came from different political parties.\n  Senator Brooke and I forged a relationship that lasted long after he \nleft Congress. We actually shared a similar start to our careers. As a \nformer State's Attorney, I admired and respected Senator Brooke's \nlegacy as a fearless prosecutor. As Attorney General for the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, Senator Brooke exposed and fought \nagainst political corruption.\n  He was no stranger to breaking barriers, and he ultimately became the \nfirst African American elected in Massachusetts to serve in the United \nStates Senate--a post he held for 12 years.\n  Senator Brooke was a problem-solver. He wanted to spend his time in \nthe Senate making a difference, not just making pronouncements. He \ninvested his considerable abilities in bridging racial, economic, and \npolitical divides to solve the challenges facing the Nation. He was a \nkey, and sometimes crucial, voice along the difficult path toward \nenactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He spearheaded equal \nopportunity legislative initiatives from housing, to education, to \nemployment. I think there was no bridge Senator Brooke was unwilling to \ncross to make lives better.\n  Senator Brooke is one of the few Senators to receive the Nation's \nhighest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was also \nthe recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal. His service in World War \nII was recognized with a Bronze Star.\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\n  This lifelong public servant dedicated his life to defending the \nbedrock principles of this country. His legacy of fighting for justice \nand equality is as important today as ever before. It is a legacy that \nwill always deserve to be remembered and honored.\n  Marcelle and I feel privileged to have known him and I send my \ncondolences to his wife, Anne, his children, and his grandchildren.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. President, the New York Times ran an editorial this morning aptly \nentitled ``The Loretta Lynch Confirmation Mess.'' The editorial writers \nnote:\n\n       Of course, as Mr. McConnell readily acknowledged, the delay \n     [of the vote on Loretta Lynch's nomination] is not simply \n     about trafficking legislation but a redirection of \n     Republicans' fury at what they consider Mr. Obama's lawless \n     actions.\n\n  If Republicans are serious about law enforcement, serious about \nimplementing the legislation I hope will pass to combat and prevent \nhuman trafficking, they will stop their partisan attacks and allow a \nvote on Loretta Lynch's nomination. After all, she has a very good \nrecord of prosecuting people who are involved in trafficking. You can't \nsay you are in favor of stopping trafficking and then block an Attorney \nGeneral who has a record of enforcing the trafficking laws.\n  It has been 19 days since the bipartisan majority in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination. She has been \nwaiting longer for a floor vote than the five most recent attorneys \ngeneral combined. She has been waiting for a vote for 19 days. If you \ntook Attorneys General Reno, Ashcroft, Gonzales, Mukasey, and Holder, \nall of them together were 18 days. For Loretta Lynch it is 19 days.\n  It has certainly been much longer than for the three men nominated \nduring the last Republican administration or for the incumbent Attorney \nGeneral nominated by this administration. She has now waited, as I \nsaid, longer than the previous five Attorneys General combined.\n  If we don't vote on her this week, her nomination will have waited on \nthe Senate floor longer than the most recent seven Attorneys General \ncombined. I hope it doesn't come to that. That would show a real \ndisdain for the Department of Justice in its efforts to enforce our \nlaws, to stop trafficking, and to go after terrorists, but it is also \nbeneath the Senate.\n  Certainly when I was chairman, I did not do that for President Bush's \nAttorney General nominee when he was in his last 2 years as President. \nAs chairman I moved Judge Mukasey through in a fraction of the time we \nhave taken on Loretta Lynch. I did this even though his nomination was \nnot something I supported and I ultimately voted against it. I moved \nhim forward quickly even though Judge Mukasey was unwilling to state \nhow he felt about President Bush's position on torture and did not seem \nto have a position on the politicization of his predecessor, or his \nwork with U.S. attorneys, things that set back law enforcement for \nyears. In fact, even though he had no position on most of the issues \nPresident Bush was involved in, either through Executive orders or \notherwise, he was still moved through in a tiny fraction of the time \nLoretta Lynch has been pending so far.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe New York Times article I mentioned earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, March 17, 2015]\n\n                  The Loretta Lynch Confirmation Mess\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       What does the abortion issue have to do with the prevention \n     of human trafficking? Nothing.\n       What do either of those things have to do with Loretta \n     Lynch, whom President Obama nominated more than four months \n     ago to succeed Eric Holder Jr. as attorney general of the \n     United States? Even less.\n       Yet Ms. Lynch's confirmation as the nation's top law \n     enforcement officer--which seemed like a sure thing only a \n     few weeks ago--is being held hostage to last-minute political \n     mischief.\n       Ms. Lynch, a supremely well-qualified prosecutor, has \n     waited far too long to be confirmed. Senate Republicans said \n     as recently as last week that they would schedule Ms. Lynch's \n     confirmation vote for this week, but, on Sunday, the majority \n     leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said that won't happen \n     until the Senate moves forward on a bipartisan trafficking \n     bill, which would, among other things, establish a fund for \n     victims through a fine paid by those convicted of trafficking \n     crimes.\n       The legislation, which sailed through committee in \n     February, stalled last week when Democrats noticed a \n     provision that would prohibit money in the fund from being \n     used to pay for abortions. The original Senate bill, \n     introduced in the last Congress, made no reference to \n     abortion. Nor did the House's version of the bill, introduced \n     by Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican of Minnesota. \n     ``There is no reason it should be included in these bills,'' \n     Mr. Paulsen said last week of the abortion language. ``This \n     issue is far too important to tie it up with an unrelated \n     fight with politics as usual.''\n       Republicans say they routinely add the abortion language \n     into many bills and that Democrats should have read more \n     carefully. Democrats say Republicans operated in bad faith--\n     not to mention in violation of Senate norms--by \n     misrepresenting the bill's contents.\n       This dispute has nothing to do with the needs of the \n     Justice Department. It is beyond irresponsible to strand the \n     department without a leader, sowing instability and \n     uncertainty in an important executive agency.\n       Mr. Holder announced his retirement in September, to the \n     evident delight of Republicans who have opposed him from the \n     start. One would have thought they would be eager to see him \n     go, yet almost six months later he remains in office because \n     a replacement has not been confirmed. No one disputes Ms. \n     Lynch's experience or accomplishments. She currently leads \n     the federal prosecutor's office in the Eastern District of \n     New York, and she has received the support of senators of \n     both parties. The only objection anyone could come up with \n     was that she might not stand up against President Obama's \n     policies, an odd criticism to aim at a prospective cabinet \n     member.\n       Of course, as Mr. McConnell readily acknowledged, the delay \n     is not simply about trafficking legislation but a redirection \n     of Republicans' fury at what they consider Mr. Obama's \n     lawless actions. Ms. Lynch is ``suffering from the \n     president's actions,'' he said Sunday, referring to Mr. \n     Obama's move on immigration policy last November.\n       This is not the way for Republicans to reassure the country \n     of their ability to govern now that they control both houses \n     of Congress. Instead, they could start by ending the delay on \n     what should be a straightforward floor vote and do the job \n     Americans elected them to do.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                         Negotiations With Iran\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, next Tuesday, March 24, we will reach \nthe deadline for the deal with Iran for its illicit nuclear program. \nThat is the date by which the Obama administration said it would have a \nframework for a final agreement with Iran. So far, it seems as though \nthe administration is willing to make a deal at any cost. America \ncannot afford that and Congress should not allow it. An overwhelming \nmajority of Americans believe we should not accept a bad deal with the \nIranians. In one poll earlier this month, 84 percent of Americans said \nit is a bad idea to accept the kinds of concessions this administration \nseems to be making.\n  The Obama administration started negotiating with Iran more than 5 \nyears ago. It has mishandled these talks from the very beginning by \nconceding Iran's right to enrich uranium. This deal was supposed to be \nabout stopping Iran's nuclear program as a pathway to a bomb. \nNegotiators started off by insisting that Iran should have no more than \n1,500 centrifuges to produce nuclear materials. That number has \nsteadily grown during the negotiations. According to David Ignatius in \nthe Washington Post on February 24, the number is now four times the \nlevel where we started. His article is entitled ``A compelling argument \non Iran.'' It says, ``The deal taking shape would likely allow Iran \nabout 6,000'' centrifuges. So we have gone from 1,500 to 4,000 to now \n6,000. The author of the article says one administration official told \nhim that even 9,000 centrifuges would be okay.\n  Remember, Iran is not supposed to have a uranium enrichment program. \nThe United Nations Security Council has demanded the program be \nsuspended. So why is the Obama administration negotiating on this point \nat all? When did this change from being an attempt to stop Iran's \nnuclear program to become an attempt to delay or to manage Iran's \nnuclear program? If this deal makes too many of these kinds of \nconcessions to the Iranians, it would be just one more example of the \nfailed foreign relations of this Obama Presidency.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  Go back and look at what happened with the Russian reset. It was the \nreset button Secretary of State Clinton launched in March of 2009--6 \nyears ago this month. Look at her comments in which she said that \nSyrian President Assad was ``a reformer.'' President Obama talked about \na redline with Syria--a redline that Syria could not cross by using \nchemical weapons against his own people. Assad crossed that line more \nthan 2 years ago.\n  Remember when the President called ISIS a JV team?\n  This is all part of a pattern of the Obama administration \nunderestimating our enemies and being outmaneuvered by them. This \nadministration has a terrible record of being wrong about Iran as well.\n  When Congress was debating increased sanctions against Iran, the \nWhite House opposed those sanctions. Congress had to force sanctions \nauthority on the President. It was those sanctions--the ones Congress \nimposed upon the President--that brought Iran to the negotiating table. \nNow the administration says it opposes congressional participation once \nagain. Well, I don't believe the White House gets to be the sole \ndecider on this important issue.\n  The administration claims it understands it would be better to have \nno deal at all than to have a bad deal, and I agree. That is why we \nneed oversight--oversight by Congress--to make sure this is not a bad \ndeal. The negotiators don't get to decide for themselves if it is a \ngood deal or a bad deal. The American people get a say, and Congress, \nas the elected representatives of the people, is the right place for \nthe people to have their voices heard.\n  So what does the Obama administration have to say about all this? The \nPresident's Chief of Staff sent a letter over the weekend, Saturday \nnight--the Saturday night surprise--and he said Congress will get to be \ninvolved only after the administration signs a deal. Congress gets to \nbe involved only after people get to find out what is in it, after \nPresident Obama signs a deal. It is kind of like Nancy Pelosi when she \nsaid of the health care law, first you have to pass it before you get \nto find out what is in it.\n  So why is it the Chief of Staff of the President is acting this way? \nWhy is the Obama administration telling Members of Congress, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, to sit down and be quiet? Let's be clear \nabout what is at stake here. If the Obama administration allows Iran to \ncontinue with its illicit nuclear program, the world will be less safe, \nless stable, and less secure. Any agreement must be accountable, must \nbe enforceable, and must be verifiable. If that is not the case, then \nit is a bad deal.\n  We need to make sure this deal is about protecting Americans, not \nprotecting the President's diplomatic legacy. If the Obama \nadministration is so confident it can negotiate a good deal, why not \nlet Congress participate?\n  We have bipartisan legislation here that Senator Corker has written \nwith Democrats and Republicans as cosponsors. That bipartisan \nlegislation would make sure that congressional sanctions currently in \nplace stay in place, and they stay in place long enough for Congress to \nhold hearings and to take whatever action is needed. That bill being \nproposed will be before the Committee on Foreign Relations next week. \nThat bill will guarantee the President keeps an eye on Iran's \ncompliance with any agreement. If the Iranians try to break the deal, \nwe would know about it so that Congress would reimpose sanctions, \nreinstate sanctions.\n  The American people need to be involved in this process. Getting \nonboard and getting the approval of Congress only strengthens the \nagreement the administration negotiates. It will validate, give more \nlegitimacy to it, and more credibility. Congress should and must be \ninvolved. It will make clear to both our allies and our enemies that \nAmerica stands united in our commitment to ending Iran's nuclear \nprogram. It also makes it far more likely this agreement will outlast \nthe Obama administration.\n  When President Obama and Vice President Biden were Senators, they \nfavored this kind of involvement by Congress. They both actually \ncosponsored legislation requiring Congress to approve any long-term \nsecurity commitment President Bush was to make with Iraq. Well, a long \nagreement with Iran over its nuclear program to me is even more \nimportant.\n  In one policy after another, President Obama has disregarded the \nviews of the American people. This is a huge concern. He has ignored \nCongress. He acted on his own even when he had no authority to act. He \nhas done it on the domestic side, he has done it on the foreign \nrelations side, and it looks to me as if the administration is planning \nonce again to ignore Congress and the American people in pursuit of an \ninadequate deal with Iran. It is time for Congress to step in and to \nstand up for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Washington Post story of February 24 by David Ignatius entitled ``A \ncompelling argument on Iran.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 24, 2015]\n\n                     A Compelling Argument on Iran\n\n                          (By David Ignatius)\n\n       Prussian King Frederick the Great offered this rebuke to \n     those who refused to allow any concessions: ``If you try to \n     hold everything, you hold nothing.''\n       President Obama might make a similar retort to Israeli \n     Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attack on the alleged \n     ``bad deal'' the United States is contemplating with Iran. \n     Netanyahu rejects any concessions that allow Iran to enrich \n     uranium; he thinks the U.S. goal of a one-year ``breakout'' \n     period before Iran could build a bomb isn't enough.\n       To which several leading administration officials respond: \n     Okay, then, what's a better practical idea for controlling \n     Iran's nuclear program? They see in Netanyahu's maximalist \n     goals an air of unreality--of fantasy, even. They grant that \n     their solution isn't perfect. But they argue that it's far \n     better for Israel and the West than any other plausible \n     scenario.\n       The Iran nuclear talks, arguably the most important \n     diplomatic negotiations of the last several decades, will \n     come to a head next month. Netanyahu will take his case \n     against the agreement to Congress on March 3 in an unusual \n     speech organized by the Republican House speaker. His own \n     political leadership will be tested in Israeli elections on \n     March 17. The Iran negotiations will reach a March 24 \n     deadline for the framework of a final comprehensive accord.\n       Israel's Minister of Intelligence Yuval Steinitz made the \n     case against the Iran agreement in an interview with me last \n     week. ``From the very beginning, we made it clear we had \n     reservations about the goal of the negotiations,'' he \n     explained. He said Obama's effort to limit the Iranian \n     nuclear program for a decade or so, in the expectation that a \n     future generation of leaders wouldn't seek a bomb, was ``too \n     speculative.''\n       The administration's response is that the agreement is \n     better than any realistic alternative. Officials argue it \n     would put the Iranian program in a box, with constraints on \n     all the pathways to making a bomb. Perhaps more important, it \n     would provide strict monitoring and allow intrusive \n     inspection of Iranian facilities--not just its centrifuges \n     but its uranium mines, mills and manufacturing facilities. If \n     Iran seeks a covert path to building a bomb, the deal offers \n     the best hope of detecting it.\n       If the current talks collapsed, all these safeguards would \n     disappear. The Iranians could resume enrichment and other \n     currently prohibited activities. In such a situation, the \n     United States and Israel would face a stark choice over \n     whether to attack Iranian facilities--with no guarantee that \n     such an attack would set Tehran back more than a few years.\n       The deal taking shape would likely allow Iran about 6,000 \n     IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz. The Iranians apparently wouldn't \n     install IR-2s, which operate twice as fast, and they would \n     limit research on future models, up to IR-8s, that are on the \n     drawing board. How these research limits would be monitored \n     and enforced is a key bargaining issue. Another critical \n     variable is the size of the stockpile Iran could maintain; \n     U.S. officials want a very low number, with additional \n     enriched material shipped out of Iran.\n       One official argues that the United States would be better \n     off with 9,000 IR-1s and a small stockpile than with 1,000 \n     IR-2s and a large stockpile. Netanyahu probably won't address \n     this issue in his speech to Congress, since he insists the \n     only acceptable number of centrifuges is zero.\n       Another key technical issue is how non-permitted \n     centrifuges would be dismantled. There is a range of options, \n     from simply unplugging the equipment to pulverizing it \n     altogether. The United States wants a formula that would \n     require at least a year for the Iranians to restart the \n     shelved equipment. As for the planned Iranian plutonium \n     reactor at Arak, negotiators seem to have agreed on a \n     compromise that will halt construction well before Arak \n     becomes ``hot'' with potential bomb fuel.\n       The length of the agreement is a crucial variable. U.S. \n     officials have always spoken of a ``double-digit'' duration \n     period, somewhere between 10 and 15 years. Negotiators are \n     also exploring the possibility of different phases\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\n     of the timeline, with inspection provisions having a longer \n     life span than, say, limits on the number of centrifuges.\n       The deal-breaker for the administration is if Iran balks at \n     U.S. insistence that sanctions will only be removed step by \n     step, as Iran demonstrates that it's serious about abiding by \n     the agreement. In the U.S. view, Iran has to earn its way \n     back to global acceptance.\n       The Iran deal is imperfect. As Count Metternich observed in \n     1807 about negotiations with the rising powers of his day, \n     ``Peace does not exist with a revolutionary system.'' But \n     U.S. officials make a compelling case that this agreement is \n     a start toward a safer Middle East.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to speak on S. 178, the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and the Toomey-Manchin \namendment No. 291 to that bill.\n  First of all, I wish to thank Senator Cornyn for bringing this bill \nto the Senate floor. It is a bipartisan bill. It is an extremely \nimportant bill. It has been awfully frustrating that we can't even get \nonto this bill. It is especially hard to understand because of the fact \nthat this is a bipartisan bill which has 10 Democratic cosponsors and \nanother 3 Democrats who voted for it in the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nThis shouldn't even be controversial.\n  It is particularly disturbing because when you think about what we \nare trying to address with Senator Cornyn's bill, it is awfully \nimportant. I mean, what can be more despicable than what we are trying \nto go after here--trafficking human beings? This is a form of modern-\nday slavery, is what it is, and some of the most despicable people in \nthe world take the most vulnerable people in our society and they turn \nthem into essentially slaves in the sex industry. I mean, as appalling \nas that is, it happens, and it happens in every State.\n  What this bill does is it provides more tools for law enforcement to \nbetter be able to crack down on this appalling practice and provides \nharsher penalties, as well it should, and it provides more resources \nfor folks who do the important work of helping victims to heal, which \nis a very long, very difficult, very painful process. It is \nunimaginable what some of these folks go through. Children are forced \ninto slavery, brutalized, beaten, and raped. It is dehumanizing--an \natrocious situation. We have a bill which is bipartisan and which would \nactually do something constructive about it, and our Democratic \ncolleagues will not even allow us to begin the debate, much less move \non in the process.\n  I understand there is a provision in the bill they don't like. I get \nthat. But we have offered repeatedly that they would be allowed to \noffer any amendment they like. They can offer an amendment to strike \nthe language to which they object, and that is the way the Senate is \nsupposed to work. You put a bill on the floor. If somebody doesn't like \nsomething that is in it, you try to change it. It is pretty basic, \npretty fundamental, and that is what we ought to be doing. But we \nhaven't been able to persuade enough of our Democratic colleagues to \nallow us to proceed to this bill yet. I hope we will soon.\n  One of the reasons I hope so goes beyond the substance of this bill, \nand that is the amendment Senator Manchin and I will introduce as soon \nas we are able to do that. This is an amendment which will allow us to \namend the underlying trafficking bill with a bill Senator Manchin and I \nhave introduced designed to protect kids from sexual abuse. It is \namendment No. 291, and it is based on a bill we have called the \nProtecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act. The goal is \nto protect kids from pedophiles in schools. That is what it comes down \nto. There is overwhelming bipartisan support for our legislation, the \nbill I introduced with Senator Manchin. It passed the House \nunanimously.\n  I rose last week to ask unanimous consent to bring up this amendment \nand make it pending so we could debate and we could vote on it, and one \nof our friends from the other side of the aisle objected to that as \nwell. So there is no progress on this yet, but I am convinced that this \nisn't going to stand. I am convinced that enough Democratic Senators \nare going to come to their senses and they are going to join us in \nvoting on this bill and that we are going to be able to somehow proceed \nwith this and proceed with the various amendments I and others intend \nto offer.\n  I want to speak a little bit about my amendment because I think we \nare going to get to it. As I mentioned, it is about protecting kids at \nschool from violent and sexual predators. Let me start with an \nobservation that should go without saying, but I will say it anyway.\n  We all know that the overwhelming majority of school authorities, \nteachers and nonteachers alike, are very good and decent people and \nthat it would never occur to them to abuse the children in their care. \nThey are motivated in their desire to help kids succeed in the various \nways they help guide these kids. I am completely convinced that the \noverwhelming majority of teachers and school employees don't want a \npedophile anywhere near their school. They don't want them in the \nclassroom next to them. They don't want them coaching their kids. They \ndon't want them in any way involved because most teachers have good \nsense and decency. That is the way they are. But the reality is that \nschools are, in fact, where the kids are, and pedophiles know this. So \nwe have a problem. The problem is that some of these predators are \nfinding ways into the schools.\n  Stated very clearly, last year alone, 459 school employees--some \nteachers, some not teachers--459 adult school employees were arrested \nacross America for sexual misconduct with the kids they are supposed to \nbe looking after; 459 that we knew enough about what they were doing \nand the prosecutors felt they had a strong enough case that they could \nactually go ahead and make the arrest. How many more are under \ninvestigation? How many more where there are suspicions but no evidence \nwith which to pursue a case? Probably a lot more. But we know for sure \nthere are 459 appalling cases, and so far this year, we are on track to \nhave similar numbers. We are 76 days into the school year, and over 90 \nschool employees have already been arrested this year across the \ncountry.\n  This is absolutely a real problem. Some of these predators are \nfinding ways to slip through the cracks of the system that is meant to \nkeep them out, and Senator Manchin and I want to do something about it.\n  Here is our suggestion. We have a bill that does two simple things. \nIt says to the State: If you are going to collect the millions of \ndollars in Federal funding that go to primary and secondary education, \nthen you have to do a proper background check and you have to make sure \nyou are not hiring a pedophile. You have to check the Federal and State \ndatabases to make sure you are doing a thorough background check. And \nthe second requirement is you can't engage or permit anybody to engage \nin this appalling practice that is known as passing the trash. It is \nshocking that this could even exist, but it does.\n  I will tell you the story that actually inspired this legislation, \nwhich is a case in point of passing the trash. The story begins with a \nteacher teaching in Delaware County, PA. This teacher was a pedophile \nwho was molesting boys who were in his care. The school district \nfigured out what was going on. There was never enough evidence to \nactually prosecute him, but they knew something was very wrong. The \nschool district decided it would be better if this teacher became \nsomeone else's problem, so, as appalling as it is, what they did was \nthey wrote a letter of recommendation to recommend this teacher for \nanother job provided that he leave. Well, he leaves. He goes across the \nState border into West Virginia, applies for and, in part on the \nstrength of the letter of recommendation he had, he gets hired at a \nschool in West Virginia. He works as a teacher. He resumes what these \npeople do--abusing children. Eventually, he becomes principal, and \nwhile principal at the school, he rapes and murders a 12-year-old boy \nnamed Jeremy Bell.\n  So the practice of sending a letter of recommendation along with a \nmonster\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nsuch as this is known as passing the trash. As appalling as that is, it \nhappens enough that it has its own name. As a matter of fact, just \nFriday, I was in Pittsburgh and I was visiting a wonderful group of \npeople--Pittsburgh Action Against Rape--a great group of professionals \nwho do wonderful work, mostly helping victims cope with the aftermath \nof their assaults. One of the people I met there and heard from is the \npresident of the board of directors. Her name is Beth Docherty. She \ntold her story. Her story began when she was 15 years old. She was in \nthe band at her school when the band instructor began to rape her. When \nshe came forward and told the authorities what was happening, the \nschool promised the teacher they wouldn't conduct any investigation if \nhe would just quietly resign. Then the school wrote a glowing letter of \nrecommendation for this guy, which he took with him, went to Florida, \nand found a teaching job there.\n  Fortunately, the prosecutors in the case in Pennsylvania felt \nconfident that they had a strong enough case, and in time they were \nactually able to get him back from Florida. They prosecuted him and \nthey locked him up, and he is in jail today, where he belongs and might \nbe for the rest of his life.\n  The point of this is, as appalling and shocking as it is to our \nconscience that anyone would do this, I am here to say it happens. It \nhappens, and we need to do something about it for the sake of Jeremy \nBell and for the sake of Beth Docherty and who knows how many other \nchildren.\n  Our legislation simply requires that the State have a provision in \nits law that makes it illegal to knowingly recommend for hire someone \nwho is attacking kids. This, too, strikes me as a bill that should not \nbe controversial. It passed the House unanimously. But there are people \nwho are trying to kill this bill. We have some of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, and outside organizations from the left have \nargued against this.\n  I want to quote from a letter that was sent to all of us explaining \nwhy a number of those groups are opposing the legislation. Here is the \nquote. This is what they say in their letter:\n  ``Individuals who have been convicted of crimes and have completed \ntheir sentences should not be unnecessarily subjected to additional \npunishments because of these convictions.''\n  Well, wait a minute. Think about the logic of that position. By that \nlogic, an admitted convicted child molester who serves a 10-year prison \nsentence for his crime should be able to walk out of the jail, walk \ndown the street, apply for and get a job teaching elementary \nschoolkids. How ridiculous is that? It is completely ridiculous.\n  Our kids should not be involuntary members of a social experiment \nwhere we are trying to see which convicted child molesters are going to \nbe recividists. Frankly, most of them are. I am not willing to take the \nrisk that our kids should be left alone with people like that. We have \na National Sex Offender Registry for a reason. It is because we \nrecognize those people pose a danger that extends past the time of \ntheir incarceration. Parents need to know about that. That is why we \nhave this national registry. Schools need to avoid the danger.\n  To be clear, I am not suggesting a convicted child molester can never \nwork again anywhere, but I am saying they should not work in a school. \nI think that is completely reasonable. I am shocked, frankly, that \nthese organizations would come out against this commonsense \nlegislation.\n  But the objection, in fairness--some objection comes from our side of \nthe aisle as well. I have a colleague for whom I have all the respect \nin the world. The senior Senator from Tennessee is a wonderful Senator. \nI agree with him on far more than I disagree. But I have to say, I \nstrongly disagree with his view of this particular view. He has been \nhere on the Senate floor. He has been very upfront with me about his \nopposition to our bill. The basis of his opposition to my bill is he \nbelieves that passing the legislation Senator Manchin and I are \nproposing, requiring background checks and forbidding the passing of \ntrash, constitutes the equivalent of a national school board, that it \nis an unreasonable infringement on schools.\n  Well, I could not disagree more. Now the idea of a national school \nboard is a terrible idea. I have no interest in that. You will never \nhear me arguing that the Federal Government should impose on States and \nschool districts things such as appropriate class size, or whether you \nshould teach geometry before algebra in middle school, or what grade \nshould students read ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' Any of those kinds of \ncurriculum issues or testing issues should be left to local school \nboards and States. But that is not what we are trying to do here.\n  What I am saying with my legislation with Senator Manchin is if a \nState takes billions and billions of Federal tax dollars each year, \nthen you cannot use that money to pay the salary of a convicted child \nabuser. I think that is totally different. That is nothing like a \nnational school board.\n  Furthermore, we all voted in favor of the substance of these \nbackground check requirements when we all passed the child care \ndevelopment block grant bill, which, by the way, passed this Chamber \nwith one dissenting vote. It was 98 to 1. There was one ``no'' vote, \nwhich had nothing to do with the background check provisions, by the \nway. The senior Senator from Tennessee was an original cosponsor of \nthat legislation.\n  By the way, that also passed the House unanimously. It is virtually \nidentical. It holds that children in these daycare centers should have \nthe protection that comes with knowing the employees have gone through \nthis background check system.\n  So do we have a national daycare board? I do not think so. If it is \nokay to protect the youngest of kids, which it certainly is and should \nbe, why cannot we also extend that protection to kids who are a little \nbit older? We are insisting on a standard that is appropriate and \nrigorous for kids who are toddlers. Then when they go to kindergarten, \nwe are not going to have the same standard to protect them? That makes \nno sense to me at all.\n  Then another point I would make regarding this idea of a national \nschool board is this practice of passing the trash. When a school \ndistrict sends a letter of recommendation for a known offender, and he \ntakes that letter with him and goes across State lines, what can a \nsingle State do about that? The case I described of Jeremy Bell, the \nlittle boy who was killed by the teacher in West Virginia who \noriginated in Pennsylvania--what could West Virginia do to forbid \nPennsylvanians from sending a letter of recommendation for that \nteacher? Absolutely nothing is the answer. Because West Virginia's \nlegislative authority does not reach into Pennsylvania. This happens \nacross State lines. In fact, it is a very conscious decision on the \npart of many of these predators, because they want to put as much \ndistance between their criminal activities as they can. When they move, \nthey move far sometimes. So this demands a Federal response. There is \nnothing a State can do to solve this problem. That is why we address it \nin our bill.\n  The other point I would make is, look, this is not the first time we \nhave had the Federal Government establish some employment standards. We \nhave Federal laws that, for instance, ban discrimination in schools. \nSchools are not permitted, under Federal law--you cannot discriminate \nin your hiring on the basis of sex or race or age or religion or \npregnancy. Does that mean we have a national school board? Does that \nmean we have a national school board? Does this mean we have to repeal \nall of these laws? I do not think so. I think it is perfectly \nreasonable to have employment standards.\n  Finally, I would say do we not have some responsibility of oversight \nof how Federal tax dollars get spent by the States? I mean, do we send \nthe money and say: Hey, here is a pile of cash, do whatever you like \nwith it? I do not think that is a very reasonable standard. What could \nbe more reasonable than simply saying you cannot use Federal tax \ndollars we are responsible for if you are going to use it to pay the \nsalaries of convicted child abusers. I think that is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  I will say there may be alternative amendments here. There has been \nsome discussion that some of our colleagues may offer alternatives to \nthe legislation Senator Manchin and I have. I am still willing to work \nwith anyone on our side or the other side of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\nIf we can constructively work--if the goal is to actually get something \npassed that is going to be helpful, that is going to be constructive, \nthen I will work with anybody to get there. But there are a few things \nI will not agree to. I will not agree to a provision that, under the \nguise of privacy, requires a school to stay silent while a known child \nmolester seeks a new teaching job. That is not reasonable. I will not \nagree to a bill that does nothing to change the status quo, a bill that \ndoes nothing to provide additional protections for our kids.\n  Unfortunately, in my view, the amendment that is offered by the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee fits into this latter category. He has \ngot an amendment that I think provides absolutely no additional \nprotections. It says all States have to have a background check system. \nBut guess what. All States already do. The problem is, many of them are \ninadequate. As I said before, there is nothing a State can do about \npassing the trash across State lines. So it does nothing to stop \npassing the trash. It does nothing to stop schools from hiring a \nconvicted child rapist. It does not say anything about the standards of \nthe background check. The bill is so loose that if a State simply \ndecided to do a Google search, that would meet the criteria of the \nbill. It is completely unacceptable. It does not change the status quo. \nIt does nothing to protect the kids. You could make the argument that \nthis bill is arguably worse than doing nothing, because it could \nundermine the effort to do this right, create the illusion of having \ndone something at the national level when, in fact, it has not done so.\n  I will conclude by simply saying I am not prepared to settle for the \nstatus quo. I am not satisfied when we have a situation where 459 \nschool employees are arrested in a single year--arrested for sexual \nmisconduct with the kids they are supposed to be taking care of. \nObviously we have a problem here. I am not going to settle for a \npretend piece of legislation that accomplishes nothing.\n  What comes home to me is my own three kids. I have three young \nchildren. When one of my children gets on a schoolbus in the morning, I \nhave every right to expect the school that child is going to--the \nschool my child is going to--is as safe an environment for him or her \nas it can possibly be. Every other parent in Pennsylvania and every \nparent in America deserves to have peace of mind. Every child deserves \nto have that security. So that is why I am not going to give up on \nthis.\n  I am confident at some point our Democratic friends are going to \nrealize it is a huge mistake for them to continue their filibuster of \nthe trafficking bill. When they do, they will agree to let us proceed \nto it. When that happens, I will be back. Senator Manchin and I will \noffer our legislation as an amendment. We are going to have a debate \nabout it. We are going to have a vote about it. I certainly hope we win \nthis vote. This, again, is legislation that passed the House \nunanimously. If it passes the Senate, it is sure to become law. If it \ndoes not pass for some reason, then I am going to come back again and \nagain until it does.\n  I hope we will take this up sooner rather than later. I hope we get \non this bill still this week. There is still time. I know we will have \nan open amendment process when we do. I look forward to offering this \namendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, yesterday, I, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, filed an amendment to the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. This amendment, based on the Rape Survivor Child \nCustody Act which we filed as a stand-alone bill last Congress, would \nprovide grants to States that have laws on the books that allow women \nto petition for the termination of parental rights based on clear and \nconvincing evidence that a child was conceived through rape. The goal \nis to encourage more States to adopt such laws.\n  The amendment as drafted gives broad discretion to the Attorney \nGeneral to determine which States are eligible for grants and which are \nnot. For that reason, I would like to say a few words regarding our \nintention in drafting this amendment.\n  Under the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act, the Attorney General is \nempowered to make grants to ``States that have in place a law that \nallows the mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek \ncourt-order termination of the parental rights of her rapist with \nregard to that child, which the court is authorized to grant upon clear \nand convincing evidence of rape.'' Termination is defined as ``a \ncomplete and final termination of the parent's right to custody of, \nguardianship of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a \nchild.''\n  There are a number of States that have such a law on the books but \nwhich also state that parental rights can be reinstated if extenuating \ncircumstances occur. And while the bill states that a determination \nmust be final, the bill was drafted with the idea that there is a \ndifference between a ``final'' determination and an ``unmodifiable'' \none. And States with such laws on the books should still qualify \nbecause the amendment does not say the determination has to be \nunmodifiable, just final.\n  The intention as currently drafted is that 10 States would be \neligible under their current laws. These 10 States are Alaska, \nColorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, \nVermont, and Wisconsin. Once this amendment is hopefully adopted as \npart of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking and passed into law, I \nam confident that the Department of Justice will concur in this \nassessment.\n  In addition to this amendment, I have two other amendments which I \nfiled yesterday. The first amendment would provide help support local \nlaw enforcement in their efforts to track down homeless and runaway \nyouth by providing funding for retired Federal agents who assist the \nlocal law enforcement in these investigations.\n  In September of 2013, a group of retired FBI agents in Northwest Ohio \ncame to my office and asked for help in creating a pilot program that \nwould allow retired agents to assist local law enforcement in finding \nrunaway children and teens. Generally, Northwest Ohio children who \nbecome involved in trafficking do so within about 2 weeks of running \naway from home, so finding them quickly is critical. Overall, about \none-third of runaways become victims of trafficking.\n  Toledo has just one detective working on missing person's cases, both \nadults and children. These retired FBI agents want to help law-\nenforcement officials investigate the 18,000 runaways in Ohio every \nyear, but they need resources. Police don't have the manpower to track \nthese children, but every city has retired agents who could assist the \n``overworked'' departments.\n  The second amendment mirrors Congressman Maloney's Human Trafficking \nPrevention Act. This legislation comes in response to a State \nDepartment inspector general report recommended the changes made by \nthis amendment. It would train Foreign Service officers working at U.S. \nEmbassies overseas to help stem the demand for trafficking and spot \nvictims before they are trafficked into the United States. It passed \nthe House in January on a voice vote, and I am confident that it would \nfind similar broad support in the Senate.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Voting Rights Act Anniversary\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, today is the 50th anniversary of the \nintroduction of the bipartisan Voting Rights Act of 1965, a day we are \nreminded of what is possible when we come together across party lines.\n  It was 50 years ago today that Republican minority leader Senator \nEverett Dirksen and Democratic majority leader Senator Mike Mansfield \ncame together on this floor to introduce landmark legislation that \nsought to fulfill the promise of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution \nand ensure that no person would be denied the right to vote because of \nthe color of his or her skin.\n  I was reminded of the power of their example just 2 weeks ago when I \ngathered with Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate in \nSelma, AL, to honor the Americans who came\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\nfrom across our country 50 years ago to march across the Edmund Pettus \nBridge in Selma and demand equal voting rights. Their example was one \nof unity, as was the example of Members from both sides of the aisle \nwho came together to introduce and eventually pass the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965.\n  So I am concerned as I come to the floor this afternoon about our \ntroubling inability to come together in this Chamber on issues where \nthere clearly should be broad agreement as well. I have with me a \nphotographic reminder that the last time the Voting Rights Act was \nsigned into law--was reauthorized--it was signed by Republican \nPresident George Bush, with the support of both Democrats and \nRepublicans in the then Congress.\n  Those of us who gathered 2 weeks ago at the bridge at Selma were \ntreated both to a stirring speech by our current President, and the \ncheering presence of President Bush, when a challenge was issued to \nthose Members of Congress present that we should come together, fix the \nVoting Rights Act, and reintroduce it in this Chamber.\n  When it comes to voting rights, it surely is true that today's \nAmerica is not the America of half a century ago, just as today's \nhurdles to the ballot box are not the same as in the time of Jim Crow. \nYet it is also true that in too many cities, towns, States, and \ncounties across our country, new roadblocks are being built to make it \nmore difficult for Americans to vote.\n  It is clear that, as President Obama said to us on the Edmund Pettus \nBridge 2 weeks ago, ``our march is not yet finished.''\n  In the coming weeks, as Senator Leahy, I, and others work to bring to \nthe Senate a new voting rights act that reflects today's challenges, it \nis my sincere hope and my prayer that Republican colleagues will \npartner with us to continue the work that remains undone.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Madam President, this was also to be the week that we would take up, \nconsider, and vote on the nomination of Loretta Lynch to serve as \nAttorney General. I must say that the Senate's proceedings this week do \nnot portend well, because we find ourselves, yet again, stuck in \nregrettable partisan gridlock.\n  For the past 129 days, we have had before us an incredibly qualified \nand talented nominee for Attorney General. Loretta Lynch was first \nnominated by President Obama in November. She has now waited for a vote \nlonger than any Attorney General nominee in 30 years.\n  As of today, her confirmation has waited longer on the floor than the \nlast five Attorneys General combined.\n  That is unacceptable, and I frankly haven't heard a single good \nreason from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for why Ms. \nLynch's nomination deserves such a delay. Instead, her nomination is \nbeing used by many to continue their fight with the President over his \nimmigration policy, and this is after nearly shutting down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security because of those same disagreements.\n  While we do need to have a focused and functional debate in this \nCongress about immigration, it is simply irresponsible to hold up a \nhighly qualified nominee for Attorney General because some don't like \nthat she agrees with the very President who nominated her.\n  I take very seriously the Senate's role to advise and consent on \nPresidential nominations. So let's just take a minute and look at \nLoretta Lynch's experience, her background.\n  She is a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School. She \nspent 8 years in private practice at a prestigious law firm, then known \nas Hogan & Hartson. She served on the United Nations International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\n  She has served the public and previously been unanimously confirmed \nby this body--twice, I should add--to be the U.S. attorney for the \nEastern District of New York. That is a job where she has prosecuted \ndrug crimes, violent crimes, and where she has taken on corrupt \npoliticians.\n  At her nomination hearing in the Judiciary Committee, on which I \nserve, our chairman called an outside witness panel of nine witnesses. \nWhen asked, not one of them said they opposed Ms. Lynch's confirmation \nto be Attorney General on the basis of her skills or experience. The \ncommittee was, in fact, unable to produce one shred of testimony in \nopposition to her nomination.\n  Yet we stand today in the middle of March and the first African-\nAmerican woman ever to be nominated Attorney General of the United \nStates, our Nation's top law enforcement official, has foundered on \nthis floor longer than the five prior nominees combined. I think this \nis unacceptable and sets an unfortunate, even dangerous precedent. We \nshould not play political games with the Department of Justice, an \nexecutive branch agency with 125,000 employees and a $28 billion \ndepartmental budget that is charged with all sorts of different law \nenforcement functions, from running the Federal prisons to enforcing \nthe Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, to making sure we fight human \ntrafficking and money laundering.\n  Frustratingly, we find ourselves this week also considering a bill to \ncombat human trafficking, which we don't seem to be able to move \nforward. It is important legislation that includes broad bipartisan \nsupport, except for a simple, partisan, political provision that has \nnow turned it into a divisive issue.\n  The Republican leader this week has argued that once we finished work \non this human trafficking bill, we could then move on to Loretta \nLynch's nomination vote. But I am forced to wonder when the delay \ntactics here will end.\n  Not only is it seemingly untrue that we can't do human trafficking \nlegislation and this nomination at the same time--because if my memory \nserves, we just confirmed two other executive branch nominees last \nnight--but the Republican leader knows well that if he truly wanted to \nmove this bill forward, Democrats would be ready to partner with him \nwith just a minor revision to the bill.\n  There is, in fact, a bitter irony that, as was reported last night, \nLoretta Lynch's confirmation is being held up over an issue--human \ntrafficking--which she herself said she would prioritize if confirmed.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues: Let's find a way to move forward on \nall of these issues--on combatting human trafficking and confirming \nLoretta Lynch to serve as Attorney General and on reauthorizing the \nVoting Rights Act, which is such an important linchpin of civil rights \nin this country.\n  We agree that we need to combat human trafficking. So let's work \ntogether on the broad areas where we are, in fact, united. Let's \nconfirm an Attorney General nominee who is qualified, smart, and will \ngive the fight against human trafficking the dedication it deserves. \nMs. Lynch would make a superb Attorney General.\n  As someone who has herself served in law enforcement and served in \nthat role at the State level, I think the Presiding Officer appreciates \nthe importance of having a confirmed Attorney General to lead our \nFederal Department of Justice.\n  Loretta Lynch has demonstrated--throughout her confirmation process \nand through her many years of service to her country--that she is well \nand amply prepared and qualified to take on this vital and important \nrole.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the delays and give Loretta Lynch the \nvote our country deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Bringing Montana Solutions to Washington\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, it is an incredible honor to represent \nMontana in the Senate. More than 150 years ago, a young Norwegian woman \nnamed Karine Dyrud immigrated to this country. She came in search of \nfreedom and opportunity. She came to a nation where government served \nthe people and not the other way around. After her husband passed away, \nthis tough widow and mother of seven headed West to Montana and settled \nwith her children about an hour north of Great Falls.\n  Karine Dyrud was my great-great-grandmother and the beginning of my \nMontana story. Her perseverance is the reason why my family has called \nMontana home for five generations. It is\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\nwhy Cindy and I have been able to pass along the legacy of faith and \nfreedom, of personal responsibility, to our four children.\n  We are blessed to live in the greatest Nation on Earth, and it is a \nsolemn responsibility of the Senate to do everything in its power to \nkeep it that way.\n  Before I was elected to Congress, I spent 28 years in the private \nsector growing companies and creating jobs. In fact, I am the only \nchemical engineer in Congress. In the private sector, we understand the \nimportance of hard work, of innovation, accountability, and not \nspending more than you take in.\n  The freedom of ideas and trade, private property and opportunity, are \nthe fundamental elements of liberty and of prosperity. These are the \nelements that helped RightNow Technologies--a Montana-based cloud \ncomputing business that I served as vice president of for 12 years--\ngrow from a small startup into a publicly traded company and a global \nleader in cloud computing. We created over 1,000 high-paying jobs--jobs \nthat support a vibrant community with good schools and quality of life \nfor Montana families.\n  Unfortunately, Washington, DC, under the guise of equality, is \nencroaching upon these freedoms, replacing the constitutional rule of \nlaw through elected officials with bureaucratic rule that is \nunaccountable, inefficient, ineffective, and far too costly. Washington \nis more concerned with its own self-interest and self-gain than the \nwell-being of the American people.\n  As we begin consideration of the Federal budget this week, we must \nhold government accountable to the people. Last year, the New York \nTimes did an assessment of the health and wealth of every county in the \nNation. You might expect folks in Silicon Valley to be doing fairly \nwell or perhaps in the suburbs of New York City. What shocked me was \nseeing that six of the Nation's top 10 wealthiest counties surround \nWashington, DC. That sends a pretty clear message about where \nWashington priorities are.\n  During the recession, while millions of Americans were struggling to \nmake ends meet amidst layoffs and economic instability, Washington, DC, \nthrived. The Federal Government poured millions of dollars into new \nbuildings, and salaries kept growing and growing.\n  It is time for Washington to be held accountable to the American \npeople, and that is why the first bill I introduced in the Senate was \nthe Balanced Budget Accountability Act. It simply requires Congress to \nbalance the budget or Members won't get paid. It is not that \ncomplicated. It is easy to measure. It is very simple. No balanced \nbudget, no paycheck.\n  Washington is out of touch with the day-to-day struggles that \nAmerican farmers, ranchers, union workers, and tribal members face \nevery day. Look no farther than President Obama's recent veto of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. Instead of working toward North American energy \nindependence, President Obama continues to play politics with good-\npaying American jobs. Instead of advancing economic opportunity for \nhard-working Montana families, President Obama is instead perpetuating \nhis war on energy and standing in the way of affordable made-in-Montana \nand made-in-America energy.\n  While serving in the House, I invited Crow tribal chairman Darrin Old \nCoyote to testify before the Natural Resources Committee. The Crow \nReservation in Montana is home to some of the richest energy reserves \nin our country, but the President's senseless agenda is preventing them \nfrom developing their resources. What Chairman Old Coyote said has \nstuck with me. He said, ``A war on coal is a war on the Crow people.''\n  President Obama and the EPA's regulatory overreach is a direct threat \nto thousands of jobs and our Nation's economic future. We shouldn't be \nhitting pause on American energy production. We need to encourage it. \nMore made-in-America energy doesn't just mean more money in the pockets \nof hard-working families. It also means more jobs. It means energy \nindependence.\n  Our energy security, though, isn't just about jobs and low energy \nprices. It is tied directly to our national security. I am happy to \nreport the United States will become the largest oil and gas producer \nin the world this year, surpassing both Russia and Saudi Arabia. As we \nsee the growing threat of ISIS and a nuclear Iran, one thing is clear: \nWe need more made-in-America energy, not more made-in-the-Middle East \noil.\n  We have tremendous opportunities to develop our Nation's energy \nresources and create new jobs across the entire Nation, but we must \nallow the States to take the lead. Rather than moving forward with \ncommonsense, job-creating solutions, such as the Keystone Pipeline, \nWashington continues to put barrier after barrier up to prevent job \ncreation and the responsible management of our resources.\n  We see that in our national forests and our public lands. Our public \nlands out West are a tremendous asset to our tourism economy and our \nway of life. It is one of the many reasons people come to Montana in \nthe first place. But the Federal Government's perpetual failure to \nproperly manage our national forests has led many of Montana's forested \ncounties into economic despair. Like many Western States, Montana once \nboasted a robust timber industry. Now timber harvests in our national \nforests have declined 82 percent. In fact, I had dinner one evening \nwith a couple from Eureka, MT, up in the northwest corner of our State, \nin Lincoln County. They said: Steve, basically we describe this area \nnow as poverty with a view.\n  We must implement meaningful forest management reforms that get our \ntimber industry up and running again. It improves the health of our \nforests and it ensures our rural counties aren't dependent on the whims \nof the Federal Government's annual budget. But we must ensure that \nStates have primacy in these decisions. We must ensure the hard-working \nfarmers, the ranchers, the loggers, and the sportsmen who live, work, \nand recreate on these lands every day have their voices heard, and that \nthose closest to the land are guiding management practices, not \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC, or lawyers in San Francisco, who would \nbe hard pressed to find Montana on a map.\n  But Washington's overreach doesn't just affect our natural resources. \nWe are seeing it in our technology sector and the Internet. I worked in \nthe technology sector for more than 12 years. I know firsthand how the \nInternet has removed geography as a constraint for countless businesses \nin Montana and across our Nation.\n  I know technology has created jobs and economic opportunities in \ncommunities where little previously existed. We must encourage the \ngrowth of these high-tech jobs in Montana and across our country. These \nare good-paying jobs that will help us grow economically and allow us \nto remain globally competitive.\n  The Internet is a laboratory of innovation, yet DC wants to tie our \nentrepreneurs' hands by placing more regulations on the Internet. The \nFCC recently approved a 300-plus-page plan to regulate Americans' \nInternet access as a title II utility, in short, a government takeover \nof the Internet. That is like putting a buggy whip manufacturer in \ncharge of Tesla.\n  The Internet is unconstrained innovation. That is why I will stand \nstrong against DC's attempts to tax the Internet, to regulate the \nInternet, and to stifle innovation. If we want to remain the greatest \nNation in the world, we need to remain globally competitive, and \ntechnology plays a key role in that.\n  We also must implement meaningful tax reforms that encourage American \nbusinesses, incentivize American businesses to grow and create jobs \nhere at home, not overseas. During my time at our software company, in \nthe last 5 years I managed Asia Pacific, and I had offices in Tokyo and \nSidney, but headquartered in Bozeman, MT, as we were growing and \ncompeting against some of the world's best technology companies.\n  We must expand our trade opportunities, certainly for our farmers and \nranchers across our country. So it is important that innovation and \nentrepreneurship are encouraged, not hindered. Unfortunately, \nWashington, DC, is more interested in issuing press releases and \nheadlines than getting results.\n  As an engineer, I was trained to solve problems, find solutions, and \nget results. It is time for Washington to look to the States for these \nsolutions--to adhere to the principles of federalism\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\nand States rights, as clearly found in our Constitution--and empowering \nlocal communities, State legislatures, Governors, and tribes to manage \ntheir resources, to grow economic opportunity, and to find and \ndetermine their own destiny.\n  In fact, it is time for Washington to listen to the States and it is \ntime for Washington, DC, to listen to Montana.\n  I have always said one of the best decisions I ever made in my life \nwas when I picked my great-great-grandmother. She got her family out to \nMontana, and she is buried in a small country cemetery just east of a \nsmall town called Conrad, MT. On her headstone, in this very remote \nsmall country cemetery, reads three simple words: ``saved by grace.'' \nShe placed her ultimate faith in her God, not in her government.\n  It is an honor to stand here today on the Senate floor to serve as \nMontana's voice in Washington. I will continue working to bring more \nMontana solutions to Washington and get it working again for all \nMontanans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                     Congratulating Senator Daines\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to congratulate our freshman \ncolleague from Montana on his initial speech, and particularly to \nsecond his observations about the devastation in the coalfields of \nAmerica. We have a depression in the eastern part of my State as a \ndirect result of this administration and the EPA, and I know it has \naffected the great State of Montana as well. So among the many \ninsightful observations the Senator from Montana made, I particularly \nappreciate his thoughts about energy.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for the \ncommittee-reported amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak on two topics. The \nfirst topic is to urge my colleagues to bring up the vote on Loretta \nLynch right away. The delay on her nomination to be Attorney General \nhas gone on long enough, and there are no longer any legitimate \nexcuses. She is by all accounts an excellent candidate. She is highly \nqualified, and she has bipartisan support in the Committee on the \nJudiciary. No one has questioned her stellar credentials. Her \nnomination has been held up for too long. In fact, Republicans have \nheld up her nomination longer than the five most recent Attorney \nGeneral nominees combined. But now her nomination has been tied to a \npiece of legislation that Republicans themselves have poisoned. Why are \nthey putting poison pills in their own legislation? They took a \nperfectly good bipartisan bill and ensured it would go nowhere. Then \nthey took a perfectly qualified Attorney General nominee and tied her \nvote to their poisoned legislation.\n  The majority party is getting in its own way when it comes to the \nmajor responsibilities of governing. It is time for the Republicans to \nact like the majority and govern. This is the difference between being \nin the majority and being in the minority. Putting poison pills in \nlegislative vehicles may be an odious practice, but it is normally \nreserved for the minority party--the party that is not in charge. \nGenerally speaking, you do not poison your own piece of legislation.\n  The American people have given the keys to the car to the Republican \nParty, and now they need to drive the car. This is the difference \nbetween being in the minority and the majority. Governing includes \ngiving advice and consent on nominations. This is a particularly \nimportant nomination. The Attorney General is the top law enforcement \nofficial in the country. He or she is responsible for enforcing our \nNation's laws, protecting national security, and upholding our \nconstitutional rights.\n  This last role is vital at a time when the DOJ is investigating \nviolations of constitutional rights by local law enforcement agencies. \nJust last week, DOJ released a scathing report on the deep and \npervasive racism in the Ferguson, MO, police force. In that report, the \nDepartment described shocking practices: systematic targeting of \nAfrican Americans and an abuse of power to collect enormous amounts in \nfees. In a city with a population of 21,000 people, 16,000 people have \noutstanding arrest warrants--16,000 people. That is three-quarters of \nFerguson's population. Those arrest warrants are overwhelmingly issued \nto Ferguson's African-American population--92 percent, to be exact. \nEmails and other documents DOJ collected prove the Ferguson police \nforce acted with racial animus.\n  If confirmed, Ms. Lynch would continue DOJ's task of investigating \nunconstitutional policing across the country. She faces weighty \nissues--the over-militarization of our police, our policing practices, \nand reforming our sentencing guidelines, just to name a few.\n  As the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General, \nthis would be a historic nomination and a crucial one.\n  At a time when the public's trust in law enforcement is badly eroded, \nwe need to confirm Ms. Lynch as our Attorney General and let her get to \nwork on fighting for our civil rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1575-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1575-S1576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HOUSE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, today the House released its budget \nproposal. It is a proposal divorced from reality that seeks to balance \nthe budget on the backs of those in the country who can least afford \nit. It takes from the middle class and gives to the ultrawealthy.\n  Without a doubt, my colleagues and I will have much more to say about \nthe Republican budget in the coming weeks and months, but today I want \nto discuss a section of the budget that seeks\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nto deny the very real and very current threat of climate change to our \npublic health and military readiness.\n  The Department of Defense is responsible for protecting the security \nof the United States, and that requires taking into consideration every \nthreat and every threat multiplier that affects the global security \nenvironment and our national interests, including climate change. That \nis why the military spends considerable time assessing the effects \nclimate change could have on its facilities, capabilities, and \nmissions, and how those effects could undermine its ability to protect \nour national security. It is unfortunate that today in their budget \nproposal House Republicans said that this planning is wasteful \nspending. I am as against wasteful spending as anyone, but preparing \nfor threats to our national security planning and operations is the \nopposite of wasteful. It is prudent.\n  Today, I want to talk about how a climate change prohibition would \ntie the hands of our national defense strategy.\n  Climate change affects our national security in two major ways.\n  First, the DOD has warned that climate change is likely to impact the \nmilitary's facilities and capabilities. In particular, America's \nmilitary bases may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.\n  According to a 2008 National Intelligence Council finding, ``more \nthan 30 U.S. military installations were already facing elevated levels \nof risk from rising sea levels.'' In my home State of Hawaii, for \nexample, Navy and Marine Corps installations such as Pearl Harbor and \nMarine Corps base Kaneohe Bay are literally on the water's edge.\n  According to the Department of Defense, the combination of decreasing \nsea ice, rising sea levels, and thawing permafrost along the coast of \nAlaska has increased coastal erosion at several Air Force radar early \nwarning and communication installations. This coastal erosion has \nalready damaged roads, seawalls, and runways at our bases.\n  Second, climate change exacerbates the drivers of global instability, \nincluding drought, food shortages, water scarcity, and pandemic \ndisease.\n  ADM Sam Locklear III, commander of the USPACOM, said that the biggest \nlong-term security threat in the region is climate change because ``it \nis probably the most likely thing that is going to happen . . . that \nwill cripple the security environment.''\n  I would like to make a point here. The Department of Defense is in no \nposition to get caught up in our partisan or ideological battles. The \nDepartment of Defense has to deal with what is. The Department of \nDefense has to prepare for and contend with reality. And we should have \ndebates on the Senate floor. We should talk about whether the \nPresident's clean powerplant is the right approach. We should talk \nabout how we should approach international agreements coming into the \nParis Accords. Let's have that debate about whether a carbon fee is the \nmost prudent approach. But what we should not do is make it impossible \nfor the Department of Defense to do its planning and preparation. That \nis what the House budget does.\n  In its 2014 QDR, the Department of Defense warned that the effects of \nclimate change ``are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors \nabroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political \ninstability, and social tensions--conditions that can enable terrorist \nactivity and other forms of violence.'' The stresses could break the \nbacks of weak governments and institutions in countries around the \nworld where the United States has enduring interests. In particular, \nthe National Intelligence Council stated in its ``Global Trends 2030'' \nreport that climate change will pose stiff challenges to governance in \nplaces such as Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n  That is why I find it ironic that many of my Republican colleagues \nwho are so committed to slowing the pace of our withdrawal from \nAfghanistan on the premise that doing so will preserve our security \ngains and keep Afghanistan stable are now tying the hands of the \nnational security community so that they are unable to study the \nsecurity effects of climate change on Afghanistan and the region. \nAgain, I don't think we should tell them how to study it, what \nconclusions to draw, what preparations to make, except to say that we \nshould stay out of their way as they do their security planning, as \nthey do their security preparation. I am not suggesting that they take \nmy view on climate change; I am suggesting that they be allowed to deal \nwith what is and that they not be sucked into a partisan ideological \nbattle over climate change. They don't have the luxury of getting \nsucked into a partisan ideological battle when it comes to climate \nchange. They have to deal with what is because they are responsible for \nour national defense.\n  Fortunately, while some in Congress play politics, our military \nleaders are clear-eyed about the current and present threats posed by \nclimate change, and they are making the necessary investments in \nknowledge of impacts to their readiness and to regional and global \nconflicts. We need to back them up and make sure that climate deniers \ndo not tie one hand behind their back while they work to understand the \nthreats to defend our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the senior Senator from Illinois and the junior Senator \nfrom New Jersey, as well as the junior Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1576-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1576-S1580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SMARTER SENTENCING ACT\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, we rise today to speak in favor of the \nSmarter Sentencing Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that would \nmake targeted reforms to mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent \ndrug offenders.\n  I was proud to join my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, in introducing this legislation. He and I wish to thank our \ncosponsors, Senators Jeff Flake, Cory Booker, Ted Cruz, Pat Leahy, Rand \nPaul, Sheldon Whitehouse, Johnny Isakson, and Chris Coons.\n  I also wish to thank the lead sponsors of the House version of the \nSmarter Sentencing Act, Congressmen Rauul Labrador and Bobby Scott.\n  It is not often that you see a political coalition such as this one \non Capitol Hill. It reflects the importance of an issue whose time has \ncome--reforming our Federal sentencing laws. We come to the floor today \nto explain what the Smarter Sentencing Act does and to address some \ncommon misconceptions about our bill that have been expressed on the \nSenate floor.\n  I ask my friend and colleague Senator Durbin: What problems does the \nSmarter Sentencing Act seek to address?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah not only \nfor his leadership on this issue but for the fact that we have been \nable to work together on an issue that is not considered to be simple \nin nature. It is challenging, complex, and controversial in some \nrespects. As the Senator mentioned at the outset, we have done it on a \nbipartisan basis. If one looks at the cosponsors of the Smarter \nSentencing Act, they span the political spectrum.\n  I was standing at our press conference--as the Senator from Utah was \nspeaking--next to Senator Ted Cruz. Some said: Durbin and Cruz are on \nthe same bill? As the saying goes around here, obviously one of us has \nnot read it. The fact is that we both read it, and we both understand \nthe importance of this undertaking.\n  Our criminal justice system in America is in crisis. The United \nStates of America holds more prisoners, by far, than any other country \nin the world. The Federal prison population has grown by 750 percent \nsince 1980 and our Federal prisons are approximately 30 percent over \ncapacity.\n  Over the past 30 years, spending on Federal incarceration has \nincreased more than 1,100 percent. Our exploding prison population now \nconsumes a quarter of the Justice Department's\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\ndiscretionary budget. These runaway expenditures are undermining other \nlaw enforcement efforts. The U.S. attorney's office and the Drug \nEnforcement Administration have already lost hundreds of positions, and \nresources for State and local law enforcement have decreased \ndramatically.\n  The biggest drivers of growth in the Federal prison population are \ndrug sentences. There are almost 50,000 more drug offenders in Federal \nprisons now than 20 years ago--50,000. This problem is made even worse \nby mandatory minimum sentences which have grown by 155 percent over the \npast 15 years. One-third of all Federal prisoners are now subject to \nmandatory minimums and 50 percent of those are drug offenders.\n  These mandatory penalties don't allow our courts to distinguish \nbetween the big-time career offenders, who ought to be the focus of our \neffort, and lower-level offenders. Now, that just is not very smart, \nand it is not effective when it comes to holding offenders accountable \nand protecting public safety.\n  We are expected to be joined at any minute by the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Booker, and I thank my friend for joining us in this effort \nto spotlight this important issue of criminal justice reform.\n  I will turn the floor over for my colleague and the lead sponsor of \nthis bill, Senator Lee, to respond to the question of the importance of \nthis undertaking.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, we have new research that shows there are \ntwo big problems we face as a result of these mandatory minimum \nsentences within our Federal system. First, they are not needed to \nensure public safety in many instances, and second, they are having a \nvery negative impact on certain disadvantaged communities.\n  Last year, the National Research Council of the National Academies \nissued a major study of incarceration in the United States. One of \ntheir main conclusions is that mandatory sentencing and excessively \nlong sentences generally do not have a significant deterrent effect and \nare ineffective unless targeted at offenders with a very high rate of \nrecidivism or extremely dangerous offenders.\n  The National Research Council concluded: ``[We] have reviewed the \nresearch literature on the deterrent effect of such laws and have \nconcluded that the evidence is insufficient to justify the conclusion \nthat these harsher punishments yield measurable public safety \nbenefits.''\n  And recent data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent \nand bipartisan Federal agency, shows that shorter sentences can \naccomplish the same goals without compromising public safety.\n  Our communities have paid a high cost for the stiff sentences that \nmandatory minimums require. The National Research Council found that \nhigh incarceration rates are concentrated in poor, minority \nneighborhoods, and that the incarceration of significant numbers of \nresidents in these neighborhoods actually compounded existing social \nand economic problems such as unemployment, poverty, family disruption, \npoor health, and drug addiction.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if I could ask the Senator from Utah if \nhe would yield for a moment.\n  Mr. LEE. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Booker has joined us, and we are happy to have \nhis cosponsorship on this legislation. I hope he might be able to make \nsome of his own observations on the very issue the Senator from Utah \nhas been discussing.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I wish to pick up where my friend left \noff. I thank, from the bottom of my heart, the leadership of Senator \nLee and Senator Durbin on what is an extraordinary piece of legislation \nin terms of its impact.\n  My colleagues have made it clear time and again--in the last Congress \nand in this Congress--that the application of mandatory minimum \nsentences, especially in drug cases, feeds the perception of pervasive \nunfairness in our criminal justice system just for the points that \nSenator Lee was making. This perception is based in that reality.\n  When I was mayor, I used to always say, ``In God we trust,'' but \neveryone else, ``Bring me data.'' The data is clear from the U.S. \nSentencing Commission, which shows that mandatory minimums have a \ndisparate impact on minority communities.\n  Let's be clear. The majority of illegal drug users and dealers in our \ncountry are white, but three-quarters of all the people incarcerated \nfor drug offenses are Black and Latino, and the large majority of \nindividuals subject to Federal mandatory minimum penalties are African \nAmerican and Hispanic. That perception is fed by this reality: African \nAmericans are granted relief from mandatory minimum penalties as are \nother citizens under the so-called safety valve, but Blacks get the \nsafety valve far less than other groups.\n  For example, the data shows that in 2010, 63.7 percent of White \noffenders received the safety valve relief while only 39.4 percent of \nBlack offenders received that benefit.\n  In 2012, Blacks were 26.3 percent of all drug offenders, but they \nwere 35.2 percent of the drug offenders who received no safety valves \nwhatsoever--no relief from the mandatory minimum penalties.\n  I will now yield back for Senator Lee, again, the lead sponsor of \nthis bipartisan legislation, and I ask the Senator: What does this \nlegislation do, specifically, to address mandatory minimums?\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nthis question, which really cuts to the heart of many of the most \nimportant reasons why we feel this bill needs to become law.\n  First, the Smarter Sentencing Act would reduce Federal mandatory \nminimum penalties for drug offenses in a very targeted way. Our bill \nwould allow Federal judges to determine--on a case-by-case basis--when \nthe harshest penalties should apply. We don't repeal any mandatory \nminimum sentences, and we do not lower any maximum sentences. This \napproach maintains a floor below which no offenders can be sentenced, \nbut it gives judges the discretion to determine when the very harshest \npenalties should apply in a particular case.\n  These changes in mandatory minimum sentences do not apply to violent \noffenses, and they do not apply to offenders who import drugs into the \nUnited States unless, of course, the offender's role is limited solely \nto transporting or storing drugs or money.\n  Second, the Smarter Sentencing Act would modestly expand the Federal \nsafety valve, which allows Federal judges to sentence a limited number \nof nonviolent drug offenders at levels below the mandatory minimum \nsentence. Our bill would expand the safety valve to nonviolent \noffenders with only a minor criminal history. Individuals who use \nweapons or play a leadership role in the offense in question would be \nineligible for the safety valve in those circumstances.\n  I ask the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to explain other \nimportant provisions of our bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  When I was a Member of the House of Representatives many years ago, \nwe were told there were some dramatic changes when it came to the use \nof narcotics in America. In fact, they came to us and said: We are \nworried. There is a new form of cocaine called crack cocaine. It is \ndirt cheap. It is $5 for a hit. It is deadly addictive, and if a woman \nis addicted to it and happens to be pregnant, it could seriously damage \nthe baby she is carrying.\n  We did something at the time which seemed like the right thing to do. \nWhat we did was to establish a sentencing standard for crack cocaine \ndramatically larger than powder cocaine--100 times larger. I voted for \nit, and the belief was that we were sending a clear message to anyone \nin America: If you get caught with crack cocaine, we are going to throw \nthe book at you. That is what we voted for.\n  I remember that the rollcall in the House of Representatives was \nbipartisan. We felt--all across the spectrum: Let's get the message out \nand get it out now before crack cocaine causes its damage.\n  Under the law at the time, it took 100 times more powdered cocaine \nthan crack to trigger the same mandatory minimum sentences--100 times. \nFor example, possessing 5 grams of crack carried the same 5-year \nmandatory minimum sentence as selling 500 grams of powdered cocaine. \nThat was the 100-to-1 crack-powder sentencing disparity.\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nThe crack-powder disparity disproportionately affected African \nAmericans, who made up more than 80 percent of those convicted of \nFederal crack offenses.\n  At a hearing I held in 2009, former Bush administration DEA head Asa \nHutchison, known to many of us as a former colleague in the House, \ntestified: ``Under the current disparity, the credibility of our entire \ndrug enforcement system is weakened.''\n  What was happening? African Americans were noting what was going on \nhere. They were being sent, as Senator Booker said, over to the prison \nsystem and put away for years and years for the use of a tiny amount of \ncrack cocaine because of the sentencing guidelines that we established \nin the House of Representatives. The Smarter Sentencing Act addresses \nthis issue.\n  I might add that in 2010, I joined with Senator Jeff Sessions, a \nRepublican from Alabama, in sponsoring the Fair Sentencing Act. We \ndecided that we would address this issue of the 100-to-1 disparity and \ntry to make sense out of it. I support 1 to 1. I think that is what the \nscience backs. But we reached a political agreement--that is the nature \nof the Senate and the House. The bill unanimously passed the Senate and \nthe House and was signed into law by the President. The Fair Sentencing \nAct reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powdered \ncocaine.\n  The Smarter Sentencing Act--the bill we are considering today--\naddresses this again. It would allow some inmates who were sentenced \nbefore the Fair Sentencing Act to petition for the sentence reductions \nthat this law put in place in 2010. This provision would not \nautomatically reduce a single sentence of anyone serving under the old \n100-to-1 standard, but it would allow Federal judges and prosecutors to \nconduct a case-by-case, singular, individual review as to whether the \nindividual should have their sentence reduced. Responding to our \ndecreased reliance on prisons, the Smarter Sentencing Act would direct \nthe Justice Department to report to Congress on how the cost savings \nfrom our bill would be used to reduce crime and prevent recidivism.\n\n  Let's respond to a few misstatements that have been made about the \nSmarter Sentencing Act. One of our colleagues said: ``We are not \nsending huge numbers of nonviolent drug offenders to Federal prison \nunder lengthy mandatory minimum sentences.''\n  I ask the Senator from New Jersey how he would respond to that \ncomment?\n  (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BOOKER. I appreciate that, and I hope we all in the Senate can \ndeal with the same set of facts. We are entitled to different opinions \nand different conclusions regarding the facts, but we should not be \ndebating facts when we have them here before us.\n  So let's take a look at those facts. In 2011, the sentencing \ncommission issued a comprehensive study about mandatory minimum \nsentences. The study found that almost 55,000 people were in Federal \nprisons serving mandatory minimum sentences for a drug crime. That was \nmore than 50 percent of all Federal drug offenders and more than a \nquarter--25 percent--of all Federal prisoners, period.\n  Second, the great majority of Federal drug offenders do not use \nviolence. Let me say that one more time because it is very important. \nWe are talking about in this bill nonviolent offenders, and the great \nmajority do not use violence. The sentencing commission's most recent \ndata shows that less than 1 percent of offenders used or threatened \nviolence in committing their crime, and no weapons--no weapons--were \ninvolved in more than 80 percent of drug cases.\n  Third, many of those serving mandatory minimum drug sentences are \nlow-level offenders. It is true that certain low-level offenders such \nas the couriers don't often receive mandatory minimums. But other low-\nlevel offenders frequently are sentenced to mandatory minimums.\n  For example, among those who are most likely to receive a mandatory \nminimum sentence are street-level dealers--those who sell less than 1 \nounce of a drug. Almost 45 percent of street-level dealers are serving \nmandatory minimums in Federal prison.\n  Finally, these mandatory minimum sentences are lengthy. They are \ncostly. They drain taxpayer resources. A recent sentencing commission \nstudy shows that the average sentence for mandatory minimums was 132 \nmonths--11 years in Federal prison without parole.\n  Some claim also that mandatory minimum prison sentences are not a \nmajor factor in the massive increase in the Federal prison population \nand overcrowding in Federal prisons. Remember, in the last 30 years, we \nhave had an explosion in our Federal prison population--800 percent. \nSome people say that mandatory minimums have had nothing to do with \nthat. I look to my colleague from Utah to respond. Is that true?\n  Mr. LEE. It is not true. It is simply inaccurate. So those who insist \nthat our exploding Federal prison population somehow has nothing to do \nwith the explosive use of mandatory minimum prison sentences within our \nFederal system are simply wrong.\n  In its 2011 report, the U.S. Sentencing Commission concluded that \nmandatory minimums have had ``a significant impact on the Federal \nprison population.''\n  From 1995 through 2010, the number of Federal prisoners serving a \nmandatory minimum sentence grew from 29,603 to 75,579. That is a 155-\npercent increase. It represents over one-third of all Federal \nprisoners.\n  As of December 2014, over 59 percent of the 210,567 Federal inmates--\n125,000 inmates over all--had been convicted of an offense carrying a \nmandatory minimum. Of these, 74.3 percent, which represents 91,806 \ninmates, were required to serve that mandatory minimum sentence or \nmore.\n  In 2013, 62.1 percent of all drug offenders were convicted of an \noffense carrying a mandatory minimum. Over 60 percent of them received \nno safety valve relief and 70 percent of them did not receive relief \nfor cooperating with authorities.\n  Some have argued that those serving sentences for nonviolent drug \noffenses have long and violent criminal histories, but sentencing \ncommission data shows this is inaccurate. In 2013, 49.6 percent of drug \noffenders had little or no criminal history, and only 7 percent of drug \noffenders were sentenced under the ``career offender'' sentencing \nguideline, which requires two prior convictions for a drug offense or a \ncrime of violence.\n  But here is the important point: The Smarter Sentencing Act reduces \ncertain mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, but \nwe do not lower the maximum sentence. That means a judge can sentence \noffenders all the way up to the statutory maximum if she determines it \nis appropriate under the circumstances.\n  Some have raised concerns about how reducing mandatory minimum \nsentences might impact serious problems such as the heroin epidemic or \nnarcoterrorism. Can the Senator from Illinois address that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to address that because it is a problem in my \nState and across the United States. We are finding that high school \nstudents are turning to heroin. It is affordable, sadly. It is \naffordable, and they are using it as an alternative to other drugs. We \ncertainly know the peril and dangers from narcoterrorism. The Smarter \nSentencing Act which we are cosponsoring only reduces mandatory minimum \nsentences for nonviolent drug offenses. There is a separate mandatory \nminimum of 20 years that applies when the drugs have resulted in death \nor serious bodily injury. Any dealer who sells drugs that killed or \nhurt someone, such as an accidental overdose, will still be subject to \nthe same mandatory minimum of 20 years. Our bill does not touch that \nprovision of the law.\n  As for narcoterrorism, a special Federal sentencing guideline \napplies. The truth is charges under that statute are very rare. Between \n2008 and 2012, only three cases--three--out of almost 200,000 were \nsentenced under that guideline. But the Smarter Sentencing Act does not \nchange the sentencing guideline enhancement for narcoterrorism or any \nof the enhancements for terrorism. We don't cut corners when it comes \nto that serious crime.\n  In fact, our bill directs the sentencing commission to ensure that \nsevere sentences for ``violent, repeat, and serious drug traffickers \nwho present public safety risks remain in place.'' Also, there will \ncontinue to be dozens\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\nof statutory penalties and sentencing enhancements in the sentencing \nguidelines allowing judges to impose heightened sentences for violent \nand repeat offenders.\n  The Smarter Sentencing Act which we are describing doesn't \nautomatically reduce a single sentence and it doesn't eliminate any \nmandatory minimum or reduce any maximum sentence at all. Our bill \nsimply restores the traditional authority of a Federal judge to impose \na sentence that fits the crime and the criminal, based on the \ncircumstances of the case, while maintaining a floor below which no one \nperson can be sentenced.\n  Can the Senator from New Jersey discuss the impact the Smarter \nSentencing Act will have on communities that have been most negatively \nimpacted by the crisis in our Federal justice system?\n  Mr. BOOKER. I appreciate that question. This is one of the reasons I \nam so passionate about the legislation originally introduced by Senator \nLee and the Senator from Illinois, because the mandatory minimums are \npatently unfair to people all across America. Whether one is White or \nBlack, to have a disproportionate sentence unnecessary to punish a \nperson and prevent a person from doing a future nonviolent crime is bad \nenough, but when we are talking about, as the Senator from Illinois was \nbefore, so negatively concentrated in certain urban areas, it creates \nan invasive belief that begins to undermine faith in our criminal \njustice system alone. As we said earlier, the overwhelming majority of \ndrug users and sellers are White, but the overwhelming number of people \nincarcerated and arrested for it are Black, as well as those receiving \nmandatory minimums.\n  But what people have to understand is that this has a punishing \neffect on us all. No. 1, it is hurting families. A friend of mine \nbrought to my attention a ``Sesame Street'' clip where even the \neducators in public broadcasting are seeing that certain communities \nhave so many of their men--nonviolent offenders--being sucked into the \nprison system for these long sentences that we have created a \ngeneration of children growing up without their parents. That has a \ndifficult impact when it comes to the poverty of that family, when it \ncomes to the challenges of having a provider pull away. So the Smarter \nSentencing Act is a tool to help to relieve that problem, as well as \nthe costs to us all.\n  What is wonderful--at a time when we have debt, when we need to \ninvest in infrastructure and many other needs, the current system is \ncosting us hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This legislation I \nhave signed on to as a cosponsor offers a savings that can be \nredirected to community efforts that prevent crime in the first place--\nevidence-based programs that undermine crimes in the first place--as \nwell as to helping people coming out of prison stay out of prison. We \ncan save money and still protect public safety with lower rates of \nincarceration and a greater reliance on community revision and \ntreatment.\n  The wonderful thing about this is that what I am saying is not \nspeculation. It is the facts we are experiencing in States that have \nalready embraced reducing mandatory minimums. In fact, many of these \nStates--and it is wonderful that this is bipartisan legislation--many \nStates are red States. We are seeing this path of reducing crime, \nreducing prison populations, creating savings, being shown to us in \nState after State model that the Federal Government should follow--\nmodels seen in Texas and in Georgia.\n  Senator Flake encouraged us to pay attention to overcriminalization \nin the Federal system. He too is a champion of reforming the system and \nmaking it better. I wish to ask the Senator from Arizona: How does the \nSmarter Sentencing Act address the problem of overcriminalization?\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator from New Jersey, and I thank Senator \nDurbin and Senator Lee. It is great to be a part of this bipartisan \neffort, the Smarter Sentencing Act.\n  This is important because this section requires the Attorney General \nand the heads of certain Federal agencies to each submit a public \nreport that identifies all criminal offenses that are established by \nstatute or regulation that each agency enforces. These reports must \nprovide information on the elements of each offense, the potential \npenalty and the required intent for each offense, and the number of \nprosecutions for each offense for the last 15 years. This is valuable \ninformation.\n  This section also requires the Attorney General and the relevant \nagencies to establish a publicly accessible index for these offenses. \nThis information is an important step toward understanding the scope of \nthe overcriminalization problem. When we have this information, we will \nhave a better idea of why these sentences are being imposed and we can \nmake better recommendations moving ahead.\n  There are some who argue that long mandatory prison sentences \nencourage defendants to plead guilty and to cooperate with prosecutors. \nThey claim that by reducing mandatory minimum sentences, our bill will \nreduce the incentive for defendants to plead guilty and thus cooperate.\n  How would the Senator from Utah respond to that complaint?\n  Mr. LEE. Those who make that argument--those who suggest that by \npassing this bill we would reduce the bargaining power of prosecutors--\nare mistaken.\n  The sentencing commission data on this point shows that the longer a \nmandatory minimum sentence is, the more likely a defendant is not to \nplead guilty and to cooperate and instead to insist on going to trial.\n  Sentencing commission data also showed that rates of cooperation for \ncrimes that have no mandatory minimum sentence are the same and even \nhigher for drugs that do have rigid mandatory minimum sentences.\n  The reality is that defendants are most likely to cooperate when they \nhave information to give. That is why high-level drug offenders receive \nrelief of mandatory minimum sentences at much higher rates than lower \noffenders. Defendants who organize or manage a drug trafficking \nenterprise have the most information with which to bargain as they \nenter into discussions with prosecutors. Low-level offenders who have \nless responsibility and less knowledge often don't have much \ninformation to offer, no matter how long a mandatory minimum sentence \nthey might face in a particular case.\n  Judge William Wilkins, who was appointed to the bench by President \nReagan and served as the first chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, \nsaid the following:\n\n       There are few Federal judges engaged in criminal sentencing \n     who have not had the disheartening experience of seeing major \n     players in crimes before them immunize themselves from the \n     mandatory minimum sentences by blowing the whistle on their \n     minions, while the low-level offenders find themselves \n     sentenced to the mandatory minimum prison term so skillfully \n     avoided by the kingpins.\n\n  Some of them claim the Smarter Sentencing Act will add up to $1 \nbillion in Federal spending.\n  Senator Flake, is that true?\n  Mr. FLAKE. That is creative accounting, to put it mildly. Here is the \nreality. The Congressional Budget Office has taken a look at this and \nhas analyzed the impact of passing the Smarter Sentencing Act. It is \ntrue there will be costs incurred mainly because of benefits that are \npaid to people who are not in prison for so long, but the CBO estimated \nthat in the first 10 years alone, our bill would save approximately $4 \nbillion, for a net savings of about $3 billion. Those savings can be \nredirected to efforts to reduce and prevent crime in the first place.\n  Senator Booker, I think it is partly because of this reason, the cost \nsavings, that we have such broad support of the bill. Would the Senator \ndiscuss some of the groups that are supporting this legislation?\n  Mr. BOOKER. This incredible convergence of people from all different \nstripes in our country, all different backgrounds, races, religions, \nand political philosophy--let's just start with the bipartisan U.S. \nSentencing Commission and the Judicial Conference have both urged \nCongress to reduce mandatory minimum penalties and both have stated \ntheir support for this legislation, the Smarter Sentencing Act.\n  It is supported by faith leaders such as the Justice Fellowship and \nthe United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It is supported by \nadvocacy groups across the political spectrum and has been endorsed by \nconservative leaders such as Grover Norquist and\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform, Eli Lehrer and the R Street Institute, Pat \nNolan, former president of the Justice Fellowship, Marc Levin of the \nTexas Public Policy Institute, and Freedom Works.\n  It is supported by law enforcement leaders, including the Major \nCities Chiefs Association and the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, \nwhich represents many of the largest district attorney's offices in the \ncountry--big cities. They represent county, Federal, State, and local \nprosecutors--prosecutors at every level.\n  The bill is supported by the Council of Prison Locals, which \nrepresents more than 28,000 correctional workers in the Federal Bureau \nof Prisons. The bill is also supported by crime victims themselves, \nincluding the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, \na coalition of more than 1,000 different organizations that advocate on \nbehalf of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking. As they explain, mandatory minimum drug \nsentences are draining the resources needed for victims. Women who are \nvictims of domestic violence sometimes end up serving long sentences \nthat the Congress intended for kingpins and other drug organization \nleaders. All of that unity in this country supports this act.\n  I wonder, is there anything else Senator Lee would like to say about \nthis bipartisan, widely supported by both the data and the advocates \nacross the quantum spectrum--is there anything else the Senator would \nlike to add?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes, and I would like to conclude my remarks in a moment by \nwrapping up. Before I do that, though, I notice on the floor with us is \nmy friend Senator Whitehouse, who happens to be another supporter and \ncosponsor of this bill and who is also the ranking member on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and I would ask Senator Whitehouse to say a few \nwords about this bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Senator Lee. I am glad to be a part of \nthis conversation. I share the concern that we all have for a Federal \nprison system that is 30 percent over capacity and costs $6 billion a \nyear already. We have to add, if we are going to take care of the 30 \npercent over capacity--that is $6 billion under the present \ncircumstances, and that $6 billion comes out of law enforcement budgets \nand community support budgets that could be making our streets safer.\n  At the beginning of every sentence, a judge imposes the duration of \nthe sentence, and at the end of every sentence, a prisoner makes a \ndecision about how he or she is going to engage with the public upon \ntheir release. There is a bill that deals with the latter part, helping \nprisoners make better decisions and be better prepared to reengage with \nthe public once they are released. I hope very much the bill Senator \nCornyn and I are leading in the Senate Judiciary Committee can, as this \nmoves forward, be connected because the two are linked thematically, \nand it makes a big difference.\n  The reason we care about how people at the end get back into regular \nsociety is because if they reoffend they go back to prison again and \nadd to the prison population and add to the costs. If they are in \nlonger than they should be, then we are not getting any public safety \nbenefit out of all of this.\n  So I look very forward to working with all my colleagues to try to \nsee if we can get together in the Senate a comprehensive piece of \nsentencing reform legislation. Having been a prosecutor myself, having \nused mandatory minimums, I appreciate that they can, in certain \ncircumstances, have value, but I think if one looks at the big picture, \nthis sentencing reform legislation is important and will serve the \npublic interest in a great variety of respects, including safer \ncommunities. So that is why I am cosponsoring it and that is why I am \nan ardent supporter of it.\n  In closing, let me thank Senator Durbin and Senator Lee for their \nleadership as the lead coauthors of this legislation and Senator Flake \nand Senator Booker for their efforts on behalf of this as fellow \ncosponsors.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by thanking my colleagues for \ntheir help. First of all, thanks to Senator Durbin for working with \nthis Senator over the last couple of years in developing this \nlegislation. I thank my other cosponsors as well. I thank Senator \nBooker, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Flake, who have joined us \ntoday.\n  This is truly a bipartisan, bicameral effort that brings support from \nacross the political spectrum. Excessive mandatory minimums do not make \nus safer. The last 30 years have shown us that they are applied \nunevenly and they leave a gaping hole in the communities they impact \nmost heavily. Now we as a society have to pick up the tab. We must \ndecide if we will continue to pay the high fiscal and social costs that \nmandatory minimums impose. It is important for us to remember these \ncosts do have many manifestations.\n  Sometimes in this body we focus only on the fiscal pricetag that can \nbe expressed in raw numbers, but doing that allows us to ignore too \noften the high human costs--the families and the communities that have \nlost brothers, sons, fathers, uncles, and nephews, people who could be \nback in their communities contributing meaningfully to their success, \nwho are instead sent away for sometimes far too long of a prison \nsentence. We can continue down this current path or if we could try \nsomething smarter, that perhaps would be better.\n  The Smarter Sentencing Act gives us an opportunity to do precisely \nthat--to do something smarter, to rely less on prison, and to do more \nwith scarce resources. Instead of just paying for prisons, it would \nallow us to work smarter in pursuit of justice.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join us in supporting the Smarter \nSentencing Act.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1580-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1580-S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, to change the subject from sentencing \nreform to climate change, I come to the floor today for the 93rd \nconsecutive week that the Senate has been in session to urge that my \ncolleagues wake up to the urgent threat of what results from our levels \nof carbon pollution. It is an opportune time now to consider a step-up \nin American corporate responsibility on climate change. Call it \ncorporate climate responsibility 2.0.\n  Americans can celebrate and applaud the fact that America's corporate \nleaders have taken so many important steps on climate change. Companies \nsuch as Walmart and Coca-Cola, to pick just two, see the problem \nclearly and have done great things. Walmart, for instance, has taken \nexemplary responsibility for its carbon footprint not only within its \nfacilities but out beyond its corporate walls into its international \nsupply chain. Walmart has led the move for consumers away from \nincandescent bulbs and into high-efficiency lighting. If you have ever \nused that machine where you have to crank electricity in order to light \nup an incandescent bulb and then do the same thing for a high \nefficiency bulb, you have an unforgettable experience of how much more \nefficient those modern bulbs are. Walmart has strong and responsible \ncarbon policies and Walmart has made a successful business model of \nsaving money by reducing carbon emissions. Walmart even has an internal \nprice on carbon so it can properly evaluate its internal processes in \nits own facilities against its climate standards.\n  This is not new for Walmart. A decade ago, Walmart's then-CEO Lee \nScott said:\n\n       The science is in, and it is overwhelming. We believe every \n     company has a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gases as \n     quickly as it can.\n\n  Coca-Cola, the other company I mentioned, has exemplary carbon \npolicies too. Coca-Cola knows how disruptive climate change can be on \nthe water supply that is Coca-Cola's most basic need in its bottling \nfacilities. They, too, have found the sweet spot of saving money by \nreducing their carbon output.\n  As the Arctic melts, Coca-Cola even put a polar bear on its iconic \nCoke can. Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola's CEO, has said:\n\n       It is absolutely imperative that our commitment to a low-\n     carbon future be fully understood. We're here to lend a Coca-\n     Cola voice to the public and political debate on getting to a \n     fair framework, an inclusive framework, and an effective \n     framework so that we can achieve climate protection.\n\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n\n  Many other major corporations have too. There is Google and Apple, \napparel giant VF Corporation and Nike, Mars, Nestle, and Cargill, \nGeneral Motors and the Ford Motor Company, UPS and Federal Express, \nUnilever and Starbucks. All are in different ways clear-eyed and \nresponsible climate champions.\n  So there is a lot to celebrate from America's corporate leaders, but \nthere is also more to be done. We are right now at a societal and \npolitical tipping point on climate change, where corporations that are \nalready good on climate change--corporations that are sensible and \nresponsible on climate change--can make a big difference by taking it \nup one more step and putting their politics where their policies \nalready are.\n  So what is putting your politics where your policies are? First, it \nis making climate change an issue, something we talk about when we come \nto Congress. I don't know whether Walmart has ever spoken to Senator \nBoozman or Senator Cotton, from their home State of Arkansas, about \nclimate change. I know they never spoke to Senator Pryor when he was in \nthe Senate because he told me so. I don't know whether Coca-Cola has \never spoken about climate change to Senators Isakson or Perdue from \nCoca-Cola's home State of Georgia.\n  It is not just them. I pick out Walmart and Coca-Cola because they \nare two of the best companies on carbon reduction. I actually don't \nknow of one major American corporation that makes climate change a \npriority when it comes here to Washington and lobbies Congress, not \none.\n  America's corporate leaders have great carbon reduction policies, but \nwhen they come to Congress, that is not on the agenda of their \npolitics. If it were, it would make a difference. I know it is not \neasy. Senior corporate leaders in major American companies have told me \nand others that they fear retribution if they lobby Congress on climate \nchange; that they will be punished on tax or trade or liability or \nregulatory or other issues they have in Congress.\n  That is how ugly and rough the fossil fuel lobby plays around here. \nBut there is an answer: group up. The fossil fuel industry and its \nallies in Congress cannot punish everyone. They cannot punish Coke and \nPepsi and Walmart and Target and VF Corporation and Nike and Apple and \nGoogle and Ford and GM and Mars and Nestle and Unilever. They cannot \npunish them all.\n  So, please, I ask our corporate leaders: Make an agreement with one \nanother that you will not abandon your climate principles when you come \nto Congress. If good corporations will not speak up, the only corporate \nforce lobbying and politicking Congress on climate change is the fossil \nfuel industry. You will get exactly what you have now: a Congress in \nwhich Members fear to take action on climate because they know one \nside, the fossil fuel boys, will punish them. They do not know any \nother side that will help them.\n  So the first part of corporate climate responsibility 2.0 is: Do not \nabandon hope all ye who enter here. Do not check your principles at the \ndoor. A second part of corporate climate responsibility 2.0 would be to \nstand by your principles with those who advocate for you. The best \ncorporate citizens push their good climate policies out beyond their \ncorporate walls into their supply chains. They insist that their \nsuppliers comply with those climate principles. They will not do \nbusiness with suppliers that do not abide by their climate principles.\n  So it would be consistent to push their good climate policies out \ninto their advocacy organizations, too, and insist that their advocates \ncomply with those same climate principles, just like their suppliers \nmust.\n  They ought not to do business with advocacy groups that will not \nabide by their climate principles. What am I talking about? I have \ndescribed how good Coca-Cola has been on climate issues. It is terrific \non climate issues. Coca-Cola and its bottlers are also important vital \nmembers of the American Beverage Association, which sits on the board \nof the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is one of the worst climate \ndenial organizations and which is a persistent obstacle to any \nresponsible action on carbon emissions.\n  Similarly, Verizon, 3M, and Ford, all with good climate policies, all \nsit on the board of this organization with opposite policies. If they \nwould not put up with it from their suppliers, if their suppliers \nflouted their principles, why put up with it from a corporate \nmouthpiece they support but that flouts their principles?\n  If corporate climate change policies are important enough to push \nbeyond the corporate walls and into the supply chain, they should be \nimportant enough to push beyond the corporate walls and into the \ncorporation's advocacy organizations. It does not make sense for \ncorporations to speak out of one side of their mouths on climate change \nand then contradict themselves, through their corporate mouthpieces, \ntheir advocacy organizations.\n  Some do not. Nike resigned from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce board of \ndirectors over the chamber's horrible climate policies. Apple left the \nchamber altogether. So have big electric utilities such as Exelon and \nPG and so have many local chambers of commerce. Google left the \nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC. When Google left \nALEC last year because of that group's bad climate position, Google CEO \nEric Schmidt said of the group: ``They are literally lying'' about \nclimate change. You do not need to support an organization that is \n``literally lying'' about climate change--not under corporate climate \nresponsibility 2.0. It is not necessary to have your own trade \nassociation or legislative organization arguing against you.\n  The same should be true of opinion outlets. For decades, the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page has been an important and respected voice \nof the business community. But now on climate change, the Wall Street \nJournal editorial page never reflects the views on climate change of \nmost of America's corporate leaders, only its fossil fuel corporate \nleaders.\n  That page has become exclusively the voice of the fossil fuel \nindustry, and of their climate denial front organizations. In fact, in \nsome ways we could say the Wall Street Journal editorial page has \nactually become a climate denial front organization. The fossil fuel \ncompanies have co-opted the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Where \nis the objection from American corporations, big well-known American \ncorporations that have spent millions and millions of dollars \naddressing their carbon emissions, that have spent enormous corporate \neffort, all the way up to the CEO level, dedicated to a carbon solution \nand that have developed great policies on climate change? Why be silent \nwhen the voice of the business community is saying the exact opposite \nof what you have worked so hard for and care so much about?\n  Under corporate climate responsibility 2.0, companies such as that \ncould stand up for their own well-established climate principles and \nagainst the opposition to their own corporate principles from the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page. I feel we are so close to getting \nsomething done, something big done on climate change. Our corporate \nsector has shown so much leadership. The great American corporate \nleadership on climate change aligns exactly with what America's science \nleadership is also saying.\n  The great American corporate leadership on climate change aligns \nexactly with what America's military and national security leaders are \nalso saying. The great American corporate leadership on climate change \naligns exactly with what so many of our religious leaders are saying \nall the way up to Pope Francis. Of course, American corporate \nleadership on climate change aligns with what Americans, the customers \nof these corporations, want and expect.\n  So let's take it up a step. Let's ask our corporate leaders to step \nit up to corporate climate responsibility 2.0 and take their existing \ngood policies and line them up with their politics, take what they \ndemand of their suppliers and demand the same of their advocates. That \nwould be a big way for America's corporate leaders to help this body \nwake up.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\n  Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the life of Sam \nSmith from Las Vegas, NV. Mr. Smith passed away last month.\n  Mr. Smith was a retired firefighter and the founder of the bookstore \nand treasured community establishment, Native Son. Native Son operated \nin West Last Vegas for 17 years, and throughout that time Mr. Smith was \nits heart and soul. Mr. Smith offered free math and reading classes and \nhelped many students prepare for fire department entrance exams. He had \na saying, ``People who study calculus don't go to jail.'' Mr. Smith \ncared about the people in his community, and he worked to improve their \nlives.\n  Mr. Smith helped people like Trina Jiles become the first Black woman \nin the Clark County Fire Department. When she came into Native Son in \n1995 he told her there were no Black women firefighters and asked how \nmany pushups she could do. When she did 20, he told her she would be \nall right and began teaching her in his free math and reading classes. \nSoon after, she passed all of her tests and became Clark County's first \nBlack female firefighter. She went on to work her way up the department \nto become an arson investigator.\n  Through his years of service, Sam Smith was a fixture in the West Las \nVegas community. I appreciate all he has done, and I celebrate his \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1582-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONSERVING LA MOSQUITIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to briefly draw the Senate's \nattention to a recent announcement made by Honduran President Juan \nOrlando Hernaandez concerning his government's efforts to secure and \npreserve a newly discovered archaeological site in the eastern part of \nhis country. The area is part of La Mosquitia, a large swath of \ntropical rain forest along the Mosquito Coast in eastern Honduras, \nwhich also extends into northeastern Nicaragua.\n  Reaching the remote forest is accomplished primarily by air or water, \nand it was airborne sensing technology in 2012 that first uncovered the \nancient site, now revealed to be as much as 1,000 years old. The site \nis believed by some to be the location of the mythic White City, a safe \nhaven where indigenous populations took refuge from Spanish \nconquistadores. However, archeologists Christopher Fisher of Colorado \nState University and Oscar Neil Cruz of the Honduran Institute of \nAnthropology and History and ethno-botanist Mark Plotkin of the Amazon \nConservation Team who reached the site earlier this month believe the \ndiscovery could be even more significant as just one of many sites that \nmay reveal an entire lost civilization.\n  La Mosquitia is also the home of the Riio Plaatano Biosphere Reserve, \na World Heritage Site that has twice been placed on UNESCO's world \nheritage in danger list, most recently in 2011. The designation was the \nresult of an investigation that revealed rampant deforestation, \nprimarily by cattle herders seeking to meet the demand for beef in the \nUnited States, in addition to illegal hunting and fishing. Perhaps one \nof the most significant aspects of the Riio Plaatano Biosphere \nReserve's designation is that it is representative of the threats to \nall of La Mosquitia.\n  That is why President Hernaandez's announcement is so important. La \nMosquitia is not just a treasure of the Honduran people; it has \npreserved centuries of cultural artifacts and is now home to a \nmultitude of plant and animal life that has remained largely \nundisturbed by the outside world.\n  President Hernaandez's commitment to preserve these archeological \nsites from looters and other criminal activity and to protect the \nbroader forest area by replanting the jungle and countering \ndeforestation deserves our support. I look forward to working with the \nGovernment of Honduras on how the United States may be able to assist \nits conservation efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1582-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1582-S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n\n       We're here today to review the president's fiscal year 2016 \n     budget request for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \n     independent federal agency responsible for regulating the \n     safety of our nation's commercial nuclear power plants and \n     other nuclear materials.\n       This is the first time in many years that the subcommittee \n     has held a hearing to examine the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission's budget.\n       It is also the first of several hearings that the \n     subcommittee will hold this year on nuclear power. These \n     hearings are important because nuclear power provides about \n     20 percent of our nation's electricity and more than 60 \n     percent of our carbon-free electricity.\n       I plan to focus my questions today on four main areas:\n       1. Licensing nuclear waste repositories;\n       2. Avoiding excessive regulations;\n       3. Licensing for new and existing reactors; and\n       4. Making sure the agency is running effectively\n       First, we must solve the 25-year-old stalemate about what \n     to do with used fuel from our nuclear reactors to ensure that \n     nuclear power has a strong future in this country.\n       Later this year, I will reintroduce bipartisan legislation \n     with Senators Feinstein, Murkowski and perhaps others, to \n     create both temporary and permanent storage sites for nuclear \n     waste. Also, Senator Feinstein and I plan to include a pilot \n     program for nuclear waste storage in the Energy and Water \n     appropriations bill, as we have for the past three years.\n       The new sites we'd seek to establish through the \n     legislation Senator Feinstein and I are reintroducing this \n     year would not take the place of Yucca Mountain--we have more \n     than enough waste to fill Yucca Mountain to its legal \n     capacity--but rather would complement it.\n       This legislation is consistent with the president's Blue \n     Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future.\n       But let me be clear: Yucca Mountain can and should be part \n     of the solution. Federal law designates Yucca Mountain as the \n     nation's repository for used nuclear fuel.\n       The Nuclear Waste Fund, which is money that utilities have \n     paid the government to dispose of their used nuclear fuel, \n     has a balance of about $36 billion and there are still \n     several steps to go in the licensing process for Yucca \n     Mountain.\n       The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a balance of unspent \n     funding that you are supposed to use to continue the \n     licensing process. But more resources will be required, so I \n     think it's fair to ask the question:\n       Knowing that there are additional steps and they will cost \n     money, why would you not request additional funds in your \n     budget?\n       The Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently completed the \n     Safety Evaluation Report that said Yucca Mountain met all of \n     the safety requirements through ``the period of geologic \n     stability.''\n       The commission and the Environmental Protection Agency \n     define the ``period of geologic stability'' as one million \n     years. To continue to oppose Yucca Mountain because of \n     radiation concerns is to ignore science--as well as the law.\n       The next steps on Yucca Mountain include completing a \n     supplemental environmental impact statement and restarting \n     the hearings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, \n     which were suspended in September 2011.\n       Money is available for these activities, and I want to hear \n     why there is no request to use it.\n       Federal law requires that nuclear power plants be built \n     safely, but the law doesn't say it should be so hard and \n     expensive to build and operate reactors that you can't do it.\n       A 2013 report by the Center for Strategic and International \n     Studies found that up to 25 of our 99 nuclear reactors could \n     close by 2020.\n       The decision to close a reactor could be due to a number of \n     factors, including the low price of natural gas, and the \n     wasteful wind production tax credit, which is so generous \n     that in some markets wind producers can literally give their \n     electricity away and still make a profit.\n       But the decision to close a reactor can also have to do \n     with excessive and unnecessary regulations. I want to work \n     with the commission to address this.\n       Over the next several decades, most of our 99 nuclear \n     reactors will go through the commission's license renewal \n     process to extend their licenses, which is critical to the \n     future of nuclear power. I want to make sure that the \n     commission is prepared for this additional work.\n       I also want to make sure the commission has devoted the \n     appropriate resources to the licensing process to keep new \n     reactors--like Watts Bar 2 in Tennessee--on time and on \n     budget.\n       I have proposed that we build 100 new reactors, which may \n     seem excessive, but not if\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\n     about 20 percent of our current capacity from coal goes \n     offline by 2020 as projected by the Energy Information \n     Administration. If this capacity were replaced entirely by \n     nuclear power it would require building another 48 new, \n     1,250-megawatt reactors--which, by the way, would reduce our \n     carbon emissions from electricity by another 14 percent. Add \n     the reactors we may need to replace in the coming decades due \n     to aging and other factors, and my proposal for 100 may not \n     seem so high.\n       Additionally, the commission needs to move forward with new \n     small modular reactors.\n       This subcommittee has provided funding to help small \n     modular reactors get through the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission's licensing process. I'd like to get your views on \n     what you need to continue your efforts.\n       One of the challenges for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     is to ensure that the agency is running effectively and \n     focusing staff on the right goals.\n       In fiscal year 2000, Congress appropriated about $470 \n     million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The budget \n     request this year is more than $1 billion.\n       Much of the increase was due to the significant number of \n     new reactor licenses that were anticipated--however most were \n     never actually submitted. So, it is fair to ask whether this \n     additional funding is being used for unnecessary regulation.\n       The best way to understand the importance of nuclear power \n     is to look at the stories of three countries: Japan, Germany \n     and the United Arab Emirates.\n       Japan and Germany have recently experienced what happens \n     when a major manufacturing country loses its nuclear \n     capacity. In Japan, the cost of generating electricity has \n     increased 56 percent and Germany has among the highest \n     household electricity rates in the European Union--both \n     because they moved away from nuclear power.\n       The United Arab Emirates has shown what a country can do \n     when a country decides to take advantage of nuclear power. By \n     2020, the Emirates will have completed four reactors that \n     will provide nearly 25 percent of its annual electricity.\n       It will take building more nuclear reactors to avoid the \n     path of Japan and Germany, and today's hearing is an \n     important step to making sure the United States does what it \n     must to unleash nuclear power.\n       I look forward to working with the commission and our \n     Ranking Member, Senator Feinstein, who I will now recognize \n     for an opening statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1583-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1583-S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CUBA'S CULTURE OF POVERTY CONUNDRUM\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I submit for inclusion in the \nCongressional Record the following article regarding the early years of \nthe Castro regime, the policies of which created a culture of poverty \nin Cuba, and converted a previously developing country into an \nunderdeveloped, closed society.\n  The author, Professor Roland Alum, is a Garden State constituent, a \nlong-time participant in civic activities, and has been a personal \nfriend for three decades. He is a respected anthropologist and author \nwhose writings have appeared in both major newspapers and academic \njournals.\n  This article, which appeared in Panoramas, an electronic journal at \nthe University of Pittsburgh, touches upon sensitive topics apropos to \nthe current U.S.-Cuba relationship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Panoramas, Feb. 14, 2015]\n\n                 The Cuban Culture of Poverty Conundrum\n\n                        (By Roland Armando Alum)\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       I propose here to re-examine certain aspects of life in \n     ``Socialist Cuba,'' principally the so-called culture of \n     poverty, as gauged relatively early in the Castro brothers \n     regime by two U.S. socio-cultural anthropologists, the \n     legendary Oscar Lewis and his proteegeee/associate Douglas \n     Butterworth, whose research project 4.5 decades ago was \n     surrounded by controversy and enigmas.\n       Unquestionably, the Fidel and Rauul Castro ``Revolutionary \n     Government'' enjoyed an extraordinary initial popularity in \n     1959. Yet, the enthusiasm vanished as the duo hijacked the \n     liberal-inspired anti-Batista rebellion that had been largely \n     advanced by the then expanding middle-classes. Instead of \n     delivering the promised ``pan con libertad'' (bread with \n     liberty), the Castro siblings converted Cuba into a socio-\n     spiritually and fiscally bankrupt, Marxist-Stalinist dystopia \n     in which both, bread and liberty are scarce (Botiin, 2010; \n     Horowitz, 2008; Moore, 2008).\n       Cuba was the last Ibero-American colony to attain \n     independence (1902); yet, by the 1950s, the island-nation was \n     a leader in the Americas in numerous quality-of-life \n     indicators. This record was reached notwithstanding \n     instability and governmental corruption during the republican \n     era (1902-58), including the 1952-58 bloody authoritarian \n     dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. However, under the (now \n     anachronistic octogenarian) Castros, Cuba became an \n     impoverished, Orwellian closed society beleaguered by \n     unproductivity, rampant corruption, humiliating rationing, \n     human rights abuses, and--understandably--unprecedented mass \n     emigration (Diiaz-Briquets & Peerez-Loopez, 2006; Horowitz, \n     2008).\n\n\n                  CUBA'S CULTURE OF POVERTY CONUNDRUM\n\n       The Lewis and Butterworth project in 1969-70 is still, \n     oddly, among the little known accounts of the early effects \n     of the Castro family's regimentation. Supported by a Ford \n     Foundation's nearly $300,000 grant, the professors intended \n     to test Lewis's theory of the ``culture of poverty'' (or \n     rather, sub-culture of poverty). They had innocently \n     hypothesized that a culture of poverty (hereafter CoP) would \n     not exist in a Marxist-oriented society, as they presupposed \n     that the socially alienating conditions that engender it \n     could develop among the poor solely in capitalist economies. \n     Influenced by Marxism, Lewis in particular had cleverly \n     problematized the commonalities of the poor's elusive \n     quandary in well-known prior studies across different \n     societies, notably among Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.\n       While poverty is defined in relative terms, the CoP was \n     conceptualized as an amorphous corpus of socially transmitted \n     self-defeating beliefs and interrelated values, such as: \n     abandonment, alcoholism, authoritarianism, deficient work \n     ethic, domestic abuse, fatalism, homophobia/machismo, \n     hopelessness, illegitimacy, instant, gratification/present-\n     time orientation, low social-civic consciousness, mother-\n     centered families, sexism/misogyny, suspicion of authorities \n     while holding expectations on government dependency, and so \n     forth.\n       This ``psychology of the . . . oppressed . . . poor'' is \n     considered a key obstacle to achieving vertical socio-\n     economic mobility even in fluid social-class, more open \n     societies, such as the U.S. Not all poor individuals develop \n     a CoP, but being poor is a sine qua non condition.\n       Ever since its early stages as a separate discipline in the \n     mid-1800s, anthropology's cornerstone has been the concept of \n     ``culture.'' A century later, the notion drifted to everyday \n     language; to wit, statements such as ``a culture of \n     corruption'' became common in the media in reference to \n     mindsets in government and corporations. I prefer the \n     interpretation of culture by my own Pitt co-mentor, ``Jack'' \n     Roberts (1964): ``a system for storing and retrieving \n     information,'' which fits with the Lewis-Butterworth \n     approach.\n       With initial high-level governmental welcome, one of the \n     Lewis-Butterworth investigations entailed comprehensive \n     interviews of former Havana slum-dwellers resettled in new \n     buildings. In the research project's fourth book, The People \n     of Buena Ventura, Butterworth (1980) admitted with \n     disenchantment that his research project found sufficient \n     social symptoms that met the CoP criteria, thus disproving \n     the initial hypothesis expecting an absence of the CoP under \n     socialism.\n\n\n                       THE PROJECT'S SIGNIFICANCE\n\n       The Lewis-Butterworth ethnographic (descriptive, \n     qualitative) work has various additional implications. It \n     shed light for an evaluation of the Guevarist ``New Socialist \n     Man'' archetype. Similarly, it informed an understanding of \n     the dynamics that led to the spectacular 1980 Mariel boat \n     exodus, when over 120,000 Cubans (some 1.2% of Cuba's \n     population) ``voted with their feet.'' Ironically, the regime \n     and its insensitive fans abroad still refer to the raggedy \n     refugees with disdainful discourse as ``escoria'' (scum) and \n     with the Marxist slur ``lumpen proletariat.'' Significantly, \n     most Marielistas were born and/or enculturated under \n     socialism, i.e., they personified the presumed ``New Man.'' \n     Many of them, moreover, had been military conscripts, and/or \n     had served time in the infamous gulag-type ``U.M.A.P.'' \n     forced-labor camps created for political dissidents \n     (particularly intellectuals and artists), Beatles' \n     fans, gays, the unemployed, long-haired bohemians/hippies, \n     Trotskyites, would-be emigrants (considered ``traitors''), \n     and religious people (including Jehovah's Witnesses and \n     Afro-Cuban folk-cults' practitioners), etc. (Nuunnez-\n     Cedenno, et al., 1985). In fact, the Marielistas \n     encompassed also an over-representation of Afro-Cubans, \n     the demographic sector traditionally viewed as most \n     vulnerable, and thus, among the expected prime \n     beneficiaries of socialist redistribution.\n       Certainly, there were always poor Cubans--of all \n     phenotypes--and conceivably, some version of the CoP existed \n     pre-1959; but in my exchanges with Butterworth, he \n     reconfirmed another remarkable finding. While acknowledging \n     the social shortcomings of pre-revolutionary times, he could \n     not document (for ex., through the collection of oral life-\n     histories), a case for a pervasive, pre-revolutionary \n     Lewisian CoP.\n       This in situ scrutiny of daily life fairly early in the \n     Castros era corroborates previous and subsequent accounts by \n     many Cubanologists and the much vilified and ever-expanding \n     exile community. There exists a widespread CoP in Socialist \n     Cuba, though not necessarily as a survivor of the ancien \n     reegime, but--as Butterworth deduced--a consequence of the \n     nouveau reegime. The authorities must have suspected, or \n     ascertained through surveillance, about the prospective \n     conclusions, given that the anthropologists were suddenly \n     expelled from the country. They were accused of being U.S. \n     spies, most of their research material was confiscated, and \n     some ``informants'' (interviewees) were arrested and/or \n     harassed.\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n     Additionally, their Cuban statistician, AAlvaro IInsua, was \n     imprisoned.\n       Comfortably from abroad, academic and media enthusiasts of \n     the Castros' ``dynasty'' customarily replicate party-line \n     clichees in their penchant to ``launder'' the dictatorship's \n     excesses and the centralized economy's dysfunctions by \n     blaming external factors. Topping the excuses is the ending \n     of the defunct COMECON's subsidies circa 1990. Some \n     apologists--notably a few anthropology colleagues--even \n     absurdly refer to the 1959-90 epoch as a ``utopia,'' while \n     the government labeled the current calamitous post-1990 years \n     the ``Special Period.''\n       Yet, the undertaking by Lewis & Butterworth, who were \n     initially eagerly simpatico to the Castros, provided \n     remarkable revelations that regime's defenders conveniently \n     still continue to overlook. It showed that life for average \n     Cubans toward the end of the regime's first decade--long \n     before the Special Period--was already beset with corruption, \n     consumer scarcities, and time-wasting food-lines. All this is \n     characteristic of what is branded ``economies of shortage,'' \n     standard for Soviet-modeled societies (Eberstadt, 1988; \n     Ghodsee, 2011; Halperin, 1981; Verdery 1996).\n       Likewise, Butterworth portrayed how ordinary Cubans--``los \n     de a pie'' (those on foot)--were by then engaging in what \n     nowadays we call ``everyday forms of resistance,'' a social \n     weapon of subjugated people anywhere. As also depicted by \n     other observers and Cuban former participant-resisters (now \n     exiled, my own informants or ``cultural consultants''), \n     Butterworth reported how Cubans were already undermining the \n     hegemonic police-state through taboo actions, such as \n     absenteeism, black-marketeering, briberies, pilfering, and \n     even vandalism. Apparently, this project remains the only \n     conventional testing of the CoP in a totalitarian socialist \n     country, although numerous researchers have chronicled the \n     pitiable quality of life under such socio-political systems \n     (Eberstadt, 1988; Halperin, 1981).\n       Indeed, the Cuban reality of widespread misery--except for \n     the privileged top one-percent (now an elitist \n     gerontocracy)--as well as of indignities and hushed quotidian \n     defiance, evokes narratives about similar, though faraway \n     communist ``experiments'' that collapsed a quarter-century \n     ago. Among these comparable accounts are ethnologist \n     Verdery's (1996) descriptions of despot Ceaussescu's Romania \n     and Ghodsee's (2011) Bulgarian ethnographic vignettes.\n\n\n                                EPILOGUE\n\n       A number of experts have been reporting about certain kinds \n     of behavioral traits among Cubans, both islanders and recent \n     eemigrees, which may reflect CoP patterns (Botiin, 2010; \n     Horowitz, 2008). This is not surprising, as the CoP worsened \n     with time as impoverishment augmented (Hirschfeld, 2008).\n       One can surmise that, despite its human and material toll, \n     the Castros regime not only failed to solve traditional \n     social problems, but exacerbated at least some of them, and \n     moreover created new ones (Diiaz-Briquets & Peerez-Loopez, \n     2006; Eberstadt, 1988). Much of this was already manifested \n     in the 1960s (Edwards, 1973; Halperin, 1981), as reflected in \n     the Lewis-Butterworth venture.\n       Lewis died, heart-broken, at age 56 in December 1970 upon \n     his repatriation. Butterworth also took ill--especially \n     emotionally--dying in 1986 (at 56 too). The IInsuas were \n     abandoned in Cuba to their own lot. AAlvaro languished in \n     jail for six years; in 1980 he was ``allowed'' to leave for \n     Costa Rica with wife Greta (who had also worked for the \n     project), and son Manolo. They reached the U.S. soon \n     thereafter, coinciding with the arrival of the Mariel \n     expatriates and Butterworth's book publication. After a brief \n     staying in northern New Jersey, where I assisted them, they \n     settled in Miami.\n       In assessing the legacy of the Lewis-Butterworth project on \n     Cuba's culture of poverty, there remain several intriguing \n     puzzles pending exploration. Hopefully, someday AAlvaro and \n     Greta will write their own elucidating memoirs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1584-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL BREWER\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Bill Brewer \non his retirement after serving the great State of Nevada for over 30 \nyears. It gives me great pleasure to recognize his years of hard work \nand dedication to enhancing the lives of many across rural Nevada.\n  Mr. Brewer stands as a shining example of someone who has devoted his \nlife to serving his State and his local community. After earning his \ndegree from Oklahoma State University, Mr. Brewer started working in \nthe housing industry for the Farmers Home Administration, FmHA. In \n1994, he became the first housing program director for the new Nevada \nState office of FmHA. This was later named the State office of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, Rural Development. During his tenure \nas program director for the USDA, Mr. Brewer invested more than $1 \nbillion in rural Nevada, assisting hundreds of families and seniors in \nhome ownership and affordable rental housing. Mr. Brewer spent recent \nyears continuing his work in public service as leader of the senior \nmanagement team of Nevada Rural Housing Authority, working to make \ngoals of the organization a reality. His positive legacy in the rural \nNevada housing industry will be felt for years to come.\n  His unwavering commitment to the State is noble and has not gone \nwithout notice. Mr. Brewer was appointed to the Nevada Housing Division \nAdvisory Committee and the Community Development Block Grant Advisory \nCommittee as a result of his accomplishments. His hard work earned him \nthe County Supervisor of the Year for Nevada and the State Director's \nGoing the Extra Mile Award in 2011. His accolades are well deserved.\n  It is not only Mr. Brewer's commitment to his local community in the \nhousing sector that places him amongst the most notable in his \ncommunity but also his devotion to charitable service. Mr. Brewer has \nserved on the board of directors for the Nevada Area Council of the Boy \nScouts of America for 10 years and is a longtime member of the \norganization. In 2004, he received the Boy Scouts Silver Beaver Award \nin recognition of his service and was awarded the President's Volunteer \nService Award in 2009.\n  I am grateful for his dedication to the people of Nevada. He \nexemplifies the highest standards of leadership and community service \nand should be proud of his long and meaningful career. Today, I ask \nthat all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Brewer on his \nretirement, and I give my deepest appreciation for all that he has done \nto make Nevada a better place. I offer him my best wishes for many \nsuccessful and fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1584-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1584-S1585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

S1587-S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 758. A bill to establish an Interagency Trade Enforcement Center \nin the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss the \nimportance of international trade and the enforcement of international \ntrade agreements.\n  We talk a lot about international trade in this Chamber and frame it \nin terms of opening new markets with new trade agreements. But as the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer understands, while it is important to \nensure future agreements are fair for businesses and workers, we should \nalso be devoting more time to the 290 trade agreements we already have \nand ask ourselves; are we doing all we can to ensure we are enforcing \nthese trade agreements on behalf of American businesses and workers who \nare affected by trade agreements, on behalf of communities that are \naffected by trade agreements?\n  I do not think we are, despite strong efforts by the Obama \nadministration. I say that because this particular report--which I have \nin my hand, which is very heavy--is a report from the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative that has 384 pages detailing all of the trade barriers \nwe face around the globe. Those are 384 reasons why we need to do more \nto fight for our manufacturers, our farmers, our innovators, our \nworkers--everyone employed in all of the industries that are affected \nby trade barriers.\n  So today, Senator Graham and I are introducing the Trade Enforcement \nAct, which would make permanent the Interagency Trade Enforcement \nCenter at the USTR.\n  The Center was created in 2012 by Executive order. I appreciate that \nvery much. Senator Graham and I have been working for a number of years \nto get a trade enforcement office, and I appreciate that President \nObama put in place by Executive order this new Center with \nresponsibilities to coordinate the enforcement powers of multiple \nFederal agencies.\n  It has already demonstrated its value in helping our Nation win major \ntrade enforcement cases. We just need to make it permanent.\n  Around the same time as the Center's creation, China began imposing \nillegal duties on American cars and SUVs in defiance of World Trade \nOrganization rules. These duties threatened the jobs of America's \n850,000 automobile workers and had a direct impact on more than $5 \nbillion of U.S. auto exports.\n  With the help of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, the U.S. \nTrade Representative challenged this practice by China at the WTO. The \nWTO agreed with the United States that China's duties breached numerous \ninternational trade rules, and last June the duties were terminated. \nThey ended.\n  Another case, Argentina was restricting imports of U.S. goods--\nblocking energy products, electronics and machinery, pharmaceuticals, \nmedical devices, cars and parts--billions of dollars in potential \nsales. The Center helped to challenge that practice by Argentina, and, \nagain, the WTO ruled in favor of the United States.\n  The Center helped to challenge China's practice of imposing duties on \nexports of rare Earth materials--so important, again, to our basic \ntechnology and manufacturing. In fact, in that case, the United States \nwon. The Center helped to challenge India's ban on U.S. agricultural \nproducts, and we won again.\n  So what we are learning is that when the U.S. Trade Representative \nworks with the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center--with an entity \nthat is laser-focused on enforcing trade laws--to challenge unfair \ntrade practices around the world, the United States wins.\n  We can continue winning if only we devote more time and more \nattention to enforcing the rules in our existing trade agreements. \nAgain, we have a lot of work that needs to be done with all the trade \nbarriers stopping us from having the opportunities to the markets that \nwould allow us to export our goods.\n  For example, the USTR's report on nontariff trade barriers highlights \nhow China provides export subsidies to its auto parts manufacturers so \nthey can sell their parts to other countries at below market value and \nstill turn a profit. This makes it impossible for our parts \nmanufacturers--many of them small businesses--to compete in those \nmarkets.\n  In a letter I wrote to the President--which I was pleased to have 188 \nMembers of Congress sign--I asked the administration to take action. I \nwas very pleased when the USTR announced later that year that the \nUnited States was formally challenging China's illegal practices on \nautos and auto parts. Without the investigation and the technical work \ndone by the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, that challenge would \nnot have been possible.\n  We have a free-trade agreement with Korea. Yet that nation continues \nto erect new trade barriers that make it more difficult for U.S. \nautomakers to do business there. Even today, despite best efforts to \nopen things up, Korea is one of the most closed auto markets in the \nworld.\n  Our legislation is based on the fact that our enforcement needs to go \nfurther and faster, and we need to support it. We need to give the USTR \nthe resources it needs to take swift, decisive action to crack down on \nunfair trade practices. I very much appreciate the work that is being \ndone by that Center, and they are showing what happens when we are \nfocused, when we as a country are focused on those things that our \nbusinesses and workers need in terms of eliminating unfair trade \npractices.\n  But I think it is very important that this Interagency Trade \nEnforcement Center become permanent, and that is what the bill that \nSenator Graham and I are introducing would do.\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\n  Our bill would also establish a Chief Trade Enforcement Officer to \nlead the Center so we have one person being held accountable on \nenforcement who would be accountable to the Senate and to the American \npeople.\n  We also do something that I think is very important that will help \nmanufacturing. Right now we have at the USTR a Chief Agricultural \nNegotiator. I support that. They are somebody helping to lead our \nefforts in agricultural policy. But we know to have a strong economy, \nit is about making things and growing things, and the making things \npart of it does not have a chief negotiator. That is why we in our bill \ncreate a Chief Manufacturing Negotiator to focus squarely on the \ninterests of manufacturers in our country. That will clearly send a \nmessage that when we talk about growing the middle class, growing the \neconomy, we are going to be laser-focused on manufacturing, as well as \non agriculture.\n  We know that for every $1 billion in goods we export, we support \n5,800 American jobs. By passing the Trade Enforcement Act, we will \nremove more trade barriers, meaning we will export more goods and \ncreate more American jobs, and we all want to create jobs and grow the \neconomy.\n  So I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in the months \nahead to ensure that in this global marketplace where we find \nourselves, there is, in fact, a level playing field and we have an \nagency and individuals who are laser-focused on making sure we have \nfair trade.\n  In the end, our goal should be to export our products, not our jobs. \nThat is what Senator Graham's and my bill would do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 763. A bill to amend title XII of the Public Health Service Act to \nreauthorize certain trauma care programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Trauma \nSystems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act with \nSenator Murray. Timely and effective trauma care is critical to \nensuring lifesaving interventions for those who have serious injuries.\n  Nationally, trauma is the leading cause of death in the United States \nfor individuals aged 44 and younger. According to the National Trauma \nInstitute, trauma accounts for 41 million emergency room visits and 2.3 \nmillion hospital admissions across the country each year. The nation's \ntrauma and emergency medical systems are designed to respond quickly \nand efficiently to get seriously injured individuals to the appropriate \ntrauma center hospital within the ``golden hour,'' the time period when \nmedical intervention is most effective in saving lives and preserving \nfunction. Achieving this standard of access requires maintenance and \ncareful coordination between organized systems of trauma care.\n  The Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care \nReauthorization Act builds on my previous efforts to improve trauma \ncare, which is an essential component of our care system. Last year, \nthe President signed into law legislation I introduced, the Improving \nTrauma Care Act, which includes burn injuries in the definition of \ntrauma care. Previously, the statutory definitions of trauma were \ninconsistent and outdated. Most notably, the law defined trauma in a \nway that excluded burn injuries, preventing burn centers from being \nable to apply for funding made available under trauma and emergency \ncare programs. The Improving Trauma Care Act updated the Federal \ndefinition of trauma to include burns, a change that more appropriately \nreflects the relationship between burns and other traumatic injuries.\n  This was an important step, but more must be done. The legislation we \nare introducing today would reauthorize two important grant programs: \nTrauma Care Systems Planning Grants, which support State and rural \ndevelopment of trauma systems, and Regionalization of Emergency Care \nSystems Pilot Projects, which provide funds to design, implement, and \nevaluate innovative models of regionalized emergency care. The bill \nwould also direct States to update their model trauma care plan with \nthe input of relevant stakeholders. These critical programs support \nemergency care in communities across the country.\n  I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in \ncosponsoring this legislation and working toward its expeditious \npassage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/17/senate-section/article/S1588-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 102--REQUIRING AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES TO HOLD ANNUAL \n HEARINGS ON GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS ON \n   THE IDENTIFICATION, CONSOLIDATION, AND ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATIVE \n                          GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. GARDNER (for himself and Mr. Peters) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S.
