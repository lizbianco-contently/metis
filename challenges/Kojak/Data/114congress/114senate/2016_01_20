Mr. President, the Republican leader has said that he is \ngoing to bring and, in fact, has brought to the floor the House-passed \nrefugee bill, as he calls it. It is, of course, an immigration bill. \nYesterday he said that the debate over the bill should be based on \n``facts and common sense.'' I agree with that. The facts speak for \nthemselves. Our enemy is clearly defined. ISIS is the defined \norganization. It is a terrorist organization that poses a threat to the \nUnited States, women, children, and families fleeing persecution. They \nare not the enemy; ISIS is the enemy. We should be focusing all of our \nefforts on defeating our real enemy, the brutal, evil ISIS. Yet the \nbill the Republican leader is bringing to the floor scapegoats refugees \nwho are fleeing war and torture instead of creating real solutions to \nkeep Americans safe.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. The junior Senator from \nArizona has said he will oppose the bill because it is ``intended to \nknock out all refugee entrants and I'm not there.'' So says the junior \nSenator from Arizona.\n  National security experts from Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have warned against advancing bills such as this.\n  Former Secretary Gates is such a good person. I enjoyed working with \nhim very much. Yesterday he said--in words much stronger than I am \ngoing to say right now--that the Republicans running for President \ndon't understand the issue. He is much stronger and more firm in saying \nthat what they are talking about is ridiculous. By the way, he is a \nRepublican.\n  President Obama has already made it very clear that he will veto this \nlegislation. As written, this bill will not be signed into law. Some \nsay it is a waste of our time. By advancing this bill, Republicans are \ncreating a terrible distraction for the sake of embracing the hateful \nrhetoric, vitriol of the Republican Party's standard bearers, Donald \nTrump and Ted Cruz.\n  I guess this should come as no surprise to anyone. Over and over \nagain Republicans remain committed to\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\npledging loyalty to the divisive platform that has been built by the \nRepublican people running for President, led by, at this stage, Donald \nTrump.\n  We believe we must destroy ISIS. Everyone on this side of the aisle \nbelieves we should destroy ISIS and defend our Nation, but we believe \nwe can accomplish this goal without compromising Americans' core \nprinciples. Sadly, many leading Republicans have proposed policies that \ncompromise our fundamental values and threaten the identity of our \ngreat Nation. Democrats are committed to opposing the violent views of \nDonald Trump and providing the American people with solutions that make \nour Nation safer. We think it is way past time for the Senate to vote \non these policies.\n  My friend, the Republican leader, has pledged over and over again \nthat when the Republicans lead the Senate, they will thrive under an \nopen amendment process. For example, he said the following: ``I said at \nthe beginning of my time as majority leader that the open amendment \nprocess was going to be the rule rather than the exception.''\n  My friend continued to say that tough votes should be expected, and I \nquote: ``We'll just take our chances. You know, we're big men and \nwomen. We're prepared to vote on proposals that are offered from both \nsides.''\n  If Senate Republicans are prepared to abide by this, Senate Democrats \nwill seek to advance a limited number of amendments on this bill that \nis before this body. I am not talking about tons of amendments or \nscores of amendments, but four or five amendments. For example, we \ncould have one that dramatically increases the funding for local police \nanti-terrorist efforts and airport security. That is one that we want. \nThey are overworked and underresourced. We could close the terror gun \nloophole to prevent those on the no-fly list from being able to buy \nfirearms, explosives, or radiological materials, as has been attempted. \nWe would offer an amendment to denounce Donald Trump's reprehensible \nproposal to impose a religious test on admission to the United States.\n  The Democratic ISIS security bill has been filed. It is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. It includes keeping guns out of the \nhands of terrorists and stopping radicalization here in the United \nStates. It includes active shooter training. As I have already \nindicated, we are going to move our airport security substitute forward \nso we can prevent dirty bombs and work abroad to take care of refugees \nwho are over there.\n  These are the amendments we feel confident about, based on the \nstatements my friend has made. We are not asking for unlimited \namendments. I have listed four amendments here.\n  The Republican leader here in the Senate and the Republican Speaker \nhave pledged their loyalty to Donald Trump and his disgraced policies. \nThey have said that if he is the nominee, they will, of course, support \nhim.\n  As a frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump and his \nproposals are leading the public debate in our country. Republicans who \nsupport these illogical plans should be prepared for the next logical \nstep: voting on his vision of America.\n  Over here, we believe that all of these measures are deserving of a \nvote. I talked about four of them. We are ready to vote on the \nproposals now--this week. If for any reason the Republican leader needs \nmore time to discuss the proposals with his caucus, we are happy to \nreschedule the vote.\n  Now, I know it is a big day in the Senate because during my news \nbriefing on the way to work, I heard that the junior Senator from \nFlorida is going to be here to vote--and the junior Senator from Texas. \nThey will actually be in the Senate to vote. It is a big day. I know we \nhave a tight schedule because they are going to be here for only an \nhour or two, but perhaps we could have a debate on the amendments we \nhave suggested. I am sure that if we offer these amendments, the \nRepublicans will offer amendments, and we could have some time here to \ndeal with these amendments. But we will not allow Republicans to hijack \nthe Senate floor to play politics with our Nation's security. The \nAmerican people deserve better. I look forward to offering these \namendments.\n  I publicly want everyone to know that I did not try to jump ahead of \nmy friend the Republican leader. I was told by staff that I should go \nfirst. If I had known the Senator was going to be here so quickly, I \nwould have waited, so I am sorry about that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S100-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE \n    CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY--VETO\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 22 be considered as having been read; that it be \nprinted in the Record, and spread in full upon the Journal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The veto message ordered to be printed in the Record is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval S.J. Res. 22, a \nresolution that would nullify a rule issued by the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Department of the Army to clarify the \njurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act. The rule, which is a \nproduct of extensive public involvement and years of work, is critical \nto our efforts to protect the Nation's waters and keep them clean; is \nresponsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and \ncommunity stakeholders; and is consistent with decisions of the United \nStates Supreme Court.\n  We must protect the waters that are vital for the health of our \ncommunities and the success of our businesses, agriculture, and energy \ndevelopment. As I have noted before, too many of our waters have been \nleft vulnerable. Pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers, \nlakes, reservoirs, and coastal waters near which most Americans live \nand on which they depend for their drinking water, recreation, and \neconomic development. Clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act helps \nto protect these resources and safeguard public health. Because this \nresolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and \ndeny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity \nneeded to invest in projects that rely on clean water, I cannot support \nit. I am therefore vetoing this resolution.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 19, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S100-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, our country has a proud record of \nadmitting the oppressed as refugees to our shores, yet the debate about \nhow to safely admit refugees from Syria and Iraq is a serious \nconversation that deserves a serious response from Washington. It is \ndifficult to effectively vet immigrants from a war-torn country where \nrecords may sometimes no longer exist at all. Senior law enforcement \nand intelligence officials have expressed concerns and DHS Secretary \nJeh Johnson has said organizations such as ISIL may like to try to \nexploit\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\nthe refugee program. So is it any wonder that the citizens we represent \nare concerned?\n  According to one recent survey, nearly 80 percent of Americans and 77 \npercent of Democrats say refugees should go through a more robust \nsecurity process. President Obama seemed to suggest these Americans \nwere motivated by some animus toward widows and orphans. I would \nsuggest they are motivated by a love for their families and \ncommunities. I remind the President that this country has a proud \ntradition of compassion, and we have settled millions of refugees from \naround the world. Many Americans are telling us they want to continue \nhelping others, but they want to do it in a smarter and more secure \nway.\n  So I want to say this before moving forward. In his State of the \nUnion Address, President Obama decried the political divisions that \nhave widened during his Presidency. He called for cooperation and a \nmore elevated debate. He warned that ``democracy breaks down when the \naverage person feels their voice doesn't matter.''\n\n  ``Democracy,'' he said, ``doesn't work if we think the people who \ndisagree with us are all motivated by malice.''\n  I ask him to reflect on those words. We each have a choice in this \ndiscussion. We can glibly dismiss the sincere concerns of middle-class \nfamilies or we can work to unify Americans by pursuing bipartisan and \nbalanced solutions.\n  Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives chose \nbipartisan and balanced solutions when they worked together to pass the \nAmerican SAFE Act a few weeks ago. Democrats and Republicans in the \nSenate should choose bipartisan and balanced solutions by working \ntogether to advance the American SAFE Act today.\n  This bipartisan bill would allow Washington to step back, take a \nbreath, and ensure it has correct policies and security screenings in \nplace before moving ahead with the refugee program for Iraq and Syria. \nNo wonder dozens of Democrats joined with Republicans to pass this \nbalanced bill with a veto-proof majority over in the House. It is \ncertainly worrying to hear that Senate Democrats are now being \npressured to block us from even debating it. I understand the political \npressure to oppose this balanced bill may be intense, but it is also \nintensely shortsighted, and I urge our Democratic friends to resist it.\n  Boosting confidence in our Nation's vetting process is critical for \nour citizens, just as it is critical for every refugee who truly needs \nour help. Our Democratic friends know a cloud of unfair stigmatization \nthreatens to hang over legitimate refugees so long as Democrats block \ncommonsense safeguards to weed out ISIL sympathizers.\n  If our Democratic friends are serious in what they imply about \npromoting tolerance for widows and orphans and in strengthening \nsecurity for Americans, they will not vote to block the Senate from \ndebating balanced, bipartisan legislation that can advance both \npriorities simultaneously.\n  Let's work together to enact the American SAFE Act and its reforms, \nand then let's work together on the root of the problem. Refugees are \nfleeing Syria because of a brutal civil war, and they are fleeing Iraq \nbecause the terrorist group Al Qaeda in Iraq has evolved into the \nlargest terrorist group in history--ISIL--so the ultimate solution is \nto make the region somewhere they can return to.\n  Here is what hasn't helped: The precipitous withdrawal of our advise \nand assist force from Iraq, the indecision attached to drawing and \nerasing red lines in Syria, mocking the genuine concerns of American \ncitizens here at home.\n  Here is what will help: the administration cooperating across the \naisle to finally develop a serious plan to confront ISIL. That is what \nthe American people continue to call for, that is what the American \npeople deserve, and it is what the administration will pursue if it is \ntruly serious about helping both our country and the victims escaping \nthis brutal terrorist group.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we have the makings of an agreement \nhere, at least the way I understood the Republican leader.\n  We agree that refugees should go through a robust screening process. \nThe bill we are talking about before the Senate, though, is stressing \nbureaucracy and paperwork. Each refugee who comes to this country--and \nthere are about 100 a day--would have to be signed off by three Cabinet \nSecretaries. That is 300 personal signatures a day. We don't want more \npaperwork.\n  What we have said is we want four amendments to change the underlying \nbill. We are not going to be demanding days of debate time. We would be \nhappy--we would be very reasonable with whatever the leader felt \nappropriate. We believe we should move forward with real solutions, not \npaperwork.\n  We are not saying we don't want to get on the bill. We are willing to \nget on the bill. We want four amendments. That is it, four amendments. \nI am sure the leader will look this over and get back to me at the \nappropriate time, but we are willing to work on this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will obviously be talking to the \nDemocratic leader on a way forward on the bill, and we will have those \ndiscussions and report back later.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, similar to most Americans listening to \nPresident Obama's State of the Union Address last week, I found his \ntake on national security and world affairs rather surprising.\n  According to a poll in December, 60 percent of the American people \nsee national security and terrorism as a major concern, and they have \ngood reason to be worried.\n  As President Obama finishes his last year in office, Syria is wracked \nby civil war, Iraq is in turmoil, Russian aggression is growing, North \nKorea has tested yet another nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia and Iran are \nimmersed in a cold war, and ISIS continues its campaign of terror. Yet, \naccording to the President, we have nothing to worry about; America's \nleadership is strong, and we are headed in the right direction.\n  Unfortunately, this fairytale version of our global situation stands \nin stark contrast with reality. In his State of the Union Address, the \nPresident did acknowledge: ``The world will look to us to help solve \nthese problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk.''\n  Well, I couldn't agree more, but unfortunately tough talk with no \naction has been the hallmark of this administration. In 2011, after the \nonset of the Syrian civil war, both President Obama and then-Secretary \nof State Hillary Clinton stated unconditionally that Syrian President \nBashar al-Assad had to go. The President drew a line in the sand: If \nAssad used chemical weapons, America would act. But when Assad flouted \nthis red line, killing his own people--including women and children--\nwith the large-scale use of sarin gas, the President chose to forgo a \ndecided military response and instead pursue negotiations involving the \nRussians, working out a compromise that ultimately strengthened Assad's \nposition, and the results of the President's decision have not been \npretty.\n  In the wake of the negotiations, an emboldened Vladimir Putin invaded \nCrimea and eastern Ukraine, and the situation in Syria got worse. It \nappears now that the Assad administration will outlast Obama's. Worse, \nour allies in the Middle East no longer trust America to come to their \naid. The President's failure to back up his tough talk with action has \nundermined American leadership, and this may take years, if not \ndecades, to repair.\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\n  This week the Senate is taking up the American Security Against \nForeign Enemies Act, which addresses the Syrian refugee crisis--another \nbyproduct, I might add, of the President's failure to uphold his red \nline. With Syria, both the United States and the European powers have \nhad to learn a lesson the hard way: If you don't take action to solve \nthe problem, the people who are suffering will end up on your doorstep.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed in this conflict. \nAssad continues to use chlorine bombs indiscriminately to kill his own \npeople, and ISIS executes anyone who is not considered loyal. It is no \nwonder the Syrian people want out.\n  Yet, with the mass exodus of refugees come other security concerns, \nincluding the threat of ISIS infiltrating the refugee population. \nSenior and U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have made it \nclear they are concerned that we don't have the ability to adequately \nvet Syrian refugees. As we know from reports, at least one of the \nterrorists responsible for the deadly attacks in Paris passed through a \nrefugee processing checkpoint in Greece.\n  To quote the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, ``I \ndon't . . . put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives \namong those refugees . . . that's a huge concern of ours.''\n  The American SAFE Act helps address this concern by requiring the \nFBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of National \nIntelligence to certify that Syrian and Iraqi refugees have been \nthoroughly vetted and do not pose a security risk before they are \nallowed to enter the country. This is a reasonable request, and if the \nadministration wants to assure the American people that these refugees \nare not a threat, then it should have no problem providing such \ncertifications.\n  I plan to file an amendment to this bill that would also give more \nauthority to individual States when it comes to the resettlement of \nrefugees. Last year, many Governors expressed a desire, shared by their \nconstituents, that Syrian refugees not be resettled in their States. My \namendment would grant Governors a presence at weekly refugee \nresettlement meetings within the State Department and give those \nGovernors veto power over the resettlement of certain refugees in their \nStates. Under my amendment, if a Governor's office is not satisfied \nthat its security concerns have been addressed by the required security \nchecks, the Governor can veto the resettlement question. Any refugee, \nonce admitted to the United States, would still be free to travel from \nState to State as he or she pleased. This amendment would simply \nincrease States' rights by giving Governors a say in any decisions by \nthe Federal Government to resettle large populations of refugees in \ntheir States. This is a reasonable solution to the concerns that were \nraised by the Governors of over 30 States, and I hope we can have a \nvote on this amendment.\n  Over the weekend, the world witnessed another byproduct of President \nObama's failing foreign policy. Thanks to a provision of the \nPresident's flawed nuclear deal with Iran, more than $100 billion of \nfrozen Iranian assets and oil revenue were made available to the \nIslamic Republic of Iran. This means that Iran's Revolutionary Guard, \nincluding the Quds Force--which is responsible for the deaths of \nhundreds of American soldiers in Iraq--just received a big influx of \ncash. Again, this is thanks to the deal President Obama considers to be \nperhaps the major foreign policy achievement of his Presidency.\n  While I am glad that the hostages held by Iran are coming home to \ntheir families, it is a mistake to think this means Iran all of a \nsudden will now play nice. Iran's leadership knows very well that it \nwon the lottery with this nuclear deal, and it desperately wants \nIranian assets unfrozen and sanctions lifted. Now that the Iranian \nleadership has received its payout, Iran will be further emboldened.\n  When negotiating this deal, the Obama administration assured Congress \nthat the United States would make sure Iran kept its end of the \nbargain. Well, it is already clear from October's ballistic missile \ntest that Iran is determined to test the President's resolve and flout \ninternational restrictions. We cannot let those provocations go \nunanswered.\n  President Obama is right that when conflict arises, the world looks \nto the United States for leadership. However, it takes more than talk \nto provide the leadership the world needs. In his last year in office, \nI hope President Obama will move beyond rhetoric and start offering \nrealistic solutions to the growing number of security concerns that \nface our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise on January 20, 2016, on the floor \nof the Senate to acknowledge this day as the 35th anniversary of the \nreturn of 53 Americans by the Iranian Government to the shores of the \nUnited States of America after captivity for 444 days in Iran. As the \nMembers of the Senate will remember, they were employees of the U.S. \nEmbassy in Iran who were brutally attacked, sent through mock \nexecutions, subjected to beatings, subjected to brainwashing, subjected \nto torture, and for 444 days were out of communication with their loved \nones and our country. Fortunately, we successfully negotiated their \nrelease, and on January 20, 1981, they were released back to the United \nStates.\n  But that release included the execution of the Algerian Accords \nbetween the United States and the Iranians, which prohibited any \nhostage from suing the nation of Iran for compensation for their \ncaptivity. Since that release, many Americans in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, including myself, have worked hard to \ntry to right that wrong. I am very pleased to acknowledge that under \nthe passage of the omnibus in December, we were able to secure funding \nto be able to compensate those hostages as they should have been \ncompensated 35 years ago. We were able to take money from the Paribas \nbank forfeiture of Iranian funds to the U.S. Government to see to it \nthat they were compensated in some measure for the sacrifice they made \nfor our country.\n  A lot of people have written: Why would you compensate people for \ntheir captivity? Why would you go to the effort for 35 years to see to \nit these people got some amount of money to compensate them for their \ncaptivity? Why would we not do it? There are Americans all over the \nworld serving in very dangerous places, serving as ambassadors and \ndiplomats through the State Department. They should know we have their \nbacks, not just on the days they are serving but 35 years later if they \nwere tortured, beaten or if they were held captive.\n  We all rejoiced to see the Americans that were released by the \nIranians. We know there were Americans taken hostage in Iraq and \nBaghdad 2 days later. Taking Americans hostage and using them as tools \nof war is something that has been happening for years and years, and \nthe Iranian Government is at the head of it. These Americans deserve \nfair treatment, compensation, and recompense for all they suffered, and \nI am proud to say that because of a bipartisan effort in the House and \nSenate, we were able to do so.\n  I want to thank Senator Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee; Senator Cardin, the former chairman; Senator Menendez from \nNew Jersey; Senator Reid from Nevada, who was instrumental in helping; \nand Senator Blumenthal, my ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee of the Senate, for help on this bill and for all the help \nthey brought. I want to thank the entire body of the Senate, who in \nDecember voted unanimously to see to it that the Paribas money was made \navailable to the survivors of the people who were taken hostage in \n1979.\n  You might remember the show ``Nightline'' that we see on television \nstarted with the original report in 1979 by Ted Koppel about the \nhostage taking. It became a television show when\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\nthey were held that long. I am glad now that the ending of that show is \na successful ending, because we brought them home and we saw to it they \nwere compensated. Some of them have passed away. Some of them had taken \ntheir own life. Some of them had difficulties. Some were never able to \nrid themselves of the scars of the torture and brainwashing. But this \nSenate and this Congress did what it was supposed to do, stood up for \nAmericans and sent a signal to everybody who works in the State \nDepartment, who is a diplomat for our country, and who works overseas \nthat if you are taken, we will stand behind you and we will never ever \nforget--whether it is 444 days or 35 years--once an American serving \nour country, always an American serving our country. We will always be \nthere for you, and we will go to every effort and every length, even if \nit does take 35 years.\n  On the anniversary of their release in 1981 when they came back to \nthe United States, we pay tribute to those great Americans who served \nour country and were held hostage in Iran. We give thanks that we have \nthe kind of men and women who are willing, day in and day out, to \nsacrifice on behalf of our great country. May God bless each and every \none of them, and may God bless the United States of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a pending \nlegislative matter we will be discussing later in the day, the American \nSecurity Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015. This is the title of the \nbill that was passed by the House in November. It is now pending before \nthe Senate, and we will be discussing it later.\n  I am going to talk for a few minutes, but the punch line is as \nindicated on this board. We are talking about who are America's foreign \nenemies. This is a bill that deals with Iraqi and Syrian refugees. I \nassert that refugees are not our enemy; ISIL is our enemy. Yet, for \nsome strange reason, in the 18th month of a war against ISIL, Congress \nhas been unwilling to debate our real enemy.\n  First, refugees are not our enemies. The refugee crisis, with \nrefugees coming from Syria and now Iraq, has been called the worst \nhumanitarian crisis since World War II. Four million Syrians have left \ntheir native country because of being exposed to the atrocities of \nbeing barrel-bombed by Bashar al-Assad and now the atrocities of ISIL \nand other terrorist organizations. Those 4 million have left to find \nhaven from this horrible violence, just as any family would. Over \n200,000 Syrians have been killed by this violence, and now the number \nis probably approaching 300,000. In addition to the 4 million Syrian \nrefugees who have left Syria to escape violence, there are an \nadditional 8 million Syrians who have left their homes and been \ndisplaced within the country and who could leave the country at any \nmoment as the violence continues. These refugees are victims of \nviolence, victims of unspeakable atrocity first perpetrated by the \nhorrible dictator Bashar al-Assad and second by terrorist groups such \nas ISIL. Yet this bill would say these refugees are enemies.\n  There is a story that means an awful lot to me personally, and I hope \nyou will indulge me.\n\n       A Jewish man was traveling from Jerusalem down to Jericho, \n     and he was attacked by bandits. They stripped him of his \n     clothes, beat him up, and left him half dead beside the road.\n       By chance a priest came along, but when he saw the man \n     lying there, he crossed to the other side of the road and \n     passed him by. A Temple assistant walked over and looked at \n     him lying there, but he also passed by on the other side.\n       Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the \n     man, he felt compassion for him. Going over to him, the \n     Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and \n     bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took \n     him to an inn, where he took care of him. The next day he \n     handed the innkeeper two silver coins, telling him. ``Take \n     care of this man. If his bill runs higher than this, I'll pay \n     you the next time I'm here.\n       ``Now which of these three would you say was a neighbor to \n     the man who was attacked by bandits?'' Jesus asked.\n       The man replied, ``The one who showed him mercy.''\n       Then Jesus said, ``Yes, now go and do the same.''\n\n  This is a story that was written 2,000 years ago, but it is not a \nstory about yesterday, it is a story about every day of human life on \nthis planet. They are beaten-up people lying by the side of the road, \nand the choice we have to make as individuals or as a society is do we \npass by or do we act as the Good Samaritan did--in a compassionate way?\n  In fact, I would argue that the Good Samaritan story actually isn't \ntough enough. If we called the refugees of the worst humanitarian \ncrisis since World War II our enemies, it is as if we were going over \nto the man and not passing by but kicking the man who had been beaten \nand robbed by bandits.\n  Let me move away from Scripture and talk about American values.\n  The Statue of Liberty that stands in New York Harbor is graced with a \npowerful poem, ``The New Colossus,'' written by an American poet, Emma \nLazarus. Emma Lazarus was a member of a very prominent, \nmultigenerational Jewish family in New York. There was a fundraising \ncampaign to build the pediment upon which the Statue of Liberty stands \nin New York Harbor. The Federal Government didn't have the money, so \nthe fundraising was done privately. Emma Lazarus wrote a poem about the \nStatue of Liberty for a fundraising contest to help raise money, and \nthat is why the statue is there now. The poem is called ``The New \nColossus.'' The Colossus references one of the wonders of the ancient \nworld, the Colossus of Rhodes. Emma Lazarus wrote the poem about the \nStatue of Liberty, calling it the ``New Colossus.''\n\n     Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\n     With conquering limbs astride from land to land;\n     Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\n     A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\n     Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name\n     Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand\n     Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\n     The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\n     ``Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!'' Cries she\n     With silent lips. ``Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door!''\n\n  The debate that we will undertake about this bill, about whether we \ncall refugees enemies is a debate about who we are as a nation. Let's \nhonor our history, let's honor our values, and let's do what Americans \nhave always done--been willing to extend a hand to those who are \nvictimized by atrocity in other lands, rather than extend the back of \nour hand and label them as enemies.\n  Now, I don't dislike everything about this bill we are about to \ndebate. I actually really like the title. The content, I don't like. \nThe title, ``American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015.'' \nWe have an enemy. We have been at war with ISIL for 18 months. We have \nspent $5 billion in this war. We have deployed thousands of American \ntroops in this war. Eleven members of the American Armed Services have \nbeen killed while on deployment in Operation Inherent Resolve. We have \nan enemy. The enemy is not refugees from Syria--the enemy is ISIL.\n  We all know the facts about ISIL, this organization that claims to be \ninspired to create a worldwide caliphate. They have slaughtered \nChristians and other religious minorities by the thousands. They have \nsold women into slavery by the thousands. They have beheaded American \nhostages, including American aid workers. If there is a modern-day \nequivalent of a Good Samaritan, it is an American aid worker who is \ntrying to help somebody out. ISIL has kidnapped, captured, and beheaded \nAmerican aid workers. The number of deaths just this weekend--400 more \npeople kidnapped by ISIL in Iraq and Syria. The number of deaths have \nbeen in the tens of thousands by ISIL, and as I have said, beheading \nAmerican hostages, 11 American servicemembers killed, but it is beyond\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\nIraq and Syria. ISIL has claimed credit for bringing down an airliner, \nkilling tourists in the Sinai. ISIL has claimed credit for bombing and \nshooting attacks, killing hundreds in Paris. ISIL has claimed credit \nfor a bombing at a peace rally in Ankara, Turkey, that killed hundreds \nand then a bombing outside the Blue Mosque in Istanbul 2 weeks ago that \nkilled 15 and injured dozens more. The shooters in San Bernardino were \ninspired by ISIL, even if they weren't directly connected to them. \nWithin the last few days, we saw another attack and explosion in \nJakarta that was claimed by ISIL. Now, that is who an enemy is--not a \nrefugee who is fleeing ISIL. ISIL is the enemy. ISIL is the enemy. ISIL \nmust be defeated. Yet we are not debating ISIL--and we haven't been \nwilling to debate ISIL in 18 months. Instead, we are trying to claim \nthat refugees are the enemies of this Statue of Liberty Nation.\n  Why has Congress been silent about ISIL for 18 months? Our President \nhas asked Congress: Congress, do your job and declare war against ISIL. \nHe even sent us a proposed authorization 11 months ago. Eleven months \nago, the President sent to Congress a proposed authorization against \nISIL. There has not been a vote on the floor in the House. There has \nnot been a vote on the floor in the Senate. There has not been a debate \non the floor of the House or Senate. There has not been a debate or \nvote in committees in the House or Senate. For 11 months, since the \nPresident asked us, ``Let's get involved and take action against \nISIL,'' there has been no action. And it is not just the President. \nGeneral Dunford, the Marine general, who is now head of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, testified before the Armed Services Committee. I asked \nhim: Should we do an authorization against ISIL? He said it would send \na strong message to ISIL. It would send a strong message to our allies. \nBut here is what he said that really grabbed me, coming from a heavily \nmilitary State. He said: Our troops deserve it. There are thousands \ndeployed away from home risking their lives.\n  I asked General Dunford: Would it be good to have an authorization \nagainst ISIL? How would our troops respond? Here is what he said: What \nour young men and women need--and it is virtually all they need to do \nthe job we asked them to do--is the sense that what they are doing has \npurpose, has meaning, and has the support of the American people. Our \ntroops think Congress is indifferent to this.\n  Virginia is very military. We are very closely connected to it. I \nhave a child in the military, one of my three kids. I know what our \ntroops are thinking about Congress right now, which is, while we are \ndeployed overseas, fighting this battle and risking our lives, Congress \ndoesn't care and would rather not talk about it. Secretary Panetta has \nrecently given a speech saying Congress should act.\n  So our President, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary \nPanetta, and others have said: Congress have this debate. There is an \nenemy out there. Have the backbone to name it as an enemy and authorize \naction against this enemy.\n  Constitutionally, Congress should act. One of the most important \npowers in the Constitution is article 1, in the definition of the roles \nof Congress. It is Congress that declares war, not the President. That \nwas put in the Constitution by the Framers--Virginians like James \nMadison--who knew that, before 1787, war was a matter for the \nExecutive, the Monarch, the Emperor, and the Sultan. But he said, ``In \nAmerica, it is going to be different.'' We are not going to make a \ndeclaration of war for the Executive. We are going to make a \ndeclaration of war for Congress. Once declared, the President can \nimplement, but it is Congress's job. Congress is not doing what the \nConstitution commands.\n  Imagine one of the family members of the 11 servicemembers who have \nbeen killed while deployed in Operation Inherent Resolve--killed in \ncombat, killed when their jet was taking off of an aircraft carrier and \ncrashed into the ocean or otherwise killed during deployment. Imagine, \nour best and brightest are sent, as they volunteered for our American \nmilitary. They were sent overseas to fight an enemy--who we all agree \nis an enemy, who we all agree is conducting atrocities--and that pride \nof your life is killed while serving our country, and yet Congress will \nnot even have a debate about whether ISIL is an enemy and whether we \nshould declare war against ISIL and instead wants to have a debate \nabout whether refugees from ISIL should be called our enemies. Imagine \nhow you would feel if you were one of those families, and Congress was \neven unwilling to dignify the loss of your loved one by 2 minutes of \ndebate or vote on the floor of either the Senate or the House.\n  David Ignatius wrote a piece yesterday in the Washington Post, ``The \nugly truth: Defeating the Islamic State will take decades.'' The last \nline of his article says this:\n\n       The next President is going to inherit an expanding war \n     against a global terrorist adversary. The debate about how \n     best to fight this enemy hasn't even begun.\n\n  After 18 months, after deaths of American troops, after all these \natrocities, after bombings in cities all over the world, the debate \nhasn't even begun because we refuse to have it in this Chamber.\n  As I conclude, why has Congress been silent about this, since we \nbegan military action against ISIL on August 8 of 2014? We will hit the \n18-month anniversary in a couple weeks, in February.\n  I have a lot of criticisms of the administration's strategy. I think \nthey waited too long to send the authorization to us. I don't think the \nauthorization is particularly well-drafted, but that is no obstacle to \nus acting. Presidents send authorizations frequently and Congress \nredrafts them. So I am not light on criticism for the administration, \nbut I am asking this question in this Chamber, where I am a Member, and \nso my question is actually critical, but it is also self-critical: Why \nhas Congress been silent in the 18-month battle against ISIL? It is \nbecause of fear. Fear of not ISIL but fear of accountability. A war \nvote is hard. It is the hardest vote we will ever cast--and it should \nbe. It should be.\n  How much easier is it to criticize the President and say: We don't \nlike your strategy. You are doing it wrong. Why don't you do more \nairstrikes here or put more boots on the ground there? That is much \neasier for Congress to do than to actually have a debate about ISIL and \ncraft a strategy, and then say we, Members of Congress, individually, \nare putting our names on this.\n  Members of Congress have been looking actively to avoid a vote on \nthis for 18 months because a war vote is tough. Under the best of \ncircumstances, there are going to be consequences that will be painful \nand tragic. There will be American lives lost, and that is under the \nbest of circumstances. War isn't always fought under the best of \ncircumstances. There will be surprises. There will be twists and turns. \nWe will go down a path such as trying to train and equip a moderate \nSyrian opposition and find it doesn't work out the way we hope.\n  I think in Congress both Houses, both parties, have had a sense that, \nwell, maybe if we don't vote and we just criticize the President and we \njust kind of turn our eyes while we are essentially forcing people to \nrisk their lives in a war that we are not willing to declare, people \nwill not hold us accountable. I have seen that tendency throughout my \n21 years in elected service, when a tough vote is on the table, when \nsomething is hard and complicated--and this certainly is--if I can \navoid it, well, I would like to avoid it, but that is so disrespectful \nto the oath we took, where we pledged to live up to the laws, including \narticle 1 responsibilities of Congress. It is so disrespectful to the \nvolunteer military deployed overseas, risking their lives, and the \nfamilies of those who have already lost their lives.\n  After all, what is our fear of a tough vote, in the grand scheme of \nthings, as against the sacrifice our troops are making overseas? Now, \nthat is something that is really hard. Having to cast a tough vote is \nnot that hard. It is not that hard. We can do this. We can do this.\n  The only action that has been taken since this war started 18 months \nago was on a bill I introduced, an authorization for military force \nagainst ISIL. I introduced it in September of 2014, 1 month after the \nwar started. It got a 10-to-8 vote in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Sadly, it was a partisan vote. It was right at the end of \nthe previous Congress and expired with no action. A number of those who \nvoted against it said: Look, the majority is about to change. Why do \nthis now\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nwith 2 weeks left in the session? When the majority changes, we can \ntake it up. Some said the President hasn't even sent a draft \nauthorization yet. It is premature to do it.\n  Now we have the President's draft authorization. We have had it for \n11 months and done nothing. Now we have seen--and there can be no doubt \nat this point--the evil nature of this threat we face and the expanding \nand complicating nature of this threat we face. Now is the time, \nfinally, for Congress to step up to our responsibility and do our job.\n\n  I have used a couple of literary references, so let me close with \none. A great Irish poet--I am biased--William Butler Yeats, wrote a \npoem at the end of World War I. He surveyed the wreckage of World War \nI, about 100 years ago.\n  In a lot of historians' views, World War I was kind of one of the \nmost needless wars in some ways. It was unclear what it was about, but \nwhat it was really about was decaying monarchies that wouldn't change. \nInstead of changing, they let a terrorist action in the assassination \nof a nobleman--a leader in the Balkans--trigger the start of World War \nI. It was mechanized slaughter, and millions lost their lives. The \nUnited States came in and played a very important role, and at the end \nof the day, they were the peacemaker who had to come in to resolve it.\n  Yeats wrote a poem after World War I surveying this wreckage of these \nsocieties. It is called ``The Second Coming.'' He expressed a real \nconcern about the state of society at the time because what he noticed \nat that time was that ``the best lack all conviction and the worst are \nfilled with passionate intensity.''\n  We have an enemy, ISIL, and I think we can all agree that they are \nfilled with a passionate intensity. They are the worst in their human \nrights violations, their atrocities, and their complete disrespect for \nhuman life. They are the worst. They are the enemy. We should be \ndebating about them.\n  The best lack all conviction. We are the best Nation in the world. I \nfirmly and deeply believe that. I have believed it every day of the 58 \nyears that I have been alive. We are the best. We have the best system \nof government in the world. While that system of government is often \ndescribed as three coequal branches, there is a reason they put the \nlegislative branch in article I, the executive in article II, and the \njudiciary in article III. This is the first among the coequal branches \nbecause we are direct representatives of the people. That is how it was \nstructured so that we would be the best of the best--the best branch in \nthe best government in the best Nation in the history of the world.\n  Do we lack all conviction? If we are willing to call refugees fleeing \nfrom violence our enemies but we are afraid to take up a debate about \nwhether ISIL is an enemy to support our troops in harm's way--that is \nthe question I am asking today. I know we are the best. Where is our \nconviction?\n  So I ask my colleagues, in connection with this bill, let's keep the \ntitle to it. Let's secure America against foreign enemies. Let's secure \nAmerica against ISIL. But let's not turn our backs on the victims of \nthe worst humanitarian crisis since World War II.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am glad I happened to come to the floor \nwhen the Senator from Virginia was speaking on this topic. I didn't \ncome to speak on the topic, but I know how passionately he feels about \nit. I find myself agreeing with much of what he has to say about what \nour military deserves in terms of the support not only of the President \nbut also of the Congress and thus, through Congress, the American \npeople. Whenever we send our troops into harm's way, our men and women \nin uniform deserve to know they have the unified support of the U.S. \nGovernment and hopefully the American people.\n  I wish to tell my friend from Virginia, who has been on this topic \nfor some time, that I think there are some practical impediments to \nwhat the Senator is suggesting, and maybe we can find a way to work \ntogether to address them.\n  First of all, there is the question of what is the strategy. I think \nCongress is reluctant to issue an additional authorization for the use \nof military force until we know what the President's strategy is, not \njust in Syria, in Iraq, but also with the travel and the movement of \npeople back and forth from those war-torn countries to the United \nStates or to other parts of the world, including the visa waiver \ncountries--the 38 of them--people who can travel freely from that area \nto those visa waiver countries and then come to the United States. The \nthird part of it, which we have been addressing and which the FBI \nDirector has brought to our attention on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, has to do with radicalization of people back here at home \nthrough the use of social media or the Internet. I would say to my \nfriend that this is a serious problem, and I find myself in sympathy \nwith what he is trying to do. But, again, the practical problem is the \nabsence of a real strategy.\n  I fear that with 1 year left for this President in office, one of the \ngoals of some of the proponents--I am not casting aspersions; I am just \nsaying I am concerned about this--one of the goals would be to issue an \nauthorization for the use of military force that would actually tie the \nhands of future Presidents, because apparently this President thinks he \nhas all the authority he needs. It is true, they just got a draft that \nthey have sent over here for us to consider, but the President seems--\nat least to me--to be suggesting by his actions and most of what he is \ndoing that he thinks he has all the authority he needs.\n  So I want to say to my friend that I don't doubt your sincerity, and \nI admire the point you are trying to make, but I do see those as \npractical problems: the absence of a strategy from the Commander in \nChief and the proposal--one of the proposals; I think it came out of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee--that would actually limit the options \navailable to the next Commander in Chief were this to be passed. But \nthose aren't insurmountable problems; those are things that, once \nidentified, we can focus on and work a little bit more.\n  I thank the Senator for his continued advocacy on this issue, and I \nadmire his determination to see this through to a good conclusion.\n  Mr. President, what I came to the floor to talk about is a bill we \nare going to be voting on this afternoon called the American Security \nAgainst Foreign Enemies Act and also called the American SAFE Act.\n  I wish he was still here. I know he just left, but I want to make one \npoint on the chart the Senator from Virginia had where he suggested \nthat some assert refugees are the enemy. That is not true. That is the \nopposite of true. The American people are the most generous people in \nthe world when it comes to admitting refugees and naturalizing new \nAmerican citizens. In the past few years--if my memory serves me \ncorrectly, we naturalize between 800,000 and 1 million new citizens a \nyear. America is the most open, welcoming country in the world because \nwe recognize this is a source of our great strength. The brains, the \nambition, and the hard work that go together with people who are \nunhappy with their current circumstance and who are looking to live the \nAmerican dream and what they have to do in order to come here to \nAmerica to be a part of that through a legal system of immigration I \nthink is something to be applauded and celebrated.\n  But this bill is about something else. This is about our national \nsecurity. This is not an anti-refugee bill. That is immediately where \nthe President went and where some of the other folks on the President's \nside of the aisle went, was suggesting that somehow, by being concerned \nabout our own national security, we were somehow anti-refugee. That is \ndemonstrably false. All we are asking for and all this legislation \nprovides for--passed by a bipartisan vote of the House of \nRepresentatives--is to enhance the screening of refugees so that this \nsystem cannot be exploited by terrorists--a tactic ISIS has encouraged. \nOur adversaries, particularly the Islamic State, recognize the fact \nthat they can't exploit our system to advance their cause, which is to \nkill innocent men, women, and children in this country.\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\n  This legislation doesn't close the door to refugees or go back on \nAmerica's great traditions and who we are as a people. All it does is \nadd safeguards to our refugee admissions process and updates it in \nlight of the threats we currently face.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer was probably in the same hearings \nI was in or the briefings with Jeh Johnson, the Director of Homeland \nSecurity, who said that following some of these threats, the \nadministration unilaterally enhanced some of their screening \nmechanisms. I applaud them for that. That is important to do. But they \ncan't sit here and tell us with all seriousness that Congress can't \nweigh in or we can't have a debate and we can't have an amendment \nprocess on legislation which is designed to do what they themselves \nsaid they are trying to accomplish, which is to protect public safety \nby enhancing some of the screening process.\n  All we are trying to do--and it is not a small thing; it is our No. 1 \nresponsibility as part of the Federal Government--is protect our \nnational security. Our chief goal in this legislation is pretty simple. \nIt is to make sure we are doing everything we can to prevent terrorists \nfrom entering the country.\n  Why would our friends across the aisle want to filibuster this \nlegislation by voting no this afternoon at 2:30 and deny us an \nopportunity to actually debate the legislation? Under the rules of the \nSenate, they are free to offer suggestions, by way of amendment, about \nhow we can improve the legislation. I have heard a number of them, \nincluding from the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Feinstein, among others, who said that what she would like to \nsee us do is to beef up our protections to prevent people from \nexploiting the visa waiver system and coming into the United States \nwithout going through an adequate screening mechanism. I think there \nwould be a lot of support on this side of the aisle and on a bipartisan \nbasis to modify this legislation to include some of her ideas. At least \nwe ought to have that debate. We shouldn't shut it down by a filibuster \non the other side.\n  This bill would ensure that the FBI and other national security \nintelligence agencies have actually certified to the security of the \nrefugee screening program. It is called accountability--something that \npeople don't think we have enough of here in Washington, DC. Something \nbad happens, and there is some nameless, faceless bureaucrat who is \nblamed. What this would do is put the responsibility and accountability \nwhere it belongs.\n  There is no doubt that we live in turbulent times. Our national \nsecurity experts tell us that they have never seen a more diverse, a \nmore complex array of threats around the world. Our Refugee Admissions \nProgram should be examined and updated to respond to those threats, and \nthat is what this legislation attempts to do.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have to look very far to see examples of why \nthis legislation is necessary. Earlier this year in Houston, a man born \nin Iraq entered the country as a refugee and was later charged with \nproviding material support to ISIS. That is one example. I am sure it \nis not the only example of why this legislation is important. We are \nstill learning more about that particular case, but what we already \nknow is alarming.\n  According to media reports, he was associated with members and \nsympathizers of ISIS. We know that investigators found an ISIS flag at \nhis home in Houston, TX. Just last week it was reported that his plans \nincluded setting off bombs at two popular malls in Houston, TX. Houston \nis one of our most populous metropolitan areas--certainly in Texas--in \nthe country. Can you imagine what kind of carnage two bombs going off \nat shopping malls could wreak? According to reports, this individual \nwas communicating with another man, also born in Iraq, who entered the \nUnited States in 2012 as a refugee and who had ties to terrorist groups \nand fought twice in Syria and allegedly was trying to go back to Syria \nto fight alongside Islamic militants. This individual was communicating \nwith another person with terrorist ties, and it certainly should raise \nall of our suspicion and concern.\n  Both of those men were refugees from Iraq. That doesn't mean the \nrefugee program should be dismantled or abandoned entirely. What it \nshould tell us is that we better be darned sure that whoever comes in \nthrough the refugee system has been adequately vetted to protect \ninnocent potential victims here in the United States. Fortunately, in \nthis instance, our law enforcement officers acted effectively and \nquickly to prevent a tragedy, but they can't be right 100 percent of \nthe time. If they are right only 99 percent of the time and innocent \npeople are hurt or killed, if we don't do everything in our power to \nstop it, then I think we are partially responsible. This is not a \ntheoretical problem, and Congress has the opportunity to act to try to \nenhance public safety. So knowing all of this, it is baffling to hear \nthe discussion among our Democratic colleagues that they may not even \nallow us to get on the bill this afternoon.\n\n  I have seen some news reports suggesting that the Democratic leader \nis saying: Well, if there is some sort of an amendment process that \ncould be agreed to, then maybe they would allow us to do that. I would \nencourage those discussions to go forward, but we shouldn't just say: \nWell, you get three or four amendments on your side and we get four or \nfive on our side. We ought to invite and welcome all constructive \nlegislation to make this as good as it can be. We don't need a backroom \ndeal to do that. We need to bring it to the floor and allow an open \namendment process under the rules of the Senate.\n  This is a debate worth having, and this is one our constituents \ndeserve to hear. I hope the latest news reports are some reason for \nencouragement that our Democratic colleagues are going to allow us to \nget on the legislation. Again, this is not a partisan issue--or it \nshouldn't be.\n  Last fall several Obama administration officials testified about \ntheir concerns about radicalized individuals and what threat they could \npose, as a refugee, if they gain entry into the United States. Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Jeh Johnson testified before the Senate and House \nHomeland Security Committees and said: ``I am concerned that we do the \nproper security vetting for refugees we bring into the country.'' I \nagree with him. That is what this legislation addresses.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. He went on to say: ``It is true that we are not going to \nknow a whole lot of the Syrians that come forth in this process, just \ngiven the nature of the situation.'' That is understandable. Syria has \nbeen engaged in a civil war over the last few years, and it is hard to \nimagine that we know a lot about those who want to come here as \nrefugees. It doesn't mean they shouldn't come here, but we do need to \nenhance the security screening and make sure we are confident that the \nones who do come will not be a threat to the public.\n  The Director of the FBI also shared his concerns by saying: ``We see \na risk there.'' So if you have the FBI Director and the Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security saying there are risks and concerns \nabout refugees coming from Syria to the United States, I would say we \nought to listen to them.\n  I hope our colleagues across the aisle will reconsider their \npurported plans to block this legislation. We vote on it at 2:30 p.m., \nso there is plenty of time to talk more about it and have discussions \nabout how there is maybe a path forward. If, in fact, there is \nultimately a filibuster and our friends across the aisle decide to \nblock the American SAFE Act--and, again, I hope they don't do that--I \ndon't think we are doing our job or doing everything in our power to \nenhance the public safety.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the year was 1939, the Nazis were in \ncontrol of Germany, and Kristallnacht had occurred. It was the night of \nbroken glass. It was the night when the Nazi storm troopers literally \ninvaded the shops and homes of the Jewish citizens who were living in \nGermany. They harassed, beat, and killed them. It was pretty clear \nwhere this was headed.\n  The Nazis had targeted Jewish people and those Jewish people--\ninnocent people--were going to be their victims.\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nSome of them decided the only place to go was to leave Germany and to \ncome to the United States of America. They boarded a ship called the SS \nSt. Louis and set sail for the United States. First, they arrived in \nHavana, Cuba, seeking refuge to escape the Nazis. The Cubans turned \nthem away. They next came to Miami, FL, and asked the United States of \nAmerica if these 900 innocent Jewish citizens of Germany could seek \nrefuge and become refugees in the United States. They were turned away. \nWith no other alternative, they went back to Germany.\n  The Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, kept track of what happened \nto those passengers on the SS St. Louis--those people seeking refuge in \nthe United States. At least one-third of them died in the Holocaust, \nkilled by the Nazis. At that time, Senator Robert Wagner of New York \ncame to the floor and asked: Couldn't we--at least as a nation--agree \nto allow 10,000 Jewish children to come to safety in the United States \nto escape the Nazis in Germany? His efforts were stopped and defeated. \nEven these children who would be Jewish victims of Nazi oppression were \nrejected by the U.S. Senate. It was a sad moment in the history of this \nChamber and a sad moment in the history of the United States.\n  After the war, we reflected on what had happened. We realized that \nthis great, strong, and caring Nation had made a serious mistake. \nInnocent people had died because we rejected these Jewish refugees from \nGermany. Therefore, after World War II, the United States decided to \ntake a different approach and show leadership to the world when it came \nto accepting refugees, and since then we have. There have been \nexceptions, but we have said that our country is open--as most \ncivilized countries on Earth are open--to those who face oppression, \nsuffering, death, and are in need of safety. We have established a \nprocess for this, and it isn't easy. Each year it becomes more and more \ndifficult and more and more challenging.\n  If you are a refugee wanting to come to the United States, be \nprepared. It will take at least 1 year of investigation--and sometimes \nup to 4 years of an investigation--before you might be allowed to come \nto this country. We go through background checks, fingerprints, \nbiometric measurements, and photographs. It is a lengthy, frustrating, \nand difficult process. For people who come to our shores from foreign \ncountries, there is no higher standard than the standard we apply to \nthose who seek refugee status. Each year about 70,000 refugees are \naccepted in the United States. There are many more who want that \nopportunity, but only 70,000 can clear this process.\n  We come to this debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate aware of what \nhas happened in Syria. Over the course of the last few years, the war \nthat has raged in Syria has claimed over 200,000 lives. Half of Syria's \n23 million people have been forced out of their homes--half of them.\n  I have a friend in Chicago. He is an extraordinary man. His name is \nDr. Mohammed Sahloul. He is a well-respected practicing doctor. He came \nto the United States as an immigrant and now has an established medical \npractice. His family is from Syria--the Bahamut section of Syria. \nBecause he feels so strongly about the war that is killing these \ninnocent people in Syria, Dr. Mohammed Sahloul literally risks his life \nevery few months to go to Syria and treat the victims of that war and \nviolence. His wife Suzanne Sahloul works with the Syrian refugees who \ncome to Chicago. The two of them have made a personal commitment to \nSyria, which was the birthplace of their parents. Dr. Sahloul returns \nfrom his visits to Syria and asks to meet me regularly, and I always \nsay yes. As painful as it is, I sit there, as I did yesterday in a \nrestaurant in downtown Chicago, as Dr. Sahloul shows me the photos on \nhis iPad, one after the other, of the children he treated in Syria. \nThese children are the victims of barrel bombs by President Assad and \nnow of Russian bombing.\n  He goes to communities where people are literally starving to death--\nstarving to death in the year 2016--in Syria. He shows me their \nemaciated bodies until I turn away and can't look at it anymore.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate who follow this debate and know \nwhat we are voting on--the Syrian crisis we face today, I would argue, \nis the most serious humanitarian crisis of our time. What is happening \nto these people is unimaginable.\n  A few months ago I joined several of my colleagues and we went to an \nisland in Greece called Lesbos. This is the stopping point for the \nrefugees. Once the Syrian refugees have gone through Turkey, they cross \na span of 8 to 10 miles of the Aegean Sea in plastic rafts. They put \nmore passengers in those rafts than should be in there because the \nsmugglers are getting paid 1,000 to 2,000 euros, or about $2,000-plus, \nfor each of the refugees they can cram into these boats. They push them \noff from the shore in Turkey and point them toward the island of \nLesbos. There are babies in those boats. The passengers wear \nlifejackets, which everyone is familiar with, but what do the babies \nwear? You can't put a baby in a lifejacket. Well, I saw what they wore. \nMany of them were wearing plastic water wings, the kind we put on our \nlittle kids when we put them in wading pools, and off they go into the \nAegean Sea. Some of them don't make it. Some of them drown and die.\n  What would cause a family to pick up and risk their lives and spend \n$2,000 per person to take this deadly journey? It is because they are \ndesperate and need a place to be safe. It is that basic.\n  So the President has said the United States will accept some of these \nrefugees. Ten thousand is the number he said. Of course, each one of \nthem has to go through a lengthy background check and will be asked all \nthese important questions before they are allowed to come into our \ncountry--10,000. We know there are millions displaced and we know that \nthat number continues to grow. Isn't it ironic that 10,000--the same \nnumber Senator Wagner of New York asked for when it came to Jewish \nchildren in Germany--is the same number the President has asked for \nwhen it comes to Syrian refugees.\n  Sadly for these refugees, and many others, they couldn't have picked \na worse time to come to the United States of America because, frankly, \nwe are engaged in a Presidential campaign where many strong statements \nhave been made about these Syrian refugees. It is hard for me to think \nabout what I saw on the island of Lesbos--these families with \nchildren--and to square that with the descriptions I have heard from \nthose who have called them terrorists in training. It couldn't be \nfurther from the truth.\n  So this afternoon, at 2:30 p.m. on the Senate floor, we will be asked \nto vote on a measure relative to the Syrian refugees. Let's call it for \nwhat it is. This is an effort to stop any Syrian refugee from coming to \nthe United States regardless of whether it is a mother and a child \nbecause what it says is that before they can come to the United States, \nyou have to have the personal signature and personal certification of \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, and the Director of the Bureau of National \nIntelligence. It is physically impossible to ask the director of the \nFBI, who has the responsibility of monitoring FBI activities all across \nthe Nation and around the world, to literally sit down and sign 100 \npersonal certifications a day which would bring us to this goal.\n  This legislation is not designed to make us safer. It is designed to \nstop Syrian refugees from coming to the United States. I know we are \nliving in a dangerous time in this world. I want us to do everything \nthoughtfully and sensibly and everything possible to protect the \nAmerican people from any possibility of terrorism.\n\n  I still remember well when I was a Member of this body on September \n11, 2001, and what America endured. I have not forgotten. I read, as \nall of us do, about terrorism in the United States and what it does to \ninnocent people in San Bernardino and in many other places. But to \nexclude Syrian and Iraqi refugees and to say that we are not going to \nallow any of them to come in or put them through a standard of proof \nthat we know makes it next to impossible is unfair and inconsistent \nwith the values of the United States.\n  I made a point of meeting these Syrian refugees and their families \nwho have made it here. I have invited my Governor in my State of \nIllinois and my colleagues to do the same: Get beyond the screaming \nrhetoric of the\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\nPresidential campaign and sit down and listen to their stories. They \nwill realize that these are people who are desperate, who are looking \nfor just an opportunity to be safe.\n  Yesterday, a number of them came to my office. Othman Al Ani, \noriginally from Baghdad in Iraq, arrived in the United States in the \nyear 2013. How long did it take him to clear the background check as a \nrefugee? Four years--it took 4 years. He now works as a caseworker for \nthe Iraqi Mutual Aid Society.\n  I met Wadad Elaly and her mother, Mrs. Elaly. In 2012, Wadad's father \nwas killed by a sniper as he came home from work in Syria. The family \nmoved out of the city for fear they would be the next victims. They \nwent to Damascus, and then they waited, literally for over a year and a \nhalf, to go through the clearance.\n  Wadad is now a freshman in high school in the city of Chicago. She is \na sweet, young girl who has seen more tragedy in her life than any of \nus would ever want to see. She and her mom want to make a life here, \nand she knows it is up to her to get a good education to make sure she \ncan make that happen.\n  Mariela Shaker--an incredible story of a young girl who was growing \nup in the Homs section of Syria, whose parents were afraid that she was \ngoing to die from a bombing that was taking place. She applied and was \naccepted to go to a downstate college in Illinois, Monmouth College. \nShe is a master violinist, a prodigy. She completed her degree there \nand now is at DePaul University working on a master's degree in music--\nan amazing young woman. A terrorist? No, just a young women looking for \nsafety and a future.\n  The stories go on and on. When I hear the statements made on the \nfloor about potential terrorists, I think to myself: They haven't met \nthese families, they haven't heard their stories, and if they did, they \nmight reconsider.\n  I am opposed to this bill that came over from the House. I think this \npersonal certification by the head of the FBI, certifying every single \nperson, and a certification by the Director of National Intelligence \nand the Secretary of Homeland Security are just being put in the path \nof these people to slow them down and stop them again and again and \nagain.\n  What we have said, not out of compassion but out of commonsense, is \nlet's address the things that will make America safer. Instead of \nzeroing in on a handful of Syrian refugees who are no threat to the \nUnited States, let's look to those things that actually are a threat. \nLet me give an example. Do my colleagues believe that a person whose \nname is on the no-fly list, the terrorist suspect list, should be \nallowed to buy a firearm?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Do my colleagues believe that a person who is on the \nterrorist watch list should be allowed to buy firearms in the United \nStates? Do my colleagues believe that a person on the terrorist watch \nlist should be allowed to buy explosives in the United States? How \nabout dirty bomb components? I don't think there is any question about \nit. The answer the vast majority of Americans would give is no. That is \none of our amendments.\n  Do my colleagues think we should put more resources into protecting \nthe United States through the Department of Homeland Security and \nthrough law enforcement, even local law enforcement, and the FBI? I \nthink so. That is another one of our amendments.\n  A third amendment is going to change the effort and zero in on what \nwe consider to be gaps in the law that allow the possibility of foreign \ntravelers to come to the United States and engage in violence and \nterrorism.\n  The fourth one is pretty controversial, but I think we need a vote in \nthe Senate. There has been a proposal by one Republican Presidential \ncandidate, for the first time in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, to exclude any immigrant of a specific religion, and that \nreligion, of course, is for those who are in adherence to the Muslim \nreligion. We should have a vote on that. I think it is important for us \nto be on the record. Those are the amendments we would like to offer.\n  We said to Senator McConnell: Bring up your Syrian refugee bill, if \nyou wish, and give us these four votes. If you will give us these four \nvotes--of course, you will want to offer some of your own amendments. \nBe our guest. But let's have a real debate about making America safe. \nLet's not just zero in on Syrian refugees. Let's zero in on ISIS, on \nterrorism, and on the real threat to the United States.\n  That is what we will decide between now and 2:30. Will Senator \nMcConnell, who has said over and over that he wants to open the Senate \nfloor to an amendment process, allow our votes on these measures? If he \nwill, we can engage in this debate. If he won't, then, frankly, there \nis going to be resistance to moving to this measure. I hope Senator \nMcConnell will join us and open this debate to a real sincere effort to \nstop the threat of terrorism in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \njoin me in passing the House bill to improve the Syrian refugee \nresettlement program and take at least a first really important step \ntoward protecting Americans here at home with regard to this refugee \nand homeland security question. Frankly, I think we should be going \nfurther, but given the gravity of the issue and the urgent need to \naddress stated and documented shortfalls within the refugee program, I \nsupport passage of this bill as a start.\n  We can't just forget--ignore--the facts, and the fact is that those \nresponsible, for instance, for the tragic attacks in Paris just a few \nshort months ago took advantage of the influx of Syrian refugees into \nFrance, and at least one of them got in that way. If that isn't \ndisturbing enough, we must also remember the fact that the majority of \nthe 9/11 attackers were granted admission to the United States on \ntemporary immigration status. There were holes and problems in that \nprogram. Clearly, we need to update and reform the current systems in \nplace, and I assure my colleagues that I won't stop pressing for \ncomplete and adequate safeguards as the President continues to invite \nadditional refugees onto American soil.\n  Voting in favor of the SAFE Act brings us one step closer to \nimproving the security of our Nation. It would be a mistake to retreat \nto some sort of pre-9/11 posture or mindset. Eleven years ago, the ``9/\n11 Commission Report'' wrote that many of the vetting programs were \n``dysfunctional.'' They remain dysfunctional in far too many cases, and \nI am not willing to take on and continue the risk of that dysfunction. \nWe need reforms. We need a far higher standard of safety and \ncoordination.\n  Now, again, these are facts we need to look at. We have seen examples \nof the refugee situation and other situations directly impacting and \nthreatening our security. What am I talking about?\n  Fact No. 1: On December 2 of last year, husband and wife Syed Farook \nand Tashfeen Malik attacked the Inland Regional Center in San \nBernardino, and their coordinated attack inspired by ISIS caused the \ndeaths of 14 people, and they wounded 21 others. As of now, it appears \nto be the most deadly terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.\n  Now, the wife, Tashfeen Malik, was not a U.S. citizen and was, in \nfact, in the United States on a visa related to her husband. \nParticularly troubling is the fact that the government didn't verify \nher address in Pakistan during the visa application process. There were \nreports that a full vetting was not completed, including checking for \nother possible signs that she had been radicalized or was a terrorist \noperative.\n  Fact No. 2: A recent FBI joint intelligence bulletin has confirmed \nthat individuals resettled in the United States as refugees have \nalready been arrested for willfully providing material support and \nresources to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. That is \ndocumented by an FBI report. Clearly, this program is a vulnerability.\n  Fact No. 3: The National Counterterrorism Center has identified \nindividuals with ties to terrorists in Syria who attempted to enter the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\nStates through the refugee program. Again, it has been verified that \nthis is an entry point for possible terrorists.\n  Fact No. 4: The horrible and coordinated assault in Paris last fall, \nin the words of President Francois Hollande of France, was ``planned in \nSyria, organized in Belgium, perpetrated on our soil with French \ncomplicity.'' And a fact related to that is that at least one of those \nterrorists got in through the refugee resettlement program there.\n  Fact No. 5: FBI Director James Comey has testified that the Federal \nGovernment doesn't have the ability to properly and fully vet 10,000 or \nmore Syrian refugees. Recently, during a hearing before the House \nCommittee on Homeland Security, he stated:\n\n       We can only query against that which we have collected. And \n     so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in \n     a way that would get their identity or their interest \n     reflected in our database, we can query our database until \n     the cows come home, but there will be nothing to show up \n     because we have no record of them.\n\n  Fact No. 6: The ``Reflections on the Tenth Anniversary of the 9/11 \nCommission Report,'' released in 2014, states that ``it is unclear \nwhether the United States and its allies have sufficient resources in \nplace to monitor foreign fighters' activities in Syria (and neighboring \nIraq) and to track their travel back to their home countries.''\n  Those are documented facts, which make perfectly clear what common \nsense should suggest. This refugee resettlement program is a \nvulnerability, and we need far better security to protect our homeland.\n  To do this, I have introduced a very strong bill to require a \nsuspension of admissions of Syrian refugees until the Obama \nadministration properly evaluates the protocols and procedures it has \nin place to relocate them here and to certify not just in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of State but also \nwith intelligence and law enforcement agencies that these procedures \nare adequate. My bill has seven cosponsors. I plan to continue to move \nit, hopefully, through an amendment process related to this bill so we \ncan make sure we have proper, adequate reforms in place.\n  So that is today's vote in simple, straightforward terms in terms of \nthe real danger. We can't properly vet all of these refugees right now. \nThis is documented. This is from the experts. We need to put proper \nmeasures in place before we continue accepting this flood of refugees. \nWe need to protect American families, secure our borders, and keep out \nall terrorists. Voting for the SAFE Act and voting to put it on the \nfloor and engaging in this debate is an important first step in doing \nthat. For that reason, I urge a positive vote to put this important \nmeasure on the floor and to pass it.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, last week I was proud to host Hassan \nJabber as my guest at the State of the Union Address. He is the \ndirector of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, \nfounded in 1971 in Dearborn, MI. ACCESS is the largest Arab American \nhuman services nonprofit in the United States, providing health and \nwellness, education, employment, and youth services in its local \ncommunities, including support for refugees settling in America.\n  Hassan is a community leader and just one example of the many \nindividuals who make up Michigan's vibrant Arab American community, \nincluding some of the most patriotic people I know whose contributions \nto our culture and economy are invaluable.\n  That is why I am so concerned about the legislation we will be \ndebating later today, which would impose significant barriers on our \nefforts to assist refugees fleeing violence and persecution in Iraq and \nSyria. I am a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee. Last November we held a hearing on refugee \nresettlement. We heard about the strict security checks involved in the \nRefugee Admissions Program, which could take 18 to 24 months.\n  The Refugee Admissions Program subjects refugees to the highest level \nof security checks of any category of traveler coming into the United \nStates. They are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the \nFBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of \nDefense, as well as other agencies. Refugees considered for \nresettlement to the United States are subjected to biometric and \nbiographic checks, as well as a lengthy in-person interview, all of \nwhich are conducted while the refugees are overseas, outside of the \nUnited States. Refugees are even required to repay loans to the \nInternational Organization for Migration to cover the cost of \ntransportation and medical screening.\n  At the same hearing last November, we also heard how the Refugee \nAdmissions Program prioritizes the most vulnerable refugees, including \nwidows with children, victims of torture and trauma, persecuted \nreligious minorities, and those who face death threats if they return \nhome. These cases are our country's top priority for resettlement. I \nsaw this for myself at the end of last year when I had an opportunity \nto travel to the Middle East with Senator Murphy and meet members of \nthis vulnerable population. Visiting the Zaatari Refugee Camp in \nJordan, I saw the scale of the crisis that the world faces.\n  Talking to just some of the over 80,000 refugees at that camp, who \nare only a small fraction of the 11.6 million people who have been \ndisplaced from their homes over the past 4\\1/2\\ years during the brutal \ncivil war in Syria, it was clear that none of those refugees were there \nby choice. Before anything else, they just wanted to return home.\n  In the end, however, returning home is not something that is going to \nhappen. They are not going to be able to return to the life they had \nbefore. They certainly did not want to have the very dangerous journey \nto escape violence and security by going far away. Unfortunately, the \npossibility of their safe return is unlikely at any time in the near \nfuture. They struggle to survive every day, and they persevere. Many \nhave been vetted by the United Nations as people who are qualified to \nresettle as refugees in countries like ours because they simply can't \nreturn home.\n  The refugees I met are struggling to live on 50 cents a day to buy \nfood and have only one propane bottle to provide cooking fuel for an \nentire month. Unfortunately, most of that aid is slated to end in the \nnext couple of months. The people in the camps live on the edge of \nhaving nothing, and they rely on humanitarian aid to get by on a day-\nto-day basis. They are thankful, but in the end they are living in \nlimbo, waiting and hoping for an interview with a U.S. official.\n  Today, at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nhearing we focused on ISIS's goals and ideology. We heard from experts \nthat the United States should continue to welcome refugees. Proposals \nto block refugees based on their religious beliefs plays into the \nnarrative that the United States and Muslims across the globe are in \ndirect conflict. We heard that those who have left ISIS territory \ndescribe it as ``a living hell,'' and if we do not accept refugees, it \nharms our standing in the world and actually will weaken our national \nsecurity.\n  The safety and security of the American people is always my top \npriority, but policies which alienate and divide, targeted at victims \nof terror and violence, do not support that mission. I am hopeful that \nthis body will focus our efforts on the very real threat posed by \nterrorism and extremism, not on imposing unnecessary barriers that will \nprevent us from assisting the victims fleeing violence. I hope that we \ncan stay true to the American values that make our country great.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S109-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S109-S111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OUR ``WE THE PEOPLE'' DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today to kick off a series of\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\nspeeches where I will come to the floor on a regular basis to address \nissues affecting Americans and propose ways to solve the challenges we \nface. These speeches will cover a variety of topics, but they will all \nlink back to the fundamental theme of our ``we the people'' democracy.\n  In the summer of 1787, a group came together of patriots, farmers, \nand scholars. They gathered in Philadelphia, and after 4 months of \nfierce debate and enduring compromise, they agreed to a set of ideas \nand a system of governance. They signed their names to a document, our \nConstitution, which has guided our Nation's progress for over two \ncenturies. They began that Constitution, that key document, with three \nsimple words on parchment--``we the people''--and with that they \nlaunched our experience in democratic governance.\n  The Founders wrote this phrase in beautiful script, 10 times the size \nof the rest of the document, as if to say this is what it is all about, \nthis is what America will be about--governance for ``we the people.''\n  They did not say at the start of this document ``we the titans of \nindustry.'' They did not say ``we the titans of commerce.'' They did \nnot say ``we the rich and powerful.'' They said ``we the people.'' As \nPresident Lincoln summarized, the genius of our governance is that it \nis of the people, by the people, and for the people.\n  With this guiding light America has been a great nation. Because of \nour ``we the people'' principle, we insisted on a better, fairer, and \nfreer nation for all citizens--because we the people demanded that all \nAmericans deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness, \nbecause we the people never stopped reaching for greater prosperity and \ngrowth to the benefit of all.\n  In order to address the challenges of our times, we must recapture \nthis ``we the people'' spirit. We must set aside politics in favor of \nprogress. We must reform a broken system that favors the interests of \nthe wealthy and well-connected over the interests of the American \npeople. That is the framework, the theme that my regular floor speeches \nwill be about.\n  In this Senate Chamber our priority should be to build an economy and \na government that works for working people, and, as Hubert Humphrey \nargued, a government that delivers for those ``in the dawn of life . . \n. in the twilight of life . . . and those in the shadows of life.''\n  We all know that our success is not measured by a soaring stock \nmarket. America is succeeding when a mom can earn enough not to worry \nabout where her kids' next meal is coming from; when schools nurture \nthe mind, the character, and the creative spirit of every child; when \ncollege is affordable to every family; when each individual in our \nNation has peace of mind through access to quality and affordable \nhealth care; when no American who works full time lives in poverty; and \nwhen our economy creates good-paying jobs for American workers here in \nAmerica rather than shipping those jobs overseas. To achieve these ends \nwe have a lot of work to do.\n  We had after World War II three golden decades from 1945 to 1975. The \nmiddle class gained enormously in size and prosperity. During that \nperiod the bottom 90 percent received approximately 70 percent of all \nincome growth. From 1975 until now, 2015, we have had four decades in \nwhich working Americans' experience has been flat or declining. What a \ndifference that is from the three golden decades where workers fully \nshared in the prosperity they helped to create--the last four decades \nwhen they have not shared and gained over those decades. They received \nclose to zero percent of all income growth. To put it differently, 100 \npercent of the growth went to the top 10 percent of Americans. We know \nthat our families and our economy will never reach their full potential \nif growth benefits only those at the very top, if the growth is at best \ntrickled down, coming from the top down, and not from the middle out.\n\n  So let's commit to changing the direction we are on, to recreating an \neconomy more similar to those three golden decades after 1945, after \nthe end of World War II, putting people back to work rebuilding \nAmerica's roads and crumbling bridges, raising the minimum wage so that \nanyone who works hard can make ends meet, and keeping a cop on the beat \nto block predatory schemes preying on the middle class.\n  We have a lot to do to tackle the greatest challenge facing human \ncivilization: saving our planet from the ravages of climate change. \nToday it was announced, as anticipated, that the final results are in \nand 2015 is the warmest year on record. This warmth and the changing \nweather is having profound consequences on our forestry, on our \nfarming, and on our fishing. All of these are manifested in my home \nState of Oregon and virtually every State represented in this Chamber.\n  We have to have a ``we the people'' movement to take on the oil and \nthe coal billionaires, cut carbon pollution, and pivot rapidly to a \nclean energy economy. We certainly have a lot of work to do to make \nsure that folks who work hard all their lives can achieve a dignified \nand secure retirement as we watch the pensions in the private workplace \nmelt away, slipping through our hands. We must set our children up for \nsuccess and expand the promise of education, ensuring that our schools \nmeet the demands of a new age and that all students can attend college \nwithout the fear of crushing debt.\n  To achieve these things through legislation is certainly possible. We \ncan envision the pathway for each and every one of these objectives, \nbut we cannot do it if this Chamber is essentially owned by the titans \nof commerce and industry. That, unfortunately, is what happened in 1976 \nwhen the Supreme Court under Buckley v. Valeo said that individuals can \nspend unlimited sums in the public marketplace and can do so even if \nthey are drowning out the voices of the rest of America. Certainly a \nsituation in which the 1 percent can drown out the voices of the 99 \npercent is not a ``we the people'' democracy; it is the opposite. It is \na ``we the titans'' democracy. It is decisions made by and for the very \nbest off, not decisions by and for the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This misguided 1976 decision sits right at that pivot point between \nthe three golden decades from 1945 to 1975 and the last four decades of \nfailed economic policy with workers' outcomes being flat or declining. \nThis decision was doubled down on the Supreme Court just a few years \nago in the Citizens United decision, which said that not only \nindividuals but corporations would be treated the same. They could use \ntheir combined assets even if they had never disclosed to the owners of \nthe corporation, the stockholders, how they intended to spend funds, \nputting billions of dollars in play with a few people sitting in a \nboardroom, completely shielded from any public witness.\n  That is why we have to change campaign finance as a way to reclaim \nour ``we the people'' democracy, to reclaim our Constitution, to fend \noff the titans who are insisting on grabbing everything for the few and \nnot for the benefit of the public, the 90 percent.\n  We have to continue to look for ways to restore hope for our working \nfamilies and ensure opportunity for each, to protect the middle class, \nto empower the middle class against forces that are threatening to \noverwhelm them, and to build an economy where everyone is sharing in \nthe economic prosperity they are helping to create.\n  The bottom line is that we have to make a choice about the kind of \ncountry we want to live in. I don't choose a country in which the rules \nare made by and for the very few at the top. I choose a country \nembedded in the first three words of our Constitution, where decisions \nare made by and for the people of our Nation. I choose a country that \nhonors these Founding principles, that comes together to tackle the big \nchallenges, that works not for the 1 percent or the 10 percent but for \n100 percent of Americans. Let us reclaim our ``we the people'' \ndemocracy, our ``we the people'' vision, and set our Nation back on \ntrack.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the fear and \nxenophobia being peddled by some Republican candidates for President is \nnow being given time on the Senate floor.\n  Instead of solving the real problems facing Americans--like the \nstudent debt crisis or our need for energy independence--or responding \nto real threats to our national security--like our failure to track \nvisa overstays or prevent terrorists from buying guns--today we are \ndebating a strawman inspired by Donald Trump's baseless rhetoric.\n  The bill the Republican leader is asking us to consider will not make \nAmerica safer. In fact, it is a dangerous distraction that plays into \nthe hands of the ISIS propaganda machine.\n  Instead of demonizing refugees, who are the most thoroughly screened \ngroup of people who enter the United States, we should take up and pass \nthe Defeat ISIS and Protect and Secure the United States Act of 2015. \nThat bill offers a comprehensive strategy to counter ISIS propaganda \nand violent extremism in the United States and abroad. It offers real \nsolutions that will keep us safe rather than scapegoating refugees who \nare fleeing war and torture.\n  In contrast, the bill we are asked to consider has put forward fresh \nfodder for the false narrative that we are at war with Islam.\n  I will oppose this House bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 6 months ago, world powers reached an \nagreement to constrain Iran's nuclear program and to give us a path \nforward toward constraining Iran's nuclear ambitions. While the \ninternational community has taken some positive steps to implement this \nagreement and to limit Iran's nuclear program and while Iran has \nrecently taken positive steps to observe and to implement this \nagreement, we must do much more to strictly enforce this deal and \naggressively push back on Iran's bad behavior outside the deal's \nparameters. If we don't, this nuclear agreement may not survive into \nnext year.\n  This past weekend was an eventful one for U.S. foreign policy and, in \nparticular, for U.S. policy toward Iran. Saturday marked implementation \nday of this nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction, or JCPOA.\n  Implementation day is important because it means that the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, has certified that \nIran has completed a whole series of tasks required as part of the \nnuclear agreement. The four most important of those tasks are these:\n  First, it has shipped 12 tons of enriched uranium--nearly its entire \nstockpile, which took Iran a decade to amass--out of the country to a \nsecure facility supervised by the IAEA around the clock.\n  Second, it means Iran has reduced the number of its functioning \ncentrifuges--centrifuges it uses to enrich uranium--by nearly two-\nthirds, or from roughly 19,000 to a little more than 6,000, and it has \naccepted long-term limits on developing, testing, and deploying new \ncentrifuges.\n  Third, it means that Iran has presented the IAEA with unprecedented \n24/7 access to monitor all of its nuclear-related facilities. That is \nnot only enrichment facilities. That is uranium mines, uranium mills, \nand centrifuge production facilities--every known and declared site \nwithin Iran connected to its nuclear program. This level of access far \nexceeds previous IAEA authorities in countries suspected of trying to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon.\n  Fourth--and to me, in ways most importantly--Iran has filled the core \nof its Arak heavy water reactor, pictured here, with concrete, \npermanently disabling the most likely short-term path that Iran had to \nproducing weapons-grade plutonium. Had Iran proceeded and had Iran been \nable to produce significant quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, our \nability to intervene and to prevent their march toward a nuclear weapon \nwould have been significantly harder.\n  Plutonium is one of the most lethal toxic substances known to man, \nand any attack on a heavy water reactor producing plutonium would have \nhad horrible consequences, not just in Iran but throughout the entire \nregion. So blocking Iran's short-term pathway through uranium \nenrichment and through plutonium enrichment is a significant step \nforward and does reflect significant restraints on Iran's nuclear \nweapons program.\n  As a result of the conditions on this deal that I just referenced, \nthe time it would take Tehran to break out and to dash toward a nuclear \nweapon, to amass all of the fissile material needed for a bomb has been \nextended significantly from just 2 months to 3 months to a year or \nmore. But these positive developments come with substantial risks, \nprincipally among them is the tens of billions of dollars in sanctions \nrelief that Iran will now receive for complying with the terms of the \ndeal. Tens of billions of dollars of Iranian assets, which have long \nbeen frozen in bank accounts around the world through an American-led \ninternational sanctions effort will now be released.\n  That is why America and our international partners must continue to \naggressively enforce the terms of the deal and to make sure that Iran \nremains in compliance with every aspect of the JCPOA. Our work in this \narea is more urgent and more difficult than it has been at any point \nbefore. We can be confident that in the coming months and years the \nIranians will test the boundaries of the deal and will probe our every \nresponse. Indeed, they already have.\n  If we fail to respond more swiftly and more vigorously to these \nIranian provocations, Iran will nibble away at the deal's restrictions \nand gradually undermine the international coalition that put it \ntogether. Every minor violation that we permit, every violation that we \ntolerate damages our credibility and gives Iran tacit permission to \ncontinue its breaches of the agreement.\n  Given this stark, difficult reality, our efforts to deter Iranian \naggression must not be limited to just enforcing the nuclear deal, or \nthe JCPOA. Rather, our efforts must be part of a coherent, unified \nregional strategy to contain Iran and to push back on its bad behavior \nin the Middle East, a task made even more difficult because of its \nnewfound access to assets previously frozen. That comprehensive effort \nto counter and contain Iran must include a willingness to take \nunilateral action by imposing new sanctions on Iran for destabilizing \nactions, both inside and outside the parameters of the nuclear \nagreement.\n  That brings me to the second important development of this past \nweekend--the designation of additional sanctions to punish Iran for its \nballistic missile tests. Last fall, in clear violation of the United \nNations Security Council Resolution 1929, Iran conducted two ballistic \nmissile tests: one on October 10 and one on November 21. Since then, I \nand many of my colleagues have been calling on the Obama administration \nto punish Iran for these disruptive, dangerous, and blatantly illegal \nactions. Over the weekend, the administration took action by \ndesignating for sanctions 11 additional individuals and business \nentities involved in supporting Iran's ballistic missile program. These \nsanctions follow a series of steps previously taken by the Treasury \nDepartment last fall to sanction other Iranians, other Iranian-linked \nindividuals and organizations for a litany of other dangerous and \nillegal activities: supporting Hezbollah officials and agents who \nthreaten our vital ally, Israel; supplying financial and material aid \nto the Houthi rebels in Yemen; providing military support for the \nmurderous Assad regime in Syria; and the list goes on. It is important \nfor all of us, on a bipartisan basis, to remind our allies throughout \nthe world that American-led sanctions against Iran--for its human \nrights violations, for its ballistic missile program, for its support \nof terrorism--remain in effect and will be vigorously enforced.\n\n  From conducting these missile tests to supporting terrorism, to \ncontinuing to deny the very existence of some basic human rights, Iran \nhas shown time and again it will continue to flout international rules \nand values. The United States must continue to maintain its unilateral \nsanctions in these areas, and we must not hesitate to use these \nauthorities--not just to punish Iran for its immediate bad behavior but \nto send a clear signal to our allies in the region, throughout the \nworld, and to Tehran that we are serious about holding Iran \naccountable.\n  Of course, implementation day and the imposition of sanctions and \nsanction designations for Iran's illegal ballistic missile tests \nweren't the only significant developments of the new year. We also \nlearned this weekend that America would soon be able to welcome home \nfive innocent Americans long held unlawfully by Iran. These Americans \nshould never have been held in the first place and their release was \nlong overdue. The negotiations to release these five Americans occurred \noutside the parameters of the JCPOA.\n  While we are grateful for their safe return, this release also raises \nsome serious questions. We still don't know the status of retired FBI \nagent Robert Levinson or his whereabouts. We don't know the status of \nSiamak Namazi, an Iranian-American energy industry executive arrested \nin October. It is my hope there are equally ceaseless efforts by the \nadministration to bring them home.\n  We have to ask: What did we give up? What were the terms of the \nagreement?\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nHow did we make possible this release? A key part that is public is \nthat while none of the 7 Iranians released were convicted of violence, \nthey were nonetheless convicted of criminal acts, and 14 Iranians who \nmay have been convicted had the charges against them dropped. The \nquestion we are going to have to pursue is, What precedent did these \nprisoner swaps set for our future interactions with the Iranian regime? \nIt is my hope that we are at the end of prisoner deals with the Iranian \nregime.\n  We must remember, though, that despite the limits imposed by the \nJCPOA, Iran continues to destabilize the Middle East and undermine \nAmerica's goals for the region. Iran's behavior since the JCPOA was \nsigned has made it crystal clear that Iran is neither America's friend \nnor ally. We must remain suspicious and distrustful of the Iranian \nregime.\n  In addition to its ballistic missile test I referenced before, the \nIranian Revolutionary Guard has conducted dangerous military operations \nnear U.S. ships, most recently threatening the safety of American \nsailors by conducting a live-fire exercise barely a mile from the \naircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman.\n  Iran also detained American sailors in the Arabian Gulf last week, \nand it did not treat them in a manner consistent with naval forces \nrendering assistance at sea. While I am pleased our sailors were \nreleased safely, Iran did use the images of those sailors for \npropaganda purposes in an attempt to send a signal to the world about \nits capacity to sow chaos in the region. We must not turn a blind eye \nto provocations of Iran in the open seas of the Persian Gulf and \nthroughout the region. I call on the administration and on my \ncolleagues to support significantly increased efforts at maritime \ninterdictions in the gulf and throughout the broader region. We should \nconduct more joint military exercises with our valued allies and \npartners in the region to make it clear to Iran that we will continue \nto pursue our interests, and we will counter Iran's maligned \nactivities. Again, to remain distrustful of Iran and push back on the \nregional ambitions I think is the only path toward a safer, stronger \nMiddle East and an American presence as one of its regional leaders.\n  No one should mistake Tehran's compliance with the terms of the \nnuclear agreement for a broader willingness to respect human rights and \nengage with the international community in the rules-based order that \nwe have helped lead since the Second World War. I have seen nothing to \nindicate that the regime in Tehran cares about the well-being of the \nIranian people, much less the opinion of the world community. In \nOctober, for example, two Iranian poets each received 10-year sentences \nand 99 lashes for kissing members of the opposite sex and shaking their \nhands. That same month an Iranian award-winning filmmaker was sentenced \nto 6 years in prison and 200 lashes on the charge of insulting \nsanctities. The filmmaker was making a documentary about an Iranian \nartist, based in Europe, who had been accused of blasphemy.\n  Nearly two-thirds of the 12,000 candidates who applied to run in next \nmonth's parliamentary elections recently withdrew or were disqualified \nby Iran's Guardian Council. Iran's Supreme Leader said: ``Americans \nhave set their eyes covetously on elections, but the great and vigilant \nnation of Iran will act contrary to our enemies' will, whether it be in \nelections or on other issues, and as before we will punch them in the \nmouth.'' These are not the actions or the statements of a state that \nrespects the rights of its people or seeks friendship with the United \nStates in the near future.\n  Just 2 weeks ago I returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, \nIsrael, and Austria. I am grateful to my colleague from New York, \nSenator Gillibrand, for organizing this trip, which included important \nmeetings with nuclear inspectors from the IAEA. We met with their \nleadership headquartered in Vienna and had meetings with Israeli Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu, Minister of Defense Ya'alon, and Turkish \nPresident Erdogan, as well as other vital regional leaders. The message \nmy colleagues and I heard from these leaders was simple, powerful, and \nclear: America must reassure our allies that we will not waver in our \ncommitment to push back on Iran, its nuclear program, and its \ndestabilizing actions in the region. Our partners, our allies--and \nIran--must know and believe through our words and our actions that we \nare serious about preserving the long-term stability of the Middle East \nand that Iran--a revolutionary regime--does not share our values or \nthat goal.\n  As part of this effort, we must reassure, reaffirm, and strengthen \nour support for our vital ally, Israel. As the administration \nnegotiates a new, long-term memorandum of understanding to provide \nIsrael with the security assistance it needs to protect itself in the \nmost dangerous neighborhood on Earth, we must insist that joint U.S. \nand Israeli strategic planning includes protection of Israel from \nthreats it faces from neighboring instability in Syria. We must not \nallow Israel to be attacked by Iranian proxies, such as Hezbollah and \nHamas. We must work closely with the Israelis to share intelligence and \nintercept any weapons shipments from Iran to its regional proxies.\n  If we fail to push back on Iran and enforce the terms of the nuclear \ndeal, not only will the agreement collapse, but our efforts to show the \nworld that diplomacy actually works will be dealt a dangerous blow as \nwell.\n  In the weeks and months to come, I call on the administration to do \nmore to push back on Iran, and I call on my colleagues--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--to come together, to be engaged, and to remain focused \non enforcing the terms of this nuclear agreement, on containing Iran, \nand on deterring their bad behavior, their support for terrorism, their \nsupport for human rights violations, and their relentless effort to \ndevelop and advance ballistic missile capability.\n  As I said before on this floor, the Iranian Government has long paid \nclose attention to everything America says and more closely to what \nAmerica does. Never has it been more true than today. Never has it been \nmore urgent than today. As the regime gains greater access to money and \nresources, we must not take our eye off of Iran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, throughout \nlast year's session I would come to the Senate floor every week and \ntalk about a waste of the week. That was in 2015. We did nearly 30 of \nthose in the 30 weeks that the Senate was in session, maybe skipping \none or two. It is 2016. We are in a new year, and I am back for the \n2016 version of ``Waste of the Week.''\n  The reason I am doing this is because I am trying to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues and the American people the fact that the \ngovernment is not spending their hard-earned tax dollars in the most \nefficient and effective way that they could. By highlighting these \nvarious uses of expenditures in Washington and abuses of that spending, \nwe alert them to the fact that there are significant savings that can \nbe made.\n  In 2015, we totaled up to nearly $130 billion of demonstrated \nexamples of waste, fraud, and abuse--money that was spent for no \npurpose whatsoever or for a purpose that certainly didn't qualify for \nthe use of taxpayer dollars and the abuse of that spending and the \nfraud that went along with it. This is just scratching the surface.\n  The Presiding Officer was very much a part of this and knows that \nsince 2010 there has been a significant effort, much of it a bipartisan \neffort, to try to deal with the long-range plunge into evermore \nspending and evermore debt that is plaguing our country, holding down \nour ability to grow as an economy, and will have long-term negative \nconsequences on our generation and particularly on future generations.\n  Whether it was Simpson-Bowles or Domenici-Rivlin or whether it was \nthe Gang of 12, the Committee of 6 or the Vitter committee, many \nefforts were made to try to work with the administration to address the \nlong-term problems. Eventually, each one of those failed. I am not here \nto impose blame on anyone. It would be easy to do. It is a very \ndifficult problem working with the administration, and sometimes we \nhave differences between our two parties here, but there was general \nrecognition--universal recognition--that we couldn't continue down the \nsame\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\npath of excessive spending, more than we received in revenues, year \nafter year at a frightening pace to ever greater debt.\n  When this administration took office, the national debt--accumulated \nwell over 200 years of the existence of this country--that debt has \nnearly doubled in the 8 years this administration has been in office \nand will virtually double before that term is up. It is unsustainable.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--a neutral agency that has nothing to \ndo with Republicans or Democrats or politics. It simply gives us the \nnumbers and the numbers tell the story. Those numbers are frightening \nwhen we look at the degree to which we continue to plunge into debt.\n  The Congressional Budget Office just released its latest report, \nwhich said coming deficits will be more than 20 percent larger than \npreviously forecast--previously forecast, just last August. Depending \non some of the actions taken here in Congress regarding spending, the \ncalculation has to be changed, and it is going to be 20 percent more \nthan what they had projected just a few months ago. We are looking at \ntrillion-dollar deficits on the horizon.\n  In my mind, here is the most startling of the 10 recommendations and \nnotices to us: In 10 years, 99 percent of all revenue that comes in to \nthe Federal Government--the cumulation of everyone's taxes and all the \nmoney that flows into Washington through user fees, excise fees, \nwithholding taxes from our paycheck, the taxes we pay either every \nApril or quarterly taxes, every tax out there accumulating, 99 percent \nwill go to mandatory spending and net interest spending.\n  If you are for a stronger defense, if you are for better research at \nthe National Institutes of Health, if you are for funding the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, if your interest is education, \nsocial welfare, if you are looking at any of the hundreds, if not \nthousands, of programs that various interests have here, if 99 percent \nof the revenues coming in are going to things we have no control over--\nmandatory spending, which is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid--\nessentially only 1 percent is left to divide up among everything else \nthe Federal Government does; that is, building roads, fixing bridges, \ngrants to cities, environmental interests, on and on we could go. If 99 \npercent is going to spending what we can't control--simply paying \ninterest on the debt and covering the entitlement spending of Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--it is unsustainable. Those efforts \nhave failed. It is a pox on all of our houses. We tried mightily and \nhad no ability to bring it to conclusion.\n  That has been kind of pushed off the table. We didn't talk about that \nmuch in the last year of this Congress. The focus was on other \nissues. But this looming catastrophe that will happen based on nothing \nbut numbers, arithmetic, and facts--will happen sooner than anybody \nanticipates--cannot be put aside. But having failed in those major \nefforts and as long as this President is in office, it appears that we \nare not going to be successful this year. This catastrophe will be \ndumped on the next President's lap, whoever that President might be, \nand I thought the very least we could do is continue to look at how to \nmake government more efficient, how to prioritize our spending, and how \nto eliminate and address the issue of waste and fraud.\n\n  I started this program, waste of the week, trying to educate the \npublic in terms of the fact that there is money out there that can be \nspent more wisely or that wouldn't have to be taken from them in the \nfirst place or that can be used to reduce our debt. I am now up to 30 \nexamples of ways in which we can address that. So today I am doing, I \nbelieve, No. 30. This is something that has to do with our foreign \npolicy.\n  These wastes of the week have everything from the ridiculous, such as \nhundreds of thousands of dollars for a grant to a university to study \nwhether massaging rabbits--after strenuous activity--allows for faster \nrecovery from the strain of the rabbits' work. This is what they are \nspending your tax dollars on. I think you can ask any person--whether \nthey are in Little League, high school, professional sports, or \ncollege--whether, after strenuous exercise, it helps if you have a \nmassage. I think the answer would be yes, of course. Everybody knows \nthat, but we had to issue a grant of almost $400,000 to somebody who \nfilled out a form and said: This is a great idea. Send us some Federal \nmoney, and we will produce this study, and then we will give you the \nconclusion.\n  There is everything from the ridiculous to issues that are very \nserious, such as the duplication of effort in two programs to help \npeople who are out of work either because of disability or because they \ncan't get a job. One is called unemployment insurance and the other is \ncalled Social Security disability. To qualify for Social Security \ndisability, you have to prove you can't work. To get an unemployment \ninsurance payment from the government, you have to prove you can work \nbut there isn't a job. You don't get both. Yet we identified $5.7 \nbillion of expenditure in duplication--people who were getting a check \nfor both being disabled and not being able to work and saying: I am \nable to work, but the job isn't there. So two checks arrive every month \nin the mailbox for these people--to the total amount of $5.7 billion.\n  You would think that in this day and age where everything is \ncomputerized, it would be easy for the unemployment insurance agency to \ncall up or to contact Social Security and say: You know, John Smith \nhere is applying for unemployment insurance. Can you check your records \nto see whether he is also receiving Social Security disability? It \nwould be easy to get their Social Security number and match. But, no, \none agency is working over here and another agency is working over \nthere. Both are sending out checks, one of which is illegal, and they \nare not communicating with each other. It ought to be an easy fix, but \nthis is the Federal Government.\n  On and on it goes.\n  Let me talk about No. 30. No. 30 involves the Task Force for Business \nand Stability Operations in Afghanistan. It is a Pentagon business \nadvocacy agency that was formed to provide contracting work in \nAfghanistan through rebuilding. We did this in Iraq, and now we are \ndoing it in Afghanistan. It was established for a valid purpose: to \nencourage foreign investment. They have a task force, and the task \nforce lives over there. What we found through the inspector general--a \nspecial inspector to ensure that this money that is being spent over \nthere is spent wisely has found that millions has been spent on private \nhousing for the staff of this task force instead of allowing those \npeople to utilize excess space at existing Department of Defense bases.\n  So here is a Department of Defense program. The Department of Defense \nhas housing and provisions for food and shelter and so forth, and they \nhave excess capacity because we have drawn down troops. But instead of \nputting those people in this area where they can occupy unoccupied \nspace, where they can get food through the DOD process--a much cheaper \nprocess--they put them in specially furnished, privately owned villas \nand spent $150 million doing it. They have also hired contractors to \nprovide--because they are separate from the Department of Defense base, \nthey have to have private security, they have to have food services \nprovided to them, they have to have bodyguards for staff and visitors, \nand they have to have onsite laundry service, food and drink services, \nprivate transportation, cultural advisers, and housekeeping services. \nAll of this could be avoided for this task force which is there to \nprovide investment counsel and advice for Afghanistan.\n  Not surprisingly, reports of the spending drew the attention of the \nSpecial Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, who has spent \ntime digging into finding out exactly what is happening here. He noted \nthat the exorbitant cost of the villas is especially concerning, as I \nhave said, because there are other facilities through the Department of \nDefense that have been planned for this specific purpose that are not \nbeing used and it would be much cheaper if they were used. Because they \nare already there, they don't to have all this collateral support. He \nsaid that 20 percent of the task force budget provided housing and \nsecurity for no more than 5 or 10 staffers.\n  Former task force employees told investigators that the inspector \ngeneral estimates that housing a staff of 10 at\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\nthe U.S. Embassy in 2014 in Kabul would have cost $1.8 million and \nlittle or nothing if they had bunked with troops at a military base.\n  The IG also noted that poor oversight and the complete lack of \ncoordination--where have we heard that before? Where have we heard \nabout Federal programs with a complete lack of coordination with other \nprograms to see if there is duplication, such as Social Security \ndisability and the unemployment insurance as an example? That has not \nbeen provided, he said.\n  He is still investigating all of this, but what we are going to do \ntoday is take that $150 million price tag for these Afghanistan villas \nto the taxpayer, and we are going to add that.\n  By the way, I have a picture of the villas. I can see why people \nmight want to live in something like this rather than an Army base. But \nthis is tax dollars going over to Afghanistan. We have a mission over \nthere to complete. I don't know--this could be in Washington, DC, or \nthis could be in Indianapolis, IN. They are pretty nice digs. Is it \nreally necessary to spend that kind of money when other facilities are \navailable, when all the services and food are available to maintain \nthese and the security is within a Department of Defense military base? \nDo we have to go to this level of support with taxpayer dollars?\n  We are adding $150 million to our ever-growing list of waste, and our \ntotal is now well over $130 billion of cost. That is this week's waste \nof the week.\n\n\n                            Syrian Refugees\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to talk about the Syrian refugee issue. I \nhad the opportunity to spend some time in Jordan, as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, and in Turkey looking at the situation as it \nexists in Syria. I also spent time in Italy and Greece relative to the \nhumanitarian crisis that is taking place, with literally hundreds of \nthousands of people who are fleeing Iraq, northern Iraq, and fleeing \nSyria because it is a war-torn area, and their migration and all the \nissues involved with that migration and the implications and \nconsequences it is having on Europe.\n  It is an issue here in the United States, resettlement of refugees. \nIt is overwhelming. These countries cannot even begin to process people \ncoming to their borders to determine whether they are legitimate or \nwhether they are inserted terrorists who are using this flow of \nmigration to gain access to Europe, to gain access to the United \nStates, and to gain access to other places. They are legitimate people \nwho are leaving with their families to avoid the consequences of this \nwar; yet we know, because we have already ascertained this, that \nincluded in that effort are terrorists who want to insert themselves \ninto that flow so they can come to Europe, come to our European \ncapitals, come to the United States, and continue their brutality and \njihad against Americans and against Western civilization.\n  I think the issue we just voted on here unfortunately fell short. We \ndidn't get support from our colleagues across the aisle and didn't have \nthe necessary number of votes to pass what the House has already \npassed, and that is to provide a suspension of time to comply with what \nour FBI Director has said needs to be done so that we can ensure that \npeople in this refugee flow who are going to be admitted to America \nunder the administration's plan are truly war-torn refugees and not \nrepresenting a terrorist threat to the American public. The FBI \nDirector and our intelligence agencies have said we don't have the \nnecessary tools in place to be able to ascertain this, and until we do, \nwe cannot guarantee that these refugees do not include people who are \nnot coming for asylum reasons but are connected in one way or another \nto terrorists. I thought it was a very reasonable thing to do to \nprovide for security for Americans and assure them that we are not \nsimply opening the gates here to terrorist access, to pause and get \nthese screening procedures in place before we allow this to happen.\n  We just had this vote within an hour or so and came up short, which \nis unfortunate, and we did not gain the support we needed to get the \nnecessary votes from our colleagues. So the effort the House has made \nonce again dies in the Senate because while we had virtually every \nRepublican vote, we couldn't get any other votes to get to the \nnecessary level to take up the legislation and move forward. There may \nbe another attempt to do that.\n  After going and looking and talking to U.N. associate officials, \ntalking to our government officials, talking to officials from these \nvarious countries and particularly those entry points from northern \nAfrica that come through Italy and from Greece, which comes from Syria \nand Iraq, the conclusion I came to was that this flow, which is now \nwell over 1 million people--temporarily slowed here because of the \nweather, and it will start up again in the spring when it warms up--is \noverwhelming Europe. You don't have to watch too much cable news or \nread too much of a newspaper to see what is happening in Europe with \nthe massive inflow of refugees, asylum seekers, and the incorporation \nof people who are not abiding by the laws, overwhelming the system.\n  So as open-arms welcome, as Germany was under the Chancellor's \nproclamation to ``bring them here, and we will take care of them,'' \neven that is now under question in terms of Germany's capability of \ndoing that. A number of other countries, including Denmark and Hungary, \nare basically saying: We can't handle all of this. It is just \noverwhelming us. The social and financial consequences of all of this \nare a great political, as well as a financial, threat to Europe, and we \nhave seen evidence of that. No one is really talking about a possible \nalternative that can deal with this problem.\n\n  Several months ago, I came to the Senate floor and basically said: I \nthink I have a better solution that is perhaps even more financially \nfeasible. My solution is to provide safe havens for these people either \nwithin their country or simply across the border of other countries. \nTurkey and Jordan are taking in millions of refugees, but they are \noverwhelmed. There is a precedent here in terms of providing safe \nhavens.\n  I was serving in the Senate at the time of the Balkan war, and the \nbrutality there was equal to some of the brutality that is taking place \nin Syria. It was a desperate situation, but through the U.N. agencies \nfor refugee relief and the use of NATO to provide security, we created, \nas a coalition of nations, safe havens for people in the Balkans. There \nwere a few mistakes, but in the end it worked very significantly.\n  These people wanted to go back to their homes. They wanted to stay \ncitizens of their country. They had hundreds of years of history \nthrough the line of their families in these countries, and they didn't \nwant to try to take on a different language and have to learn different \nskills in order to assimilate in other countries any more than we would \nwant to move our people out to another country if we were in that \nsituation.\n  By creating safe havens and having NATO provide the security to keep \nthese safe havens from being attacked or misused and by providing a \ncoalition of financial support and enough humanitarian support through \nthe United Nations and through the world's nations, I said this is a \nbetter way to handle it, and we succeeded in that effort. So the \nprecedent is there, and I thought: Why not use the same model for \nSyria? It solves the immigration issue because those people are housed \nin a humanitarian way, with NATO providing for their safety, which is \nwhat I suggested. After all, Turkey is part of NATO. It is a mission in \nwhich NATO would address the problem in Europe, where most of the NATO \nnations are housed. Obviously, the United States would take part in it.\n  It provides a financial situation to the issue. I haven't been able \nto calculate this, but the cost of providing those safe havens can't \nexceed the cost of all the transfer, movement, assimilation into the \nculture, training, education, learning the language, and everything \nthat has to be provided for those who are going to foreign nations from \ntheir homeland.\n  So once again, I am bringing this suggestion to my colleagues' \nattention, and, hopefully, to the attention of NATO and other countries \nthat are caught up in this refugee problem and asking: Why don't we \nreopen the discussion and debate about what the cost would be, what it \nwould take to accomplish it in order to create these safe havens in \nareas close to or within the\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nborders of the countries from which they are coming from? It addresses \na multitude of problems that are overwhelming the capability of \nEuropean nations and have created a political storm of opposition both \nin Europe as well as in the United States, and it legitimately gives \nthose refugees safe harbor, humanitarian support, and housing \nconditions. It gives them food, water, and humanitarian and medical \nsupport at their safe haven rather than have them flowing into other \ncountries.\n  So, once again, I am calling for this. Germany estimates that last \nyear alone the cost of the refugee crisis was 21 billion euros, and in \ndollars it would be even more. Italy spent 620 million euros in 2014 \nand more than 800 million euros in 2015. Individual islands in Greece \nspent between 1 and 1.5 billion euros last year, and they can't afford \nit. We all know that Greece can't begin to afford this. They have said: \nWe have enough financial problems trying to take care of our own \npeople, let alone the massive influx of refugees. Sometimes they get \n10,000 refugees a day in their country who say: We are here, we want to \neat, we want a place to sleep, and we need to be taken care of.\n  Greece is saying: We can't even take care of our own, let alone the \nrefugees.\n  It is creating tremendous tension and tremendous political \nconsequences for many European nations. The EU allocated 560 million \neuros for the crisis last year, which is far too short. But in that \ncontext, this money can be used to address the problem of funding for \nthese safe havens, avoiding all of the cultural, political, and social \ndynamics that are a part of this refugee flow and creating so many \nproblems there.\n  I have kind of given an outline here of what I think we ought to \nseriously consider as we are looking at the refugee crisis. For those \nwho say America is not a welcoming country, that is not true.\n  My mother is an immigrant. I am the son of an immigrant. She came \nhere as a young child with her sisters and brothers the legal way. My \nmother and father learned the language and worked hard so that we could \nget a good education and assimilate into the United States.\n  But now we simply don't have the capability. It is not wise to simply \nopen our borders and say: Come one; come all. Maybe that was possible \nbefore ISIL, ISIS, Al Qaeda, and these other terrorist groups were \nformed, but today we have a major national security issue combined with \nthe ability to assimilate refugees from other countries.\n  The security issue alone puts us in a position where we just simply \ncan't provide the kind of security for the American people without \nscreening and background checks because ISIL said: We are doing this. \nLook at California and these other places where they are inspired over \nthe Internet or injected into our country. The FBI Director says: We \nare overwhelmed in terms of trying to keep track of people whom we \nsuspect are trying to do harm to the American people. I think because \nof that issue alone, as well as the other issues involved here, this is \na model we ought to take a serious look at.\n  Once again, I am calling for that, and I will talk more about that as \nwe go forward.\n  I am now finished with my two presentations.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Right to Life for the Unborn\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, Kansans celebrate a rich history of \nprotecting man-made laws that deny natural rights. We have protested \nmany things over a long period of time, and our history is significant \nin that regard. After years of bloodshed leading to the Civil War, \nKansas was born a free State. Though we lament the use of any violence, \nresidents of our State have acted on the firm conviction that human \nbeings, regardless of their stage or state in life, could not be \nregarded as property by other people.\n  We take pride in the fact that one of the first sit-ins of the civil \nrights movement took place at the Dockum Drugstore in Wichita, KS, \nleading the way for peaceful protests in the struggle for equality.\n  Today I wish to call attention to a somber anniversary in our \nNation's history that will be observed this week. Forty-three years \nago, the Supreme Court determined an unborn child has no guaranteed \nright to life under the Constitution, paving the way to destroy the \nlives of 57 million unborn children since 1973.\n  Many Kansans, most of them very young, will continue a decades-long \ntradition of standing up for the civil rights of an unprotected class \nof people as they come to Washington, DC. With their chaperones, they \nwill comprise one of the Nation's largest groups attending the annual \nMarch for Life.\n  They come each January, when it is rarely warm, and, as is forecast \nfor this Friday's march, it will be snowy, cold, and probably very \nmiserable. Despite the elements--despite the weather--when the hundreds \nof thousands of youth walk down Constitution Avenue past the Capitol \nand the Supreme Court, they give witness to the sanctity of human life \nfrom the moment of conception. They protest abortion providers \nreceiving taxpayer dollars. They object to government policies that \nviolate freedom of conscience.\n  These Kansans have made a 20-hour bus ride and will yet again brave \ncold weather to demonstrate their commitment to the right to life--a \nright that those of us in positions of power have an obligation to \nprotect.\n  When visiting with these young advocates, I have been struck by the \nclarity with which they march. Motivated by a joy for life, a love for \nlife, they come to Washington, DC, not to condemn, but rather to affirm \nthat all life is sacred and to encourage a broader realization of that \nin our Nation.\n  Every opportunity they have while they are here they will use to \neducate and to encourage a point of view that protects life. As other \ntimes in our struggle for civil rights in our country, they will make \nprogress to pursue and secure the right to life, and none of those \nthings have happened as quickly as we would like.\n  As we work to expedite the day when the unborn are protected under \nlaw, I welcome to our Nation's capital all Kansans, as well as the \nhundreds of thousands more who will join them as they march for life. \nEvery great movement begins with the first step, and these young \nKansans can be certain their march will not be in vain.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n             Price Spikes in Decades-Old Prescription Drugs\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill, to inform our \ncolleagues of an important development in the investigation underway by \nthe Special Committee on Aging as we examine the sudden and dramatic \nprice hikes for certain decades-old prescription drugs.\n  First, let me provide the Presiding Officer and our colleagues with \nsome background on our investigation to date. Given that 90 percent of \nseniors take at least one prescription drug every month, the egregious \nprice increases we have witnessed on these older drugs that are no \nlonger under patent protection could inflate the cost of health care by \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year. Concerned not only about the \nhigh costs but also about the potential risk that patients will not be \nable to access the prescription drugs they need, we launched a \nbipartisan investigation early last November into the causes, effects, \nand potential solutions to these massive and unjustified price \nincreases.\n  Our investigation is focused on four companies that recently acquired \nsix drugs that were decades old--drugs whose patents had expired long \nago--and then these companies, after purchasing these drugs, \ndramatically hiked their prices. The four companies are Turing \nPharmaceuticals, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Retrophin, Incorporated, and \nRodelis Therapeutics.\n  Of these four, Turing Pharmaceuticals, previously led by its founder \nMartin Shkreli, is the company that has received the most attention. In \nAugust of last year, Turing acquired the\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\ndrug Daraprim. Daraprim is considered to be the gold standard for the \ntreatment of toxoplasmosis, a disease resulting from a parasite \ninfection that can be particularly harmful to infants born to infected \nmothers.\n  Despite the fact that Daraprim has been on the market for 63 years, \nTuring bought the drug and then promptly raised its price from $17.63 \nto a whopping $750 per pill.\n  The other three companies also dramatically increased the prices of \nthe drugs they acquired from between 300 to 2,000 percent.\n  On November 4, we wrote to the companies asking for detailed \ninformation regarding their pricing decisions. I ask unanimous consent \nthat our letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Around the same time, Turing CEO Shkreli was actively engaged in \nonline postings and other communications discussing Turing business, \nusing what appeared to be his own personal electronic devices.\n  On November 12, 2015, the Aging Committee asked the counsel for \nTuring to take reasonable steps to ensure that any business records on \nMr. Shkreli's personal devices be properly preserved and produced. \nTuring still has not provided the Aging Committee with clear assurances \nthat it will do so, notwithstanding the fact that they have told us \nthat Mr. Shkreli was ``principally involved for Turing in all aspects \nof the transactions and the decisions covered by'' our November 4 \nletter.\n  On December 9, 2015, we issued a subpoena for documents to Mr. \nShkreli in his capacity as CEO, compelling Turing to produce the \ninformation that had been sought by our November 4 letter. On December \n15, 2015, we learned that Mr. Shkreli had been indicted on seven counts \nunrelated to Turing and predating the company's corporate existence. \nThe next day Turing announced Mr. Shkreli's resignation as CEO but left \nunclear whether or not he remained on its board of directors.\n\n  The fact that the company has not made it clear that it would act to \npreserve Turing business records in its former CEO's possession left \nthe committee deeply concerned that we might not receive all documents \nrelevant to our investigation. Therefore, on December 21 of last year, \nthe committee requested that Turing provide detailed information on the \nsteps it was taking to preserve these records. Once again, however, \nTuring failed to produce an adequate response to our request.\n  Consequently, the Special Committee on Aging issued another document \nsubpoena--this one directly to Martin Shkreli himself--on December 24. \nIt directed him to produce substantially the same documents sought by \nthe committee's December 9 subpoena. By a letter dated January 12, \n2016, counsel informed our committee that Mr. Shkreli was categorically \ninvoking the act of production privilege under the Fifth Amendment to \nthe Constitution and was therefore refusing to produce any documents in \nresponse to the December 24 subpoena. So this is the important new \ndevelopment. He has chosen, in response to a document subpoena for \nTuring documents that may be in his personal possession, to invoke the \nFifth Amendment.\n  To be clear, Mr. Shkreli is essentially arguing that the very act of \nproducing and authenticating documents that are seemingly unrelated to \nthe charges filed against him may incriminate him. The committee has \nasked him through counsel for an explanation of the rationale for this \nargument, and we are awaiting a response. The committee is troubled by \nhis unsupported invocation, given that the Turing documents we have \nrequested appear to be unrelated to the charges brought against him. \nAbsent a valid justification of the grounds for invoking the Fifth \nAmendment, Mr. Shkreli's assertion could hinder our important \ninvestigation.\n  Our committee is seeking to understand how companies can acquire \nprescription drugs--drugs for which they had nothing to do with the \nresearch and development, drugs that in some cases are more than half a \ncentury old--and then suddenly impose dramatic price increases on those \ndrugs at the expense of infants, vulnerable seniors, and others with \ndevastating diseases for which in some cases these drugs are the gold \nstandard for treatment.\n  So far the Special Committee on Aging has received nearly 20,000 \ndocuments over the course of this investigation. The documents the \nSenator from Missouri and I are seeking on behalf of the committee \nlikely include information that is essential in order for us to fully \nunderstand why this phenomenon is happening and to develop the \nlegislative and regulatory solutions to end this disturbing practice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                   Special Committee on Aging,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2015.\n     Mr. Martin Shkreli, \n     Chief Executive Officer, Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC, Avenue \n         of the Americas, 39th Floor, New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Shkreli: The United States Senate Special \n     Committee on Aging is conducting an investigation into the \n     pricing of off-patent drugs in certain circumstances. We seek \n     your cooperation with this investigation so that the \n     Committee may better understand drug pricing and related \n     regulatory and public policy concerns.\n       In particular, the Committee wishes to learn more about \n     Turing Pharmaceuticals' recent acquisition of the rights to \n     sell Daraprim, a drug used to treat and prevent infections, \n     from Impax Laboratories and Turing's subsequent decision to \n     increase the price of Daraprim from $13.50 per tablet to \n     $750.00.\n       In order to assist us in our investigation, we ask that you \n     provide us with the documents set forth in Schedule A and the \n     information set forth in Schedule B by December 2, 2015. \n     Please submit the material responsive to this request as it \n     becomes available, rather than waiting to provide it all at \n     once. In order to facilitate this production, we request that \n     you schedule a time to meet and confer on the Request with \n     Committee Staff as soon as it is practicable for you to do \n     so.\n       The jurisdiction of the Special Committee on Aging is set \n     forth in Section 104 of S.

Madam President, I yield now to the ranking member of \nthe Special Committee on Aging, my colleague Senator McCaskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, first I want to compliment the \nchairman of the committee for her remarks, which presented, I think, a \nvery thorough and complete look at what the committee is doing and why \nwe are doing it.\n  There are different ways that people can do business in the Capitol. \nThere is the one-off press conference, there is the topic of the day \nthat everyone scurries to get attention for, and then there is the \nprofessional, plodding, complete investigation into a very important \npublic policy issue. That is the kind of investigation that Chairman \nCollins is leading--one that is responsible, thorough, and, frankly, \ngrounded in a deep belief that the American people have the right to \nknow why these obscure drugs and the companies that developed them were \npurchased, and then they exploded in price. This is something we need \nto understand. These drugs are lifesaving drugs. This is something that \nadversely affects many Americans with these drugs. But the problem that \nis represented here could have much broader implications.\n  Prescription drug prices have increased by 13 percent in 2015, and \nthey are up 76 percent in the past 5 years--more than eight times the \nrate of inflation. A recent national poll shows that the affordability \nof prescription drugs was Americans' top health concern. This problem \nappears to continue unabated as we speak. Just last week, there were \nreports in the Wall Street Journal that several major drug companies \nhave all raised prices on drugs, some by double digits in the last \nmonth alone.\n  We need to get to the bottom of why we are seeing such huge spikes in \nthese drug prices. In the course of the investigation, we have received \nquite a bit of pushback from lobbyists and insiders. One industry \nlobbyist said if we wanted to cure cancer, we better leave the drug \ncompanies alone. That is absurd.\n  We want to encourage innovation, and that is why the investigation is \nbeing handled so responsibly by Senator Collins. We want to protect \nthose in research and development, but we can do so while taking a hard \nlook at price gouging and the hedge fund-like behavior of some \npharmaceutical companies.\n  I believe Congress has both the ability and the duty to conduct a \nthorough investigation of this issue, and I am proud to be a part of \nthis bipartisan investigation led by Chairman Collins so that we can \nfind policy solutions that will help Americans. As she indicated, we \nhave already requested and received over 20,000 documents from multiple \nsources and have conducted more than 60 interviews with relevant \nstakeholders, and we plan to continue our investigative efforts until \nwe have assembled a sufficiently complete picture so that we can be \nconfident that any proposed policy solutions are well informed and \ntargeted to the specific problems we have identified. In order to do \nthat, it is important that we get all of the documents that have been \nrequested.\n  The privilege against self-incrimination is an extraordinarily \nimportant and sacred constitutional right. It is a right that this body \nbelieves in protecting, and we in no way want to erode it. But as a \nformer prosecutor, I am also very aware of its limitations. In order to \ninvoke the Fifth Amendment, there needs to be a nexus between the \ndocuments and the information that one is refusing to provide under the \nprivilege and an actual fear of self-incrimination in a criminal \nproceeding. We are asking for documents that on their face have no \napparent connection to any ongoing criminal proceeding. If there is no \nconnection between the documents and a criminal proceeding or if the \ndocuments are corporate documents, the courts are very clear that they \nshould be turned over to authorities.\n  I appreciate the chairman's conscientious and dogged pursuit of this \ninvestigation. I will continue to cooperate and assist in any way \npossible. I look forward to continuing the important work of the \nSpecial Aging Committee's investigation into drug prices, and I can \nassure the public that with the work that Chairman Collins is doing \nalong with our staffs and the other members of the committee, we will \nget some answers.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           American SAFE Act\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, all across the Middle East and Europe, \nhundreds of thousands of refugees are fleeing the medieval barbarism of \nISIS and the violent cruelty of the Assad regime. Out of a population \nof 22 million, more than 4 million Syrians have fled to neighboring \ncountries. These refugees--almost all of them women and children--have \nbeen living away from their homes for years in Jordan, Turkey, or other \nhost countries, struggling to survive, struggling to be free. Hundreds \nof thousands have decided to make the dangerous journey to Europe. Many \nperish along the way. According to the United Nations, over 3,200 \nrefugees attempting to reach Europe died or went missing in 2015 alone.\n\n  Throughout our history, when we have been at our best, the United \nStates has accepted the world's most vulnerable seeking refuge from \nviolence and murder. Our principles don't mean very much if we jettison \nthem when we find them politically inconvenient or difficult to live \nby.\n  The legislation we voted on today represents a significant departure \nfrom our proud history. It would require the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Director of the FBI, and the \nDirector of National Intelligence to personally certify that each \nrefugee from Syria and Iraq poses no security threat before admission \ninto the United States and would effectively halt the refugee process. \nThis is not the reason I opposed the legislation. It is worth noting it \nis likely those three officials would be able to do nothing else during \nthe course of the day to keep us secure because they would be busy \nsigning certifications.\n  It is very clear, from all the testimony we have heard at our \ncommittees and people who are experts in this area, that a blanket \nprohibition like this\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\ndoesn't actually make us safe. Refugees are the most thoroughly vetted \ngroup of anyone entering the United States. Let's start with that. The \nUnited States first screens them and collects biometric data. Only \nthose who pass are then referred to the United States--and refugees \ndon't even know which country they are going to be referred to when \nthey approach the United Nations. Then multiple agencies--including \nDHS, the FBI, the State Department, and our intelligence agencies--\nconduct a rigorous screening process. This includes health checks, \nrepeated biometric checks, several layers of biographical and \nbackground screenings and interviews. Out of the 23,000 individuals \nreferred to the United States, only about 2,000 have been accepted. It \nshould be understood by people in this body--and I hope it is \nunderstood by the American people--that no refugee enjoys a presumption \nof acceptance into the United States. The reverse is true. They are \nrequired to pass the most stringent standards of any group seeking to \nenter the United States--a process applicants must endure with \nuncertainty for over 2 years.\n  So instead of playing politics, in my view we ought to be having a \nserious discussion about how actually to keep our country safe and what \nwill make it safer. One of the things I learned when we were working on \nthe immigration bill in the Senate--which still hasn't passed the \nHouse. I would remind everybody, the only bill to secure our border, \nthe only bill to provide internal security when it comes to immigration \nwas the bill that passed through the Senate that has never been taken \nup by the House in any form. One of the things I learned was that of \nthe 11 million undocumented people in the United States, 40 percent of \nthem--almost half--are people who came lawfully to the United States \nbut overstayed their visa, and we have no way of tracking that. We have \nno way of understanding who those people are. This legislation would \nhave fixed that. I would have loved to have seen the House pass a \ncompanion piece of legislation, but that concerns me because there are \na bunch of people in here who haven't been vetted at all. So instead of \nplaying politics, we ought to figure out what we can do.\n  Another example. A group of us have introduced a bill that \nstrengthens the Visa Waiver Program, which terrorists can exploit to \nenter the United States. Currently, over 25 million people come to the \nUnited States every year through this program. Our legislation \naddresses important security vulnerabilities and closes the program to \nforeign fighters. The omnibus we just passed in December included some \nimportant parts of our bill. It prevents people who have traveled to \nterrorist hot spots in the last 5 years--including Iraq and Syria--from \neven using the Visa Waiver Program. It also requires all travelers \nusing the program to have electronic passports, which are harder to \nfake. These are big changes to make the American people safer. \nTogether, these changes will help stop terrorists from coming to the \nUnited States, but there are still important parts of the bill we must \npass, including requiring individuals using the Visa Waiver Program to \nsubmit biometric data such as fingerprints and photos before boarding a \nplane to the United States, working with our European partners to close \ntheir borders to the flow of foreign fighters heading to ISIS and back, \nrequiring better information sharing on foreign fighters and dangerous \nindividuals.\n  This is not to say that a refugee--or even a U.S. citizen--is not \nvulnerable to radicalization. We need to be vigilant about that. \nAmericans are justifiably concerned about the reality of the threat and \nthe dangerous world in which we live today. We must counter terrorist \ngroups' ability to radicalize using social media, both here at home and \nabroad. Our country needs a much better strategy for countering and \ndegrading ISIS propaganda and its recruitment machine. We have to \ndevelop creative and agile technologies to effectively degrade the \nability of terrorist organizations like ISIS and others to persuade, \ninspire, and recruit by using social media. Congress should also pass \nthe Senate immigration bill I mentioned earlier, which included a \nhistoric investment to secure our borders and enhance our interior \nenforcement.\n  As a reminder to everybody here, this bill would double the number of \nborder agents, expand fencing, implement new technology and resources, \naddress visa overstays, and provide for full monitoring of every inch \nof our southern border. By addressing real vulnerabilities and \ninvesting in smart security solutions, we can protect our borders and \nalso--and also--live by our values.\n  We cannot allow ourselves to return to dark periods in our history \nwhen Americans debated turning away those fleeing cruelty around the \nworld.\n  My mom who was born in Poland in 1938 while Nazi tanks amassed at the \nborders--she and her parents miraculously survived--Polish Jews--\nmiraculously survived one of the worst human events in human history, \nand they survived it in and around Warsaw. They lived there for 2 years \nafter the war and then went to Stockholm for a year, Mexico City for a \nyear, and then they came to New York City. They came to the one country \nin the world where they felt they could rebuild their shattered lives.\n  On my first birthday--when I was 1 year old, 1965, 15 years after my \nmom and her grandparents came to the country--my grandparents sent me a \nbirthday card. This is what they said in that card. They wrote in \nEnglish, by the way, 15 years after they came to the United States: The \nancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of democracy in search of \nwhich your dear mother and we came to the hospitable shores of \nbeautiful America in 1950. We have been happy here ever since beyond \nour greatest dreams and expectations with democracy, freedom, and love \nand humanity's greatest treasure. We hope that when you grow up you \nwill help to develop in other parts of the world a greater \nunderstanding of these American values.\n  We have very few opportunities to live by our values. This is one of \nthose times. In this case it is not about developing them, as my \ngrandparents worried during the Cold War, in other parts of the world. \nThis is making sure that we hold on to the values that have defined us \nas a nation, that have separated us from so many other nations in the \nworld and made this a place where my grandparents and my mom were able \nto come and achieve the American dream--a dream that would have seemed \nunimaginable to them during the Holocaust.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Our Value for Life\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is a basic American value: Families.\n  America has gotten particular about our families. We love our \nfamilies and we love our kids. It is one of the struggles we have had \nrecently as a nation because we have seen this collapse of the American \nfamily, this basic value. We see that unit struggling. Families begin, \na husband and a wife, in that incredible moment when a lady looks at a \npregnancy test, sees that little line, and realizes there is a baby on \nthe way.\n  Forty-three years ago as a country there was a decision made by the \nSupreme Court. That decision forever changed the structure of our \nfamilies, forever changed the values within the country, because the \nvalues shifted 43 years ago, and it changed from there is a baby on the \nway to that family gets to choose if that is a baby or not. To \nliterally be able to say, based on the preference of the mom, it is \ntissue or it is a baby, we should handle those two things very \ndifferently.\n  I can remember distinctly in my family 19 years-plus ago now, when we \nsaw that little line on the pregnancy test and we started getting a \nhouse ready and getting things organized and we started trying to \nfigure out how to get our finances in order and everything ready to go \nbecause there was a baby on the way. In those first moments, before my \nwife could even feel that she was pregnant, we found out that she was. \nThat was a child coming to our family. She has a name now. Her name is \nHannah. With the first of our two daughters--Hannah and Jordan--we \nunderstand full well how things started and what things were like in \nthose earliest days. It is remarkable to me that so much of the \nconversation now circles around preference. At that moment we knew that \nif we didn't do something right away to actually reach into the womb \nand take that child out of the womb--Planned Parenthood and other folks \nwould say\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\n``just to remove the tissue''--that if something wasn't done from that \nmoment on, there was a baby coming, a baby who would look up into our \nface and would smile and would have a name.\n  Americans have lost track of this basic principle. That is not tissue \nin the womb. When that pregnancy test comes up positive, that is a \nbaby. Regardless of the preference of any individual, that is a baby on \nthe way. Cells are dividing. For many they don't find out for maybe a \ncouple of months even and begin to figure out something is really \nchanging and they do a quick test. Sometimes by the time they even do a \ntest there is a beating heart there. They look in with a sonogram and \ncount 10 fingers, 10 toes. If you were to reach in and do a DNA test, \nyou would find out that lump of tissue that is in there is not tissue. \nIt has DNA different than the mom, different than the dad. That is a \nchild. It is a unique life. That life is not determined based on a \npreference. That life is determined based on that dividing cell as a \nchild with 10 fingers and toes.\n  I can't think of anything else we have in America where anyone can \nsay, based on their preference, I choose for that to be alive or I \nchoose for that not to be alive. I can't just look at this desk and say \nI choose to call that a life because we know life has basic criteria. \nIt has dividing cells. It can function on its own. It can reproduce. It \nis life. We know what life is. We can't casually say one thing is life \nand one thing is not, just like we casually don't just try to fight off \nthe destruction of tissue in other ways.\n  I always smile when I hear some folks on the other side of this \nargument say they want abortion to be safe, legal, and rare. I hear it \nall the time--safe, legal, and rare. When someone says that to me, I \nalways ask the question: Why rare? I understand safe and legal. Why \nwould you care if it is rare? If it is just tissue, why does it matter \nif you remove it?\n  No one has a big national movement to fight individuals from taking \nwarts off their hands because everyone knows, if you have a wart on \nyour hand, it is just tissue and no one cares if you take that off. \nThey understand that really is your body. It is a wart on your hand and \nit doesn't look good, so take it off. Everyone is fine with that. For \nsome reason there is a push to say safe, legal, and rare when it comes \nto abortion because I believe inherently even the individuals who say \nsafe, legal, and rare understand it is not just tissue or you wouldn't \nsay it has to be rare. You understand it is an incredibly painful, \ndifficult decision that a mom is making because she knows in her gut \nthat is not tissue. That is a child, a child who would one day have a \nname and a smile. That is a child.\n  In China the government gets to decide whether it is just tissue or a \nchild because the government will step in and say: If you have a second \nchild, you can't have that one. You have to destroy the second child. \nNow, in their benevolence, China has shifted to say you can have up to \ntwo children in certain areas and in certain regions, but if you have a \nthird one, you have to destroy that child. In America, for whatever \nreason, we have individuals with the freedom to be able to say: I \nprefer for this not to be a child. Suddenly, somehow our culture says: \nOK. You can pick.\n  The Supreme Court in 1973 looked at this issue, and they argued a lot \nabout viability, what they call quickening. This conversation about \nviability really circled around whether States could actually make laws \nprotecting the lives of children once they reach viability. In 1973, \nviability was very different than what it is today. In the NICU units--\nneonatal intensive care units--you will find a very large area in most \nhospitals. You ought to go by and visit and walk into an NICU area \nbecause you will find many rooms and many beds there. Decades ago that \nwasn't true because children at 22 weeks and 24 weeks didn't survive \nbefore. Now a higher and higher percentage are.\n\n  There are children who are in Oklahoma City right now in NICU who \nweigh just a tiny bit more than two iPhones. That is their weight when \nthey are born--just a tiny bit more than two iPhones in weight. Yet \nthey are growing up to be healthy, productive kids. They are children.\n  We are getting better at NICU as well, learning how to provide oxygen \nso their lungs develop. I visited some of the physicians in the NICU at \nOU Children's Hospital over the Christmas break and said: What have we \nlearned? What have we gained? Is this getting better?\n  They talked about how we feed differently now than we did decades \nago. At NICU, we understand how they are developing and receive food, \nand we want their digestive systems to develop. Things are very \ndifferent now in science. It is forcing the country to rethink an issue \nagain: When is a child a child? And in our basic American values, \nshould we stand up for them?\n  I believe we should. I am amazed at the number of moms who--if they \nwill get a sonogram and see the picture of their child in their womb, \nthey understand clearly that is not tissue; that is a face looking back \nat them. Those are fingers and toes that they can count. There is a \nbeating heart there. That is not random tissue.\n  In fact, I don't know if you knew this, but they can now do 3-D \nsonograms and then send the sonogram to a 3-D printer and actually \nprint out a model of what the child looks like in the womb in that \nexact position. Not only is that cool as a parent, to be able to say \nthat I can actually hold a model of what my child looks like right now \nat 20 weeks of development, 28 weeks of development and to be able to \nsee and look at their face, but it is revolutionary for physicians that \nat 20 weeks they are reaching into the womb, giving anesthetic to the \nchild, and they can actually see exactly what the imperfections are so \nwhen they go in to do surgery, they can practice on the outside before \nthey reach into the inside.\n  The technology continues to advance. I say to my colleagues, at what \npoint will our laws catch up with our science? How long will we deny \nclear science and not understand that is a child?\n  I think in the decades ahead, our Nation will catch up to the science \nand will look back on a season in our country when we ignored the \nobvious: When a pregnancy test says positive, that is not positive for \ntissue; that is positive for a baby.\n  I also want to affirm thousands of volunteers around the country--\nmany of them coming this week to the March for Life--who serve every \nsingle week in crisis pregnancy centers around the country, who \nlovingly walk with moms through some of the most difficult days of \ntheir lives as they make hard decisions. With great compassion, they \nwalk them through a tough pregnancy. Then they are with them in the \ndays after delivery, bringing diapers to them, bringing formula to \nthem, helping them in those early moments. Thousands of volunteers \naround the country do that every single week. Good for them. Good for \nour country. Good for our value for life. I am always proud when \nAmericans stand up for other Americans no matter how weak they are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           American SAFE Act\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the terrorist attacks that we have seen \nover the last couple of months, including those tragically in Paris and \nSan Bernardino, CA, have made it all too clear that terrorists' threats \nto Americans and to our allies are very real.\n  I believe the best way to combat the threat of ISIS across our globe \nis to continue to degrade and destroy their forces overseas and show \nthe world that they are not as powerful as they claim to be. Our \nsuccess will not only rob them of their safe haven but will also \nundercut their recruitment narrative that ISIS is on the rise. But in \naddition to destroying ISIS overseas, we must also focus on defeating \nthe threat of ISIS here at home.\n  I realize that many Americans and many of our colleagues are \nconcerned about terrorists traveling to our borders as refugees from \nSyria or maybe some other country. As many of my colleagues may recall, \nlate last year we debated the question regarding the resettlement of 4 \nmillion Syrian refugees and whether we in this country should open our \ndoors to even a small fraction of them. We debated it right here on the \nSenate floor, as some of you recall, and we debated it in our \ncommittees, including the Homeland Security and\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\nGovernmental Affairs Committee, where I serve as the senior Democrat.\n  During that debate, I was reminded of the words of Pope Francis's \nhistoric and moving address to a joint session of Congress in the House \nChamber last fall when he reminded us of the Golden Rule--to treat \nother people the way we want to be treated, to love our neighbors as \nourselves. He also invoked Matthew 25, which deals with ``the least of \nthese'': When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was naked, did you \nclothe me? When I was thirsty, did you give me drink? When I was a \nstranger in your land, did you take me in?\n  I think we have a moral imperative to provide for ``the least of \nthese,'' but at the same time, we have a moral imperative to protect \nAmericans from extremists who seek to come to the United States to \ncause us harm. As we learn to address this tension, our Nation has \nrigorous screening procedures in place for all refugees, as well as \nenhanced screening for refugees who might be coming here from Syria. It \nis a process that takes an average of 2 years to complete.\n  For those who aren't familiar with the process, people--in this case, \n4 million refugees--are left for fighting in Syria to try to get away \nto save their lives. They are in refugee camps in that part of the \nworld, and the United Nations has a special mission which includes to \nvet them, to get to know them, to talk with them, and to see if they \nwould like to stay in a refugee camp or try to get settled into some \nother country.\n  In vetting the 4 million refugees, a small fraction of those are \nfolks who indicated that they would be interested in maybe resettling \nin this country. At the end of the day, after winnowing down from 4 \nmillion refugees, I believe the U.N. sent us 7,000 names. Out of the \n7,000, we selected 2,000--mostly kids, mostly young families, mostly \nold people, and not very many men of fighting age, if you will. But the \nPresident has called for increasing that 2,000 to something like 10,000 \nover the next year--of course, this year.\n  Think about that. Out of 4 million, what percentage of 4 million is \n10,000 people? Even if we took all 10,000, it is one-quarter of 1 \npercent. That is what it is: one-quarter of 1 percent. There are \nobviously concerns about whether any of those people are dangerous--\npose an imminent danger to our people. Keep in mind that 2,000 have \ncome in the course of the last year, and not one has been arrested, not \none has been convicted of plotting or trying terrorist activity. One of \nthe reasons that happens is--if I were an ISIS person and I were in \nSyria and wanted to get over, I sure wouldn't spend 2 years trying to \ncome through with the refugees.\n  That is the most stringent vetting of any group of people who want to \ncome to this country. They have to undergo biometric checks. They are \ninterviewed by people who are trained not just by the U.N. but also by \nus overseas, and they are vetted by people, interviewed by people who \nare trained to detect deception.\n  We have the ability to check these people against any number of the \ndatabases that relate to potential terrorist activity. If I were an \nISIS person wanting to embed myself with a terrorist group, I am not \ngoing to wait 2 years to do that and face the most rigorous of vetting \nprocesses for anyone trying to come to this country.\n  For those of Syrian descent, the process could be even longer than \nthat. It is a long time to wait for terrorists if they were going to \ntry to use the refugee program to access the United States. If I were a \nterrorist trying to come here, the last thing I would do is go through \nthose 2 years of vetting.\n  While I understand my colleagues' concerns, the refugee bill that we \ndealt with today would do little to address our Nation's security \nneeds. That is why many of my colleagues joined me in opposing this \nbill. The bill that was before us would require the head of top \nnational security agencies to personally certify that each refugee from \nSyria and Iraq poses no security threat before admission to the United \nStates--not now, not ever.\n  If this bill had passed, it would have served as a backdoor way to \nshut off the refugee program by requiring our national security \nleaders--the head of the FBI, Director of National Intelligence, \nSecretary of Homeland Security--to promise something they would never \npromise. As currently drafted, this bill would require these three \nnational security leaders to guarantee that the refugee will never, \nnever become a security threat. That is not how these leaders or their \norganizations evaluate security threats. They don't have a crystal \nball, and they cannot predict the future.\n  Simply put, the SAFE Act would effectively stop the resettlement of \nfully vetted refugee women, children, families, and older folks from \nSyria and from Iraq and would weaken our national security. Again, that \nis one of the reasons I believe we must focus our attention on threats \nthat pose a greater risk to our homeland.\n  Democrats put forward a series of commonsense solutions--\nalternatives, if you will--that will strengthen our security and help \nprotect us against ISIS, a couple of which I had the pleasure of \ncoauthoring. Instead of vilifying refugees, the proposals that we put \nforward impose tough new sanctions on financial institutions if they \nknowingly facilitate transactions with ISIS. That particular proposal \ncloses loopholes that would let terrorists legally buy guns. This bill \nimproves intelligence sharing with our allies who join us in the fight \nagainst ISIS.\n  The bill also includes several provisions to better protect the \nhomeland. For example, the bill--our proposal--strengthens the security \nof our airports. The bill provides better training for law enforcement \nto respond to active shooter incidents. The legislation also makes \nseveral improvements to the security of low-level radiological material \nso that potentially dangerous material does not fall into the hands of \nterrorists who might use it to create a dirty bomb.\n  One particular area I want to focus on, though, is countering violent \nextremism. As the tragedy in San Bernardino, CA, underscores, some of \nthe greatest threats we face are homegrown terrorism and self-\nradicalization. That is why the Democratic alternative includes \nlanguage from the legislation I introduced that would strengthen the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's ability to counter violent extremism \nhere in the United States.\n  This proposal authorizes a new office charged with helping \ncommunities across the country--Muslim communities across the country--\nstop their young people from being recruited by ISIS. The legislative \nproposal would also create a grant program that would help the \nDepartment of Homeland Security connect with nonprofits, with local \nofficials, with religious leaders and youth groups to work together to \ncounter the narratives proffered by terrorist groups like ISIS.\n  If you look in recent years at the folks in this country who are \ninspired by ISIS to commit terrorist activities against those of us in \nthis country, you will not find them having come over embedded, to my \nknowledge, with any refugee organization or any refugee group. The \nbiggest threat to us is not necessarily the people coming through on \nthe Visa Waiver Program, student visa programs, or tourist visa \nprograms. The biggest threat to our security is from folks who in many \ncases were born here or in some cases folks who could have come from \nSyria, Iraq, or some other place, but they became radicalized after \ncoming here--maybe after becoming a citizen here. Those are the threats \nthat I think pose the greatest danger. We call them lone wolves.\n\n  One of the best ways to address those folks is to look around at \nmaybe our history and look at what is going on in Arabic and other \ncountries and ask if there is some way to reach out to those people who \nare actually in danger of becoming radicalized or a lone wolf, if \nsomeone could reach out to them and reduce the likelihood of having \nthem become radicalized and prevent them from taking out their \nfrustration or anger on people in this country in harmful ways.\n  In my last year as Governor of Delaware, I was involved in a \nfoundation that was called the American Legacy Foundation. It was \nfunded by a tobacco settlement between the tobacco industry and all 50 \nStates. The idea behind the American Legacy Foundation was to use the \n$1 billion that was provided to the American Legacy Foundation to\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\ndevelop ways to message and communicate with young people in this \ncountry who were either smoking or thinking about becoming smokers.\n  Some of us remember from our youth--and when I was a kid growing up, \nthe idea of smoking was thought to be a desirable thing. Early on, we \nwere not aware of the health consequences to it. We would see all kinds \nof people in commercials on television advertising smoking, and you \nwould think that would be a cool thing to do. The American Legacy \nFoundation came along in 2001 and developed a countermessage to all of \nthat, and we called it the Truth Campaign. The Truth Campaign was a \nmultimedia campaign that was included in radio and TV commercials, as \nwell as on the Internet and in magazines and that sort of thing, that \nyoung people read or listened to. The narratives and the messaging \ncommunications were not developed in boardrooms or by someone like me \nor the paid staff of the American Legacy Foundation; they were \ndeveloped by young people who could have been 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, \n17, or 18 years old who developed an area and said: This is a message \nyou need to send out through all of these different mediums to try to \nconvince them not to smoke or if they are already smoking, to quit. And \nthat is what we did.\n  If you look at the incidence of smoking for people who were preteens \nand teenagers in this country in 2001 and what it was by the end of the \nlast decade, it is amazing how well it worked. It was called the Truth \nCampaign. The messaging and the messages developed by our target \naudience were hard-hitting. There was a saying when I went to business \nschool: Talk to your customer and ask them what they want. And in this \ncase, we talked to our customers. A lot of them were about the same age \nas our pages who are sitting here today.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is attempting to start up an \noffice called the Office of Community Partnership. It is an office that \nwould work with Muslim communities across the country, including \nfamilies, religious leaders, and other young people, in order to try to \nmake sure young people do not become radicalized and undertake \nactivities that are going to harm other folks in this country. I think \nit is a very promising initiative. The folks leading this community \npartnership office at the Department of Homeland Security are going to \nwork with the American Legacy Foundation to see what worked and really \nchanged the game with respect to young people smoking and using tobacco \nin this country. We may be able to apply some of those lessons to deter \nthe likelihood of people of Muslim faith who are somehow convinced that \ntheir faith directs them to undertake these violent activities. I am \nencouraged by this prospect.\n  The last thing I will say is that we have 1\\1/2\\ billion people \naround the world who are Muslims. I am Protestant, and there are people \nof different faiths in this body. There are Protestants, Catholics, \nJews, and others. Among the things we have in common, as well as with \nthe Muslim faith, is something I mentioned earlier--the Golden Rule. \nAlmost every major religion on Earth has several things in common, but \none of the things they have in common is the Golden Rule, which is to \nlove your neighbor as yourself and treat other people the way you want \nto be treated. I don't care if you are Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, \nBuddhist, Hindu, or Muslim, somewhere in your Sacred Scripture is that \nidea, that notion, that directive.\n  There are some people who take my Christian faith and turn it on its \nhead to say and do things that we would never do and should never do. \nWe take the Bible, the Old Testament and the New Testament, and instead \nof embracing Matthew 25--the least of these, when I was a stranger in \nyour land, did you take me in--we are basically saying: We are not \ngoing to let any people in this country who are, say, of the Muslim \nfaith. That is not a Christian thing to say or do.\n  People take my religion, my faith and turn it into something that it \nis not even close to being, and, not surprisingly, there are some \npeople who do that with the Muslim faith. We need to counter that and \nhelp the vast majority of folks in this country who are Muslim to \nbetter counter them in ways which, frankly, I could never do but which \npeople in Muslim communities and of that faith across the country would \nlike to do and want to do. We need to be a good partner and help them \nto be successful in that effort. Frankly, that is a whole lot better \nalternative than the legislation that was before us today, and that is \none thing we ought to be able to agree on. I hope my colleagues--\nDemocratic, Republican, and Independent--will find a path to join me \nand others who think this is a good idea and make it happen.\n  With that, I will pass the baton to my friend from another big State, \nRhode Island.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 17 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise for ``Time to Wake Up'' speech \nNo. 124.\n  Today, let's talk Texas. Polling from the University of Texas at \nAustin shows that more than three out of four Americans--or 76 \npercent--now believe that climate change is occurring. Fifty-nine \npercent of Republicans say it is happening. While most poll respondents \nsay they would support a Presidential candidate who supports reducing \ncoal as an energy source, the number goes up to 65 percent for voters \nunder the age of 35. So we might expect Republican Presidential \nhopefuls to acknowledge the problem and incorporate climate action into \ntheir campaign platforms. We might, but we would be wrong.\n  Republican candidates for President have a key constituency: fossil \nfuel billionaire donors. So the candidates ignore the clear tide of \npublic opinion, mock the warnings of our scientific and national \nsecurity experts, dismiss climate disruptions in their own home States, \nand dismiss the world-class climate research of their own home State \nuniversities and scientists--even in Texas.\n  When asked if global warming is real, the junior Senator from Texas \nresponds that the ``data and facts don't support it. . . . Science \nshould follow the facts.'' OK. Let's follow the data and facts.\n  NOAA and NASA just announced that 2015 was the warmest year ever \nrecorded on Earth. That is a fact, and it not an anomaly. It is the \ncontinuation of a clear trend. Fifteen of the warmest 16 years ever \nrecorded by humankind on this planet are the 15 years of this century.\n  Texas A has a department of atmospheric sciences. The faculty there \nhave unanimously adopted this statement:\n\n       1. The Earth's climate is warming, meaning that the \n     temperatures of the lower atmosphere and ocean have been \n     increasing over many decades. Average global surface air \n     temperatures warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit between \n     1880 and 2012.\n       2. It is extremely likely that humans are responsible for \n     more than half of the global warming between 1951 and 2012.\n       3. Under so-called ``business-as-usual'' emissions \n     scenarios, additional global-average warming (relative to a \n     1986 to 2005 baseline) would likely be 2.5 to 7 degrees \n     Fahrenheit by the end of this century.\n\n  That is Texas A's scientific assessment supported by the data and \nfacts.\n  Go Aggies.\n  The Texas State climatologist, Dr. John Neilsen-Gammon, appointed to \nhis position by Governor George W. Bush, has concluded that ``fossil \nfuel burning and other activities are the primary cause of the global-\nscale increase in temperature over the past decades.''\n  According to a Yale University poll released last fall, most Texans--\n61 percent of Texas adults--support setting stricter limits on coal-\nfired powerplants. Well, the President's Clean Power Plan would do just \nthat. It is projected to both cut carbon emissions and save Americans \nmoney on their annual energy bills. Yet the junior Senator from Texas \nrails against the plan, urging people ``to stand up against this \nadministration's dangerous agenda of economic decline''--economic \ndecline if you are a big polluter, maybe, used to polluting for free. \nThe Clean Power\n\n[[Page S123]]\n\nPlan will save the average American family nearly $85 on their annual \nenergy bill by 2030, not to mention preventing death and disease \nthrough reduced soot, smog, and other harmful pollutants.\n  A 2014 study found that strong limits on carbon pollution similar to \nthose in the Clean Power Plan would prevent 2,300 deaths in Texas \nbetween 2020 and 2030. Texas emits the highest amount of carbon \npollution in the country. Yet Texas is well positioned to meet its \nClean Power Plan targets.\n  An Environmental Defense Fund study based on data from Texas's \nprimary electric grid operator shows that existing market trends alone \nwill get Texas to 88 percent of its compliance with the plan as a \nresult of increased wind power capacity, improved energy efficiency \nresults, and switching from coal to natural gas. In fact, Texas's wind \nfarms have become so good at generating power that some utilities are \ngiving away energy.\n  Here is an article from the New York Times on this unique situation \nin Texas with the headline ``A Texas Utility Offers a Nighttime \nSpecial: Free Electricity.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  Scott Burns, the senior director of innovation at Reliant Energy, a \nTexas utility with plans to incentivize night and weekend electricity \nuse, says: ``You can be green and make green.''\n  With Texas so strong in wind energy production and solar energy \npotential, Texas is actually in a position to use its clean energy \nresources to help other States comply with the Clean Power Plan, a win-\nwin with even more Texas clean energy jobs.\n  So, in Texas, there is an overwhelming consensus of scientists at \ntheir own State universities, there is a desire for action among the \nmajority of Texans, and there are vast economic opportunities from \nTexas renewable energy. But the junior Senator from Texas continues to \nrail against mainstream climate science. He claims that ``according to \nthe satellite data, there has been no significant global warming for \nthe past 18 years.'' Eighteen years. What an interesting number to \npick--18 years. If we go back 18 years, we start in 1998.\n  Why might the junior Senator from Texas start his assessment of \nsatellite data in 1998? Well, look at this. When PolitiFact \ninvestigated the Senator's claim that global warming has paused, the \nSenator's office referred to the work of Dr. Carl Mears, a scientist \nwho worked with satellite data temperature sets. This is a graph of \nthat data. Look at 1998. The Earth was experiencing a large El Nino \nevent in 1998, and the observed temperatures were substantially above \nnormal. So if that is where we start the data set, of course it is \ngoing to look like a pause. As the Washington Post put it, ``There is a \nreason why Cruz uses this particular year, and that reason is what \nmakes this claim misleading.'' PolitiFact ruled him ``mostly false,'' \nby the way.\n  The whole data set shows a clear, unequivocal, long-term global \nwarming trend. As Dr. Mears himself said, ``You can look at the data \nsince 1980, and it's pretty clear that there's an ascending trend \nthere. But if you look at any 15-year period, it's a lot less clear \nthat the trend line that you drive might actually mean something.'' Dr. \nMears also warns against drawing conclusions from just this one data \nset. ``Look at all the different datasets,'' he said. ``You don't want \nto trust only the satellite temperatures; you want to look at the \nsurface temperatures and that sort of thing.''\n  Scientists have known for some time that the oceans bear the brunt of \nglobal warming. The reason is simple: They can absorb more heat than \nthe atmosphere, and they do. Peter Gleckler, an oceanographer at the \nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said, ``Ninety, perhaps 95 \npercent of the accumulated heat is in the oceans.''\n  A study released this month shows the world's oceans absorbed--I \ndon't think this number has ever been said before on the Senate floor--\napproximately 150 zettajoules--that is a lot of zeroes; I don't even \nknow how many zeroes that is--150 zettajoules of manmade heat energy \nbetween 1997 and 2015. What does that mean? Here is how the Washington \nPost described it. I will quote the Washington Post:\n\n       [I]f you exploded one atomic bomb the size of the one \n     dropped on Hiroshima every second for a year, the total \n     energy released would be 2 zettajoules. . . . Since 1997, \n     Earth's oceans have absorbed man-made heat energy equivalent \n     to a Hiroshima-style bomb being exploded every second for 75 \n     straight years.\n\n  Yet the Senator from Texas would like us to base our calculation on a \ncherry-picked data set beginning in an outlier year.\n  The oceans aren't just warming, unfortunately. The warming in the \noceans is accelerating. Paul Durack, coauthor of the study, notes, \n``After 2000 in particular the rate of change is really starting to \nramp up.''\n  People who insist that the climate has not warmed in recent decades \nignore a lot, but one thing they particularly ignore is the oceans, and \nwe measure this stuff. The oceans don't lie.\n  Here is another good one from the junior Senator. The Senator from \nTexas informs us that ``history with markedly more CO2 \npredated the Industrial Revolution, so it didn't come from automobiles \nor the burning of carbon fuels.'' What he omits is that this history \nwith markedly more CO2 occurred more than 800,000 years ago.\n  This chart shows that here is where we are right now. Here is the \nrecord of carbon in the atmosphere going back 800,000 years. Where in \nthat period was it more than now? Never. Eight hundred thousand years, \nhundreds of thousands of years before humans even began to walk the \nEarth.\n  Greenhouse gases blanket our planet, absorbing the Sun's energy and \npreventing heat from escaping back into space. Ice sheets melt, seas \nwarm and rise, and so since the late 1880s, sea level has risen 3 feet \nalong the shores of Galveston, TX. None of that matters to the junior \nSenator from Texas.\n  In December he even convened a hearing protesting scientific \nconsensus on climate change as ``partisan dogma and ideology.'' Tell \nthat to NASA and the U.S. Navy. At the time, more than 190 countries \nwere negotiating the groundbreaking international climate agreement in \nParis. Well, Texans were on hand in Paris too. Austin mayor Steve Adler \nsigned the Compact of Mayors, a ``global coalition of mayors pledging \nto reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate \nchange, and report transparently.'' Katherine Romanak and Hilary Olson \nrepresented the University of Texas's Gulf Coast Carbon Center to share \ntheir expertise on carbon capture and storage. Professor Robert \nBullard, dean of the School of Public Affairs at Houston's Texas \nSouthern University, organized a delegation from the Historically Black \nColleges and Universities Climate Change Consortium, and Dr. Katharine \nHeyhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech \nUniversity, encouraged fellow evangelicals to join her in faith-\ninspired support for climate action.\n  On that subject, let me read into the Record the 2015 statement of \nthe National Association of Evangelicals:\n\n       [T]he Earth belongs to God, not us. . . . Probably the most \n     serious and urgent challenge faced by the physical world now \n     is the threat of climate change. . . . We encourage \n     Christians worldwide to . . . exert legitimate means to \n     persuade governments to put moral imperatives above political \n     expediency on issues of environmental destruction and \n     potential climate change.\n\n  Well, as the President said last week, America ``led nearly 200 \nnations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate \nchange.''\n  The junior Senator from Texas would be President, yet he completely \nrefuses to engage on climate change. He ignores Texas State \nuniversities, Texas scientists, Texas local officials, and the whole \nclean energy economy in Texas. He courts evangelicals. He associates \nhimself with the evangelical movement, but he ignores the statement of \ntheir own national association.\n  Now, some say his candidacy is a danger to our distinct American \nheritage, the separation of church and state. But, really, it seems to \nme his problem is with the separation of oil and state.\n  The fossil fuel industry is the last bastion of climate denial. It \nfunds a vast apparatus of climate denial. It also funds a lot of \npolitics. You do the math.\n  It is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\n  \n\n\n              [From the New York Times, November 8, 2015]\n\n                          Energy & Environment\n\n      A Texas Utility Offers a Nighttime Special: Free Electricity\n\n                (By Clifford Krauss and Diane Cardwell)\n\n       Dallas.--In Texas, wind farms are generating so much energy \n     that some utilities are giving power away.\n       Briana Lamb, an elementary school teacher, waits until her \n     watch strikes 9 p.m. to run her washing machine and \n     dishwasher. It costs her nothing until 6 a.m. Kayleen \n     Willard, a cosmetologist, unplugs appliances when she goes to \n     work in the morning. By 9 p.m., she has them plugged back in.\n       And Sherri Burks, business manager of a local law firm, \n     keeps a yellow sticker on her townhouse's thermostat, a note \n     to guests that says: ``After 9 p.m. I don't care what you do. \n     You can party after 9.''\n       The women are just three of the thousands of TXU Energy \n     customers who are at the vanguard of a bold attempt by the \n     utility to change how people consume energy. TXU's free \n     overnight plan, which is coupled with slightly higher daytime \n     rates, is one of dozens that have been offered by more than \n     50 retail electricity companies in Texas over the last three \n     years with a simple goal: for customers to turn down the \n     dials when wholesale prices are highest and turn them back up \n     when prices are lowest.\n       It is possible because Texas has more wind power than any \n     other state, accounting for roughly 10 percent of the state's \n     generation. Alone among the 48 contiguous states, Texas runs \n     its own electricity grid that barely connects to the rest of \n     the country, so the abundance of nightly wind power generated \n     here must be consumed here.\n       Wind blows most strongly at night and the power it produces \n     is inexpensive because of its abundance and federal tax \n     breaks. A shift of power use away from the peak daytime \n     periods means lower wholesale prices, and the possibility of \n     avoiding the costly option of building more power plants.\n       ``That is a proverbial win-win for the utility and the \n     customer,'' said Omar Siddiqui, director of energy efficiency \n     at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit \n     industry group.\n       For utilities, the giveaway is hardly altruistic. \n     Deregulation in Texas has spurred intense competition for \n     customers. By encouraging energy use at night, utilities \n     reduce some of the burdens, and costs, that the oversupply of \n     wind energy places on the power grid.\n       Similar experiments are underway elsewhere.\n       In Italy, customers of Enel, a leading utility, can receive \n     incentives for keeping their electricity use below a \n     predetermined level at times of highest demand.\n       In Maryland, Baltimore Gas & Electric allows customers to \n     earn rebate credits on their bills for every kilowatt-hour \n     less that they use during certain high-demand times. The \n     program is run by Opower, which manages similar programs for \n     several utilities.\n       And in Worcester, Mass., National Grid has installed a home \n     energy management system from Ceiva Energy in about 11,000 \n     homes, connecting a range of devices like smart plugs, high-\n     tech thermostats and digital picture frames that display the \n     home's energy use along with the photos.\n       But no major market has gone as far as Texas, which is \n     conducting a huge energy experiment made possible by the \n     nearly universal distribution in recent years of residential \n     smart meters that can receive and transmit data on \n     electricity.\n       ``Texas is head and shoulders above everybody else with \n     really unique packages for the consumer,'' said Soner \n     Kanlier, a retail energy markets expert at DNV GL, a \n     consulting firm based in Oslo, Norway.\n       Texas is a unique power market, one that makes it better \n     suited for innovation than most others. It is by far the \n     largest deregulated electricity market in the country, \n     spawning scores of retail power competitors hungry to make \n     new customers and keep old ones.\n       ``You can be green and make green,'' said Scott Burns, \n     senior director for innovation at Reliant Energy, which has \n     plans to offer incentives to increase night and weekend \n     electricity use.\n       Energy experts say smart meters have not yet reached their \n     potential and have made little difference in total power use. \n     In many cases, utilities have monopolies and fixed rates, and \n     they do not want to see customers bled away by renewable \n     energy sources, so they have little incentive to use the new \n     data source in creative ways, experts say. Texas is trying to \n     be the exception, though experts say it will still take more \n     time to assess the impact.\n       ``The American consumer wants choice,'' said Jim Burke, \n     TXU's chief executive. ``Consumer choice, with its impacts \n     and benefits, will drive the future of the power industry.'' \n     But he quickly added a note of caution: ``I think the pace at \n     which it evolves is the unknown.''\n       Executives freely acknowledge that the range of residential \n     electricity plans they offer is overwhelmingly a marketing \n     tool.\n       ``We're all trying to grow, and it's a very competitive \n     market,'' said Manu Asthana, president of the residential \n     division of Direct Energy, which offers various plans.\n       Commercials on television and radio, billboards on \n     highways, and aggressive social media campaigns promise \n     joyful, or at least free, cooking, cooling and gadget-playing \n     at certain hours.\n       ``Every morning, every evening, ain't we got fun?'' goes \n     one TXU jingle, mimicking the jaunty song that became popular \n     in the 1920s. When customers ask for information or complain \n     on the phone or by Twitter post or Facebook comment, company \n     agents go over their electricity needs and habits to find the \n     right plan for them. Otherwise, power executives say, the \n     customer can easily be lost.\n       ``Time of use'' plans are growing in popularity in Texas, \n     according to figures compiled by the Electric Reliability \n     Council of Texas, or Ercot, the operator of the power grid \n     and the manager of the deregulated market for 75 percent of \n     the state.\n       In June 2013, 135,320 households had enrolled in ``time of \n     use'' plans in the Ercot region. That number climbed to \n     290,328--out of more than six million residences in September \n     2014. And although nearly 63,000 residences dropped out of \n     the program over that time--in part because rates are \n     typically higher under the plans at peak hours--Ercot \n     officials believe that the number of households enrolled \n     continues to grow.\n       Consumers estimated that the plans were saving them as much \n     as $40 or $50 a month during the peak summer season.\n       ``We are still in the formative stages of this,'' said Paul \n     Wattles, an Ercot senior analyst for market design and \n     development. ``If we can reach critical mass--and 290,000 is \n     already a pretty good number--but if that number started to \n     double or triple, you could start seeing a significant \n     shifting of load, and that is the whole point.''\n       Ms. Burks, the law firm business manager, is part of that \n     shift--and she is not motivated by environmental concerns.\n       ``I never thought about it,'' she said. In fact, she leaves \n     lights on and even the television on when she leaves the \n     room.\n       ``I'm really wasteful now,'' she said. ``The first thing I \n     tell my guests is my electricity is free after 9.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           American SAFE Act\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time as a Senator from \nMaryland, as well as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, to talk about the bill we voted on earlier today--\non the motion to proceed to the so-called SAFE Act dealing with Syrian \nrefugees. I like to call it the fear act because I think it really is \nan act that is misguided.\n  I will start by saying that the world looks to the United States, and \nwhen there are tough problems, they look to our leadership. They know \nthis country is prepared to step forward and provide the international \nleadership to deal with the toughest problems we face as a global \ncommunity.\n  The bill I call the fear act would jeopardize America's response to \none of the greatest humanitarian crises of our time, it would \njeopardize the U.S. leadership on humanitarian issues, and I think it \nwould compromise U.S. security. Let me tell my colleagues why. We face \nthe greatest crisis on refugees and displaced individuals since World \nWar II. The number is about 60 million globally who are currently \nrefugees or displaced. The largest numbers right now are coming out of \nSyria. Make no mistake about it--millions are coming out of Syria. They \nare escaping the Assad regime's barrel bombs and gases and starvation \npolicies. These are victims. These are people who are losing their \nlives because of the barbaric regime of President Assad. Our values are \nthat we respond to those issues, that we act in a responsible way, that \nwe help the international community to help those people who are trying \nto escape the persecutions of oppressive regimes.\n  The fear act would shut down the U.S. process of accepting Syrian \nrefugees. Why do I say it would shut it down? Because it would require \nthe Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence--all \nthree--to certify, on an individual basis, the ability of these \nindividuals to meet our standards to come into the United States. That \nwould require 100 certifications per day, 300 certifications total.\n  What else would they be doing? I hope the Director of the FBI is \nworking to keep our country safe and more than just dealing with the \nSyrian refugees. This would cut down and eliminate our ability to \naccept Syrian refugees.\n  Let me cite some of the numbers. The United States has accepted 2,000 \nSyrian refugees. There are millions of Syrian refugees. The total \nnumber the President has talked about is 10,000--a small fraction of \nthe total numbers who are being relocated under the Syrian refugee \nprogram. We look at the neighboring countries alone, what is being done \nin Jordan, what is being done in Lebanon, and look at what Europe is \naccepting. We are taking a very\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\nsmall burden here, and it is individuals who do not pose a threat. I \nwill explain that. Every one of us will do everything we can to make \nsure that our homeland is safe. I am prepared to do everything \nreasonable to make sure we keep Americans as safe as we possibly can \nfrom the threat of extremists.\n\n  So what do these Syrian refugees go through? By the way, there has \nnot been a reported case of a Syrian refugee in regards to terrorism. \nWhat do they go through?\n  First, they are screened by the High Commissioner for Refugees of the \nUnited Nations. They screen the individuals who are considered eligible \nto come to the United States. They go through that screening process. \nThen they are fingerprinted and go through a biometric check. They go \nthrough several layers of biographical and background screenings. They \nare individually interviewed by U.S. officials. It takes about 18 to 24 \nmonths. If you are a terrorist, you are not going to go through this.\n  It is up to the potential individual who will come to the United \nStates as a refugee to establish that they are a refugee. That means \nthey must establish that they have been a victim of the terrorist \nactivities in order to be able to get to the United States. It is up to \nthem to establish that burden. We don't accept individuals who cannot \nestablish that burden. This is not the target group that we should be \nconcerned about.\n  The real threat to our homeland security--let's take a look at others \nwho come to this country. We already did this in the omnibus bill, but \nwe know under the Visa Waiver Program there are individuals who hold \npassports of countries with which we have the Visa Waiver Program. That \nmeans they are countries that have relations with the United States, \nand we generally accept their visitors without a visa. Many of these \ncountries have foreign fighters who have gone to the affected areas \nthat could very well be involved in terrorist activities and then come \nback to the European country and come to the United States under the \nVisa Waiver Program. Well, we took some action against that in last \nyear's bill. That was good. We need to continue to scrutinize that.\n  What we saw happen in California was that we had a spouse who didn't \ncome under a Syrian waiver program or a Syrian refugee program, but who \ncame under other visa programs. That needs to be scrutinized. For \npeople who come to America, we need to know that they are not connected \nto a terrorist organization.\n  But the greatest concern is the radicalization of Americans. We need \nto know why people do what they do. We need to have a better system to \nprotect the homeland. Let's focus on the real problem areas in our \ncountry.\n  If this bill were to be passed, it would actually make us less safe. \nIt would affect our national security. Let me tell you the reason why. \nFirst, it would clearly diminish U.S. leadership. When we go and seek \ninternational support, particularly for our coalition against ISIL, our \nfailure to be willing to take any of the Syrian refugees will certainly \ncompromise America's credibility and ability to lead internationally.\n  It will be used by ISIL as propaganda. Make no mistake about that. \nThey understand that. This is what they are saying about America.\n  It is against our values. It makes us weaker as a nation.\n  It is for those reasons that we found that national security \nprofessionals from both parties, including Henry Kissinger, David \nPetraeus, Brent Scowcroft, and Michael Chertoff, all have come out in \nopposition on the grounds that it would undermine our security and \nbenefit ISIL. These are professionals. They understand the risk \nfactors.\n  What we should be doing is everything we can to protect us from the \nthreat of ISIL. That means let's figure out ways we can share \nintelligence information among all of our willing partners. Let's \nprovide the leadership, particularly in those countries in which ISIL \ncan operate, so that the governments represent all the communities, so \nthat there is not a void where the Sunni minority population feels that \ntheir only safety is with ISIL.\n  Let's make sure we cut off all the financial support for ISIL, \nincluding their oil abilities and the transport of oil. This is what \nthe Obama administration is doing. Let's make sure we do cut off any \nopportunities to expand their capacity.\n  Let's deal with foreign fighters--people who come from Western \ncountries who go to these areas and train. Let's make sure that we know \nwhere they are, and when they try to come back into one of the Western \ncountries, that they are apprehended and tried because of their \naffiliation with terrorists.\n  Let's help countries such as Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon that are \ntaking on the extreme burdens of the refugees so they can deal with \ntheir own crises that have been exaggerated because of the Syrian \nconflict and ISIL formation.\n  In other words, let us work in a coordinated way to root out the main \ncause of the terrorist activities; that is, ISIL's ability to attract \nsupporters and to gain territory. Let's take away that territory, \ncoordinate our airstrikes, and work with the local forces on the \nground. All of that should be done, and we need to work together on \nthat.\n  To concentrate on the few thousand Syrian refugees who have gone \nthrough this country's strictest vetting process makes little sense and \nwill not keep us safer, but, as I indicated before, will actually \ncompromise our national security.\n  In closing, let me state what makes this Nation the great Nation that \nit is. I think each of us knows that we are living in a special \ncountry--a country that has stood up for freedom, a country that has \nbeen looked upon as a beacon of hope around the world. Many of our \nparents and grandparents came from other countries in order to settle \nin this country because of its opportunity.\n  I am a student of history, not just because it is an effective, \nfactual counterpart to the bluster of politicians and social media \naccounts. History can be a touchstone to remind us of who we are and a \nlens through which we can see who we are. Throughout our history, we \nhave recognized that even in times of war we were fighting leaders of \nauthoritarian regimes and not their victims. From 1945 to 1952, we \nresettled 400,000 displaced persons from Nazi-controlled areas in \nEurope. In the fall of Saigon in 1997, the United States rescued \n883,000-plus refugees who fled Vietnam, a country with which we had \nbeen in a state of undeclared war that claimed 58,000 American lives. \nBetween 1970 and 1991, we resettled 200,000 Jews from the Soviet Union, \nthe very government which posed the greatest security threat the United \nStates has ever known. In addition, we have resettled hundreds of \nthousands of refugees from Cuba and other countries behind the Iron \nCurtain.\n  This Republican bill we considered today dishonors our proud history \nof providing a safe haven. History can also be harsh and unsentimental. \nThis bill risks repeating mistakes of the past when the United States \ntragically turned away Jewish refugees in World War II.\n  After the photo of Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old who was washed up on \nthe beach, was published in the news media, the American people opened \ntheir hearts to the Syrian people. The American people recognize the \ndistinction between those who are victims of terror and those who \nperpetrate it. We should not let knee-jerk reactions keep us from being \nthe beacon of hope for Syrians and other refugees in the Middle East, \nAfrica, and around the world. We should do what we do best--our values.\n  We should never compromise homeland security. We need to do \neverything we can to keep Americans safe. We need to make sure we have \nthe strictest vetting procedures for anyone who wants to come to this \ncountry as a refugee or a visitor. We could always do a better job, and \nwe have to do more to understand why Americans have been converted to \nradicalization through the Internet and what has happened on social \nmedia.\n  Yes, we need to do a much more effective job of keeping America safe \nand the homeland safe, but shutting down the Syrian refugee program \nwould be a major mistake for our values of who we are as a nation and \nfor our national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Remembering Paul Kinsman\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the life and \nlegacy of Paul Kinsman. Paul was born in Watertown, SD, on September 7, \n1958, and died in Pierre, SD, on January 10, 2016, at the young age of \n57. Paul was a lifelong South Dakotan and a dedicated public servant to \nthe citizens of our State.\n  After earning his law degree, Paul began 28 years of public service \nto the people of South Dakota. We are a better State and a better \npeople because of his hard work and his dedication.\n  As an administrative law judge, the deputy commissioner of \nadministration, the director of property taxes and special taxes, the \ncommissioner of administration, and the secretary of revenue, he \ninspired his coworkers with his intelligence, his humor, and his \ntenacity for getting things done.\n  During my 8 years working as Governor of South Dakota, Paul served as \ncommissioner of the Bureau of Administration and secretary of revenue. \nHe was a burly, teddy bear of a man. No matter how hard the problem or \nhow challenging the issue, whenever we met he had a gleam in his eyes \nand a smile on his face that told me without words that we were going \nto solve that problem or meet that challenge. And we did because of \nhim.\n  As an administrative law judge and tax collector, he earned the \nrespect and admiration of the public, even when his rulings and \napplications of law were not in their favor. He was straightforward and \nfair, which South Dakotans appreciate.\n  As the head of the Bureau of Administration, he led and championed \nmany projects that increased the efficiency of State government to \nserve the people and preserve the heritage of South Dakota in the \npeople's house, our State capitol.\n  But more important than all of his career accomplishments is the kind \nof person Paul Kinsman was. He was a loving husband, father, \ngrandfather, and friend to all who knew him. He had a tremendously \npositive impact on the many thousands of people he met and touched with \nhis kindness and generosity. With this, I welcome the opportunity to \nrecognize and commemorate the life and legacy of this public servant \nand my friend, Paul Kinsman.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                        Enemies List Regulation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, news outlets reported something today \nthat should worry all of us. Apparently, President Obama is again--one \nmore time--considering imposing his enemies list regulation by \nExecutive order, just weeks after Congress voted overwhelmingly to \npass, and the President signed into law, legislation prohibiting him \nfrom doing that very thing.\n  The enemies list regulation would inject partisan politics into the \ngovernment contracting process by allowing an organization's political \nleaning and donations to be considered. Here is the practical effect: \nAdministrations of either party could draw friends lists and enemies \nlists and then award contracts based upon whether an organization \nbacked the right horse in the last election.\n  That is the kind of thing you would expect in some banana republic \nbut not in the United States of America. So why would the President \neven attempt to impose such a bad idea?\n  Let me remind my colleagues of something the President's own Chief of \nStaff recently said. He implied that the central question President \nObama will now ask himself before imposing a policy is--listen to \nthis--``Why not?''\n  ``Why not?'' Think about that--not whether it is good for the \ncountry, not whether it is constitutional, just ``why not.''\n  If future Republican Presidents lived by this ``why not'' standard, \nDemocrats would be truly outraged. If future Republican Presidents \nignored prohibitions passed by Democratic-controlled Congresses, \nDemocrats would be outraged. When the legislature passes a prohibition \nand the President signs that prohibition into law, it is the law.\n  I hope every one of my colleagues, even those who support the idea of \nan enemies list, will join me in that sentiment at least. If it is the \nlaw, it is the law. We are always mindful that the precedents set today \ncould be wielded by a different President tomorrow.\n  The intent of the prohibition Congress passed here is absolutely \nclear, regardless of creative arguments the administration might \nconstruct to justify skirting the law.\n  If President Obama's standard these days is ``why not,'' then here \nare a few reasons why not. Here is the first: He can't do it. That \nshould really be the end of the discussion.\n  For the sake of argument, here is another reason: It is a terrible \npolicy. Just listen to what members of the President's own party have \nsaid about it. One of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate said:\n\n       Under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the award of \n     contract must be based on the evaluation of quality, price, \n     past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, \n     technical excellence and other considerations related to the \n     merits of an offer. The requirement that businesses disclose \n     political expenditures as part of the offer process creates \n     the appearance that this type of information could become a \n     factor in the award of Federal contracts.\n\n  She explained:\n\n       Requiring businesses to disclose their political activity \n     when making an offer risks injecting politics into the \n     contracting process.\n\n  The second-ranking Democratic in the House--not some back-bencher--\nsaid:\n\n       The issue of contracting ought to be on the merits of the \n     contractor's application and bid and capabilities. . . . \n     There are some serious questions as to what implications \n     there are if somehow we consider political contributions in \n     the context of awarding contracts.\n\n  He said he was ``not in agreement with the administration'' on this \nissue.\n  So, look, no one should have to worry about whether supporting a \ncertain political party or a candidate will determine their ability to \nget a Federal contract or keep their job. I hope what we read in the \npapers is not accurate.\n  The President's enemies list proposal fails even the ``why not'' test \non multiple levels:\n  No. 1, he can't.\n  No. 2, it is bad policy, as Democrats have reminded us.\n  If you need another reason, here is a third: No. 3, Congress has \nrejected these types of policies already.\n  There are plenty of reasons why the President should not attempt to \nimpose this regulation, and the President should heed them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S126-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, in 1992, the House and Senate joined \ntogether to pass a resolution designating January 16 as Religious \nFreedom Day to celebrate one of the most powerful and unique freedoms \nwithin our Nation's founding and fabric. This day is significant \nbecause it marks the passage of the 1786 Virginia Statute for Religious \nFreedom originally authored by Thomas Jefferson.\n  2016 marks the 230th anniversary of the passage of this statute that, \nas Congress recognized, ``inspired and shaped the guarantees of \nreligious freedom in the First Amendment.'' It reads in part: ``. . . \nno man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, \nplace, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced . . . in his body \nor goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious \nopinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by \nargument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that \nthe same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil \ncapacities.''\n  The Founders understood that there is a direct connection between the \nprosperity and health of a nation and its respect for human rights and \nreligious freedom. Individual faith grows\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\nwhen people live free of government coercion and control. In America, \nindividuals can practice any faith or no faith. This is true religious \nfreedom--having the freedom to practice a faith or to have no faith at \nall and to have that choice not only be respected, but protected.\n  Respecting and protecting this fundamental human right means that we \ncannot diminish it. The constitutional guarantee of the free exercise \nof religion means that people have a right to live their faith in \npublic. Saying someone has the right to worship freely at the place of \ntheir choosing is not the same thing. Additionally, while one faith \ngroup should not be favored over another, so too should we not err on \nthe side of removing faith from the public sphere and opting for no \nreligion at all.\n  Thomas Jefferson left explicit instructions that his authorship of \nthe Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom be included on his \ngravestone as one of only three things for which he wanted ``most to be \nremembered.''\n  As we celebrate the 230th anniversary of the passage of this statute, \nwhat will we be most remembered for? I hope that we can be remembered \nfor not only honoring this legacy of Thomas Jefferson, but for \nupholding a right that is fundamental to the core of this nation and to \nhuman dignity--religious freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S127-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING OFFICER RICARDO GALVEZ\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Downey police officer Ricardo Galvez, a devoted \nson and brother who was tragically killed in the line of duty on \nNovember 19, 2015.\n  Officer Galvez was born on April 2, 1986, and grew up in Whittier, \nCA. In 2006, he joined the Downey Police Department as a police aide \nand 2 years later decided to serve his country by joining the U.S. \nMarine Corps as a Reservist. After bravely serving in Iraq, Officer \nGalvez returned to Downey and became a police officer in 2010. He \ndeployed again in December 2012 to Afghanistan during Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  Those who knew Officer Galvez fondly remember him as a caring man \nwith an infectious smile, a person of great humility and kindness, and \na trusted colleague and friend who was committed to his family and \ncareer.\n  The U.S. Marine Corps' motto, Semper Fidelis, is Latin for ``always \nfaithful'' and truly embodied Officer Ricardo Galvez. He dedicated his \nentire adult life to public service, unwavering in his commitment to \ndefend Americans abroad and safeguard his community at home. His \ndevoted and courageous service earned the respect and affection of the \ncolleagues he worked alongside, the community he served, and the family \nand friends he loved. He will be deeply missed.\n  On behalf of the people of California, for whom he served so bravely, \nI extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to Ricardo's mother, \nMargarita; brother, Pedro; sisters, Nancy and Sandra; and his entire \nextended family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S127-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DIANNE BEECHER\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to commend Dianne Beecher who \nhas honorably served the people of Pennsylvania for over 28 years, most \nrecently as senior constituent advocate for my Senate office. Dianne \nhas been a trusted member of my staff and a loyal friend over the 11 \nyears we have worked together.\n  Before her years in public service, Dianne had already proven herself \nto be a kind of ``Renaissance woman.'' She dabbled in entrepreneurship, \nworked as an entertainment promoter, and spent a period of time as a \nrace car driver. While creating this unique resume, Dianne's most \nimportant and dearest role was that of a devoted mother to five \nchildren--Sharryl, Aileen, Jodi, Bradley, and Brandee. Carrying her \ncompassion for people into her professional life, Dianne found her \nniche in the pursuit of helping others. She began her career in public \nservice with the Democratic State Committee for Pennsylvania as its \npolitical director, eventually joining the Pennsylvania chapter of the \nAFL-CIO, serving as its political education coordinator.\n  Dianne originally joined my staff in the auditor general's office in \n2004; when I became State treasurer, she moved with me. In that office, \nshe assisted in creating one of the first constituent services \noperations within the treasury department. When I was later elected to \nthe U.S. Senate, Dianne continued her dedication to the people of \nPennsylvania as the senior constituent advocate on my constituent \nservices team.\n  Early in my first term as a U.S. Senator, Dianne became a vital \ncomponent in the establishment of my office's constituent services \noperation. Through her role as senior constituent advocate, Dianne has \nliterally saved the lives of countless Pennsylvanians. Over the years, \nshe managed hundreds of cases, specializing in Social Security and \nMedicare, while maintaining a genuine and unfailing commitment to each \nconstituent she encountered. Dianne has saved the health insurance \ncoverage for individuals suffering from serious illnesses, allowing \nthem to continue care and maintain their medications.\n  She is responsible for the financial stability of countless people \nunable to work due to their medical conditions. In one instance, \nDianne's work was recognized by National Public Radio when she saved a \nfamily in the midst of the 2008 housing crisis by helping them finally \nreceive retroactive benefits due from Social Security. Most constituent \nservices work goes unacknowledged by the press; however, Dianne's \ncommitment and compassion remains the same for every case in her \nportfolio. She works meticulously and regularly goes beyond the call of \nduty to provide the resources and support needed for the people of the \nCommonwealth.\n  Throughout her career, Dianne has served the people of Pennsylvania \nwith distinction and diligence. Her compassion and commitment to \nhelping others left a lasting impression not only within my office, but \nin the lives she touched through her good work. I wish her well in her \nretirement and hope she will have the opportunity to enjoy more time \nwith her children, 10 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S127-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S127-S128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING CARL SHARIF\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the life \nand legacy of New Jerseyan and proud Newarker Carl Sharif, who passed \naway on September 30 at the age of 72. Carl was a dear friend and \nmentor to me at the dawn of my career in public service. He will be \ngreatly missed by the city of Newark and by all who knew him.\n  A son of Newark, Carl began his career as an aide to Mayor Hugh \nAddonizio in the 1960s, and he remained a dedicated public servant for \nthe rest of his life. During times of great tumult and change, Carl was \na steady presence in Newark, working from within its government to \nstrengthen the city's spirit and foundation. In 1970, Carl helped to \nlead the campaign to elect Kenneth Gibson, the first Black mayor of \nNewark. He served as an aide to Mayor Gibson and as a member of \nNewark's school board, quickly becoming its president.\n  Carl was incredibly generous with his time and with his tremendous \npolitical and institutional knowledge. He served as one of my earliest \nmentors in professional politics, and he led me through my first \ncampaign for city council and my second campaign for mayor. It was Carl \nwho insisted that the key to significant and lasting change in our city \nwas through walking every street, knocking on every door, and talking \nwith every Newarker. Carl reminded all of us that we were never to \nforget the people we were elected to serve, and I will be forever \ngrateful for his wisdom, support, and advice through the years. I \ncherish all that he taught me, and I will do everything I can to honor \nhis legacy through my work and life.\n  Carl was committed to ensuring the best for Newark and all of its \npeople. He devoted himself wholly to our city and its people, and they \nloved him in return. For his family, friends, our city, and our State, \nCarl leaves a legacy of public service and unwavering faith in the \ngoodness of our community. As we reflect on this inheritance, I ask \nthat my colleagues join me in honoring Carl Sharif's love for and \nservice to his city and its people and in remembering his extraordinary \nlife.\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S128-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BLAKE WOMBOLD\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to honor Blake Wombold \nof Heart Butte, a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army Reserves, for his \ngenerous contribution of new shoes for the Heart Butte High School Boys \nbasketball team.\n  Blake was born in Browning, MT, and is an alumnus of Heart Butte High \nSchool, where there were only 19 students in his graduating class. He \nplayed basketball throughout his high school career and truly feels \nbasketball is ``king'' in Indian Country. Blake went on to graduate \nfrom Salish Kootenai College with a general science degree. He has been \nwith the Army Reserves for 7 years, is a staff sergeant, E-6, as well \nas a combat trainer/biomedical equipment technician.\n  This year marks the second year that Blake has donated new shoes to \nHeart Butte's basketball team.

HURLEY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this week Alaska's faith \ncommunities are mourning the loss of Archbishop Emeritus Francis T. \nHurley who passed on January 10, 2 days shy of his 89th birthday. \nArchbishop Hurley will be buried this weekend.\n  Archbishop Hurley was ordained a priest of the San Francisco \nArchdiocese in 1951. He came to Alaska in 1970 as the auxiliary bishop \nof Juneau and was elevated to archbishop of the Archdiocese of \nAnchorage in 1976. He served a quarter century in that role until 2001. \nArchbishop Hurley remained active in the life of Alaska's Catholics \nuntil his death. He had a remarkable career that stretched 45 years.\n  Many come to Alaska from other places and leave a few years later \nbecause they failed to take Alaska on its terms. If there is one thing \nto be said about Archbishop Hurley it is that he understood what it \ntook to be successful in our remote environment. He not only understood \nwhat it took to succeed in Alaska. He fully embraced it. He thrived on \nit.\n  No roads connect the island communities for which the auxiliary \nbishop of Juneau was responsible. Bishop Hurley might have stayed in \nJuneau and waited for his 4,000 parishioners to come to him. Instead he \nchose the road Alaskans would take. He learned to fly so that he could \nbring the church to the people, and he piloted the diocesan plane for \nmore than 5,000 hours over the course of his career.\n  During his relatively brief tenure in Juneau, Archbishop Hurley \ncreated Trays on Sleighs, an Alaska centric interpretation of the \nsenior feeding program known as Meals on Wheels.\n  He is responsible for three of the most important social service \nfacilities in Anchorage; Covenant House, which serves homeless youth; \nthe Brother Francis Shelter, which serves homeless men; and Clare \nHouse, an emergency shelter for women with children and expectant \nmothers.\n  All of these facilities exist today because Archbishop Hurley took \nthe initiative to get them built. Near and dear to the archbishop's \nheart was the ``Joy Community,'' which helped Catholics with \ndevelopmental disabilities prepare to receive the sacraments. And these \nare just a few of many legacies he has left around the State. He also \nfounded two Catholic newspapers: the Inside Passage in Juneau and the \nCatholic Anchor in Anchorage.\n  You might say that this is all part of a day's work for a Catholic \nbishop. But understand that Alaska is a very young State and lacks the \ninfrastructure of more established provinces. What Archbishop Hurley \ndid is identify the gaps in the social safety net and move forward with \na single-minded determination to fill them.\n  Archbishop Hurley's contributions were international in scope. In \nDecember 1990, he traveled with Father Michael Shields to Magadan--a \ncity in the Russian far east. In a theater, they offered Christmas \nmass--the first public mass in the city's history. Three hundred people \nattended.\n  In the following 3 weeks, signatures were gathered to register a new \nchurch, and on January 4, 1991, the Church of the Nativity of Jesus was \nfounded. Across the years, Archbishop Hurley traveled there nine times \nand, on January 14, 2001, celebrated the parish's 10th anniversary.\n  As you can see, Archbishop Hurley's contributions were quite \nsubstantial. Yet he was much more than what he did. Archbishop Hurley \nwas beloved for whom he was. He was a charming man with a tremendous \nsense of humor and a knack for remembering names. He was an engaging \nconversationalist. At times, it seemed like he was everywhere; at \nbaptisms, at funerals, engaged in the political life of the community, \ntending to the needs of the homeless and the troubled. From the moment \nhe came to Alaska, Archbishop Hurley was a man in motion, and even in \nretirement, he never slowed down.\n  Archbishop Hurley, respected by people of all faiths, was truly a \ncentral figure in the spiritual lives of Alaskans for nearly a half \ncentury. Every time I pass one of the churches that were built on his \nwatch or the social services facilities he inspired, I will smile and \nreflect on how blessed I was to know him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S128-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S128-S129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING VERMONT ESSAY WINNERS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, since 2010 I have sponsored a \nState of the Union essay contest for Vermont students. The contest, now \nin its sixth year, is an opportunity for Vermont's high school students \nto articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President \nof the United States. A panel of Vermont teachers reviewed all of the \nessays submitted and selected the top 20. I am proud to say that nearly \n800 students wrote essays for this year's State of the Union contest.\n  I would like to congratulate each and every finalist and to \nspecifically acknowledge Meredith Holbrook as this year's winner of the \ncontest. I would also like to recognize Vivian Huang for placing second \nand Ryan Racicot for placing third. I ask to have printed in the Record \ncopies of the winning essays.\n  The material follows:\n\n             Meredith Holbrook, Milton High School (Winner)\n\n       My fellow Americans, today the United States has the \n     strongest military in the world. Our nation has the number \n     one economy. We have the longest running democratic \n     government in history. If we want to be considered the \n     greatest in the world, the home of the free, the land of \n     opportunity, then we must face the challenges before us.\n       In 2014, 48.1 million Americans lived in food insecure \n     homes, of this, 15.3 million were children. This equates to \n     14 percent of households being food insecure. How can the \n     wealthiest nation in the world be unable to feed its hungry? \n     We have the full capability of providing for those in need. \n     We should not allow politics to stop us from caring for our \n     citizens in need. It is impossible to expect the people of \n     this country to be functioning members of society without \n     adequate nourishment. The solution to this problem is simple: \n     feed America's hungry. I believe that if we were to create a \n     cabinet level agency dedicated specifically to food-\n     insecurity, we would be bettering the common good of America. \n     Devoting ten billion dollars from the federal budget would \n     make a tremendous improvement in the number of food-insecure \n     homes. It may be a bold move to make, but our nation cannot \n     move forward until our people are no longer hungry.\n       Alongside hunger is homelessness. On one given night in \n     America, about 560,000 citizens are homeless, and about \n     200,000 of those people are in families. It should be the \n     basic right of our people to have shelter and security. The \n     wound of homelessness cannot be solved with night time \n     shelters. Homeless people must be provided with long-term \n     shelters if they are ever to be productive members of \n     society. In order to solve this issue, we must invest in job \n     counseling. Many homeless citizens are homeless due to the \n     inability to acquire a job. If people had the chance to have \n     a clean interview outfit, as well as proper interview \n     instruction, there would not be as many people sleeping on \n     the streets. In order to make this happen, we must have more \n     people trained in the expertise of job counseling, and more \n     programs helping to aid homeless citizens. Again, this would \n     mean funding such programs. A small cost to pay to get \n     Americans off the streets.\n       How a nation treats its elderly says a lot about its \n     character. We will not be a nation that ignores the needs of \n     its senior citizens. Today, many seniors cannot comfortably \n     retire. They are often forced to choose between\n\n[[Page S129]]\n\n     paying for food or, paying for medication. They will go \n     without heat because they cannot afford to buy fuel. The \n     source of this issue is Social Security. Although this \n     retirement system has benefited many Americans, it needs to \n     be changed. Social Security often does not change with \n     inflation, or does not change enough to account for increased \n     prices. While prices are rising, Social Security is not \n     keeping up. This leaves seniors to make difficult choices \n     regarding spending. Every year, Social Security should be \n     assessed, and changed accordingly to inflation. To pay for \n     this, we would need to raise the Social Security tax \n     percentage to seven percent. This would allow America to \n     adequately pay for the needs of our elderly.\n       This nation is nowhere near perfect. We have many issues we \n     must address, domestic and foreign. We cannot expect to \n     properly address issues overseas, until we fix the home we \n     live in. We must fix America from within. Once we do this, we \n     will truly be able to call ourselves the greatest nation in \n     the world.\n\n       Vivian Huang, South Burlington High School (Second Place)\n\n       The year of 2015 has been historic for the United States of \n     America. We have signed a landmark agreement on climate \n     change, enacted marriage equality, and become economically \n     sound--marking greater economic growth rates than predicted \n     and reaching a five percent unemployment rate. Still, we \n     enter the year of 2016 with two pressing issues remaining on \n     the global and the national scale: terrorism and healthcare. \n     As we tackle these issues, we must remind ourselves that the \n     United States of America is truly one nation, indivisible, \n     with each citizen carrying responsibilities to support our \n     nation's values, as well as one another.\n       First, following recent acts of terror around the world, it \n     is top-priority for the United States to defeat the threat of \n     ISIS. Enough is enough. Rest assured that rather than sending \n     our troops to combat zones in Iraq and Syria, we will take an \n     active role in helping our European allies lead the battle. \n     America must provide rigorous train-and-assist programs for \n     Kurdish forces, exert a tight grip on ISIS-controlled \n     territory, cut off supply lines, and implore the Gulf States \n     to combat terrorism. Furthermore, previous experiences in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan have revealed that merely destroying one \n     source of terrorism will not suffice. To ultimately render \n     counterterrorism and military action unnecessary in Iraq and \n     Syria, we plan on developing political, economic, and \n     educational reforms that will effectively respond to complex \n     sectarian and ethnic divisions in the region.\n       Let's make it clear that the United States is not declaring \n     a war against religion, but rather against the violence of \n     extremism. As human beings, it is our responsibility to help \n     the innocent Syrian families fleeing ISIS and Assad's brutal \n     regime. Now is not the time to turn our backs, but to provide \n     humanitarian aid and shelter, even though it requires extreme \n     vigilance. Additionally, every American must confront the \n     problem of bigotry, which only becomes exploited by ISIS for \n     its own recruitment. We all have the duty to stand up against \n     discriminatory rhetoric and hostile actions. We all have the \n     duty to uphold the country's values by supporting each \n     other--our friends, neighbors, co-workers, and fellow \n     community members--with tolerance and respect.\n       Second, an important issue on the domestic front continues \n     to be healthcare. Physical and mental wellness is a \n     fundamental need for the American people. Over the past year, \n     the Affordable Care Act has improved access to this basic \n     human right for the uninsured. However, there is more to \n     accomplish in 2016. Until completely comprehensive universal \n     healthcare--namely, a single-payer system--is set into place, \n     Medicaid must be expanded in 20 remaining states and \n     community health clinics must be placed in underserved \n     locations.\n       The Department of Health and Human Services must address \n     the chief drivers of healthcare costs; hospital expenditures, \n     physician and clinical services, and skyrocketing drug prices \n     escalate the national health spending. To target this broad \n     problem, a single-payer healthcare system will minimize \n     unnecessary spending by requiring hospitals to operate on \n     government-approved standardized billing procedures. Hence, \n     hospitals and pharmaceutical companies will not be able to \n     overcharge patients and run extortionate monopolies on \n     essential medications.\n       Indeed, American citizens' rugged bravery, wise judgment, \n     and drive for excellence have made this country great. But we \n     can always progress forward, as long we stand united. \n     Therefore, we will tackle the urgent issues of terrorism and \n     healthcare not only with confidence, but also with the \n     ambition to remain one nation, indivisible, with liberty and \n     justice for all.\n\n             Ryan Racicot, Milton High School (Third Place)\n\n       The most pressing and immediate danger of today's society \n     is the rapidly changing climate. The scientific community \n     agrees virtually unanimously, that climate change is a very \n     real and imminent concern. Continuation down the current path \n     at this pace will eventually result in the ultimate demise of \n     the human race.\n       This issue is not the United States' to tackle alone. In \n     order to fully reverse the effects of climate change, it will \n     take a worldwide collaborative effort unlike anything the \n     world has ever faced before. The United States' role going \n     forward is to set an example for other first world countries. \n     The United Nations' conference this year in Paris was a step \n     in the right direction. But the United States needs to agree \n     to a binding commitment to reduce emissions. Without a whole-\n     hearted promise to abide to these reductions, the United \n     States will not be taken seriously on this issue.\n       The United States government cannot expect corporations to \n     make eco-friendly movements unprovoked, it is simply not \n     worth the financial burden. The federal government needs to \n     incentivize eco-friendly waste management for businesses, by \n     making eco-friendly business more profitable than \n     environmentally irresponsible business. As it stands now, no \n     company has motivation to protect the environment. Doing so \n     only hurts production and makes them less competitive. To \n     reverse this trend, the federal government needs to enforce \n     pre-existing environmental laws and spend more on \n     environmental saving measures.\n       To convert all factories to updated standards for \n     emissions, a large amount of money will be needed initially, \n     but over time, a system in which clean energy is valued more \n     than profit will result in a much more sustainable economy. \n     Companies who destroy the environment and experience greater \n     profit as a result will be forced to pay for their own \n     pollution management systems. Greatly increasing taxes on \n     environmentally irresponsible corporations will make clean \n     energy more fiscally appealing than polluting means of \n     energy. This is not stealing money from the American people \n     or a redistribution of wealth. This is using money made by \n     multi-billion dollar companies at the expense of the \n     environment to help fix the problem they themselves helped to \n     create. Also, by taking the charge on creating \n     environmentally friendly products and machinery, the \n     potential for the United States to make a profit is huge. By \n     incentivizing other countries to go eco-friendly, and selling \n     the materials and means to do so creates jobs and income, \n     which boosts the U.S. economy, all without destroying the \n     environment.\n       Unlike many other issues troubling the state of Vermont, \n     the nation, and the world, climate change affects every \n     single person. Regardless of race, gender, sexuality, \n     socioeconomic status, religion, education or political \n     affiliation, climate change affects all, especially the most \n     disadvantaged. Because of this, it is everyone's personal \n     responsibility to do their part in saving the planet. One \n     cannot stand idle and expect other people do all of the dirty \n     work. Helping to save the earth is not about how you can \n     benefit, it is about how you can help the greater cause. We \n     can no longer allow large corporations to prioritize making a \n     profit over responsible waste management. The short-term \n     profits for the rich are vastly outweighed by the long-term \n     environmental consequences felt by all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S129-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TERESA THOMPSON\n\n Mr. THUNE.

The rule, which is a product of extensive public \ninvolvement and years of work, is critical to our efforts to protect \nthe Nation's waters and keep them clean; is responsive to calls for \nrulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders; and \nis consistent with decisions of the United States Supreme Court.\n  We must protect the waters that are vital for the health of our \ncommunities and the success of our businesses, agriculture, and energy \ndevelopment. As I have noted before, too many of our waters have been \nleft vulnerable. Pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers, \nlakes, reservoirs, and coastal waters near which most Americans live \nand on which they depend for their drinking water, recreation, and \neconomic development. Clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act helps \nto protect these resources and safeguard public health. Because this \nresolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and \ndeny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity \nneeded to invest in projects that rely on clean water, I cannot support \nit. I am therefore vetoing this resolution.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 19, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S130-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the first time:\n\n       S.J.

          \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Coats, Mr. Hatch, \n        and Mrs. Ernst):\n  S.J. Res. 29. A joint resolution to authorize the use of United \nStates Armed Forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \nand its associated forces; read the first time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the joint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas the terrorist organization referred to as the \n     Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and various other names \n     (referred to in this joint resolution as ``ISIL'') has been \n     systematically targeting, kidnapping, and killing innocent \n     men, women, and children throughout Iraq and Syria, continues \n     to expand its terror influence, and is responsible for recent \n     attacks in Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, and France;\n       Whereas foreign fighters, undeterred by the more than 60-\n     nation coalition operating against ISIL, continue to join the \n     ranks of ISIL with the goal of establishing a caliphate;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 2014, President Barack Obama stated \n     that ``ISIL poses a threat to the Iraqi people, to the \n     region, and to U.S. interests'';\n       Whereas, on August 19, 2014, ISIL released a video of the \n     beheading of an American journalist, James Foley, and \n     threatened to kill more Americans;\n       Whereas, on September 2, 2014, ISIL released a second \n     video, of the beheading of an Israeli-American journalist, \n     Steven Sotloff, and again threatened to kill more;\n       Whereas a Central Intelligence Agency assessment in \n     September 2014 estimated that ISIL can muster as many as \n     31,500 fighters in Syria and Iraq alone;\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2014, ISIL released yet another \n     video of militant ``Jihadi John'' standing over the severed \n     head of former Army Ranger Peter Kassig;\n       Whereas Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler, a member of a \n     United States Special Forces operations team, was killed \n     during a daring raid on an ISIL stronghold in Iraq to rescue \n     70 prisoners who were slated to be executed;\n       Whereas American hostage Kayla Mueller, a 26-year-old \n     female, was kidnapped and repeatedly raped for almost 18 \n     months by the leader of ISIL, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi;\n       Whereas, on November 13, 2015, ISIL carried out a \n     coordinated attack on Paris, France, killing more than 129 \n     people from at least 14 different countries, including \n     American student Nohemi Gonzalez;\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2015, Central Intelligence Agency \n     Director Brennan warned, following ISIL's horrific terrorist \n     in Paris, that the attack was likely ``not the only operation \n     that ISIL has in the pipeline'';\n       Whereas, on August 18, 2014, Pope Francis said that the \n     international community would be justified in stopping ISIL;\n       Whereas, on August 21, 2014, former Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff General Dempsey stated that ISIL ``has an \n     apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will \n     eventually have to be defeated'';\n       Whereas, on September 16, 2014, former Secretary of Defense \n     Hagel testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate that ``if left unchecked, ISIL will directly threaten \n     our homeland and our allies'';\n       Whereas, on September 17, 2014, during a hearing of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, Secretary of \n     State Kerry stated that ``ISIL must be defeated. Period. End \n     of story.'';\n       Whereas, on March 13, 2015, Central Intelligence Agency \n     Director Brennan stated, ``ISIL is well-armed and well-\n     financed. Its fighters are disciplined, committed, and \n     battle-hardened. Left unchecked, the group\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\n     would pose a serious danger not only to Syria and Iraq, but \n     to the wider region beyond, including the threat of attacks \n     in the homelands of the United States and our partners.'';\n       Whereas, on July 23, 2015, Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     Director Comey stated that ``[t]he threat that ISIL presents \n     to the United States is very different in kind, in type, in \n     degree than al Qaeda. ISIL is not your parent's al Qaeda, \n     it's a very different model. And by virtue of that model, \n     it's currently the threat that we are worried about in the \n     homeland most of all'';\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2015, following the attacks on \n     Paris, France, ISIL released a video threatening to ``strike \n     America at its center in Washington'';\n       Whereas, on November 17, 2015, former Secretary of Defense \n     Panetta warned that countering the threat posed by ISIL \n     ``isn't about containment. It is about defeating ISIS. I \n     think if there's anything we ought to understand from these \n     last events [in Paris], it's that we have to go to war \n     against this brutal enemy'';\n       Whereas after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     Congress authorized the use of military force against al \n     Qaeda;\n       Whereas ISIL poses a direct threat to the United States \n     homeland that is equal to or greater than the threat posed by \n     al Qaeda prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001;\n       Whereas, although nothing in this joint resolution limits \n     the authorities of the President under article 2 of the \n     Constitution of the United States, Justice Robert H. Jackson \n     wrote in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 \n     (1952) that ``[w]hen the President acts pursuant to an \n     express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority \n     is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in \n     his own right plus all that Congress can delegate''; and\n       Whereas ISIL, through the use of social media and its \n     online magazine, Dabiq, seeks to radicalize Americans and to \n     inspire attacks within the homeland: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force Against the Islamic State of Iraq \n     and the Levant and its Associated Forces''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President is authorized to use all \n     necessary and appropriate force in order to defend the \n     national security of the United States against the continuing \n     threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, its \n     associated forces, organizations, and persons, and any \n     successor organizations.\n       (b) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. \n     1457(a)(1)), Congress declares that this section is intended \n     to constitute specific statutory authorization within the \n     meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     joint resolution supercedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Reports.--Not less frequently than once every 60 days, \n     the President shall submit a report to Congress on matters \n     relevant to this joint resolution, including actions taken \n     pursuant to the exercise of authority granted under section \n     2.\n       (b) Single Consolidated Report.--To the extent that the \n     submission of any report described in subsection (a) \n     coincides with the submission of any other report on matters \n     relevant to this joint resolution otherwise required to be \n     submitted to Congress pursuant to the reporting requirements \n     of the War Powers Resolution, all such reports may be \n     submitted as a single consolidated report to Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S134-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 346--EXPRESSING OPPOSITION TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION \n   INTERPRETIVE NOTICE REGARDING LABELING ISRAELI PRODUCTS AND GOODS \n    MANUFACTURED IN THE WEST BANK AND OTHER AREAS, AS SUCH ACTIONS \n            UNDERMINE THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Risch) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 346\n\n       Whereas the United States supports a negotiated solution to \n     the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states, a \n     democratic, Jewish State of Israel and a viable, democratic \n     Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace, security, \n     and mutual recognition;\n       Whereas a true and lasting peace between Israel and the \n     Palestinians can only be established through direct \n     negotiations regarding outstanding issues between Israel and \n     the recognized leadership of the Palestinian people, the \n     Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas a true and lasting peace between Israel and the \n     Palestinians is in the national security interests of the \n     United States and necessary to ensure the safety and security \n     of Israel;\n       Whereas the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions \n     (BDS) movement has called on the European Commission to go \n     beyond labeling guidelines and implement a ban on the import \n     of products of Israeli companies that operate in the West \n     Bank and other areas;\n       Whereas politically motivated acts of boycott, divestment \n     from, and sanctions against Israel represent a concerted \n     effort to extract concessions from Israel outside of direct \n     negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, and \n     undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated two-state solution;\n       Whereas the United States has long opposed efforts to \n     impose solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict outside \n     of direct negotiations between the two parties;\n       Whereas the United States has historically been at the \n     forefront of combating economic pressure against Israel and \n     has enacted legislation to counter both the Arab League \n     Boycott of Israel and the BDS movement;\n       Whereas one-sided actions, such as singling out Israeli \n     products, serves to encourage and prompt consumers to boycott \n     Israeli products and goods manufactured in the West Bank and \n     other areas;\n       Whereas section 102(b) of the Bipartisan Congressional \n     Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (title I of \n     Public Law 114-26; 19 U.S.C. 4201(b)) states that the United \n     States should discourage potential trading partners from \n     adopting policies to limit trade or investment relations with \n     Israel when negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and \n     Investment Partnership with European countries;\n       Whereas the United States and the European Union have \n     historically worked in coordination to bring an end to the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict; and\n       Whereas multiple Untied States legislatures have enacted \n     measures to confront politically motivated acts of boycott, \n     divestment from, and sanctions against Israel, including \n     Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, South Carolina, and New York: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses opposition to the European Commission \n     interpretive notice regarding labeling Israeli products and \n     goods manufactured in the West Bank and other areas, as such \n     actions undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated Israeli-\n     Palestinian peace process;\n       (2) opposes politically motivated acts of boycott, \n     divestment from, and sanctions against Israel or Israeli-\n     controlled territory;\n       (3) calls upon the European Commission, the Council of the \n     European Union, and the European Parliament to oppose any \n     boycott, divestment, or sanctions initiatives aimed at \n     singling out Israel, to refrain from actions \n     counterproductive to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian \n     conflict, and to work on bringing the parties back to the \n     negotiating table;\n       (4) encourages European Union member states to exert \n     prudence in the implementation of the European Union labeling \n     guidelines regarding Israeli products and goods manufactured \n     in the West Bank and other areas;\n       (5) urges the President to increase the use of the voice, \n     vote, and influence of the United States in international \n     organizations and other appropriate international forums to \n     actively oppose politically motivated acts of boycott, \n     divestment from, and sanctions against Israel;\n       (6) supports efforts by United States State legislatures to \n     enact measures that oppose politically motivated acts of \n     boycott, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel; and\n       (7) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated solution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states, \n     a democratic, Jewish State of Israel and a viable, democratic \n     Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace, security, \n     and mutual recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/20/senate-section/article/S134-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S134-S135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 347--HONORING THE MEMORY AND LEGACY OF ANITA ASHOK \nDATAR AND CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN BAMAKO, MALI, ON NOVEMBER \n                                20, 2015\n\n  Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Menendez, Ms. \nWarren, Mr. Markey, Mr. Warner, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nBlumenthal, and Mr. Coons) submitted the following resolution;
