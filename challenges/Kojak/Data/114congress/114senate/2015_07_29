Mr. President, late nights, vigorous legislating, and \nsometimes unpredictable outcomes may make some reach for the aspirin, \nbut these are the hallmarks of a functioning Congress.\n  The push-and-pull between different parties, different Members, and \ndifferent Chambers is all part of the democratic rhythm. That is \nespecially true when you are talking about a measure as complicated and \nconsequential as a multiyear highway bill.\n  I am pleased to see Republicans and Democrats continuing to hold \ntogether to pass the Senate's bipartisan highway legislation. We are on \nthe verge of scoring another important victory for the American people.\n  Once the Senate completes its work on the bill, the House of \nRepresentatives will begin its work on a multiyear measure as well. A \nmultiyear bill is now our joint goal. That is important for our \ncountry. We know it represents the best way to provide State and local \ngovernments with the kind of certainty they need to focus on longer \nterm road and bridge projects.\n  Here is how Kentucky's main transportation advocacy group, \nKentuckians for Better Transportation, put it: A longer term bill would \n``provide an opportunity to plan for and implement projects that are \nimportant to Kentucky's citizens and Kentucky's economy--and to every \nother state in the nation.''\n  We will conference the legislation we pass with what the House passes \nand then send a unified bill to President Obama. In the meantime, we \nwill work with our friends in the House to pass a measure that will \ngive them the space they need to develop a multiyear highway bill. It \nis also a measure that would deliver some important relief to our \nveterans by covering unfunded requirements the administration failed to \nbudget for. It would also extend a helping hand to heroes who need it.\n  I can't see a reason any Senator would vote against it. We will take \nup that bill once the House sends it to us. We will continue working in \nthe interim to finish our own bipartisan, multiyear highway bill--a \nbill that is fiscally responsible and will not raise taxes by a penny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6089-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6089-S6090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the \nongoing revelations about Planned Parenthood are more than just \ndisturbing. They literally shock the conscience. A Democratic colleague \ncalled them ``very troubling,'' ``extremely troubling,'' and ``highly \ntroubling.''\n  Next week, every Member of his party will have a chance to join us in \nreaffirming the Senate's commitment to genuine compassion and to \nwomen's health. We introduced legislation last night that would ensure \ntaxpayer dollars for women's health are spent on women's health, not a \nscandal-plagued political lobbying giant.\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\n  It is a simple choice: Senators can either vote to protect women's \nhealth or they can vote to protect subsidies for a political group \nmired in scandal.\n  I know Planned Parenthood's entrenched lobbyists have been close \nallies of Democrats in recent years, but this moment calls for Senators \nto rise higher and to think bigger.\n  Let's not filibuster women's health in order to protect special \nsubsidies for one scandal-plagued political organization.

Mr. President, the Republican legislation to attack women's \nhealth is disguised as a way to help women. We have to look long and \nhard to find those people who are being taken care of across the \ncountry today because of programs that allow them to go to someone who \nknows what they are talking about when they are concerned about their \nfertility, they are concerned about birth control, and a myriad of \nother problems that happen as women go through life.\n  The Republican bill pretends to be for women's health, but it would \nprohibit Federal funds to go to an organization that is the health care \nbackbone for American women during their lives. In fact, it is the only \nhealth care that a significant number of women get. For about 30 \npercent of women, that is their health care. You can disguise this by \ngiving fancy titles to the legislation any way you want. This is an \nattack on women's health.\n  It is stunning to me that the 16 people who are running for President \nare out there going after immigration. They are going after not only \nimmigration generally but specifically. These young men and women who \ncame to America--and the face of this picture in Nevada is a woman by \nthe name of Astrid Silva, who came here as a little girl with her \nmother in a boat across the Rio Grande River with her little doll and \nher rosary beads that she didn't understand--a little, little girl. She \nknew no other country. What do the Republicans want to do? They want to \ndeport Astrid Silva, a woman who finally because of the courageous \naction of President Obama--because Republicans refused do anything on \nimmigration--was allowed to get her driver's license, to fly in an \nairplane for the first time, to be able to go to the airport without \nfear of being arrested, and they want to do away with that. But that is \nnot enough.\n  Most of them want to privatize Social Security; they want to change \nit in some significant way. It is led by one President's son, one \nPresident's brother who basically said we have to change Medicare, as \nhe was speaking to the Koch brothers.\n  We are working, trying to get the Ex-Im Bank that affects the lives \nof 165,000 working Americans. Most of the Republicans want to get rid \nof that. Now the program is out of sync. It has expired.\n  The environment. Don't worry about it; it is fine. The icecaps are \nmelting in the Arctic. Don't worry about it. We have the worst fires in \nthe history of Alaska because of climate change. Don't worry about it; \nit is only 5 million acres that burned this summer so far. The droughts \nare affecting all of America but especially the West. It is so bad in \nthe West that in the Sierras there are bears that don't even hibernate \nanymore. It is not cold enough. In New Hampshire, moose are dying. \nAbout one-third of them are dead because of fleas and ticks. Why? \nBecause it is not cold enough to kill them anymore. These little pests \nare ravaging these huge animals.\n  I could go on, but I am going to stop, other than to say, in addition \nto all of that, now they are after women's health.\n  I hope they understand the pretty posters and the fancy words--no \nmatter how you package it--are an attack on women. Indirectly, it is an \nattack on my daughter, my wife, and my grandchildren directly. I should \nsay my granddaughters directly. I have a few of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6090-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6090-S6091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Constitution is very clear. It says the \nGovernment cannot spend a penny without an appropriations law--a law \ndealing with appropriations.\n  I am so fortunate, when I came to the Senate, I became a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I loved working on the Appropriations \nCommittee. Under John Stennis from Mississippi, Robert Byrd from West \nVirginia, and Dan Inouye from Hawaii, it was a wonderful process.\n  I have this job. I got off the committee, which was very hard for me \nto do because I loved that committee. We worked very hard every year to \nfund every one of those 12 appropriations bills. We did it because we \nwere legislators. We compromised. We worked together to fund this \ngovernment, but all of that is gone.\n  Republicans do not work with us on appropriations bills. We don't do \nthem anymore. This season of Republicanism is more than I can hardly \nunderstand. I certainly don't appreciate it. No job is more important \nin the Constitution than exercising the power of the purse. That is our \nresponsibility, but that has been taken away from us by convoluted \nmethods.\n  I know my Republican colleagues will get up and say we have to do \nsomething about this terrible debt. Seated next to me in this august \nChamber of the Senate is a man who is the senior Senator from Illinois. \nI have said this before, and I will say it again. The reason I mention \nhis name is because I knew we needed to do something about the debt. I \narranged a long trip--my first job as leader--to Central and South \nAmerica, and I took Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire, who is \nan expert on the finances of this government, and a Democratic \ncounterpart, Kent Conrad, who is just as good. They worked on that \nairplane side by side for 14 hours and worked up a plan. What they came \nup with was so brilliant. They said: What we are going to do is have a \nplan just like the base closings.\n\n  The base closing commissions that were set up--we did two rounds of \nthem--got rid of military bases in the country that we were trying to \nget rid of prior to World War II. We were able to do that, and as a \nresult, we saved the country billions and billions of dollars.\n  They introduced legislation that said that we are going to have a \ncommission appointed. There will be legislators, and there will be \npeople the President appoints and people from the outside. They will \nreport to us, and there will be no filibusters, no amendments, and we \nwill have an up-or-down vote. It was a great piece of legislation.\n  When I brought that legislation to the floor, seven Republican \nSenators who cosponsored the legislation refused to vote for it, and we \nweren't able to move forward on it. Now I get to my friend from \nIllinois. I had the ability to appoint three Members of my caucus to be \non the Bowles-Simpson Commission. The President did that because what \nJudd Gregg and Kent Conrad tried to do failed. To his credit, he did \nthat. I needed a liberal. My friend and I are not afraid to use that \nterm--a progressive, if that makes people feel better. He didn't want \nto do that. He did it because it was the best thing for this \ninstitution. He sat through days and days of hearings and became a \nbeliever that we had to do something about the debt. He voted for \nsomething that Republicans didn't vote for--to do something about the \ndebt.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer and to everybody within the sound of \nmy voice: We have done something since then. We have reduced the debt \nof this country by $4 trillion. That doesn't mean we don't have a lot \nmore to do. But what virtually all economists tell us is that we are at \na point now where we have to start spending some money.\n  My friend from California has worked hard on this highway bill. It \nwas hard for her to do that because the Republicans weren't allowing \nher to come up with any new revenue.\n  Anyway, my point is this: The Republicans are failing their most \nimportant job, and that is helping us come up with some spending \nprograms. We called on the Republicans to get serious about budgeting. \nThey have refused. We have pleaded with them to\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\nsit down and negotiate a long-term bipartisan plan to avoid another \nshutdown. From the start, it has been clear that Republicans are not \nserious about governing.\n  A party that is serious about governing does not do the things they \nhave done. For example, in the wake of mass shootings by individuals--\nit is in every newspaper in the country, and it has been for weeks. \nThere were new deaths in Tennessee and Colorado. It doesn't matter. I \nam sorry to say that we have lost track of where they all are.\n  Even after these mass shootings, Republicans still want to cut our \nfunding for mental health services. Gee-whiz--how could they do that? \nThe Republican bill cuts funding for substance abuse and mental health \nservices. They blocked research for funding for the Centers for Disease \nControl to study the cause and effect of gun violence. They are cutting \nfunding for counseling programs in elementary and secondary schools. \nThat is only on one subject. A party that is serious about governing \ndoesn't cut critical funding to our Nation's security. They have cut \nfunding for the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol and Firearms, they cut \nfunding to vital cyber-security upgrades and financial agencies. They \ncut funding for U.S. marshals, the brave men and women who helped to \ncatch those two murderers who escaped from the prison in New York.\n  A party that is serious about governing doesn't wage war against our \nNation's infrastructure. They have cut funding for the Nation's \nelectric grid by 40 percent, leaving our utilities susceptible to cyber \nattacks. Senate Republicans have cut transit projects all across this \ncountry. They have cut funding of the air traffic control system. The \nlist is endless. There are cuts to education, women's health, \nagriculture, energy, and job training.\n  If the Republican leader and the Speaker wanted to get serious about \ngoverning, they would sit down with us and craft a bipartisan \ncompromise to prevent another government shutdown.\n  On the bill before us, the Speaker of the House of Representatives \nhas referred to that bill by using a very derogatory word which starts \nwith the letter ``s.'' If the Republican leader and the Speaker want to \nget serious about governing, then they need to sit down with us so we \ncan craft a bipartisan compromise to prevent another government \nshutdown. Instead they have already given up. Both the Speaker and the \nRepublican leader have said that what we are going to do is abandon the \nappropriations process in favor of a continuing resolution, which is a \nbuzzword for failure. Failure is another word for a government \nshutdown. It is another way to close our government.\n  By relying on a continuing resolution, it leaves in place sequester \ncuts and underfunds critical priorities for working American families. \nRepublicans are neglecting their responsibilities. They are not showing \nup for work. It doesn't have to be this way. We have time to come up \nwith a balanced solution to keep our government funded. We have 2 \nmonths to come together, but a CR will not work. Sequestration will \nkick in, and it will harm every agency in the government. It will \nespecially hurt the middle class of our country. If they are serious \nabout governing, they will work together with us on appropriations \nbills rather than ignore us.\n  Republicans need to sit down and get to work on their most important \njob, as is dictated by the Constitution.\n  I apologize to everyone for taking more time than I normally do, but \nit was brought about by my friend the Republican leader.\n  I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6091-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 10 \na.m. will be divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had some time reserved, and I am halfway \nthrough that time now. So I will talk a little faster than usual \nbecause we have an Armed Services meeting right now, and we are trying \nget to the bottom of this side agreement that was apparently made with \nIran.\n  I wish to applaud the Senate for taking another step, and that is \nwhat we are going to be doing in just a few minutes with the DRIVE Act \nin Congress with these votes, and tomorrow we expect to see a final \nvote for passage so we can send it to the House. This will be my sixth \nreauthorization over the past number of years. These bills are all \nabout compromise. It is hard to do. There are a lot of Members of this \nbody who didn't think they got what they wanted in this bill, and I \nhave to say that I didn't get what I wanted. I suspect that the \noccupier of the chair didn't get what he wanted, and Senator Boxer \ndidn't get what she wanted. That is not the way this works because this \nis a bill to get us away from the short-term extensions.\n  It has been obvious that Members of this body are opposed to moving \nto a 6-year reauthorization bill and are willing to use any procedural \nmeans to slow it down, and that is what happened. If we had not dragged \non yesterday, and if we had yielded back some of the time, we could \nhave had these votes that we are about to have now yesterday. If we had \ndone that, we could have final passage today, and it would be sent over \nto the House before they leave. They are going to leave. That doesn't \nmean that this is not important. What we are doing today and tomorrow \nis passing this bill. Even though the House is going home, they all \nagree that we need a good, long-term bill as soon as they get back. \nThat is why we have a motion before us for a short-term delay--so they \nwill have time to do it.\n  We will have a good bill for them. We have worked on it for several \nmonths. It passed out of committee unanimously. Every Republican and \nevery Democrat voted for it. We will have a chance to do that.\n  Also, I have State sheets on every State. I can read off how every \nState benefits from this 6-year reauthorization bill. All you have to \ndo is talk to the Governors, mayors, and the departments of \ntransportation across the country. They fully expected Congress only to \ndeliver piecemeal extensions, as we have in the past.\n  We have to keep in mind that the last reauthorization bill that we \nhad was in 2005. I remember that vividly because I was the author of \nthe bill. When we passed it, everyone rejoiced. Yesterday the Senator \nfrom Minnesota was talking about the tragedy of the fallen bridge in \nMinnesota, where 13 people died. I told the story about how a bridge in \nOklahoma City had a chunk of concrete fall off of it and hit a mother \nof three children and kill her. You don't want to wait until this \nhappens.\n  We have bridges in this country--and we have talked about each one of \nthem on the Senate floor during the discussion on this bill--that are \ndeteriorating, and we have to do something about it.\n  If any Member or the staff of any Member--I know the staffs are all\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\nwatching right now. We have every State listed on these sheets, and it \nshows what they will have and how they will benefit from the DRIVE Act, \nwhich will be before us in a moment. If we don't do it, there are \nconsequences, and I have to remind everyone of that today as we \napproach a shutdown of the transit programs. I urge my colleagues to \njoin in voting yes on this procedural hurdle today. If you vote no, you \nare reinforcing current laws and extensions, which is the worst \npossible outcome.\n  One area deals with big projects. We cannot do big projects with 3-\nmonth, 4-month or even 1-year extensions. We have gone through 33 \nshort-term extensions since the SAFETEA-LU bill was passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have the problem of not having any of the big \nprojects, and everyone knows that is a problem. The reason big projects \ncan't be done is due to the costs. But a study has been done by Gary \nRidley, who is one of the foremost authorities nationwide on this \nsubject, and in that study he came to the conclusion that it costs an \nadditional 30 percent off the top to do short-term extensions.\n  If there is anyone who is a conservative and wants to take the \nconservative position on this issue, the conservative position is to \nvote for a long-term reauthorization bill, and that is what is before \nus now. The current funding has no growth--not even for inflation. The \nDRIVE Act provides growth in the highway and transit systems in each \nState. For those who are interested, we have all of this listed State \nby State. The current law gives States and local governments no \ncertainty. However, the certainty is there in the DRIVE Act. So we have \nevery reason to do this.\n\n  Project delivery. We are going to be able to deliver the projects. We \ncan't even start the projects on short-term extensions.\n  Freight. We have a freight section. We have never had a freight \nsection before for moving freight across the country.\n  Transparency. Everything is there so that everyone can see every \nnickel that is used. This is the most transparent of all of the \nreauthorizations we have had.\n  Lastly, innovation. The DRIVE Act prepares our transportation system \nfor the future. That is why it is so important that we get to it today.\n  I compliment the leaders for moving us forward and making every \neffort to get this done before the House goes home.\n  This will give them a good start on what to do during the recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 40 \nminutes be under the control of the Democratic side and that the time \nbe equally divided among the following Senators: Reid, Boxer, \nWhitehouse, Markey, Schatz, and Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at virtually every caucus we have, every \nTuesday caucus, I have Senators report on what is going on in the world \nas it relates to climate change.\n  I wish these were fun-filled presentations where people laughed, \nclapped, and smiled, but they are not. They are very downbeat because \neach Senator who makes a presentation--whether it is the senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, who talks about moose dying in her State because \nthe fleas and ticks no longer die in the cold weather, she explained \nhow about one-third of the moose are dead in New Hampshire, or whether \nit is the junior Senator from the State of Michigan talking about what \nis going on in that beautiful State of Michigan.\n  Without going through the list of Senators who have reported what is \ngoing on as they see it with climate change, everyone within the sound \nof my voice should rest assured things are not good. Our world is \nchanging and has already changed drastically.\n  The Earth is undergoing a shift, a manmade climate change shift. We \ndon't need to travel to the polar icecaps for proof, although if we \ndid, we would see that too. There is evidence all around. Talking about \nthe polar icecap, think about Alaska. Millions of acres are on fire as \nwe speak--not a fire as we see in the forest or the range lands of \nNevada, where you see fire flames flip up into the sky so high it is \nhard to believe sometimes. But this is burning underground at the \npermafrost. It is awful what is happening in Alaska.\n  But let's talk about Nevada. Nevada is an unusual State in many \ndifferent ways. We have over 32 mountains more than 11,000 feet high. \nWe have one mountain we share with California that is 14,000 feet high. \nWe have beautiful, beautiful wilderness.\n  I have had the good fortune during my time in the Senate to \nlegislate. When I came here, we had about 60,000 acres of wilderness. \nWe are now approaching about 4 million acres of wilderness, and it is \nbeautiful, beautiful country. There are beautiful mountains, antelope, \nand mountain sheep, of course. We even have mountain goats. It is a \nbeautiful, beautiful State.\n  We share Lake Tahoe with California--beautiful, beautiful Lake Tahoe \nthat Mark Twain said is the fairest place on all the Earth. The water \nlevel this summer is at a record low. Water we used to take for granted \nthat would come out of the lake isn't coming out anymore.\n  Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains is a fraction of normal \nlevels. A few decades ago, we used to have piles of snow that were \nunbelievable, tens and tens of feet of snow every winter--no longer. In \nfact, this past March, World Cup ski cross and snowboardcross races had \nto be cancelled. Why? We had no snow--no snow at a place where we had \nthe Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley--no snow. They cancelled the races.\n  As I have said on the floor, because it is so traumatic as far as I \nam concerned, many of our black bears aren't even hibernating. It is \nnot cold enough. This past June, a few weeks ago--Lake Mead at one time \nwas the largest manmade lake in America. It isn't anymore because of \nLake Powell, which overtook Nevada for the largest manmade lake in \nAmerica. Lake Powell is on the road to being eliminated. It is part of \nthe great Colorado River program that allows the States of California--\nall the upper Colorado States--Arizona, and Nevada, to survive.\n  This past June, Lake Mead water levels sunk to record lows--record \nlows. Towns that were buried with the making of the Boulder, Hoover \nDam, we can see them again. St. Thomas is an example. An early Mormon \nsettlement there was buried in the water--no longer. Now they are doing \narcheological work on what was buried under Lake Mead previously.\n  Now, that is only Nevada, and that is only a touch of what is \nhappening in Nevada. Wildfires are devastating our State, wiping out \nnative grasses and plants, causing endangered species that need to be \nlisted as threatened or going extinct because, for example, if you have \nbirds survive in our sagebrush, sagebrush is burned and no longer \nexists, you get these foreign species that come in, mainly cheatgrass, \nand it is no good for anything other than more fires. That is what we \nhave in Nevada, devastating wildfires.\n  Around the United States, massive floods are destroying life around \nthe globe. The poles are melting. By the year 2050, scientists estimate \nthe sea level will rise in the world by 16 feet.\n  What will that do to Florida? Of all the major cities in the world, \nwith virtually no exception, they are all in coastal areas. What \ncoastal city in the world is going to be hit hardest in the world by \nthis climate change, the rising of the seas? Miami, FL, the State of \nFlorida.\n  Massive floods are destroying life around the globe. Poles are \nmelting. I repeat, ocean resources are being exhausted.\n  Stunningly, Republicans in Congress are ignoring changes to our \nenvironment that we are all witnessing. They are here. They are in \ndenial. They are in what I refer to as Koch denial because, remember, \neverybody, the two Koch brothers don't want us to do anything on \nclimate change. Why? No. 1, it may prevent them from making more \nbillions. They are heavily invested in tar sands in Canada, and, of \ncourse, their original fortunes were made in\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\noil, gas, and coal in America. Republicans are in denial. They are in \nKoch denial.\n\n  Last month House Republicans passed legislation that would rescind \nPresident Obama's action addressing air pollution and climate change. \nThat legislation is not going to happen over here, but that is the \nmindset of the Republicans. Not to be outdone, Republicans here in the \nSenate are trying the same thing with the Senate Interior and \nEnvironment appropriations bill, filling it with policy riders that are \ndangerous to the planet, dangerous to America.\n  Republicans all know the planet is changing--I hope they do, but they \ndon't. If a Republican knows this, they are a rare Republican and I am \nstill waiting for them to step forward. Republicans don't admit it is a \nproblem. Where is their solution? Well, they have none. They have no \nsolution because they refuse to acknowledge there is a problem.\n  Let's not fool ourselves as to why Republicans reject climate change. \nI have already said why. It is the Koch challenge they all have. Every \nPresidential candidate has to be very careful. There are certain \nthings, and I don't know them all because I am not in attendance at the \nmeetings, but No. 1 is that the Ex-Im Bank has to stay dead. Those \n165,000 people working in America, get rid of them. It is a government \nprogram, get rid of it--even though, as we speak right now, 40 other \ncountries have working ex-im bank programs that are taking business \naway from American exporters. My Republican friends are unwilling to \nstand up to the oil barons who bring their filthy tar sands from \nCanada.\n  Republicans have offered no legislation nor have they offered a \nsingle idea that would protect our world from climate change. The \nclosest they came was to try to be funny here on the floor when it \nsnowed and they brought a snowball into the Chamber, saying: It \ncouldn't be climate change; we have some snow today. Well, we did get \nsome snow, but that doesn't mean we don't have climate change.\n  It is shameful to turn our back on the biggest dilemma the Earth \nfaces. We must come together to arrest climate change.\n  I am very happy that my friend the junior Senator from Rhode Island \nis here because he is focused on all kinds of issues relating to \nclimate, and he has been the driving force in recognizing that one of \nthe places climate change is devastating our world is our oceans. We \ncan't see that very well because the oceans are so massive, but in \nplaces our oceans are already dead--not dying but dead.\n  So it is shameful, I repeat, to turn our backs on the biggest dilemma \nthe Earth faces probably in the history of our world. We must come \ntogether to address climate change.\n  There are solutions that involve, among other things, clean energy. \nJust a few weeks ago, a solar company announced it would build a 100-\nmegawatt solar farm and sell the power to Nevada's utility. The \nelectricity generated by that solar farm was described by the press as \n``not only the cheapest solar--it may be the least expensive \nelectricity in the entire country.'' That is what solar does now. Think \nabout that. The cheapest power being built in America today is solar \nand it is inexhaustible. It doesn't have to be in the desert, where the \nSun shines all the time; it can be used where the Sun doesn't shine all \nthe time, and used well.\n  Solutions to address climate change are here. They are right here. \nNevada has seen $5 billion in development with solar and geothermal and \na little bit of wind. Solutions to address climate change are here, and \nthey are affordable and become more so every day. They have created \nthousands of jobs. And I misspoke earlier. It is $6 billion in Nevada--\nnot $5 billion--that has now been invested in clean energy.\n  Republicans should stop denying climate change. If they want to keep \ncomplaining about the solutions, they should offer their own solutions. \nBut there can't be a solution if they do not see a problem, so I am not \ngoing to hold my breath that Republicans are going to change their \nways.\n  This is the No. 1 issue facing our world. The Defense Department is \nconcerned about the resources they are going to get for manpower. If \nyou ask the people who run the government's military, the Chiefs of \nStaff, they will tell you they are concerned about what this means for \nthe security of this Nation.\n  We cannot ignore this issue any longer. It is affecting the security \nof this Nation for lots of other reasons--namely, what it does to other \ncountries that puts pressure on us.\n  I appreciate very much my colleagues joining in this discussion we \nare going to have today because it is a discussion we have to have \nbecause the world is in trouble because of the climate change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me take a moment to commend the \nleadership of our minority leader on this issue. He has made it a \npriority in the caucus. He has seen its effects at home in Nevada, and \nhe is an outstanding voice in this area. I am very grateful to him.\n  I also thank and recognize my chairman on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Barbara Boxer, and no one is more forceful than she on \nthe need that we have to address climate change and the carbon \npollution we are emitting that is causing this.\n  Mr. President, we are here just after the 6-month anniversary of an \ninteresting statement that was made by the Republican chairman of the \nenergy committee, the Senator from Alaska. Six months ago--January 22, \nto be exact--she said: What I am hoping that we can do now is get \nbeyond the discussion as to whether climate change is real and talk \nabout what do we do.\n  That was January 22 on the Senate floor, 6 months ago. What have we \nseen from the majority party in the 6 months since their energy \nchairman said that we need to get to this question, we need to concede \nclimate change is real, and that we need to address what to do? We have \nseen exactly nothing--that is to say nothing but complaints: Oh, the \nPresident's Clean Power Plan is no good. Oh, we should have massive \nresistance to the President's Clean Power Plan. Oh, we should defund \nthe EPA.\n  These are the thoughts the Republican majority brings as we face this \nquestion.\n  So it is worth looking at some of the folks who are very clear that \nclimate change is a real problem. Here is one--NASA, our scientists \nfrom NASA. They couldn't be clearer about the importance of climate \nchange and about the role of carbon pollution. How smart are NASA \nscientists? They are driving a rover around on the surface of Mars, \nfolks. They just shot a spacecraft by Pluto close enough to take \npictures of it and send back data.\n  What does the Republican majority have to say about NASA's position \non climate change? That they are in on a hoax. They basically accuse \nNASA scientists of being dishonest, even though they are the ones who \nput our country on the surface of Mars and who put an American vehicle \nclose enough to Pluto to take pictures of it.\n  Look at Walmart. Just a moment ago, the junior Senator from Arkansas \nwas presiding. Walmart joined with a dozen other companies yesterday at \nthe White House to say climate change is real. These aren't leftwing \ncompanies. This was Walmart. This was Alcoa. This was GM. This was \nCoke. This was Pepsi. This was UPS.\n  We have to start taking this seriously. But is there anything out of \nthe State of Arkansas--Walmart's home State--on climate? Nope. Not a \nsingle thing.\n  There was recently an article in Forbes magazine titled ``Climate \nChange Will Cause Increased Flooding in Coastal Cities.'' The picture \nis a satellite picture of the State of Florida. The little caption \nunder the picture says: ``Flooding from climate change is threatening \nmuch of the coastline, including major cities in Florida.'' Yet we have \ntwo Presidential candidates from Florida on the Republican side, and \nwhat do they have to say about climate change? Nothing--nothing other \nthan ``I don't know, I am not a scientist'' and all the usual dodges.\n  Pope Francis wrote an encyclical--an extraordinarily important \narticle in the Catholic faith--about the reality and the effect of \nclimate change. What do our Catholic Republican Senators have to say \nabout that? Nothing. We are not going to listen to him; he is not\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\na scientist. Well, actually, technically he is. He is a trained \nchemist. But that is the line--not a scientist.\n  What could possibly explain these strange anomalies? The biggest \ncorporation in Arkansas knows climate change is a problem, and there is \nnothing from the Senators from Arkansas. The coastline of Florida is \nunder immediate threat, according to Forbes magazine, the capitalist \ntool, and the Presidential candidates from Florida can't say a single \nthing about it. The Pope is calling on us----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent for a closing minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The last thing I will mention is that there is a \ncommon thread that links all of this, and it is money. The Koch \nbrothers are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into this \nelection. One of their organizations--one--said that it was going to \nspend $889 million in this election and that anybody who crossed them \non climate change would be at ``a severe disadvantage.'' Nice little \ncampaign you got here; I would hate to put it at a severe disadvantage \nwith my $900 million. So what we have is secret money and we have \nthreats related to it that are obliterating what had been a good \nRepublican response on climate change and on other environmental \nissues.\n  We need to move on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I want to talk a little about the \nparticulars of the Clean Power Plan and address some of the questions \nthat have been raised by some of the opponents.\n  I think the first premise has to be that carbon is an airborne \npollutant; that the Clean Air Act doesn't just give the EPA the \nauthority to regulate airborne pollutants, it actually requires that \nall airborne pollutants that can cause a public health risk get \nregulated. That is the basis of the Supreme Court decision. This \ndoesn't give the EPA the discretion--this doesn't give the Obama \nadministration the discretion to regulate carbon pollution, it requires \nthat they do so. So the only question is not a legal one. The legal one \nhas been settled. The EPA is required to regulate pollution under the \nClean Air Act. The only question remaining is, Is carbon a pollutant? I \ndon't think there is anybody credible in this Chamber who thinks carbon \nis not a pollutant.\n  Look, I think we are actually making progress. Over the last 6 to 12 \nmonths, we have seen a sea change among Republican Members of Congress \nwho are increasingly concerned, I think, about being on the wrong side \nof history, about being on the wrong side of science, about being on \nthe wrong side of a whole generation of young voters--Republican, \nDemocratic, and Independent--who understands this is one of the great \nchallenges of our generation. So we are seeing some movement. We are \nseeing some openness to at least concede that this problem, in fact, \nexists.\n  We have this incredible law in the Clean Air Act. We don't need to \npass a new law. Of course, Senator Whitehouse and I have been working \nvery hard with Senator Boxer and others on a carbon fee, but we also \nhave the tools at our disposal to regulate carbon pollution. Like \nmethane and other airborne pollutants, it is causing environmental and \nhealth damage.\n  The Clean Power Plan is very simple. It is treating this as though it \nis the pollutant that it is. Originally, I think there were some \nlegitimate concerns about how this thing was going to get administered. \nI will give a ``for example.''\n\n  If you are in a very small rural State and you are going to regulate \nnot a State's total carbon emissions but an individual powerplant's \ncarbon emissions, that is a very tough sell. There are instances where, \nbecause of legacy infrastructure, because of distance--for instance, in \nHawaii we have remote and relatively small islands. So it is very \ndifficult to ask the island of Lanai, which is running on diesel-fired \ngenerators, or the island of Molokai, to, at an individual powerplant \nlevel, reduce carbon emissions. That is tough. They can make \nimprovements in efficiency, but they may not be able to meet the \nstandard. So the idea is to allow all of it to aggregate.\n  What Hawaii did, we have a Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, \nrecognizing that there are going to be some places that will have \nincredible challenges economically and in terms of the financing of the \nprojects, incredible challenges complying at the micro level, at the \nsite level, at the power generation level, but if we provide \nflexibility to States--and I know in California with the Cap-and-Trade \nProgram and the Northeast with the RGGI Program, there is a flexibility \nregionally or within States of energy systems to say that as long as \nyou, in the aggregate, are making sufficient progress, we are going to \nallow you to figure out how to make that progress on your own. So we \nanticipate these rules will provide sufficient flexibility to allow \neconomies to thrive.\n  I will make one final point on this before hearing from the great \nSenator from California; that is, all of the hue and cry, all of the \npanic, all of the heartburn about what is going to happen to our \neconomy doesn't have to be an abstract question anymore. We have States \ncurrently exceeding the anticipated thresholds in the clean \npowerplants. So we don't have to imagine what is going to happen to \nvarious economies if we comply because we have States such as \nCalifornia, we have the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative.\n  Two years ago, I was on the floor talking about the Hawaii Clean \nEnergy Initiative with a 40-percent renewable portfolio standard, and \nthe legislature in the last 3 or 4 months just passed the first 100 \npercent clean energy statute in the United States. Our unemployment \nrate is 4 percent, and we have exceeded our previous goals. California, \nwith its Cap-and-Trade Program, and all the hue and cry and panic about \nwhat would happen to our economy--California is booming. Hawaii is \ndoing well. People still have their economic challenges, but it is not \nbecause of our desire to drive an innovation economy and to try to \nsolve this great challenge of our time.\n  We can create clean energy jobs. We can innovate into the future. \nAmerica has an incredible opportunity to lead in this space. I am so \npleased to be part of that innovation and part of that leadership. We \nare putting our marker down as a country. We understand this is going \nto take a global effort, but now America has the credibility to lead on \nclimate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the great Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Hawaii leaves the \nfloor, I just want to say what a breath of fresh air he is. That is \nsomething we say to compliment somebody, but in this case he is \nfighting for clean air. He is fighting for his kids and his grandkids. \nIt has been an honor to work with him.\n  The world understands this, Americans understand this; that we are \nfacing a serious threat to our Nation--dangerous climate change. We \nabsolutely need to act now. The evidence is all around us.\n  I will highlight, in the brief time I have, some of the facts. These \ncannot be refuted.\n  The evidence of climate change is around us. NASA and NOAA found that \n2014 was the hottest year around the globe since recordkeeping began \n134 years ago. How my colleagues could come to the floor and dispute \nthis--if we were to ask people do you respect NASA, I would say \neveryone from our kids to our grandmas would say, absolutely, they are \nscientists.\n  The American Meteorological Association, the society, reported that \nnumerous key climate change indicators were at or near record levels. \nThey found 2014 was the hottest year since recordkeeping began in \n1880--2014 was the hottest year since 1880--and sea surface \ntemperatures and sea levels were at record highs.\n  This is the problem: When we have these kinds of record temperatures, \nthey come with a cost--a cost to wildlife, a cost to human life.\n  I don't have time to go into what we are beginning to see, but about \n8 years ago when I did take the gavel of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, we held a hearing. Everything that was predicted by \nthe scientists is coming true--everything.\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\n  Here is the good news. Here is the great news. My State of California \nis a true leader in this area. With the leadership of our State \nlegislature, our Governor, Jerry Brown, and leading activists in our \nStates, such as Tom Steyer and many others, we are seeing California \nstand up and address this issue. And what has happened? What has \nhappened? All the gloom and doom: Oh, my God. If we try to move away \nfrom dirty energy, it is going to be terrible for everybody.\n  Let me tell you the good news. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, in 2011 California had over 360,000 green jobs, the most of \nany State, and in 2014 there were more than 2,094 solar companies at \nwork throughout the value chain in California, employing 54,700 people. \nLet me say there are some days in California where we get half of our \nenergy from the Sun--half of our energy from the Sun.\n  Here is the other thing we have to know: California households pay \nthe ninth lowest electricity bills in the country. So all the doom and \ngloom, we are going to have to pay more and all the rest, is so much \ntalk.\n  A long time ago, when I became aware of climate change, I looked at \nit and thought: Oh, my gosh. What are we going to do? But the longer I \nlooked at it and the longer I studied it, the faster I recognized that \nif we address climate change in the right way, it will be a boon to our \neconomy and it will be a boon to our health because we know for sure \nthat asthma and respiratory ailments and cardiovascular disease are \nthreats to our families, and they will go down--the risks will go down \nbecause when we clean up the carbon pollution, we clean up all the \nother pollutants that go along with it.\n  Just this week one of our great leaders whom I mentioned, who was the \nleader of NextGen, the president and founder Tom Steyer, said the \nfollowing: Our country needs bold leaders who will lay out a plan to \nachieve more than 50 percent clean energy by 2030, putting us on a \npathway to a completely clean energy economy by 2050 and millions of \nnew jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the fact sheet from \nNextGen Climate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFact Sheet: Powering America With More Than 50 Percent Clean Energy by \n                                  2030\n\n       NextGen Climate is calling on candidates and elected \n     officials to tackle climate change--the defining issue of our \n     time--by producing a plan to power America with more than 50 \n     percent clean and carbon-free energy by 2030, putting us on a \n     pathway to 100% clean energy by 2050. The transition to clean \n     electricity is urgently needed, technologically achievable, \n     economically beneficial, and politically popular.\n\n\n       CLIMATE CHANGE PUTS AMERICA'S ECONOMY AND SECURITY AT RISK\n\n       Left unchecked, climate change will have devastating \n     effects on America's economy and security.\n       The International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) \n     conservatively estimates that, without action, 1-5% percent \n     of global mean Gross Domestic Product is at risk due to \n     climate change, and in some localized places the risks even \n     higher.\n       Intensifying seasonal weather patterns, extreme weather \n     events, rising sea levels, and increased illness and disease \n     will cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars a year in \n     property damage, increased costs, and lost productivity.\n       We are already feeling the effects of climate change at \n     home. From 2010 to 2014 the United States experienced nearly \n     50 climate-related disasters with costs in excess of $1 \n     billion each, and in 2013 alone the United States experienced \n     $125 billion in expenses from climate-related events.\n       Climate change poses a grave national security risk as \n     well. Just last year, 16 retired three- and four-star \n     generals and admirals issued a report, National Security and \n     the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change, identifying climate \n     change as a ``catalyst for conflict.'' Additionally, the \n     Pentagon's 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review laid out that \n     climate change poses a serious threat and will aggravate \n     stressors abroad.\n\n\n TRANSITIONING TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY WILL PREVENT CLIMATE DISASTER\n\n       It is not too late to avoid the worst consequences of \n     climate change--though time is running out. The longer the \n     United States, and the global community, delay the transition \n     to a clean energy economy the larger the economic impacts \n     will be. In order to help prevent climate disaster, the \n     United States must reduce carbon emissions by 83 percent \n     economy-wide by 2050.\n       A plan to power America with more than 50 percent clean and \n     carbon-free energy by 2030 will put us on the path to a 100 \n     percent clean-energy economy by 2050, accomplishing the \n     necessary carbon emissions reduction from the electricity \n     sector.\n\n\n    MORE THAN 50 PERCENT CLEAN ENERGY BY 2030 IS A TECHNOLOGICALLY \n                            ACHIEVABLE GOAL\n\n       The transition to a clean energy economy is already \n     underway. Clean energy technologies like wind and solar are \n     increasingly competitive with outdated fossil fuels on cost, \n     and are growing rapidly across America and around the world:\n       Installed solar capacity in the United States increased 34 \n     percent between 2013 and 2014.\n       The U.S. has installed over 20,000 megawatts of solar \n     enough to power more than 4 million average American homes--\n     and that is expected to double in just the next two years.\n       Utility scale solar has reached cost parity with coal and \n     gas in many regions and is projected to be cheaper than \n     fossil fuels throughout most of the U.S. by 2017.\n       Combined with significant technological cost breakthroughs \n     of clean energy technologies and the Obama Administration's \n     historic steps to stop the unlimited dumping of carbon \n     pollution into our air and water with the Clean Power Plan, \n     the U.S. electricity sector is beginning to transform to one \n     that is cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable.\n       The Energy Information Administration projects that the \n     electricity mix in 2030 will be approximately 25% coal, 31% \n     natural gas, 1% oil, 18% nuclear, 7% hydropower, 12% wind, \n     3+% solar, and 3% other renewable sources. This means that \n     with no additional policies other than expected \n     implementation of the Clean Power Plan, nearly 43% of the \n     electricity produced is projected to be clean or carbon-free \n     in 2030.\n       Though the transformation to a clean energy economy is \n     already underway, and accomplishing more than 50 percent \n     clean energy by 2030 is technologically possible, \n     policymakers must do their part to push us over the top. The \n     deck is currently stacked against clean energy, as subsidies \n     and other preferential treatment prop up outdated fossil \n     fuels, stifling American innovation and slowing the growth of \n     modern renewable energy sources.\n       Our country needs bold leadership that accelerates the \n     transition away from fossil fuels that cause climate change \n     and towards America's clean energy future and the economic \n     benefits it will bring. By fully implementing the Clean Power \n     Plan and pursuing other policy solutions that will allow \n     energy sources like solar and wind to compete against fossil \n     fuels on a level playing field, our leaders can ensure we \n     transition to clean energy in time to prevent climate \n     disaster.\n\n\nACHIEVING MORE THAN 50 PERCENT CLEAN ENERGY BY 2030 WILL SPUR ECONOMIC \n                         GROWTH AND CREATE JOBS\n\n       Today, clean energy jobs are significantly outpacing fossil \n     fuels jobs. In 2014, the number of people working in solar \n     power surpassed the number of people employed as coal miners. \n     As the technology landscape continues to change, clean energy \n     has the opportunity to be a significant driver of employment \n     in every city, state, and region. These jobs include \n     installing and operating clean energy, performing energy \n     retrofits, designing and researching new technologies, and \n     operating the clean energy businesses of tomorrow.\n       Solar jobs are growing 20 times faster than the broader \n     economy.\n       Solar energy creates eight times more jobs in construction, \n     installation, operations, and maintenance, than coal and \n     natural gas do across full project lifetimes.\n       There are more than 500 wind manufacturing facilities \n     across the U.S. and there are currently more than 70,000 \n     people employed in wind-related jobs.\n       In this global race for clean energy, the nation that leads \n     on clean energy technology development will have a \n     significant advantage in creating the millions of clean \n     energy jobs that are up for grabs in this new energy \n     revolution.\n       The United States is on the road to a clean energy economy. \n     Technology and economics no longer limit our ability to \n     realize this new energy system. With bold political \n     leadership, we can accelerate America's transition to a clean \n     energy economy, win this global clean energy race, strengthen \n     our economy, and help mitigate potentially trillions of \n     dollars of damages from climate change.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. After stating their key findings, I will complete my \npresentation.\n  How many more minutes do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is what NextGen found: Achieving more than 50 \npercent clean energy by 2030 will spur economic growth and create jobs.\n  I agree.\n  Second, most Americans support a goal of more than 50 percent clean \nenergy by 2050.\n  I think the polls bear that out.\n  Third, climate change puts America's economy and security at risk.\n  I absolutely agree with that. We have been told that by the defense \nestablishment.\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\n  Next, transitioning to a clean energy economy will prevent climate \ndisaster.\n  That is true.\n  Lastly, they say 50 percent clean energy by 2030 is feasible.\n  Although I haven't studied this myself, I can say the Energy \nInformation Administration estimates that this can happen if we take \nthe kind of steps President Obama is recommending and a lot of us in \nthe Senate support, putting a price on carbon that will save us from \ndevastating climate change. It will provide jobs and will make us a \nhealthier nation.\n  As I said, I rise today to talk about one of the most serious threats \nfacing our Nation--dangerous climate change. We need to act now, but \nthe Republican majority in Congress has no plan to address the threat \nposed to the American people.\n  The evidence of climate change is all around us. NASA and NOAA found \nthat 2014 was the hottest year around the globe since recordkeeping \nbegan 134 years ago.\n  Earlier this month, the American Meteorological Society reported that \nnumerous key climate change indicators were at or near record levels \nlast year. 2014 was the hottest year since recordkeeping began in 1880; \nand sea surface temperatures and sea levels were at record high levels.\n  And it is continuing--NOAA reported that January through June 2015 \nhas been the hottest first half of any year on record.\n  We must act now to address climate change by reducing dangerous \ncarbon pollution from the biggest source--power plants.\n  The President's Clean Power Plan will help America lead the way to \navert the worst impacts of climate change--such as sea level rise, \ndangerous heat waves, and economic disruption.\n  By reducing carbon pollution, we can also cut many types of air \npollutants that threaten human health.\n  I often say, if people can't breathe, they can't go to work or \nschool. According to EPA, the powerplant proposal will avoid up to \n150,000 asthma attacks in children, 3,300 heart attacks, 6,600 \npremature deaths, and 490,000 missed days at school and work in 2030.\n  The Obama administration clearly gets it, and so do the American \npeople. A Stanford University poll from earlier this year found that 83 \npercent of Americans, including 61 percent of Republicans, say if \nnothing is done to reduce carbon pollution, climate change will be a \nproblem in the future. And 74 percent of Americans say the Federal \nGovernment should take action to combat climate change.\n  Our businesses also get it. On Monday, 13 of the largest American \nbusinesses gathered at the White House to launch the American Business \nAct on Climate Pledge. These companies, including California-based \nGoogle and Apple, pledged to take steps to address climate change.\n  But climate deniers in Congress still don't get it--they have made \nrepeated attempts to block the Clean Power Plan and other commonsense \nsteps.\n  Last year, the EPW Committee heard from four former EPA \nadministrators who served under Republican Presidents, from Richard \nNixon to George W. Bush, and they all agreed that climate change \nrequires action now. This should not be a partisan issue.\n  President Obama has a plan, the American people want us to act, so I \nask my Republican colleagues, what is your plan?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are at a crossroads. We have a \ncatastrophe that is looming for our planet. We have the world looking \nat the United States wondering if we are going to lead. We have the \nPope coming to the United States and speaking out on this issue. We \nhave the world gathering in Paris this November, this December, \ndiscussing this issue because it is now the focal point of the world; \nthat is, the danger of ever-escalating, dangerous climate change, the \nwarming of our planet, and the catastrophic consequences of the warming \nof our planet.\n  The tides are rising. Snows are melting. In other places, the snows \nare greater than they have ever been before. Climate change--dangerous \nclimate change--that is what is happening.\n  What is the response from the Republican side of the aisle? We hear \nnothing. We hear denial. We hear essentially an argument that it is not \nour responsibility to deal with it, but the Pope is asking us to be the \nleader. The world is asking us to be the leader. The young people in \nour country, the green generation, are asking us to be the leader.\n  The United States is a technological giant. We have the capacity to \ninvent the technologies that are going to radically reduce greenhouse \ngases, not only in our own country but around the world: new renewable \nenergy technologies, new battery technologies, and new ways of \ngenerating electricity in the 21st century. We do not have to be tied \nto 19th century technologies--oil and coal. It is the 21st century.\n  In our country, in 2015 and 2016, we are going to generate 40,000 new \nmegawatts of wind and solar. We ask, Well, what does that translate \ninto? What are 40,000 megawatts? If we think of all the nuclear \npowerplants that have been constructed in our country over the last 70 \nyears, we now have 100,000 megawatts of electricity coming from nuclear \npower. In these 2 years, 2015 to 2016, we are going to add 40,000 in \nwind and solar. The experts did not think this was possible 10 years \nago. The experts would have said: Oh, wind and solar, that is nice, but \nit can't replace the coal that has always been relied upon to provide \nour electricity going back to the 19th century. Impossible, they said. \nNo. This new generation is rising up. And what is doing it? Well, we \nhave put tax breaks on the books now for wind and solar. We are giving \nthem the same breaks we always gave oil, we always gave coal. But what \ndo we hear from the Republican Party? Should we eliminate the coal and \noil tax breaks? Oh, no. You can't touch those. But when we say, well, \nlet's renew the tax breaks for wind and solar, they say it is time for \nus to now allow these new industries to go it alone. That has been the \nproblem all along; there isn't a level playing field. What we have done \nover the last 7 years is create a level playing field, so the new \nenergy technologies can compete against these old tax breaks for coal \nand oil that have been on the books for generations. We can do it. We \ncan solve this problem, but we can't create an unlevel playing field.\n  The same thing is true with automotive technologies. All of that \nCO2 coming out of automobiles, coming out of trucks, people \nsaid we just have to live with it. The average for vehicles that \nordinary families drove in our country just 6 years ago was 25 miles a \ngallon, essentially the same as 1975. The green generation, the young \npeople in our country, say let's do better, let's invent new \ntechnologies. Let's have electric cars. Let's have plug-in hybrids. \nLet's have a generation of hybrids. No, says the industry. It is too \ndifficult. We can't figure it out. It will cripple our industry.\n  We pass new laws here on the Senate floor and on the House floor. \nWhat has happened? We have a revolution in automotive technology. We \nnow have people driving around in computers on wheels. The dashboard \nlooks like it is a spaceship. The cars are infinitely more efficient, \nand we are heading toward 54.5 miles per gallon. What did the experts \nsay 10 years ago? Impossible. We cannot do it. These are the same \npeople who said to President Kennedy that we cannot put a man on the \nmoon in 8 years. President Kennedy said: ``We choose to go to the moon \n. . . and do other things, not because they are easy, but because they \nare hard.'' We are the United States of America. We will invent the new \npropulsion systems. We will invent the new methods. We will invent all \nof the things we need so that America dominates the Soviet Union and \nnot the opposite.\n  The whole world is looking at this generation, this Senate. We have a \nplan. President Obama has a plan to control emissions coming out of the \npowerplants of our country. Our plan is one that moves toward renewable \nenergy and away from these smokestacks of CO2 going up into the \natmosphere and creating a blanket that holds in the heat and continues \nto dangerously warm the planet. That is what the greenhouse effect is. \nIt holds in the heat, all of this pollution.\n  When we move toward solar, when we move toward wind, when we move \ntoward geothermal, when we move toward all the new technologies, the \nCO2\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\nis cut radically and the planet is able to breathe, and breathe in a \nway that says to generations to come that we will have left this planet \nbetter than it was before.\n  That is what the Pope is going to come and talk to us about--\ndangerous climate change. That is what the Pope is going to come and \nask the United States--to be the leader and not the lagger, to not \nallow the deniers of climate change to dominate our debate in the \nUnited States of America, to not allow the technologies of the 19th \ncentury dictate to the 21st century.\n  Just 18 years ago, a small percentage of all Americans had a wireless \ndevice in their pocket. Do you want to know why? The experts said it \nwas impossible; you can't do it. Today everyone is walking around with \none of these in their pocket, including 700 million people in Africa. \nWe can do it.\n  In Kenya and in Ethiopia, they are moving toward geothermal, solar, \nand wind. They are skipping the landline delivery of telecommunication \nservice in favor of wireless, and they are also skipping the landline \nsystem of generational electricity and moving to renewables. They are \nnot relying on coal. They are moving on to the new. You can't eliminate \nit totally. You need some coal. You need some oil. But we can continue \nto reduce it year after year.\n  What is the plan we hear from the Republican Party? How do we reduce \nthe amount of greenhouse gases we are going to be sending into the \natmosphere? What is their plan? They say they don't like President \nObama's plan. Where is their plan? What are they going to do? What are \nthey going to tell the green generation--all these pages on the floor \nrepresenting tens of millions across our country? They are asking the \nquestion: Where is the plan? How do we do this? How do we solve the \nproblem? How do we invent the new technologies, as we did with wireless \ntechnology, and spread it across the planet? How do we do it for \nclimate change as well? That is going to be the essential debate.\n  Shruggy says: I am not happy; I am sad.\n  Where is the Republican emoji? Where is the one who says: We can do \nit; we are America.\n  We are not going to allow the rest of the world to have a problem \nfrom which the United States is going to exempt itself because it is \nthe only country that is denying climate change. The Senate has a great \nresponsibility. We have an opportunity to be the global leader. We can \nsave all of creation while engaging in massive job creation here in \nAmerica. We now have 100,000 clean energy jobs in Massachusetts. It is \na big job creator. It is an employer of Americans all across our \ncountry.\n  We have a chance to do something special. We can begin this \ntransition in a much more serious way--away from coal, away from oil, \nand toward this renewable solar era of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, man made climate change has evolved from a \ncritical threat to an unavoidable reality. The reality of climate \nchange has already shown its grim effects on our environment and our \nhealth.\n  Today, I would like to speak about the impacts of climate change on \nthis country's economic engine: our businesses. As temperatures and sea \nlevels rise and as weather patterns become more severe, the costs of \ndoing business go up. Droughts and heat waves drive up energy costs and \nhave put incredible pressure on global food production. On a warming \nplanet, floods and other natural disasters damage infrastructure and \nprivate property, driving up insurance premiums and increasing the cost \nof doing business.\n  All of this creates uncertainty for investors, who increasingly want \nto know how climate change will affect the companies in which they \ninvest. American companies are beginning to notice. General Mills' \nChief Sustainability Officer Jerry Lynch said, ``The best available \nscience tells us all the changes we are making to the planet as a human \nspecies are what's causing this.'' Last year, General Mills announced \nits commitment to increasing sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions in its supply chains.\n  Even oil companies realize what is happening: ExxonMobil's William \nColton, Vice President of Corporate Strategic Planning, said, ``The \nrisk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action.'' \nExxonMobil officials subsequently announced the company would put $600 \nmillion into algae farms that would turn sunlight into automotive fuel. \nIts new focus shows that corporations across all economic sectors are \nrealizing something vital: the negative effects of climate change hurt \ntheir bottom line.\n  This week, some of America's largest companies such as Apple, Coca-\nCola, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Google, PepsiCo, and Walmart are \nstanding with the Obama Administration to launch the ``American \nBusiness Act on Climate Pledge''. By signing this pledge, companies \ndemonstrate an ongoing commitment to having a climate action plan. The \nongoing shift in official corporate climate policies from a burgeoning \nnumber of other large and small businesses demonstrates that taking \naction on climate makes strong economic sense. If these bastions of \ncapitalism can develop and commit to climate action plans, why has not \nthe Republican Party devised its own action plan? Denial simply will \nnot cut it.\n  The involvement of American businesses in climate policy is a welcome \ndevelopment but they must move even further by disclosing the risks \nthey face from climate change to investors. These risks, which are \npassed on to shareholders, hit nearly every industry imaginable, from \nobvious choices like the oil and gas sector, to healthcare and \nfinancial services and transportation and hospitality. Disclosing \nclimate risk through the Securities & Exchange Commission's, SEC, \ncorporate reporting measures enhances transparency and allows investors \nto make smarter decisions, ultimately protecting and increasing \nshareholder value.\n  As we continue to deplete our scarce natural resources and send their \nharmful byproducts back into our air, water and land, the cumulative \nimpacts are changing the world. The rate of this change is \naccelerating; the status quo is untenable. By providing honest climate \nrisk disclosure and establishing climate action policies to mitigate \nand reduce that risk, American companies are acting in everyone's best \nfinancial interests.\n  Profit-driven corporate superpowers like Apple, Coca-Cola, and \nWalmart are taking concrete steps to reduce the impact of climate \nchange. The message they are sending is clear: adapt, or fall behind. \nOther companies now have the opportunity to join in what American \nbusinesses do best: innovating and leading the rest of the world by \ntheir example. It is increasingly obvious that taking action to combat \nclimate change is economically prudent. But more important, it is also \nthe morally correct thing to do. I encourage more in the business \ncommunity to take a stand on the right side of human history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are continuing to make substantial \nprogress on passing a multiyear highway bill. Thanks to the \ndevelopments of the recent day--I guess it was yesterday--we learned \nthat the House is open to a conference committee to reconcile an \nauthorization bill that they will likely take up soon and then to have \na conference committee to reconcile those differences. Previously we \nhad been told that the House would not take up the Senate bill and was \ninsisting on a short-term patch to the December timeframe. I can tell \nyou that I, for one, was reluctant do that because without a clear path \nforward after December, we would be looking at perhaps not just the \n34th patch but the 35th patch and on and on.\n  What this country needs is a long-term transportation bill, and that \nis what the Senate will likely pass tomorrow--our own 3-year bill--and \nthen work with our colleagues in the House, as we usually do when the \ntwo bodies don't necessarily agree on everything, to work those out.\n  I am thankful that the Members of this Chamber recognize how \nimportant this legislation is. I have to tell you, coming from Texas--a \nbig, fast-growing State that needs this investment in our \ninfrastructure--this is important for my constituents.\n  The highway legislation we are putting forward is actually a 6-year \nauthorization, and that is something to\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\nbe celebrated. As I mentioned, this avoids the sorts of temporary \npatches we have had in the past.\n  Although Chairman Hatch of the Senate Finance Committee came up with \nenough money--enough pay-fors in the jargon we use around here--to pay \nfor this for 5 years, there was an attempt to work on a bipartisan \nconsensus. Since all of those pay-fors were not acceptable to this \nconsensus, we got enough pay-fors to pay for the first 3 years of this \n6-year bill. But that doesn't mean the work will end on trying to find \na way to, in a fiscally responsible way, pay for the back end of this \n6-year bill.\n  There is a popular bumper sticker found on cars and trucks in Texas. \nI know people sometimes get a little tired of Texans who are so proud \nof their State, as I am. But one of those bumper stickers said: ``I \nwasn't born in Texas but I got here as fast as I could.'' Indeed, \npeople have been voting with their feet, coming from parts of the \ncountry where, frankly, the policies--whether it is tax or regulatory \npolicies--or just the lack of jobs have caused people to look elsewhere \nfor jobs, for an opportunity to provide for their families and to \npursue the American dream.\n  I have mentioned time and time again on this floor that our economy \nin Texas grew at a rate of 5.2 percent last year. Compare that to the \nnational growth rate, which was 2.2 percent. So something is going on \nhere, and I would argue that what is going on is that the policies that \nhave been emanating from Washington, DC, have actually been a restraint \nor a wet blanket on job growth and economic growth. We ought to look to \nsome of the States that have been successful laboratories of democracy \nfor the kinds of policies that actually pay off. I am not just talking \nabout for businesses; I am talking about for workers and families, \nparticularly when it comes to wages and good jobs.\n  My State is a growing, diverse State. I know sometimes people are \nsurprised. They know we have a large Hispanic population. Roughly 38 \npercent of Texas is Hispanic. But Vietnamese is the third most commonly \nspoken language in Texas. We have about a quarter of a million \nVietnamese Americans. We are a very diverse State. Some estimates \nproject our State to exceed 50 million people by the year 2050, \npotentially doubling our current population.\n  There is no time to lose when it comes to maintaining and expanding \nour transportation networks to meet the rising demands from more people \nand more vehicles on our roads. That is why this multiyear bill is so \nimportant.\n  For example, this legislation would help our State focus on improving \nroadways that impact the daily lives of Texans. That includes many of \nour interstates, such as Interstate 35. I don't know how many people in \nthis Chamber have ever tried to drive down Interstate Highway 35 \nthrough Austin, but it is almost like a parking lot. It runs the length \nof our State, starting in Laredo, TX, which is the largest inland port \nin America, where we have a lot of trucks and a lot of commercial \ntraffic coming across. It starts in Laredo, but it goes through \nmultiple population centers, such as San Antonio--my hometown--Austin, \nand then Dallas and Fort Worth, which are some of the fastest growing \ncities in America, before going on to Oklahoma. The interstate is more \nthan 400 miles long in Texas alone, and because of our growth, it is \nincredibly congested. In fact, 18 segments of the interstate rank in \nthe top 100 most congested roadways across the State. That growth isn't \nprojected to let up anytime soon. As a matter of fact, it is going to \ncontinue at high levels.\n  Employment levels in Central Texas alone--some of the fastest growing \nparts of the State--are projected to double or quadruple in the next 30 \nyears.\n  We are not afraid of getting bigger. We are proud of our size, our \ngrowth, and the opportunity that provides to the people of Texas. But \npassing a long-term, well-funded highway bill becomes even more \nimportant when you come from a State such as mine with the sorts of \ntransportation challenges we have now and will continue to have in the \nfuture.\n  Building a stronger transportation network for a stronger economy \nmeans strengthening not only Interstate Highway 35, which I mentioned a \nminute ago, but also the vast existing networks of other interstates \nand upgrading routes to higher standards. This is ultimately about \npublic safety. We need to have transportation infrastructure, highways, \nand interstates that allow people to travel at relatively high speeds \nin a safe way. That is why this is important as well.\n  Because we understand the relationship between quality infrastructure \nand economic success, I introduced an amendment to the highway bill \nthat would help our State connect more efficiently. I appreciate the \nbill managers for letting us take a close look at this and the \npotential benefit for my State and the transportation network as a \nwhole.\n  This amendment will provide for much needed improvements to high \npriority corridors in Texas, such as Interstate Highway 69. Congress \nfirst designated future segments of I-69 in Texas nearly 25 years ago, \nafter leaders from the gulf coast region and East Texas said the State \nneeded a new route to increase connectivity between land and sea ports \nand our existing interstate system. Fortunately, this is also a route \nthat improves emergency evacuation capabilities--something I know the \nPresiding Officer can appreciate coming from Louisiana--and one that \ndelivers an interstate to the Rio Grande Valley, which is the largest \npopulation center in the country previously unserved by the Interstate \nHighway System.\n  Through years of outreach and public engagement--from Brownsville to \nTexarkana--we have identified upgrades and improvements to existing \nState corridors that could deliver a future I-69 throughout the \nState. We have made great progress since 2010. More than $1.3 billion \nhas been expended toward corridor improvements throughout Texas, and \nsince 2011, more than 200 miles of I-69 have been added to the \nInterstate Highway System, including the first segment in South Texas.\n\n  This is still a work in progress, and it costs money. Upgrades are \nneeded for more than 1,000 miles of designated roadways to complete it. \nI am reminded of what the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Inhofe, has said to me privately, which I know he \nhas also said publicly as well, about the importance of infrastructure \nand the Federal Government's role. Now, I happen to be one who believes \nthat the Federal Government needs to do a much better job when it comes \nto prioritizing Federal spending and spending within our means, which \nthe Federal Government has not been doing. But when we talk about \npriorities and things that only the Federal Government can do that the \nStates and local government cannot do, as Chairman Inhofe likes to say, \nthere are two things that the Federal Government should do, and that is \nnational defense and infrastructure. He said pretty much everything \nelse is a lower priority item. I think that makes a lot of sense.\n  When it comes to spending money, that is something that my \nconstituents in Texas are leery of when it comes to the Federal \nGovernment. They realize that spending money on our infrastructure and \nthe highway system just makes common sense. So with a multiyear highway \nbill such as the one before us, we can complete our interstate, I-69, \nand that will move us one step closer to reality. As I mentioned a \nmoment ago, these and other modernization efforts also make our roads \nsafer and help with more efficient freight movement, which means our \nbusinesses can deliver goods to customers across the State and \nthroughout the country in a more expeditious fashion.\n  I must also point out that this bipartisan bill is fiscally \nresponsible and the pay-fors are not phony pay-fors, which sometimes \noccurs here in the Congress. It doesn't increase taxes or add to the \ndeficit. So from my perspective, it is a win-win.\n  I encourage all of our colleagues to continue reviewing it and to \nkeep in mind the essential role infrastructure plays in our country and \nin our economy. Our economy, of course, is what produces jobs, and it \nallows people to find good work and provide for their families and \npursue their dreams.\n  So far 2015 has been marked by real steps forward in this Chamber, \nincluding essential legislation, such as the\n\n[[Page S6100]]\n\nDefense authorization bill and a bill that will combat human \ntrafficking. This highway bill continues in the spirit of \naccomplishment. Perhaps it is not a grand-slam home run, but I would \ncall them singles and doubles that we have been able to eke out so far \nthis year. This bill will represent another solid accomplishment for \nthe 114th Congress that we can be proud of on a bipartisan basis.\n  I encourage all of our colleagues to continue the momentum and to get \nthis bill passed soon, hopefully no later than tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Strengthening Our Economic Recovery\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, colleagues, I want to hearken back to \nlast November's election. I thought for some time--and the Presiding \nOfficer has heard me say this once or twice--that for this Senator \nthere are three takeaways from that election. No. 1, the American \npeople want us to work together in the Senate here in Washington; the \nAmerican people want us to get things done; and most especially, the \nAmerican people want us to get things done that actually strengthen our \neconomic recovery.\n  My own view is that one of the things we can do to strengthen our \neconomic recovery is to increase exports. We work very hard in this \nChamber, in the Senate and with the House and the President, to try to \npave the way to create a large new trading block consisting of the \nUnited States and 11 other countries which, when put together, comprise \nabout 40 percent of the world's customers. This is the trading block we \ncall the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It is something that is sought by \nthe President and is supported by myself, by Democrats, and by \nRepublicans, and it is still being negotiated. But it is an important \npart in growing and strengthening our economic recovery.\n  One of the other related areas is how do we finance exports. One of \nthe ways we have done that for years in this country is through the \nExport-Import Bank. We have reached a point where the authorization of \nthe Export-Import Bank has expired. The legislation that has passed the \nSenate would renew that authorization, and my hope is that when we \nfinally find our way through the transportation gauntlet, we will also \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank to again make available financing \nfor business--not for every business large and small, but for quite a \nfew. Other nations with whom we compete help finance their exports, and \nfor us not to do the same puts us at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Another thing we can do to strengthen our economic recovery is to \nbetter protect our international property--research and development--\nwhether it is from cyber security attacks, data breaches, or whether it \nis through simply the way we combat patent trolling. Folks come up with \nideas and they are delayed. They end up in court, and research and \ndevelopment is stymied in some cases as a result of all that.\n  We have worked in the Environment and Public Works Committee for \nyears now on something called the Tax Exceptions Control Act which \nprovides predictability and certainty for businesses, especially in the \nchemical industry, but also at the same time works to protect our \nhealth as human beings, especially among the most vulnerable--the \nyoung, the old--and at the same time it is good for the environment. \nThat legislation may be coming before us as soon as next week.\n  Many of us have sought to provide some certainty for businesses on \nthe tax side through international tax reform, which is an idea \nsupported by the President, by the House Republican and Democratic \nleadership, and by the Finance Committee working group led by Senators \nPortman and Schumer. It is not comprehensive tax reform, but it is a \nbig piece of it that at least provides some certainty and \npredictability and would also provide, frankly, a couple hundred \nbillion dollars over the next 10 years to be used for roads, highways, \nbridges, transit, rail, and so forth.\n  The last thing I will mention in terms of strengthening our economic \nrecovery is transportation. There is an outfit called McKinsey which is \na major consulting company. They have something called the McKinsey \nGlobal Institute. Not long ago they reported that if we were to make \nthe kind of robust investment in infrastructure sought by the President \nand supported by House Republican and Democratic leadership, and \nsupported by our bipartisan working group on the Finance Committee--if \nwe were actually to do that, we would grow, according to McKinsey's \nemployment estimates, by as much as 1.5 million jobs over the next \nseveral years. A lot of these jobs are for people who are either not \nworking or are working part-time. They would like to build something or \nrebuild something, and they could work on highways, bridges, our \ntransit systems, and so forth. The folks at the McKinsey Global \nInstitute go even further to say that if we were to make this kind of \nrobust investment in transportation at large, we would not only put a \nlot of people back to work, but we would grow our GDP by as much as 1.5 \npercent. That may not sound like a lot, but I think our GDP growth in \nthe first quarter was zero. We struggled through a tough winter. It has \nbounced back nicely in the second quarter, but it is still only 2.5 \npercent. The idea of being able to add 1.5 percent to that would give \nus a 4-percent GDP growth, and that is as strong as we have seen in a \nwhile. It would translate into a lot more jobs for people other than \njust building highways, bridges, and roads in our country.\n  I have been asked, why would our GDP grow so much by making these \ninvestments in transportation? In one of several meetings I have had \nwith industry groups, someone from a company said: We move a lot of our \nproducts overseas in order to sell our products. We don't export by \nair, but by ship. Most of the exports leaving this country go by way of \nship. He went on to say: We send our products to ports and we have a \nnarrow window of time. In his particular case it was a timeframe of 4 \nhours. The ships coming into this particular port needed to pick up \ntheir goods and products within 4 hours. He said if they met that \nwindow, they were good. If they missed that window, they were not good. \nAs it turns out, there are enormous delays in moving not just people in \nthis country but in moving products and freight.\n  One of the great things about the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee's 6-year transportation reauthorization legislation was a \nfreight provision. I give a lot of credit to Senators Boxer and Inhofe \nfor including--we were among the people who strongly recommended it--a \nstrong freight provision in the Transportation bill in order to help \ngrow GDP to help grow jobs.\n  As it turns out, part of the reason why it is difficult to get \nanything done around here on transportation is the issue of how we are \ngoing to pay for all these investments, although I have referenced some \npretty good ideas. I mentioned one. One of the reasons it is difficult \nto pass legislation through is that multiple committees have \njurisdiction over transportation. The Environment and Public Works \nCommittee in which I serve is led by Senators Inhofe and Boxer. We have \njurisdiction over roads, highways, and bridges. That is a big piece of \nour transportation system, but it is not all of it. The Banking \nCommittee has jurisdiction over transit, which is significant. The \nCommerce Committee has jurisdiction over freight rail and interstate \npassenger rail and jurisdiction over safety in a lot of instances. They \nalso have jurisdiction over a fair amount of what happens in the air \nfor our country. Then the Finance Committee, which I am also privileged \nto serve on--which is called the Ways and Means Committee in the \nHouse--is heavily involved in how to pay for all the improvements we \nneed to make--and how badly we need to make them.\n  As it turns out, there are some folks who actually study the amount \nof time\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\nthat we are delayed either sitting in traffic or moving very slowly in \nthis country. The folks at Texas A put out an annual report on \ncongestion in our country. They found the average U.S. commuter wastes \n38 hours every year because of traffic congestion. There is an industry \ngroup that has something called The Road Information Program. They \nestimate the average driver in the United States pays $377 each year in \nadditional vehicle costs as a result of poor road conditions. The World \nBank, in a related report, has found that when a road is allowed to \ndeteriorate from good to poor, each dollar we fail to invest in road \nmaintenance will increase vehicle operating costs by between $2 and $3. \nSo among the many reasons we want to make these investments is No. 1, \nto grow employment for the many folks who are actually building and \nworking on these projects--a lot of people. We want to grow our gross \ndomestic product. We want to reduce the amount of time spent sitting in \ntraffic or traveling very slowly in traffic. The 38 hours wasted in \ncongestion are hours we lose in our lives every year. Lastly, we want \nto reduce the amount of money we spend on our own vehicles.\n  I know my own vehicle, my Chrysler Town and Country minivan, went \nover 400,000 miles this week as we were driving in from Delaware the \nday before last. We were coming across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge last \nweek when it topped out at 400,000 miles. Along the way people have \nasked: How do you get a vehicle to go that many years and that far? I \ntell them that every other week we wash it. That is pretty much all I \ndo. Well, I actually do a lot more than that. I have replaced a lot of \ntires. There are a lot of potholes, causing a lot of realignments, and \nit adds up. The average is almost $377 a year, but the money adds up \nfor us as it does for other people as well.\n  I mentioned earlier that the Environment and Public Works Committee \nhas jurisdiction over roads, highways, and bridges. The commerce \ncommittee has jurisdiction over ground transportation, including \nfreight rail, passenger rail, and air; the banking committee has \njurisdiction over transit; and the Finance Committee has jurisdiction \nover finance and how we actually finance these investments. That is one \nof the reasons it is difficult to put a package together with all the \ndifferent pieces to find common ground and to come to an agreement on \nhow to fund it.\n  One of the other difficulties is--and I am not a huge advocate of \nearmarks, but one of the reasons people were willing to vote year after \nyear, decade after decade, for a 6-year transportation bill was because \nthey could point to certain specific provisions in the Transportation \nbill which helped their congressional district or their State. It is \nmore difficult now for a representative or Senator to say these are the \nspecific provisions that are good for my State or my district, and this \nis one of the reasons why I am supporting this legislation. It doesn't \nmean we ought to go back to earmarks, but it is one of the reasons why \nit is harder to build a super majority to move legislation like this \nthrough the Senate.\n  So where are we? The House has passed legislation that says for the \nnext 3 months we are going to fund transportation projects in this \ncountry--roads, highways, bridges, and transit. They have outlined a \ncouple of ways to pay for that. They do not have enough money to pay \nfor projects over the next 5 months. They have authorized the actual \nconstruction of those projects for the next 3 months. That is their \nbill, and I think they have pretty much passed it and said, kind of, \ntake it or leave it. Previously, they said they wanted to extend for 5 \nmonths the authorization and the appropriations for roads, highways, \nbridges, and transit until sometime in December to give us time between \nnow and December to come to agreement on the administration's earlier \nidea embraced by House Democratic and Republican leadership and \nembraced by the working group in the Senate Finance Committee about \ninternational tax reform, which some would deem repatriation.\n  We passed out of here today a different plan that I do not support \nbut a plan that would appear to authorize projects for a 6-year \ntransportation bill. As it turns out, the money is good for maybe 3 \nyears, not for 6. It comes from a lot of different sources, some that I \nwould deem inappropriate. Others may differ with that. It is not the \nway I think we should do business, but it is the way we have done \nbusiness.\n  We passed a bill. We have different perspectives as to what we ought \nto do. My expectation is that the Senate will agree with the House-\npassed bill and we will, in the meantime, go back to the drawing board. \nOne of the things that I think has value in the House-passed bill is it \nsets the stage for us to get serious about the administration's \nproposal, again embraced by the House Democratic and Republican \nleadership, and by our bipartisan working group in the Finance \nCommittee. It gives us time to actually find out if we can do that.\n  There are some people who don't like that idea. Some people in pretty \npowerful positions around here don't like that idea, but there are \nothers in equally high positions who think that is a very good idea. \nAmong the benefits that it would provide--it doesn't address our \ntransportation needs forever, but it certainly would provide a lot of \nmoney for the next 6 years.\n  Why might that be a good idea? I think ultimately--and while for \nyears we have used user fees, gas taxes, diesel taxes, to fund most of \nour road construction at the national level and for our road repairs--\nto be honest with you, over time, our cars, trucks, and vans have been \nmore energy efficient.\n  My Chrysler minivan that I mentioned earlier gets about 24 miles per \ngallon on the highway, but there are vehicles today, including \nminivans, including trucks, that do a whole lot better than that. We \nhave smaller passenger cars that routinely get 40 and even 50 miles to \nthe gallon. To say that the diesel tax and the gas tax are forever the \nsole solution is probably not realistic. We have some vehicles on the \nroad that are pretty much all electric. They do not buy any gas. They \ndo not buy any diesel fuel. When they need a refill, they pull up and \nrecharge their batteries. We have some folks who buy vehicles that are \npowered by fuel cells. They run on hydrogen or natural gas, methane.\n  So given the changing mix in the way we move ourselves and goods and \nservices around the country, that sole reliance on user fees, by a gas \ntax and diesel tax, forever is not a good idea.\n  Among the other ideas that are out there is tolling. People who come \nthrough my State on I-95 pay a toll. A lot of them use E-ZPass. They \ncan go through our State on the highway using E-ZPass so they don't \nhave to sit in line and wait. Their credit card accounts get charged \nfor their travel. We have a similar kind of arrangement on State Route \n1, where a lot of people come through our State from I-95 heading south \nto our beaches or to Dover Air Force Base. We have highway-speed E-\nZPass there too. So tolling is part of the future.\n  Another idea that is being experimented with by the States--it is \nreferred to in different ways--but I think of it as vehicle miles \ntraveled. Is there a way we can actually figure out how much, in terms \nof a true user--how many miles we are actually traveling in our \nvehicles and assess some kind of fee at the Federal level or maybe at \nthe State level on those who are driving cars, trucks, and vans.\n  Folks in Oregon have been working on this the longest. I think they \nstarted this effort about 10 years ago. They call it a road user \ncharge. That is another way of saying vehicle miles traveled. I think \nat the end of the day--not the end of the day but in 10, 15, 20 years, \nwe will have figured out how to actually do vehicle miles traveled/road \nuser charges in a cost-effective way that is protective of people's \nrights to privacy.\n  The other area that I think we will do a better job in is tolling, \nmoving to more things like the highway-speed E-ZPass, so people who \nwant to use a particular road will pay a toll and do so in a way that \nstill expedites movement of traffic as we do through highway-speed E-\nZPass. Having said that, if we are unable to come to an agreement at \nthe end of this year, if we are unable to come to an agreement on some \nkind of international tax reform, the idea of using a lot of cats and \ndogs to fund transportation improvements for the next 2 or 3 years--I \ndon't think that is a good outcome.\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\n  I am not a Congress of one. If I were, I would go back and say we \nshould look at--at least for the next 6 years--user fees. We have been \nusing user fees or taxing gas and diesel for a long time to provide for \nmost of the Federal share for these transportation construction \nprojects and improvements. I think the last time we raised the Federal \ngas tax was 1993. We raised it to 18.3 cents per gallon. We raised, at \nthe same time, the diesel taxes to 24.3 cents per gallon. We have not \nraised either of those for over 22 years. Since that time, the cost of \nasphalt, the cost of concrete, the cost of labor, the cost of steel \nhave all gone up, but the user fees, the gas tax and diesel tax, have \nnot gone up at all.\n  George Voinovich--former Governor, former U.S. Senator--and I worked \ntogether about 5 or 6 years on the Bowles-Simpson Commission to suggest \nan increase in the gas and diesel tax by a penny every quarter, by a \npenny every 3 months, for about 15 quarters. We were roughly saying 3 \nor 4 cents a year for 4 years and then index the gas tax after that to \nthe rate of inflation so we did not have to come back and re-address it \nevery year or every 2 or 3 or 4 years.\n  That is an idea that was actually adopted in the Bowles-Simpson \nreport, but much of what the Bowles-Simpson report included has not \nbeen enacted. One of the things I am going to be doing--and I hope \ncolleagues in the House as well as in the Senate--in the next day or \ntwo is introducing an increase in the gas and diesel tax of 4 cents a \nyear for the next 4 years--that will be 16 cents over the next 4 \nyears--and then indexing the gas tax and diesel tax to the rate of \ninflation.\n  What would that cost the average family, the average driver in this \ncountry? On a weekly basis, it would be about $2, actually less than \n$2. I don't know what people pay for a cup of coffee, but I am told you \ncan buy--I bought a cup of coffee today for $1.70. Some people buy it \nfor less. Some people buy it for $2 or more. But for roughly a cup of \ncoffee a week, we could have better roads, highways, bridges--a whole \nlot better.\n  By doing that, we would raise, over the next 10 years, $180 billion, \nmaybe even more, to be able to provide for our construction needs, \nroads, highways, bridges, and transit. We have the system in place. We \nknow how to do it. The price of gasoline--I bought gas the other day in \nCentral Delaware, in Dover. I paid $2.53 a gallon. It was down by about \n20 cents over the last month. If the Iran deal actually goes through \nand is approved, the Iranians are expected to add to a world already \nawash in oil. So the price of oil is coming down. The Iranians would \nadd, I am told, about another half billion barrels of oil to the \nmarketplace and probably continue to push down the price of oil.\n  I ask us to keep that in mind. Some people say we will never be able \nto get the votes for an increase in the gas or diesel tax, even if it \nis phased in for 4 cents a year for 4 years. But there were six States \nlast year across the country--most of them with Republican Governors \nand Republican legislatures--that did something like this. They did not \nraise the gas tax by $1 or 50 cents or even 25 cents, but they raised \nit, in some cases, over several years.\n  The question is, Can State legislators or Members of the Congress \nactually vote to meet our transportation needs? Can they actually vote \nfor this stuff and get reelected? As it turns out, 95 percent of the \nRepublicans in these six States and State legislatures--95 percent of \nthe Republican legislators who voted for these user fee increases won \ntheir primaries last year and they won their generals. They were \nreelected.\n  Among the Democrats who voted in those six States last year to raise \nuser fees, 90 percent of them won their primaries, they won the general \nelection. They were reelected. For people who say you cannot vote to do \na tough thing and still get reelected, I would just say look at those \nsix States from last year. Other States are going to follow in those \nfootsteps this year as well.\n  So the long term--I will wrap it up at this point in time. I see \nSenator Grassley is on the floor. But long term, the worst option is to \ndo nothing. The worst option is to do nothing. I have a glass of water \nhere. I am going to ask the pages to bring me a couple more glasses, \njust empty glasses, if they will quickly. Senator Grassley is waiting \nto talk. Bear with me. This is show-and-tell on the Senate floor. I \ndon't think this is against the rules, but if it is, maybe the \nPresiding Officer will cut me a break.\n  We will say this glass of water that is sitting right here is world \ncapital markets, a lot of money, trillions of dollars. Some of it is \nfrom sovereign nations, some of it is from trust funds, pension funds, \nand so forth. This glass is empty. This is the U.S. transportation \ntrust fund. It is empty.\n  When we run out of money and we don't raise taxes or revenues to fill \nit, we turn to the general fund. We say let's take money out of the \ngeneral fund and put some of it into the transportation trust fund. \nThis glass is empty too. Our debt is down, our deficit is down--our \ndebt is not down--our deficit is down, but we still are running a big \ndeficit. There is no money in the general fund to refill the \ntransportation trust fund these days.\n  So what we do is we go out into the world capital markets--here, \nwhere there is a lot of money--and we borrow. We sell Treasury \nsecurities. So as it turns out, one of the best buyers for those \nTreasury securities is China. So we ask China: How about buying some of \nour Treasury securities? They do. Then when the Chinese turn around and \nstart pushing around the Vietnamese or the Filipinos in the South China \nSea, around the Spratly Islands and places I used to fly as a naval \nflight officer years ago--when the Chinese--and I don't think they are \ndoing this so much anymore, but they manipulate their currency.\n  When the Chinese are trying to maybe dump some of their products in \nthis country illegally and we say you can't do that, China, you can't \ndo that, for the Chinese, it is very easy to say I thought you wanted \nto borrow money, and it puts us in a very awkward position as a nation.\n  If things are worth having, they are worth paying for. I don't think \nthe pay-fors that were used in the--not the 6-year authorization bill \nthat passed here--the Transportation bill is really a 3-year. I don't \nthink the idea of taking money away from Customs fees and different \nother sources to use for purposes for which it was never intended--for \ntransportation purposes--I don't think that is the way to do this.\n  The good news is this: The House is in one place, the Senate is in \nanother. We have several months to figure this out. I hope we use these \nseveral months to drill down real hard on the idea of international tax \nreform, the deemed repatriation, which will provide hundreds of \nmillions of dollars for transportation over the next 6 years. If that \ndoes not work, I want us to look at some other alternatives. The worst \nalternative is to get to December and say: Well, let's just borrow some \nmore money or let's come up with some cats and dogs and patch this and \nkick the can down the road again.\n  So I am going to work very hard as a member of the Finance Committee \non the international tax reform piece. I know Senator Grassley, if I am \nnot mistaken, is the senior Republican on the Finance Committee and \nsomebody who is a key participant in trying to find common ground. He \nis good at that. I look forward to working with him on that.\n  I will close with this. To me, the message from the American people \nin the elections from last November was threefold: People want us to \nwork together. They want us to get important things done, and among the \nmost important is to further strengthen an already strengthening \neconomy. A big piece of that can be transportation. The American people \nexpect us to make tough decisions. This is a tough negotiation, but it \nis one we have to have. We have to have a good outcome in the end.\n  With that, I thank my friend from Iowa for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                            False Claims Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I often come to the floor to honor \nwhistleblowers but more importantly to talk about their very important \nrole in making government function.\n  On July 30, 1778, the Continental Congress passed the very first \nwhistleblower law in the United States. It read:\n\n       [I]t is the duty of all persons in the service of the \n     United States . . . to give the earliest\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\n     information to Congress or other proper authority of any \n     misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers \n     or persons in the service of these states, which may come to \n     their knowledge.\n\n  Probably for the last 6, 7 years, I have been referring to this \naround the time of July 30.\n  Going back to 1778, we have had recognition of the important role \nwhistleblowers can play in making sure government is responsible. \nWhistleblowers have always been crucial in helping Congress and the \nFederal Government root out fraud and misconduct.\n  It is simple common sense to reward and protect whistleblowers who \nreport waste of taxpayers' money, fraudulent use of taxpayers' money, \nand outright simple abuse. The False Claims Act does that. In fiscal \nyear 2014 alone, the Federal Government recovered nearly $6 billion \nunder the False Claims Act. That makes more than $22 billion since \nJanuary 2009 and more than $42 billion since I got the legislation \npassed in 1986. These recoveries represent victories across a wide \narray of industries and government programs. Those programs include \nmortgage insurance, Federal student aid, Medicare and Medicaid, as well \nas defense contracts.\n  The Department of Justice credits whistleblowers for their important \nrole in the success, for the money that has come back to the Federal \nTreasury, and for the carrying out of the False Claims Act. According \nto the Justice Department, whistleblowers accounted for $3 billion in \nrecoveries under that act in just fiscal year 2014. In fact, over 80 \npercent of False Claims Act cases are initiated by whistleblowers.\n  Clearly, the False Claims Act is working very well. Of course, the \nact has no shortage of critics--typically in the groups where you find \nperpetrators of fraud. But we have learned our lesson that a weak False \nClaims Act is not in the taxpayers' best interests.\n  In 1943, Congress bowed to the pressure to undo the act's crucial qui \ntam provisions. Amendments passed in that era of World War II barred \nactions where the government already had knowledge of fraud. The result \nwas to block nearly all private actions. Congress assumed--and now we \ncan say assumed wrongly--that the Justice Department could do a good \njob prosecuting fraud all by itself. As I said, they were wrong. \nBetween 1943 and 1986, when the False Claims Act was amended, fraud \nagainst the government skyrocketed. Most of those accused went \nunpunished.\n  A 1981 report by the Government Accountability Office said:\n\n       For those who are caught committing fraud, the chances of \n     being prosecuted and eventually going to jail are slim. . . . \n     The sad truth is that crime against the Government often does \n     pay.\n\n  So in 1986 I coauthored much needed amendments to the False Claims \nAct. The 1986 amendments once again gave citizens the ability to help \nthe government go after fraud in a meaningful way. For example, the \namendments provided protection for whistleblowers and eliminated the \nimpossible government knowledge bar. Essentially, a relator's suit was \nonly barred where the fraud had been publicly disclosed. The amendments \nalso clarified that the act covers false claims made not just directly \nto a government agency; it also covers fraud against grantees, States, \nand other recipients of Federal funds, whether or not the fund \nobligation is fixed.\n  These provisions and others were intended to give the False Claims \nAct teeth again, and they did. However, as happens with a lot of \nlegislation Congress passes, the courts chipped away at the heart of \nthe False Claims Act and ignored the intent of Congress. The assault on \nthe act came to a head in the Supreme Court's erroneous opinions in the \nwell-known cases of Allison Engine and Totten. The Court held that the \nact required proof of intent that the government itself pay a claim and \nthat a claim is presented directly to the government.\n  The problem with that logic is it creates a loophole big enough to \ndrive a truck through. A third party paid with government money would \nget away with fraud because a contractor, not the government agency, \npaid the claim. So in 2009 we passed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct and made very clear that was not consistent with the original \nintent of the 1986 False Claims Act. The act reaches false claims for \ngovernment money or property, whether or not the wrongdoer deals \ndirectly with the Federal Government. It was never the intent of \nCongress to give a free pass to subcontractors or other parties \nreceiving government funds. In fact, those folks are some of the \nbiggest perpetrators of fraud today.\n  The inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services \nhas reported a 134-percent increase in complaints against Medicare Part \nD in just the last 5 years. By not stopping fraud against programs such \nas Medicare Part D, the government is hemorrhaging funds. Taxpayer \nmoney is taxpayer money. Fraud does not magically become OK just \nbecause a third party is involved.\n  Of course, the issue of presentment to government officials is not \nthe only sticking point. There has been pushback in courts and from \nlobbyists about all sorts of issues, such as the ``public disclosure \nbar,'' settlement practices, and award shares for relators. Through it \nall, Congress has had to stay vigilant in keeping courts and Federal \nagencies generally true to our original legislative intent.\n  As an example, just recently the Justice Department tried to minimize \na relator award in a Medicare and Medicaid fraud case. The relator \ncontributed significantly to the case. The judge recognized that \nCongress intended that ``the only measuring stick'' for an award is \n``the contribution of the relator.'' Those are the words the judge use, \nand that judge was right.\n  Congress intended to empower, to protect, and to reward relators who \nidentify fraud against the taxpayers. History teaches us that weakening \nthe relator's rights weakens the government's ability to fight fraud. \nAll that does is let wrongdoers off the hook, and it costs the \ntaxpayers money. That is not the result we intended with the False \nClaims Act. And the Continental Congress, which was so concerned about \nidentifying misconduct, fraud, and misdemeanors, would not have wanted \nthose results I just talked about.\n  I want to remind my colleagues to stand strong for the effective tool \nthat we have to combat fraud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      50th Anniversary of Medicare\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I remind my colleagues that tomorrow \nmarks the 50th anniversary of President Johnson traveling to \nIndependence, MO, to be with President Truman, who in the 1940s had \nattempted to push through Congress legislation to expand the Social \nSecurity Act to include what we now call Medicare. When President \nJohnson went to Independence, MO, he signed the legislation.\n  The one we pay the most attention to is Medicare, which is health \ncare for the elderly, but probably equally important and certainly very \nsignificant is the creation of Medicaid. Medicaid came out of several \nyears of congressional debate where Congress understood that low-income \npeople--especially low-income people who were working--didn't have \ninsurance. It was for people who were poor, people in nursing homes, \nand it evolved for elderly people. Most of the money in Medicaid goes \nto take care of the elderly in nursing homes, and it has had such an \nimpact on their lives.\n  But think about what Medicare has done. Prior to 1965, this social \ninsurance program--this program we call Medicare today--provided health \ncare to almost every senior. Prior to 1965, only about half of the \nsenior citizens in the United States of America had health insurance--\nonly about half. Huge numbers of the elderly lived in poverty. They \nlived in poverty partly because for a whole host of reasons they \ncouldn't save enough and Social Security wasn't quite enough. Many \nlived in poverty because of their health care costs. They would go to \nthe doctor and have to pay out of pocket. They barely could afford that \nand sometimes couldn't afford that.\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\n  So what Medicare does is it provides 50 million seniors today with \nhealth insurance. It wasn't easy. A majority of Republicans in the \nHouse and the Senate opposed the creation of Medicare. The John Birch \nSociety--we know it today as the tea party--the John Birch Society in \nthose days opposed the creation of Medicare. Insurance interests and \nthe medical interests opposed Medicare. It was a huge struggle. As I \nsaid, a majority of Republicans voted against the creation of Medicare. \nJust like the Affordable Care Act--Republicans didn't like the \nAffordable Care Act and don't like the Affordable Care Act today. \nRepublicans didn't like Medicare a generation and a half ago and \nopposed it. Bob Dole--then Congressman Dole, later Senator Dole, later \nPresidential candidate, Republican nominee Dole--bragged about opposing \nMedicare, saying it wouldn't work. He bragged about that for a couple \nof decades after it took effect. But we know social insurance works.\n  What is social insurance? Social insurance is where everybody pays \ninto something. Whether it is Social Security, whether it is \nunemployment insurance, whether it is Medicare, people pay into a \ngovernment program of some kind, and then when they need it, they get \nassistance. You pay into Social Security. If you become disabled, you \nget a benefit. Once you retire, you get a benefit. You paid into it. It \nis called social insurance.\n  You pay into Medicare all your working life, but when you turn 65, \nyou receive a Medicare benefit. You get health insurance; you get \nhospitalization; you get a doctor's benefit.\n  You pay into unemployment insurance, which is another kind of social \ninsurance. When you get laid off, you get assistance so you can \ncontinue to feed your family and go on with not as good a lifestyle but \nat least you will have enough to get along. That is why social \ninsurance matters.\n  What is troubling about all of this is there are still people in this \ncountry--particularly conservative Republicans--who just don't like \nsocial insurance. They don't like Social Security. They don't like \nunemployment insurance. They don't like Medicare. They will tell you \nthey do. Very few politicians running for office say they don't like \nMedicare. But we know that because if, in fact, they get elected, we \nknow what they do when they are in office. They try to privatize Social \nSecurity, as President Bush did. They try to voucherize Medicare, as \nthe Republican Vice Presidential nominee in 2012, Paul Ryan, tried to \ndo. And we know what so many Republicans--conservatives, the most \nconservative Republicans--thought about unemployment insurance when \nthey tried to cut it back, when they tried to weaken it, and when they \ntried to undercut it.\n  So while government isn't close to solving all of our problems, \nsocial insurance sets a safety net that protects the public. It \nprotects you in your old age with Medicare. It protects you if you are \ndisabled with Social Security. It protects you if you are laid off with \nunemployment insurance.\n  That is why, when people hear my colleagues--particularly, again, the \nmost conservative Republicans, who have never supported these \nprograms--go after these programs, understand what privatization means \nand understand what vouchers mean. It means shifting costs of health \ncare to seniors instead of this program taking care of those seniors. \nIt means privatizing Social Security.\n  In my State of Ohio, half of the senior citizens rely on Social \nSecurity for more than half of their income. So think what would have \nhappened if a decade and a half ago President Bush had actually been \nsuccessful in trying to turn Social Security over to Wall Street, which \nis what he wanted to do. If he had been successful in turning Social \nSecurity over to Wall Street, think what would have happened to \npeople's Social Security checks in 2007, in 2008, in 2009, in 2010, and \nin 2011, when the bottom fell out of Wall Street and our financial \nsystems. That is why these social systems are so important.\n  That is why tomorrow, when we commemorate the 50th anniversary of \nPresident Johnson traveling to Independence, MO, to the home of \nPresident Truman and his signing the Medicare bill, and how much it has \nmeant to generation after generation--my parents, my grandparents, and \nthe parents and grandparents of so many of us in this body and in the \ngallery--that matters so much to us.\n  So I wanted to stop by the floor to say happy birthday to Medicare--\nhappy 50th birthday. We want to see another 50 years where Medicare \nmakes a huge difference in the lives of so many Americans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the multiyear \nsurface transportation bill before the Senate. The current \nauthorization is set to expire this Friday when the highway trust fund \nwill be depleted to levels that can no longer fully reimburse States \nfor construction that has already been completed. Unfortunately, it \nlooks as though we are going to have yet another short-term extension, \nrather than immediately enacting a longer term bill, as the House of \nRepresentatives is preparing to send the Senate a 3-month extension.\n  This is a critical time of year for many States, particularly for my \nhome State of Maine, where peak construction work occurs during a very \nshort construction season. It would be irresponsible for Congress not \nto pass a bipartisan bill this week and keep those projects moving \nforward.\n  I hope this fall we will finally be able to come together with our \ncolleagues in the House to send to the President a multiyear surface \ntransportation bill.\n  The State of Maine currently receives $170 million of Federal highway \nfunds annually, and the Maine Department of Transportation needs and \nobligates every single dollar. Under the multiyear bill before the \nSenate, Maine would do even better and would receive nearly $190 \nmillion the first year, increasing to nearly $215 million. The \nlegislation before us also prioritizes bridge reconstruction and \nsafety. This funding is critical, as 364 of Maine's bridges have been \nrated as structurally deficient.\n  The commissioner of Maine's Department of Transportation tells me \nthat if the highway trust fund is not fixed by July 31, the department \nwill have to stop construction projects midstream within weeks. This \nwould be devastating for the State's economy, for the people employed \nin these well-paying construction jobs, and for the transportation \ninfrastructure in desperate need of repair and rehabilitation.\n  The lack of consistent multiyear funding for the highway trust fund \nmakes it so difficult for States to plan, causes construction companies \nto delay hiring workers, and costs the government more in the long run \ndue to the uncertainty of funding. According to the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the States \nof Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming are among those that \nhave already postponed bidding on major transportation projects due to \nthe uncertainty of Federal funding.\n  While I feel I have no choice but to support a short-term patch to \nprevent the highway trust fund from expiring later this week, this \nshort-term approach is not the answer. It needs to stop being the norm. \nIt epitomizes Congress's failure to govern sensibly--to govern in a \ncost-effective way, to govern in a way that allows for the creation of \ngood jobs in this country, and the renovation, repair, and \nrehabilitation of our vital transportation system.\n  We in the Senate have the opportunity to pass a multiyear surface \ntransportation bill that reauthorizes our highways, transit, rail, and \nsafety programs, while keeping the highway trust fund solvent for the \nnext 3 years. This legislation gives State departments of \ntransportation the certainty they need to continue planning, investing, \nand constructing thousands of highway and infrastructure projects that \nthe entire Nation relies upon. These investments create jobs, boost our \nNation's economy, and keep us competitive in the global marketplace.\n  The legislation maintains the Federal-aid highway formula program\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\nstructure. This funding is not only crucial for building new highways \nand bridges but also to maintain and repair our Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure, including, as I mentioned, the thousands of deficient \nbridges across the Nation.\n  With the consideration of this important bill, we are one step \nfurther to responsible investments, steady investments in \ninfrastructure that millions of Americans count on every day. That is \nwhy I am so disappointed that instead we will do yet another short-term \npatch. We need to get away from that method of funding the highway \ntrust fund.\n  I also wish to highlight today the importance of the national \ninfrastructure investment grants, otherwise known as the TIGER program. \nWhile this program was not included in the underlying bill, Senators \nMurray, Reed, and I have filed an amendment, along with Senators \nCochran, Shelby, and others, that would authorize this highly \nsuccessful TIGER grant program. This program has been such an effective \ninitiative. It has helped to advance critical transportation \ninfrastructure projects across our great country. It is one of the most \nflexible transportation programs in which State and local authorities \ncan apply for funding. Every Senator here has seen firsthand how TIGER \nprojects create good jobs and support economic growth in our home \nStates. The program has supported highway, bridge, port, rail, and \ntransit projects from this highly competitive program.\n  In fact, let me give my colleagues some idea of the demand for the \nTIGER grants. To date, the TIGER program has received a total of $4.6 \nbillion through appropriations from fiscal year 2009 through 2015, \nawarding 342 projects in all 50 States. Here is how many applications \nwere submitted. Remember that 342 projects were actually funded. There \nwere 6,700 applications that were received by the Department, totaling \nnearly $134 billion in funding requests. So my colleagues can see that \nthe pent-up demand is just enormous. This demonstrates how \noversubscribed the TIGER program is and how much it is needed by our \nState and local governments. I have received numerous letters of \nsupport for our amendment, some of which include Transportation for \nAmerica and more than 150 elected officials, State departments of \ntransportation, metropolitan planning organizations, and chambers of \ncommerce. You name it; they have endorsed our amendment to authorize \nthis important program.\n  This is just one of the many ways my colleagues and I would like to \nwork to improve this bipartisan bill. Our TIGER grant amendment is \nwidely supported on both sides of the aisle, and I believe it would \npass were we able to get a vote.\n  It has been a privilege to work very closely with my colleagues, \nSenator Murray and Senator Reed, both of whom I have worked with on the \ntransportation-HUD subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, as \nwell as Republicans such as Senator Cochran and Senator Shelby at the \nfull committee level on this program. But, most of all, it is important \nthat we act and act quickly to pass a multiyear surface transportation \nbill that will create jobs and on which our country can depend.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman).\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the Senator from \nMaine on the floor today to speak about this critical infrastructure \nprogram called TIGER. She and I have worked together for many years on \ntransportation infrastructure, and I so appreciate her leadership and \nher tremendous enthusiasm in making sure that our country does the \nright thing. It is a delight to be here today with her, as well as with \nmy colleague from Rhode Island, who is now the ranking member on the \ntransportation appropriations subcommittee. I thank them both for \ncoming to the floor to speak about a program that we created several \nyears ago and that has been so effective.\n  We all know that investing in our Nation's infrastructure is a \ncritical part of broad-based and long-term economic growth. As we can \nsee today, this is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans \nagree that infrastructure investments get workers back on the job, help \nour economy grow in communities across this country, and make sure our \ntransportation systems work in a 21st century economy. That is why I am \nso proud to be a strong supporter of this bipartisan amendment that we \nare offering today. It has 29 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. \nWhat it does is it continues the popular competitive grant program \nknown as TIGER.\n  TIGER grants have made an impact in every corner of this country, and \nthey represent exactly the type of investment our country should be \nmaking--addressing our Nation's short-term and long-term transportation \nissues while creating good-paying jobs--American jobs, I would add--and \nworking to grow our economy from the middle out, not just the top down.\n  We have all seen firsthand the difference the TIGER program can make \nin our States. So that is why I fought, along with my colleagues, to \nget this amendment included in the final Transportation bill.\n  Since its creation, TIGER has awarded $4.1 billion directly to \ncommunities to support more than 340 innovative, multimodal projects in \nevery State. For example, TIGER grants are increasing the flow of \ncommerce and trade between Maine and New Hampshire because of \nimprovements to the Memorial Bridge. In New Mexico, TIGER grants are \nbeing used to make critical safety improvements to a major trucking \nroute where the fatality rate has been more than three times the State \naverage. In my home State of Washington, $204 million has gone to 13 \ncritical infrastructure projects across my State, from Seattle to \nSpokane to Vancouver.\n  Demand for TIGER funding is intense. Applications always exceed the \namount of funding available, sometimes by as much as 20 to 1. It is \nclear that we can and should be doing so much more to help communities \ncarry out these projects that make our transportation system safer and \nmore efficient.\n  Though we hit some unfortunate and unnecessary barriers in passing \nthe TIGER amendment, I know that Senator Collins and Senator Reed are \ngoing to continue fighting along with me to support this critical \nprogram. I hope more of our colleagues will join with us in boosting \nregional economies and in improving our Nation's infrastructure, \nbecause this type of program is so important to our States and our \nlocal agencies as they work to tackle the complex transportation needs \nof our communities.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me begin by commending Senator Collins \nand Senator Murray for their extraordinary leadership on this TIGER \nprogram in particular but in so many different aspects, particularly \nwith respect to transportation policy. They have done an extraordinary \njob, and today is no exception. I am delighted to be able to join them \non their amendment to increase resources for TIGER grants.\n  I am disappointed, as are my colleagues, that this is merely, in some \nrespects, a discussion amendment--we can't bring it up for a vote--\nbecause I think this is an effort, as Senator Collins pointed out, that \nwould be supported strongly by both sides of the aisle.\n  Since 2009, the TIGER program has helped State and local governments \nmake critical investments in their infrastructure all across this \ncountry. In many respects, it is the final piece of a puzzle of how we \nget needed, necessary infrastructure in place. It has been that \ncatalyst that has brought private funds and State funds and local funds \ntogether to accomplish something that makes sense to our economy and to \nthe efficiency and productivity of our States.\n  TIGER is able to leverage additional resources. It is a program that \nhas been wildly popular to construct roads and bridges, public transit, \nports, and passenger and freight railroads. It is very flexible. Its \nflexibility, its adaptability, and its ability to coalesce other \nresources has been remarkable. As a result, it has been extraordinarily \npopular.\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\n  Through the TIGER program, the U.S. Department of Transportation has \nsupported more than 340 different projects in all 50 States and in the \nDistrict of Columbia. These projects have improved safety, they have \nconnected workers to jobs, and they have supported economic \ndevelopment. By the way, they put people to work right away in an \neconomy that needs people to be working right now.\n  As Senator Collins pointed out, the demand has far outstripped the \nresources: 6,700 applications for the roughly 300 grants. We can do \nmore. The appetite is there, the need is there, and the competitive \nprocess ensures that these needed resources are targeted to \nextraordinarily important programs. So for many of these reasons this \nis one of those programs that is just win-win-win. Unfortunately, we \ncannot bring it forward on this legislation. This funding is absolutely \nnecessary.\n\n  I have seen in my home State of Rhode Island that without the TIGER \ngrant we would not have been able to jump-start a project which is the \nInterstate 95 viaduct. It sounds interesting, but it is actually \ncritical. It is the center of I-95 in Providence, RI, which is the \nmajor north-south highway in New England. If this viaduct project could \nnot be funded, then essentially there would be a roadblock on I-95. \nTIGER has helped this project move forward. We have to do more, but it \nhas helped to move this project forward.\n  It has helped ports in Providence and at Quonset Point. All of these \nare so necessary because they improve our economic competitiveness \nglobally, regionally, nationally; they put people to work, and they \nprepare us for much more complicated issues in the world economy. As I \nsaid before, we are all disappointed that because of this process we \ncan't have a debate and have a vote. We are also disappointed because \nwe bypassed in this process the committees that typically do these \nthings--the Banking Committee for transit, the Finance Committee for \nthe pay-fors for this legislation. Again, I am disappointed we could \nnot have done it the old fashioned way, through the committees and \nbring it to the floor. If we had that approach, we could have improved \nthe offsets that we are using to pay for these programs. We could have \nconsidered amendments like this. We could have done a lot of things.\n  Now we all have additional amendments that we are filing, but we \nwon't be able to take them up. I have got one in terms of pay-fors that \nwould produce $55 billion over 10 years--robust funding for a score of \nhighway programs--and it is by capping the deduction of publicly traded \ncorporations for employee salaries over $1 million. I think most \nAmericans would say if someone is getting over $1 million we shouldn't \nbe subsidizing that with tax reimbursement. They very well may be worth \nthat money, but that is a judgment the corporation should make, and if \nthey think it is worthwhile, they are the ones who should put the money \nup, not with a subsidy from the tax code. That is just an example of \nsome of the ways we could generate real resources.\n  Again, let me say how strongly I support this amendment, how much we \nreally owe the determination, the vision, and the thoughtfulness of \nSenator Collins and Senator Murray. I must also thank Senator Inhofe \nand Senator Boxer for their work on getting us at least this far. We \nhave got to go further, but they have got us at least this far.\n  It looks as if, given that the House is leaving, this bill will not \nbe enacted this week. Certainly, we have got a template which I hope we \ncan improve on as we spend the few months' extension that will be the \nultimate result of this week. In that time I think one of the measures \nthat will be improved is the TIGER program and other things that we can \nand must do.\n  Let me conclude where I began and thank very sincerely Senator \nCollins and Senator Murray.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. I am sure I won't take that long.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. President, I will speak further on the efforts to defund health \nservices for women later on, but I am concerned about those Senators \nwho are attacking women's health with a renewed effort to eliminate \nhealth centers that thousands of Vermonters rely on every day. Across \nthe country we have millions of low-income women who depend on Planned \nParenthood health centers for lifesaving preventive treatments and \ncare, including annual exams, cervical and breast cancer screenings, \nand HIV screenings and counseling. These clinics are the primary source \nof health services for many women. Eliminating Federal funding for \nPlanned Parenthood health centers would deny women access to these \ncritical services. They will force women to find medical care elsewhere \nor, more devastatingly--or more probable--to simply go without.\n  The partisan bill that was introduced yesterday in the Senate is the \nlatest attempt to score political points. It is bumper sticker politics \nat its worst. Needlessly jeopardizing the health care of millions of \nAmericans who depend on these preventive care services is a bid to \nrally a base that is as irresponsible as it is offensive to this \nSenator. I know women in Vermont who tell me they go for their health \ncare, their cancer screening, to the Planned Parenthood centers because \nthey feel they have people they feel comfortable with. They can bring \ntheir daughters, their children there. They know they are going to be \ncared for. They know people will care for them. They don't care whether \nthey are Republicans or Democrats, they are women who need health care, \nand I will strongly oppose the effort that is going to be before us in \nthis body to cut off health care for women.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for his remarks. I agree \nwith him, and I will be speaking later on today on the same topic.\n  I want to go back to speaking about the Transportation bill. I want \nto thank my colleagues for the strong show of support we had on this \nbill. We had 65 colleagues voting to end debate and get to a vote. We \ndo expect a good vote tomorrow, but I have to say that the reaction of \nthe House Speaker took me aback. Remember that the bill we passed was \ntotally bipartisan, with a majority of Democrats and a strong majority \nof Republicans. Senators Inhofe, McConnell, Boxer, Durbin, and a host \nof others worked very hard on this bill. Why would the Speaker of the \nHouse be so negative about it? As a matter of fact, his comments that \nwere reported in the Politico online version today were such that I \ncan't repeat what was said on the floor of the Senate because I would \nbe breaking the rules. I will leave it up to everybody to see exactly \nwhat he said about our bipartisan bill. Actually, the name on the bill \nis that of the Republican leader of the U.S. Senate. Yet the Speaker of \nthe House demeans our bill.\n  I want to be clear that I defend freedom of speech and I defend the \nright of Speaker Boehner to say whatever he wants; therefore, I can say \nwhatever I want. What I would like to ask is why on Earth would you \noppose a bill that is so bipartisan, that received 65 votes, and that \nthe Republican leader has put his name to? Why would you do that?\n  Another question is this--and I put up this chart. Where is the House \nbill? One could argue that you don't like our bill. Where is your bill? \nWhat have you done? Where have they been?\n  We have known about this transportation crisis for a long, long time. \nThe Presiding Officer and I have worked hard together on getting a \nstrong bill, even though we disagree on so many things. The bill was \nvoted out of the Environment and Public Works Committee 20 to 0. Yet \nthe Republican Speaker of the House condemns the bill. Where is the \nHouse bill?\n  We are about to pass the third extension since the last \nTransportation bill expired in 2014. There have been dozens and dozens \nof extensions--more than 30. We know that when the highway trust fund \nis extended for just a couple of months at a time--and Senator Inhofe \nhas taught me this because I was not aware--it is administratively\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\nvery expensive to do, and on the ground what is happening is States are \nshutting down their projects.\n  Let's look at the seven States that have essentially canceled or \ndelayed projects because there has been inaction. Arkansas has canceled \nor delayed highway projects, as well as Delaware, Georgia, Montana, \nTennessee, Utah, and Wyoming. Why have these States done this? Because \nthey are concerned that we don't have a long-term highway bill. That is \nwhy we are so excited about the bill that looks like it is on its way \nto passage because it is a 6-year authorization with a full 3 years of \nfunding. Again, I ask the Speaker rhetorically what is it about the \nbill that he doesn't like?\n  Let's go to the highlights of the bipartisan Senate bill. I will \ndiscuss them. I would put up the chart which asks ``Where is the House \nbill?'' because that is the common question I want to ask today. It is \neasy to throw darts at someone else and say I don't like what you did. \nWhat you did wasn't good enough. Where is your answer? They have \nnothing--nothing but another paltry extension. Why did they do that? \nEither they don't have an idea in the world as to how to proceed or \nthey want to go on a 5\\1/2\\-week break.\n  The American people--most of us--work. I ask rhetorically: How many \npeople in America who hold down a job get a 5\\1/2\\-week break, which is \ncalled the August break, which begins in July, and they get that break \nwithout taking care of pressing business? I think your boss would say: \nYou know what. You have a lot of problems here, so stay another couple \nof days. Oh, no, they want to get out of town. They originally were \ngoing to get out of town tomorrow. My understanding is they are trying \nto get out today. That gives them a 5\\1/2\\-week break without taking \ncare of business.\n  I think anybody who is watching this who really cares about the \nhighway trust fund, transportation, and bridges collapsing--let's look \nat this one that happened in California. This is a frightening view of \na bridge that collapsed. We were so lucky. We thank God that nobody was \nkilled. California now has a bridge that has collapsed, and people have \nto go 400 miles out of their way to go from California to Arizona or \nArizona to California. We are hoping to fix it with emergency funds, \nbut we can't rebuild the part that fell that quickly. We need a long-\nterm bill.\n  I say to the Speaker: Don't go home. I say to the majority whip over \nthere, my friend from California: Don't go home. Stay and do your job. \nThe American people are not going to think very highly of you if you \nleave with this highway trust fund going broke on Friday.\n  The Senate has passed a bill. It is a good bill. The Speaker has used \nsome words I cannot use on the floor to describe it.\n  I want to ask the Speaker what it is that he doesn't like. What is it \nthat he doesn't like? Is it the $55 billion a year for 6 years, the \nfirst 3 years being fully paid for with every State getting more \nfunding, including his State, for highways and transit? Does he not \nlike that? Does he think we shouldn't spend funding on fixing up our \nbridges, roads, and highways? Does he not like the two new programs--\nthe freight program, which would provide funds for States to improve \nthe movement of goods? Does he not like the assistance for major \nprojects, a program which is going to help our States when they know \nthere is a real problem in their community and they want to build a \nproject?\n  Does the Speaker not like the fact that we have tripled safety fines \nso when a Takata airbag problem happens the companies have to step up? \nDoes he not like the fact that there is a new law in there that says \nconsumers should be protected from renting a car that is under recall? \nWe stopped that. Does he not like the first-ever commuter rail fund for \npositive train control, where we can actually help our computer \nrailways put in positive train control so we will not have those \ntragedies that happened?\n  Why doesn't he like this bill? It has a long list of supporters. \nLet's look at the supporters. I guarantee you it is rare that you see \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce agreeing with the International Union of \nOperating Engineers. It is rare that the Laborers' International Union \nof North America agrees with the AAA, which agrees with the Conference \nof Mayors, which agrees with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, \nwhich agrees with the Association of State Highway and Transit \nOfficials, which agrees with the Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which \nagrees with the American Council of Engineering Companies. It goes on. \nIt goes on. It is rare to see it. The American Highway Users Alliance, \nthe American Public Transportation Association, the American Road & \nTransportation Builders, the Society of Civil Engineers, the trucking \nassociation, the equipment distributors, the general contractors, the \nequipment manufacturers, the Metropolitan Planning Organization, the \nNational Asphalt Pavement Association. It goes on and on and on. This \nis America.\n  The National Association of Counties--I used to serve as a county \nsupervisor. It is hard to get us to agree. They agree. Pass the bill. \nThe National Association of Manufacturers, I understand they scored \nthis vote. The National Association Of Truck Stop Operators, the \nNational Governors Association, the League of Cities, the ready mixed \nconcrete people, the stone, sand, and gravel people, the owner-operator \nindependent drivers, the Portland Cement Association, the retail \nindustry leaders.\n  The AFL-CIO sent a statement yesterday to the House: Take up this \nissue. If they do not love our bill, I--it is fine. I do not expect \nthem to, but I do say: Where is your bill? Where is it? You can stand \non the Capitol steps and say: I don't like this about it. I don't like \nthat about it. I don't like the pay-fors. I don't like what is on page \n50 or page 150. That is your right and I respect it. I support your \nright to say this is not a good bill, if you don't think so.\n  Where is your bill? Where is the House bill? Get it together. Do not \ngo on vacation. Wait until you finish this job because I will tell you \nwhat happens when you do go on vacation. The first person in your State \nto see you who was laid off--because States are cutting back. We know \nfrom the Association of General Contractors that these States lost \nconstruction jobs last month because we have not acted on a long-term \nbill: Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nMaryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New \nJersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and \nWisconsin.\n  Just last month the General Contractors told us that construction \nworkers were laid off because we have not acted. I want to say to the \nSpeaker, Ohio is on the list. You lost jobs in Ohio. What are you doing \nby just saying you don't like this bill? Stay in. Do your work. You \nhave terrific people on both sides of the aisle on your Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee. I had the privilege of working on both \nsides of the aisle with Chairman Shuster, with Ranking Member DeFazio, \nand many other members of that committee. I know the Speaker has told \nme he wants a 6-year bill. I believe him, but why put it off?\n  We have the Inhofe-Boxer McConnell-Durbin product. It passed \noverwhelmingly. Take it up. Here is what the Committee for a \nResponsible Federal Budget said: It is refreshing to see Congress focus \non a multiyear solution instead of another short-term patch. They say \nof our bill: This is a fiscally responsible bill that relies on solid \noffsets.\n  Let me be clear. I did not love every offset. I see my friend from \nMaryland. He knows we tried desperately to get better offsets. There \nmay be a lot of people in the House who don't like the offsets. Why \ndon't you come together and figure out another way? Why don't you see \nif you can fully fund a 6-year bill? We fully funded a 3-year bill. So \nI ask the question of the Speaker: What is it about our bill that you \ndon't like and where is your bill?\n  Yesterday Chairman Shuster over there issued a statement: The House \nalso needs to make its voice heard and put forth its own priorities. He \nis right. So why are you going home for a 5\\1/2\\-week break when the \nSenate is going to be in session next week? Put off your little break \nhere--or your long-term break here, 5\\1/2\\ weeks. I do not know too \nmany American workers who get that kind of a break in the summer.\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\n  I say it is time to see your bill. I think we can get it done. I have \na lot of faith in the people over there. I served in the House for 10 \nproud years. I know how things get done. It gets done a lot easier than \nover here because here we have rules that are very old, which can allow \none person to hold up a bill for days and days, but they don't have it. \nThey don't have that kind of situation. They can come together, go \nthrough the committee, come out with a rule, bring the bill to the \nfloor, and get it done.\n  Let me quote from the Washington Post editorial:\n\n       The Senate bill authorizes 6 years of spending on \n     transportation projects under a sensible plan Senators Boxer \n     and Inhofe worked out. The bill provides 3 years of \n     guaranteed funding for the spending plan, raised from a \n     variety of sources.\n\n  They basically say--they don't love the process, neither did any of \nus. But they say it is a ``significant improvement from what Congress \nhas done for the past decade or so, as lawmakers fumbled from short-\nterm funding patch to short-term funding patch, a non-strategy that \noften relied on budget gimmicks and made it difficult for \ntransportation officials to conduct long-term planning.''\n  So we have an opportunity. The Senate has worked its will. We have a \ngood bill. Is it great? Is it perfect? No. Are the pay-fors great and \nperfect? No. Is every policy in it perfect? No. But as Amy Klobuchar \ntold me, we stood our ground, all of us, but we found common ground. \nThat is important. We stood our ground, but we found common ground. \nThat is how we are supposed to do things around here.\n  I look at my friend who is going to speak shortly from Maryland. I \nknow he set the pace with Senator Corker in working out some very \ndifficult issues in the Foreign Relations Committee, on which I am so \nproud to serve and so proud of my leader on that committee, Senator \nCardin. They set the pace over there.\n  Then Patty Murray, working with Lamar Alexander--they came out with \nan education bill. Then I worked with Senator Inhofe, and he worked \nwith me. Mitch McConnell worked with Senator Durbin. We came out with a \nproduct that is supported by a majority of both caucuses. I am proud of \nthe product. I know it is not perfect. I know if I had my way, I would \nhave drawn up a very different bill. So would Senator Inhofe. So would \nSenator McConnell. So would Senator Durbin.\n  But here is what is at stake. I will show you the bridge again. This \nis what is at stake. This is the face of what we are doing. It is \nbigger than our egos. It is bigger than our taking a 5\\1/2\\-week break. \nI served as a county supervisor. We knew the building we were in was \nearthquake deficient. It is still beautiful, Frank Lloyd Wright's last \nbuilt-out government building. I served in that gorgeous building. When \nI found out it could collapse in an earthquake and the five county \nsupervisors found that out--we were told many, many years ago it was \npossible we could be held liable because we knew absolutely that this \ncould crumble around us.\n  I am not saying for one second that any colleague is liable if \nsomething like this happens again, but I will tell you I think it is in \nfact a moral question for us. How long can we put this off? I guarantee \nyou a 3-month patch is not going to give the States the confidence to \nenter into any long-term agreements to fix any of the 60,000-plus \nbridges that are deficient and 50 percent of the roads that are not up \nto par.\n  So I say to the House, if you don't stay here and you go home after \npassing a short-term extension and someone comes up to you and says, \nCongressman or Congresswoman, I just got laid off. I am a construction \nworker--I guarantee you are going to have a hard time explaining why \nyou left and took a 5\\1/2\\-week break, August break, and you left \nbefore even August 1. It is the first time the House will have done \nthat in 10 years. They have not left before August 1 in 10 years.\n  There is a lot on our plates. Instead, we are going to talk about \nPlanned Parenthood. Fine. I welcome the argument because to me it is \nthe same old, same old argument about interfering with women's health. \nI will go there with you. I will be there with you. I will fight that \nbattle for the people of America, the women of America. I don't mind \nthat, but we have to do this. We have to do this in the House. We have \nto pass a bill.\n  So I hope the House will change its mind. The Republican leadership, \nthey know they control the schedule. They should cancel their recess \nand stay in an extra week. In that extra week, we can work together. If \nthe Speaker does not like our bill, he can write his own bill. We will \ngo to conference, we will start working on it, and we will get that \nbill. That is my ask today. My ask is, Where is the House bill? I am \nasking the House in the nicest way I know how: Please don't leave \ntonight or tomorrow on a 5\\1/2\\-week break with your desk a mess with \nthis issue. It is a mess with this issue.\n  The highway trust fund is going bust on Friday. If the best you can \ndo after knowing about this for months and months and months is give us \na paltry 3-month extension, then shame on you. The Senate has proven, \non a very bipartisan basis, that we can do better--not a 3-month \nextension but 3 years of a paid-for bill, 6 years of an authorized \nbill. Surely you can meet us and we can get this done together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first I want to thank Senator Boxer. It is \na privilege to serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee with \nSenator Boxer, under her and Senator Inhofe's leadership. The bill we \nreported out, a 6-year bill, is a bill that deals with the surface \ntransportation needs in this country.\n  It was put together in a very bipartisan manner. It respected and \nreflected different views. I had certain views with regard to \nalternative transportation programs. Not everybody agreed, but we were \nable to come together on that issue so we can help local governments \nwith their priorities.\n  We need a 6-year bill. The Senator is absolutely right. I must tell \nthe Senator, I could not agree with her more. We have been talking \nsince the last extension, the extension before that, and the extension \nbefore that, that we need to have a 6-year reauthorization. The Senator \nwas able, working with Senator Inhofe, to deliver a bill that does \nthat. We have yet to see a 6-year bill from the House of \nRepresentatives. We are prepared to make the hard decisions. We are \nprepared to sit down with our House colleagues and work out the \ndifferences, but we need a 6-year reauthorization, not another short-\nterm extension. They are talking now about 3 months. Another short-term \nextension provides no predictability. I have programs in Maryland, and \nI know the Senator from California has programs in her State, that you \ncannot plan with a 3-month partnership with the Federal Government. You \nneed to have the multiyear commitments.\n  What Senator Boxer was able to do in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--we need to duplicate that and get this done and get a bill \nto the President's desk. It is more important than the recess. I thank \nmy colleague for taking the floor and for her extraordinary work in \nthat regard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               50th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this week--tomorrow, to be precise--we \nwill be celebrating the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, \nwhich then-President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed into law on July 30, \n1965.\n  I take great pride in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, which fall \nunder the Social Security Act, because they are so successful, but also \nbecause--as I think most of my colleagues know--the headquarters for \nboth the Social Security Administration (SSA) and for CMS, the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, are located in Maryland. The men \nand women who work at SSA and CMS are doing incredible service to carry \nout some of the most important programs in our country: Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  For the past 50 years, our seniors and our most vulnerable citizens \nhave been able to rely upon Medicare to provide access to affordable, \nhigh-quality health care.\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\n  Let me underscore how important Medicare is to our country, to our \nseniors and those who suffer with disabilities. It allows them to be \nable to get quality health coverage, affordable care, without having to \ndeal with the difficulties of obtaining and paying for private \ninsurance. Private insurance makes money by insuring people who make \nfewer claims. As you get older, your health care needs become more \nintense. Therefore, private insurance companies aren't exactly excited \nto have people who make a lot of claims in their health insurance pool. \nThat is why we developed Medicare. We developed it so our seniors would \nbe able to have quality coverage.\n  Before we had Medicare, one out of every two seniors had no health \ninsurance. Our seniors are now able to get health care coverage. Today, \nonly 2 percent of adults aged 65 and older lack health insurance. \nBefore we had Medicare, nearly 60 percent of seniors' health care costs \ncame out of their pockets. Today, that is down to 13 percent. So we \nhave seen significant improvement over time. Before we had Medicare, 1 \nout of every 3 women aged 65 or older lived in poverty. Today, that \nnumber is 1 out of 10.\n  All of the indicators that we have show that Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security have accomplished their objectives. Now we are \ncelebrating the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  With regard to the Medicare Program, those seniors who have \ndisabilities and who qualify are allowed to have full coverage--again \nwithout having to worry about being discriminated against in the \nprivate insurance marketplace. In Medicaid, 33 million children are \ncovered, more than 1 out of every 3 in our Nation.\n  Over time we have improved these programs. The Medicaid program has \nbeen improved by the passage of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, a bipartisan bill that was passed by this body. It \nsignificantly improved access to care for our children, particularly \nour low-income children.\n  We have also improved access to coverage through the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act has strengthened and \nimproved Medicare and expanded Medicaid Programs to cover more low-\nincome Americans. To date, thanks to the ACA, 9.4 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries have saved more than $15 billion just on prescription \ndrugs. In Maryland alone, our seniors have saved more than $230 million \non their prescriptions.\n  I am particularly pleased that over the 50-year history of Medicare, \nwe have changed the program, improved it, and built upon it over time. \nWhen it was first enacted, it was there mainly to cover seniors' needs \nwhen they were injured and ill. It was an insurance program for when \nthey got sick or had an injury. Well, we have changed that focus to a \nwellness program to keep seniors healthy.\n  I am particularly proud that when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, I authored the bill that expanded Medicare to cover \npreventive health care, including screenings for colorectal cancer, \ndiabetes, and osteoporosis, and mammographies. Those tests were added \nin legislation that I authored in the House of Representatives. We have \ncome a long way since then, culminating with the Affordable Care Act \nthat eliminated all the copays for preventive health care.\n  Today, Medicare is keeping our senior population healthier. Seniors \nknow that their preventive health care is covered and that they can \ndetect diseases at an earlier stage and live healthier lives as a \nresult.\n  Over the past five decades, our Nation has seen incredible, positive \nchange as a result of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. On the 50th \nanniversary of the passage of this landmark legislation, let us \ncelebrate the progress we have made and work together to try to find \nways to build upon that progress by further improving our Nation's \nhealth care system to ensure that all Americans have access to \naffordable, high-quality health care and are able to live healthy, \nproductive lives.\n  This is particularly timely because I believe next week we are going \nto see an attack on women's health care. I urge my colleagues to \nrecognize the historical discrimination we have had against women's \nhealth care in this country. We dealt with that in the Affordable Care \nAct, some of the historical discriminations against women. But we need \nto be very careful about this because there is going to be an attack on \nPlanned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is particularly important for \nwomen's health care needs. Yes, it does deal with contraceptive \nservices--that is very important for women--but it also deals with \npreventive health care, screenings, and primary health care. So many \nwomen get their health care needs met through Planned Parenthood.\n  As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, as we \ncelebrate how we have been able to make progress in providing \naffordable, quality health care to all Americans--whether they are our \nseniors, our disabled population, our children, those of low income, \nthose groups who have been historically discriminated against--I urge \nthat we look to try to build upon those programs and make them even \nstronger and not weaken the programs that are available.\n  President Johnson's Vice President, Hubert H. Humphrey, famously said \nthat ``the moral test of government is how that government treats those \nwho are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the \ntwilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of \nlife, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.'' While we still have \nwork to do, we are closer to passing that moral test because of the \ncreation of Medicare and Medicaid 50 years ago and, more recently, the \nenactment of the Affordable Care Act. Let's continue to make progress \nso that all Americans have accesses to affordable, quality health care.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concerns \nwith the nuclear agreement negotiated between the United States and \nother world powers and Iran.\n  In May, Congress acted in a bipartisan way to enact the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act. The Senate passed the legislation 98 to 1, and \nthe House passed it 400 to 25. The bill was signed into law by \nPresident Obama.\n  This critically important legislation provides Congress, as the \nrepresentatives of the American people, the ability to examine and vote \non an agreement that will have tremendous impact on the future security \nof the Middle East and the world.\n  When the Senate passed the legislation in May, I said the bill would \nallow Congress to hold the administration accountable for negotiating \nan enforceable and verifiable agreement that would stop Iran's progress \ntoward a nuclear weapon.\n  Negotiators have completed their work. Review of the agreement is \nunderway. Committees are holding important hearings. We had one this \nmorning. After the August recess, Congress will have the opportunity to \nvote on a resolution that approves or disapproves of the deal reached \nwith Iran.\n  I believe the agreement is flawed in several ways. First, the \nagreement fails to provide for an inspections regime that is strong \nenough to prevent Iran from fulfilling its nuclear ambitions. Any \nagreement with Iran should include rigorous and immediate inspections \nof suspected nuclear sites. There has been much talk and hope of an \nanywhere, anytime inspection regime, but anywhere, anytime inspections \nare not what this agreement provides. Instead, under this agreement, it \ncould take 24 days, and potentially longer under the Joint Commission \nprocess, before inspectors have access to a suspected nuclear site. It \nis obvious Iran could hide elements of a nuclear program, such as the \nconstruction of centrifuges, before inspectors could ever gain access \nto a suspected nuclear site.\n  Iran has already failed to meet the transparency requirements of the \ninterim Joint Plan of Action. The International Atomic Energy Agency, \nor IAEA, consistently warned of Iran's failure to meet those standards \nof full transparency and in its June 2015 report stated that ``the \nAgency remains\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\nconcerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear-\nrelated activities involving military related organizations, including \nactivities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a \nmissile.''\n  Given Iran's lack of transparency, I believe the content of this \nagreement does not contain strong enough mechanisms to prevent Iran's \nclandestine development of a nuclear weapon.\n  Second, I find it more troubling that Congress--or even the \nadministration--has not been given access to the understanding between \nIran and the IAEA regarding how Iran's compliance with the agreement \nwill be implemented. This has been the subject of great discussion.\n  Third, I am concerned the agreement will provide Iran with financial \nresources that they could use to continue to fund terrorist groups that \nput Americans and our allies at risk. We know they were doing it in the \npast. We know of their desire to do it in the future. It is troubling \nthat when the sanctions against Iran are lifted, the nation will \nimmediately receive approximately $150 billion in assets. As a \ndesignated state sponsor of terrorism for over 30 years, Iran has \nfunded proxy wars across the region.\n  These wars range from Shia militias in Iraq to Houthis insurgents in \nYemen. Iran further threatens our allies through funding Hezbollah and \nHamas and propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad, who continues to \nslaughter his own people.\n  While no one knows for sure how Iran will spend the signing bonus it \nreceives from sanctions relief, the regime's prior behavior provides \nthe best evidence of how it will act in the future. I hear the argument \nthat the internal infrastructure of the country has fallen into \ndisrepair because of the sanctions and because of the lack of the \neconomic activities. Yet we have to look at Iran as still funding \nterrorist activity while allowing their own country's infrastructure to \nbecome failed and compromised.\n  What makes us think that with the new flush, $150 billion signing \nbonus, Iran is going to change their priorities all of a sudden? I \npersonally have trouble with that.\n  Finally, I am worried the decision to lift the embargo on \nconventional arms and ballistic missiles sold to Iran will allow Iran \nto present a greater threat to its neighbors. In addition, it could \nprecipitate a military buildup in the region, which will in turn \nincrease volatility in an already volatile region. Despite these \nquestions and concerns, the administration has argued that our only \noptions are to accept the deal or to go forward with Iran.\n  To accept this binary choice is to say the American people should \naccept this deal, regardless of how one-sided it may be, in order to \navoid a military conflict with Iran.\n  As a newspaper in my State, the Charleston Gazette-Mail, \neditorialized yesterday, this argument ``paint[s] a simplistic picture \nthat allows [its proponents] to gloss over the very real problems with \nthis deal.''\n  The Gazette-Mail continues:\n\n       The deal's many critics have consistently made the case \n     that there are other possible paths. The problem is that this \n     administration doesn't want to take them.\n\n  Even the President's top general agrees that this is a false \nproposition. Just this morning, when asked if the choice was binary--\naccept the Iran agreement or go to war--GEN Martin Dempsey, Chair of \nthe Joint Chiefs, said that ``we have a range of options and I always \npresent them.''\n  All of us would prefer a diplomatic solution in Iran, but a good \nagreement with Iran is one that will truly cut off Iran's path to a \nnuclear weapon and improve the security situation in the Middle East.\n  The sanctions passed by this Congress, together with the sanctions \nthat were built in concert with our foreign allies over the course of a \ndecade, were what brought Iran to the negotiating tables in the first \nplace. These sanctions should be kept in place and strengthened until \nIran is forced to accept a deal that actually makes the region safer. I \nbelieve a better deal is possible than the leverage provided by \nsanctions, and I am not alone. A CNN poll released yesterday found that \n52 percent of the American people want Congress to reject this deal, \nwhile only 44 percent believe the agreement should be approved.\n  A majority of Americans didn't say they oppose this agreement because \nthey want war with Iran. Absolutely not. Instead, the poll reveals that \na majority of Americans want a better deal, one that cuts off Iran's \npath to a nuclear weapon and makes the Middle East more secure.\n  There are legitimate arguments on both sides of the debate about the \nIran deal. I accept that the President and his administration truly \nbelieve the deal they have negotiated is in America's best interest, \nbut the claim that those who have a different view want war with Iran \nis an inappropriate attempt to short-circuit the legislative debate \nabout this agreement.\n  Congress must stand up against a threat to national security and \nensure that a monumental agreement contains the necessary verification \nand enforcement measures to protect future generations from a nuclear \nIran. I stand with all of our allies in the region that have put their \ntrust in America to negotiate a deal that will protect them \nindefinitely from the threat of Iranian nuclear weapons.\n  The posterity of our Nation and our allies depends on the critical \npolicy decisions made by this Congress and this administration. Now is \nthe time to carefully consider the nature of Iran's threat toward \nIsrael and America, the history of Iranian-funded terrorism, and the \nconsequences of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. America does \nnot have to accept a bad deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, once again, I am on the floor for the \n``Waste of the Week.'' Each week since February, I have come to the \nfloor to discuss an issue of waste, fraud, and abuse--misspent taxpayer \nmoney identified by neutral agencies of the Federal Government that \ndidn't have a partisan bone to pick in this or by inspectors general of \nvarious agencies or by the agencies themselves.\n  In February, I said I am going to come here every week throughout the \nduration of this session, and I am going to try to achieve a goal of \n$100 billion of waste. I wasn't sure we could reach that goal, but \ntoday is a very special day because we are going to highlight by the \nend of my speech over $100 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse that the \ntaxpayer is covering with hard-earned pay at home.\n  Over the past several months, I have highlighted a variety of \nexamples from the serious, such as the illegal procurement practices at \nthe Veterans' Administration, to the ridiculous: taxpayer funding, \nunder grants, for massages of rabbits to determine whether a massage \nafter strenuous exercise made them feel better. I don't think we needed \nto gather a bunch of rabbits and pay, with a $387,000 grant to an \norganization to mechanically massage the backs of rabbits.\n  I think if you stop anybody on the street and ask: Do you think a \ngood massage would make you feel a little bit better, especially after \na strenuous exercise--I think the answer would be yes. Actually, I \nthought I might want to sign up for this until I found out that when \nthe experiment was over, they killed the rabbits. So I didn't want to \nput myself in that position.\n  Then, from the young taxpayers who receive (improper and fraudulent \nchild tax credit refunds) to the old, the active Social Security \nnumbers that were assigned to individuals over the age of 112. \nObviously there aren't too many people in the country, if any, over \nthat age. These people had obviously died many years before--on and on \nit goes.\n  We are deluged with examples of waste, fraud, and abuse, which brings \nsome chuckles and brings some ``Can you believe we are actually doing \nthat?'' But the bottom line is that people are working hard every day \nto make ends meet to pay the mortgage, to buy the groceries, to save \nmoney to send the kids to school, and they are sending taxes to \nWashington and the bureaucracy is doing stuff like this.\n  It is a bad break for taxpayers, and it is shameful for government \nnot to take measures to stop this waste, fraud, and abuse from \nhappening. I am trying to disclose to the public this is how your \ntaxpayer money is being spent so they will put pressure on their \nMembers and say clean it up. Fortunately, we have been able to do some \nof that, but there is a long way to go.\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\n  Today I want to discuss errors with payments under the earned-income \ntax credit. Let me go back and explain this. The earned-income tax \ncredit is a refundable tax credit that offsets income tax owed by low-\nincome taxpayers. Congress originally approved the earned-income tax \ncredit in 1975 to offset the burden of Social Security taxes for low-\nincome workers and provide an incentive for them to work. It is a good \nmotive. To some extent, it has worked. The way it works is this: When \nthe credit exceeds the amount of taxes due, it provides a lump-sum \npayment, after you file your taxes, to those who qualify for the \nprogram.\n  People who work and earn less than a certain income level qualify for \nthis refund from the government. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, this tax credit is the largest need-tested, \nantipoverty cash assistance program the Federal Government runs. So \nwhether you think this is a right program or not, the questions are: \nHow is it being run? And is it efficient and effective or is it making \nmistakes?\n  We are talking about Big Government. Mistakes are usually big \nmistakes, if there are some. In 2011, the IRS identified more than 6.6 \nmillion potentially erroneous earned-income tax credit claims that went \nto households that didn't qualify. Individuals were telling the \ngovernment they are working and earning and therefore eligible for the \nearned-income tax credit bonus check, but at the same time they were \ntelling other agencies, such as the Supplemental Social Security \nProgram, that they are not earning that much or not working or don't \nhave income. Some are getting double checks--one for which they're \nqualified and one for which they're not.\n  When we add all of that--the latest year that has been identified is \n2013, and the tax credit costs to taxpayers during that year amounted \nto $60 billion. Of those, $14.5 billion were erroneously sent out \nchecks by the agency, the IRS. If we can put in place measures that can \nprovide accountability and verification to this program, we could save \nthe taxpayer up to $14.5 billion a year. So with that, we add to our \ngauge an additional $14.5 billion.\n\n  As everyone can see on this chart, this gauge is climbing up each \nweek. This chart shows the amount of money saved through the various \nprograms we have identified. We have now eclipsed the $100 billion \nlevel, and we are just a little ways past the middle of the year.\n  I could take the charts, stick them in the back closet, and say: \nThank you. I made it to my $100 billion mark, and I have made my point. \nBut I will keep on going. Every week the Senate is in session for the \nremainder of this year, I will be back down here for the latest ``Waste \nof the Week'' so we can embarrass, disclose, and let agencies know that \nthey are wasting taxpayers' dollars, and we, as a Congress, need to do \nsomething about that.\n  Some people may say that $100 billion in comparison with the total \nFederal budget is a drop in the bucket, but $100 billion is almost \nincomprehensible. Maybe Donald Trump understands what $100 billion is, \nbut I don't. In terms of that magnitude of money, it is a small portion \nof what we spend here.\n  We can do so much more in terms of identifying issues and programs \nthat will save the taxpayer money. Federal spending is out of control. \nWe know that, and this highlights some of that. The real issue is much \nworse. While States such as mine, the State of Indiana, have created \nbalanced budgets, eliminated debt, and provided surpluses, which they \ncan use to return to the taxpayers or save for a rainy day, the Federal \nGovernment has not done that. This is a huge challenge in front of us. \nThis is just a small piece of trying to identify some of the problems \nand challenges that we have, and by identifying them, we can save the \ntaxpayer money by making reforms to these various programs.\n  With that, I will yield back the floor, but you can count on me being \nhere every week for the rest of this session with the ``Waste of the \nWeek'' for as long as the Congress and Senate are in session.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tragedy on Crow Reservation\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to share some \nremarks on what is going on with Planned Parenthood. Prior to sharing \nthose remarks, I wish to inform my colleagues that we received some \ntragic news that has come out of Montana. I literally just got off the \nphone with Chairman Darrin Old Coyote with the Crow Tribe in Montana. I \nwish to take a moment to discuss the reports of a tragic shooting that \nhas occurred on the Crow Reservation in Montana.\n  This afternoon we received word of a shooting in the community of \nPryor, MT, on the Crow Reservation. I literally just got off the phone \nwith Chairman Darrin Old Coyote before I got to the floor just to see \nhow things were going and to be informed of the latest developments. \nThere are two confirmed fatalities and at least one other injured \nindividual who has been life-flighted to Billings.\n  My wife Cindy and I are deeply saddened by the news of today's tragic \nshootings in Pryor. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Pryor \ncommunity, and the families of all victims are in our prayers. I \nunderstand this was a couple who had children and grandchildren and are \nwell known in Pryor.\n  I am staying in close contact with Crow leaders, with local law \nenforcement, Federal officials, and community leaders during this time. \nIt is our understanding and it has been confirmed that the suspect has \nbeen apprehended and is in custody.\n  My staff and all of the staffs here in Washington stand ready to help \nthose affected by this tragedy. Our hearts break for the victims and \nfor their families.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join the Montana delegation and all \nMontanans in keeping the community, the victims, and their families in \ntheir thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. President, 655,306 kidneys is more than $49 million, which \nequates to 256 Lamborghinis; 327,653 hearts is more than $24.5 million, \nwhich equates to 128 Lamborghinis; 1,310,612 arms and legs is $98 \nmillion, which equates to 512 Lamborghinis--this is the envisioned \nprice tag were every one of Planned Parenthood's 327,653 abortions \nperformed last year to provide body parts and organs to harvest.\n  The utter callousness of Planned Parenthood in discussing the price \nof baby parts, as if handing over a menu, is clear evidence of the \nculture of an organization enriched through ghoulish and disturbing \npractices. This is a culture which protects tissue over life and lays \nout harvested organs as financial milestones toward a new car.\n  Planned Parenthood has worked its way into the American lexicon, \nbecoming synonymous with women's health but hiding its abortion \npractices.\n  Planned Parenthood received $528 million of Federal taxpayer money \nlast year alone. And when asked on the street, so few even know that \nPlanned Parenthood does abortions. But now the veil has been lifted, \nexposing inexcusable and unconscionable behavior.\n  This organization, Planned Parenthood, performs more abortions than \nany other organization in our country. But now our own calloused \nhearts--the heart of our Nation--are shocked out of apathy, and we have \na choice. We cannot accept the destruction and the selling of our \nchildren, to stare clearly into the face of the appalling and do \nnothing. We can allow our consciences to be moved and then remove the \npublic endorsement of these actions. We can remove Federal taxpayer \nfunding of the organization that has perpetuated such horrific actions.\n  I am proud to join Senator Joni Ernst and Leader McConnell, as well \nas 23 of my Senate colleagues, in the introduction of legislation to \nprotect women's access to health services and defund Planned \nParenthood. This bill ensures that funds allocated to Planned \nParenthood will be redirected to other eligible entities to provide \nwomen's health care services.\n  Let me be very clear, so the information is clear about what this \nbill does and what it doesn't do. This bill ensures there is no \nreduction--not $1 of reduction--in overall Federal funding available to \nsupport women's health. This bill ensures the preservation of Federal \nfunding for women's health\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\nservices which include important services of relevant diagnostic, \nlaboratory, and radiology services, for well-child care, for prenatal \nand post partum care, for immunization, for family planning services, \nincluding contraception, sexually transmitted disease testing, and \ncervical and breast cancer screenings. Let me say again, this bill \nensures the preservation of Federal funding for these very important \nservices for women. This bill does not reduce any funding for women's \nhealth services.\n  This bill does not allow any Federal funds to go toward Planned \nParenthood to continue its practice of trafficking baby parts. We \nbristled when we heard of an abortion doctor that left babies born \nalive to die, and we sensed justice when that same doctor was sentenced \nin a court of law for his crimes. Similarly, we shuddered as parents. \nCindy and I have been married for 29 years. We have four children, two \nboys and two girls. We shuddered as parents at the idea of baby parts \nbeing harvested and sold in the context of equating that value to \npurchasing a Lamborghini. Will we see this to the same end?\n  We are a society. We are a nation that values life so much that in \nour Declaration of Independence it is clearly articulated that all have \nthe right to life. We Democrats, Republicans, and all Americans must \nstand strong in the defense of those who are most vulnerable. We must \nadvocate and be a voice for those who do not have a voice, for the most \nvulnerable in our society, including the unborn.\n  Over the last year, we have cringed at terrible images coming out of \nthe Middle East. We have seen horrible images coming across social \nmedia, and we have called loudly for action. That was on soil thousands \nand thousands of miles away from America.\n  Today we cringe at terrible images that have occurred on our own \nsoil. Nothing, not even a Lamborghini, is worth the lives of our \nchildren. Planned Parenthood has clearly articulated the value they \nhave placed on babies' organs and limbs, but what they have failed to \nacknowledge is the value the American people know full well, and that \nis the value of our children, which is priceless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. It is so interesting, \ncoming away from the Transportation bill where we saw such cooperation \nbetween the two sides, and now we are headed back to our corners with \nthe vast majority of Republicans attacking an organization that helps \nmillions of Americans get fundamental health care. It is the same old \nsides again.\n  My friend from Montana may not like Planned Parenthood, and he can \ntell his family and his friends not to go there, but he doesn't speak \nfor the American people. They trust Planned Parenthood, an organization \nthat has been around since 1916. Its founder was thrown in jail because \nshe wanted to give birth control to people.\n  Let's be clear. My friend and those who are writing this legislation \nstate that they are not attacking health care. Yet they try to defund \nthe one organization in the country that people trust to deliver that \nhealth care. It is interesting because it is part of the attack on \nhealth care that we see from my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  We celebrate the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid which have \nprovided millions of Americans with accessible, affordable health care. \nThis week we heard one of the leading Republican Presidential \ncandidates talk about how it is time to end Medicare. This isn't a \nfringe candidate. I heard Newt Gingrich say years ago that Medicare \nwill wither on the vine. They have been after Medicare forever and ever \nand ever. They don't like Medicaid. Some Republican governors are not \nproviding their poor people with health care because they don't like \nMedicaid. These are lifelines that from their start have been attacked \nby Republicans. I have proof. I have spoken many times and quoted \nRepublicans from past years going after Medicare, going after Medicaid, \nand now again going after Planned Parenthood and women's health care. \nThis is an ideological attack, and it would put women's health and \nwomen's lives at risk. It is attacking women's reproductive health \ncare, an issue that was resolved in 1973.\n  I want to say to my friends on the other side--and they are my \nfriends--why don't you just keep moving us forward like you did on the \nTransportation bill. We set aside our differences and we are moving \nforward. Now you are reopening, again, the attacks on health care. You \ntried to repeal ObamaCare more than 55 times now in the House. It \ndidn't work. You tried it here the other day; it didn't work. You have \nattacked Medicare. You have attacked Medicaid, and now you want to take \naway women's health care provided by an organization that is chosen by \nmillions of women and men every single year for lifesaving and \npreventive services.\n  This legislation is being driven by an outrageous and potentially \nillegal act of an extremist group. It is just the latest chapter in the \nlong history of attacks on Planned Parenthood and their health care \nproviders who work there, and on the women and the men they serve.\n  Again, one can go back to the beginning of Planned Parenthood, when \nAmerica's first birth control clinic opened before women could vote. We \nforget that women got the vote in 1920. If we have a woman in the White \nHouse in 2020--something that I personally hope will happen--we will \ncelebrate the fact that 100 years after women got the right to vote \nthere is a woman in the White House. The point is that on the very day \nthe clinic opened 100 years ago, dozens of women waited in line. Do you \nknow what they wanted? Lifesaving birth control information. They \nwanted to plan their families. They wanted to avoid unplanned \npregnancies and the options that they would face if they had an \nunplanned pregnancy. What was the response? The clinic was raided, the \nclinic was shut down, and nine days later its founder was thrown in \njail. Planned Parenthood has been a target of attacks by extremists \nsince 1916, and that attack continues on the floor today.\n  Despite the effort of extremists, our country has come a long way \nsince the days when a woman could be jailed for advocating birth \ncontrol. We can't go back. We can't turn back the clock on women's \nhealth, and we still have people that are saying women shouldn't get \nfree birth control through ObamaCare. They want it to go over the \ncounter. We can't turn back the clock on women's health, but that is \nwhat is about to come.\n  With all the problems facing us--we still have work to do on \ntransportation, we still have work to do to avoid sequester and all the \ndeep cuts to our military and to our domestic programs such as the FBI, \nHomeland Security, food inspection, and border patrol. All of that is \ngoing to be cut, but, oh no, we don't turn to that to fix that. What do \nwe turn to? Another attack on Planned Parenthood, another attack on \nwomen's health.\n  We know this extremist group went undercover and secretly taped \npeople. That is what they did. If you approve of those tactics that is \nfine, but what I approve of is women getting health care. I think that \nwhen you scratch the surface, what you will find is that a lot of my \ncolleagues don't think women should be able to plan their families. We \nare still debating birth control. You have got to be kidding.\n  You have to look at the work Planned Parenthood does: cancer \nscreening, STD tests, and other lifesaving health care. They want to \ndeny women this health care.\n  Do you know what I really find extreme? So many of my Republican \nfriends tell me day after day, keep Uncle Sam out of our private lives. \nHow true. I agree. Some of them even call themselves Libertarians. When \nyou look up the meaning of Libertarian in Wikipedia, it is defined as \none who ``seeks to maximize the autonomy and freedom of choice, \nemphasizes political freedom, voluntary association, and the primacy of \nindividual judgment.'' The primacy of individual judgment--that is the \ndefinition of Libertarian. Yet my colleagues decided they don't like a \ncertain organization so they should say to everybody in the country \nfollow us. No. No. It is not right. Planned Parenthood is the safety \nnet for women's health care, and it has\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\nbeen so. This attack on women's health care is the opposite of liberty.\n  I hope if this bill does come forward, we will debate it and debate \nit and debate it, because I don't think the people in this country want \nwomen's lives used as a political football. Women's health is not a \ngame. It isn't something you should gain or lose votes on. Women's \nlives are not a game. We all have women in our lives, all of us, whom \nwe adore regardless of our political party--our moms, our wives, our \ndaughters, our sisters. Why would anyone in the Senate or anywhere else \nwant to take away the health care that has benefitted one in five women \nin America, and more than 800,000 patients in my State every year? Why \nwould anyone want to deny birth control to more than 600,000 \nCalifornians each year? Why would anyone want to deny women in my State \n100,000 breast exams?\n  Instead of listening to these extreme voices, Republicans should \nlisten to women in their States. I will tell you about a woman in my \nState, Nicole Sandoval of Pasadena, CA. Planned Parenthood was there \nfor Nicole when she needed it most. When she was 23 years of age, she \nhad no insurance before ObamaCare. Planned Parenthood caught her \ncervical cancer early enough to treat it and to save her life.\n  Instead of listening to these extreme voices, Republicans should \nlisten to women such as Heather Penman of Concord, CA. Planned \nParenthood was there for Heather when she needed it most, providing her \nwith a cancer screening. They found precancerous cells, and it helped \nher get the lifesaving surgery she needed. She didn't say what my \ncolleague said, standing up and attacking an organization that saved \nher life. She said, ``I might not be alive today'' without their help. \nShe told me that a few years ago. She said, ``Planned Parenthood is \nabout taking care of women's health and it shouldn't be reduced to some \npolitical argument.''\n  Imagine what would have happened if Planned Parenthood hadn't been \nthere for Nicole or Heather. That is what Planned Parenthood does. \nThere are millions of Nicoles and Heathers across America, each with \nher own story of how Planned Parenthood has been there for her. We are \nnot going to allow Republicans to take away their health care. No, we \nare not. We are not going to allow Republicans to undermine the vital \nresearch that is helping treatments for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, \nmultiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, HIV, and birth defects.\n  The research has led to public health breakthroughs, including \nvaccines for polio, chickenpox, rubella and shingles. Instead of \nattacking this research, we should be supporting it. That is something \nwe should all agree on. Republicans are pushing an extreme, dangerous \nagenda--an agenda that is out of touch with most Americans.\n  We had a breather from that agenda when we had that Transportation \nbill. How excited was I. Then we turn around, we do this bill, we work \ntogether, and we are back in our corners again, with Republicans \nattacking women's health and Democrats defending women's health. A new \npoll released this week shows that a strong majority of Americans \nopposes defunding Planned Parenthood, even after these videos--these \nedited videos--have been put out.\n  The American people are paying attention to this story. Women are \npaying attention to this story. We know this is a political attack on \nwomen's health. We know the group went in and secretly filmed people \nfor 3 years. We knew what their objective was--to hurt women's health, \nwomen's reproductive health. We know because that is where they stand.\n  They want Uncle Sam to tell a woman what her rights are. Well, I have \nto say that I am a Senator. I have strong views. I do not impose these \nviews on anyone. I want people to choose the way they feel and make \ndecisions between themselves, their family, their doctor, their God. \nThat is up to them. I do not want any Senator in this body telling my \nfamily what to do or your families what to do because it is up to them. \nI respect their families. They will discuss it with their families.\n  This is a political attack on women's health. We know it is an attack \non a group that saves lives every day. This is a fight they have picked \nbefore. They come out here with this, as if this were the first time \nthey have ever attacked Planned Parenthood. Well, we won it before, and \nwe will win it again. I heard my colleague, Senator Murray, recall that \nin 2011--she thought it was 2011--the Republicans threatened to shut \ndown the government because they wanted to defund Planned Parenthood. \nThey were going to shut down the government. She said: You know what; \nwe are not going do this to women's health. If that is what you want to \ndo, shut it down. We will take this case to the American people. They \nbacked off. We won that fight. We will win this fight as well.\n  We are going to fight. We are going to fight to make sure that Nicole \nand Heather and women across America can continue to get the services \nthey need: the birth control, the cancer screenings, STD screenings. \nThat is what we are fighting for. We are going to make sure that \nPlanned Parenthood is still there for the millions of women and \nfamilies who depend upon it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to speak to the highway bill today, \nlegislation before us that hopefully by tomorrow we will report out of \nthe Senate favorably and send it to the House of Representatives. My \nunderstanding is that the House will, sometime in September, report out \ntheir own version of the highway bill, hopefully a multiyear bill, in \nwhich case we would go to conference with them and hopefully get \nsomething we can get to the President on his desk that would be more \nthan a short-term extension, but instead be something that provides the \ncertainty that those who are involved in building roads and bridges and \nmaking sure that freight and people move across this country will have \nthe infrastructure in place to do that, and that we can get about the \nprocess of creating jobs and growing our economy, which is what \ninfrastructure is all about.\n  I want to speak specifically to some of the rail provisions in the \nlegislation. I want to say that thanks to the leadership of Senators \nWicker and Booker and the bipartisan contributions of the members of \nthe Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the legislation \nbefore the Senate today includes critically important provisions from \nthe bipartisan Rail Reform, Enhancement, and Efficiency Act that our \ncommittee passed by voice vote last month.\n  This bill reauthorizes Amtrak through fiscal year 2019, while \nincreasing rail safety, improving infrastructure, cutting redtape, and \nempowering local officials. Following the tragic May 12 derailment of \nAmtrak 188 in Philadelphia that resulted in eight fatalities, Senator \nWicker and Booker added additional rail safety provisions that were \napproved by the committee.\n  The bipartisan rail bill that passed in committee and is included in \nthe multiyear transportation bill before the Senate today would also \nadvance the deployment of positive train control technology for \naverting accidents. I am proud to note that we recently amended the \nmultiyear transportation legislation to expand this authorization. \nNever before has the Senate authorized robust, dedicated, and mandatory \nfunding for positive train control implementation.\n  The amendment accepted by the Senate earlier today would authorize \n$199 million in PTC grants and loan financing for commuter railroads in \nfiscal year 2016. This is the highest single-year authorization for PTC \never. Using the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing \nProgram, commuter railroads will be able to leverage this funding for \n$2 billion in loans, necessary to cover the PTC capital needs.\n  In addition to advancing the deployment of PTC, the Wicker-Booker \nbill would require speed limit action plans for all passenger railroads \nto address automatic train control modifications, crew communication \npractices, and other measures to prevent overspeed derailments while \npositive train control is being implemented. It would\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\nalso require grade crossing action plans to improve State grade \ncrossing safety efforts, and it would consolidate grant programs to \nfocus resources on critical safety and infrastructure needs.\n  Building on the work of the commerce committee's ranking member, \nSenator Nelson, the bill would increase the rail passenger liability \ncap for inflation from the $200 million level set in 1997 to $295 \nmillion, with inflation adjustments every 5 years. The bill applies a \nnew higher cap retroactively to the date of the Amtrak accident in \nPhiladelphia, thereby raising the potential compensation available to \nvictims and their families.\n  This legislation also includes a measure from Senator Peters to \nrequire a thorough examination of Amtrak's postaccident response \nfollowing the Philadelphia derailment, ensuring a close look at whether \nAmtrak addressed the needs of families and passengers involved in \ntragedy.\n  Senator Peters' work will make meaningful improvements to Amtrak's \nemergency preparedness going forward. As we worked on the legislation \nbefore our committee's adoption, I included a requirement for all \npassenger railroads in the Nation to install inward- and outward-facing \ncameras on their locomotives.\n  This fulfills an outstanding recommendation of the National \nTransportation Safety Board. These cameras will not only help with \naccident investigations, a need that we saw following the Philadelphia \nderailment, but they will help monitor each passenger railroad's \ncompliance with critical safety requirements. Last week I received a \nletter from NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart stating:\n\n       I applaud the recent passage of the passenger rail safety \n     bill. I was pleased to see the inclusion of recommendations \n     regarding inward and outward facing audio and image \n     recorders. Thank you for your support of the NTSB.\n\n  The bill also includes extensive contributions from Senator \nBlumenthal to improve passenger rail safety, including redundant signal \nprotection to increase roadway worker safety, potentially preventing \ntragedies such as the one in West Haven, CT, in 2013.\n  Senator Blumenthal also made important contributions on provisions \ncovering alerters, signage, and track inspections. The bill includes \nhis proposal for the Federal Railroad Administration to increase \noversight of needed safety improvements at Metro-North.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to the following document: the \nFederal Railroad Administration's ``Operation Deep Dive Report'' \noutlining the safety concerns at Metro-North and setting forth specific \ndirected actions. The bill before the Senate would require the FRA to \nfollow up on that report and its recommendations.\n  I also call my colleagues' attention to Emergency Order No. 29, which \nwas issued after terrible derailments in the Bronx, Bridgeport, CT, and \nWest Haven, CT. This bill would apply the emergency order's speed limit \naction plan framework to the entire passenger rail network, reducing \nthe risk of future overspeed derailments.\n  I would also like to include a statement from Senator Blumenthal \nfollowing the news that 13 current and former Metro-North employees had \nbeen accused of cheating on licensing exams. The statement reads: ``My \namendment was accepted into the bill, which was voted out of the \ncommittee favorably, and I urge the Senate to take up the measure \nswiftly so we can ensure Metro-North is implementing true safety \nreforms.''\n  I echo Senator Blumenthal's statement on Metro-North, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    June 30, 2015.\n\n          Blumenthal Statement on Metro-North Cheating Scandal\n\n       Hartford, CT.--U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) \n     issued the following statement today regarding news that 13 \n     current and former Metro-North employees have been accused of \n     cheating on exams to become licensed conductors and \n     engineers:\n       ``The scale and scope of these revelations are sweeping and \n     shocking--yet another searing indictment of Metro-North's \n     safety training programs and procedures. Metro-North owes the \n     public a better explanation to this apparent serious criminal \n     conduct, and I will call for congressional hearings to compel \n     them to do so.\n       Over a year ago, the Federal Railroad Administration \n     conducted a Deep Dive investigation of Metro-North and found \n     deeply disturbing flaws in Metro-North's training program. \n     The news today that 13 employees have been indicted for \n     cheating on a training exam raises more troubling questions \n     about whether the training program at Metro-North remains \n     weak, ineffective--or worse, susceptible to criminal conduct. \n     These procedures must be improved and the flaws discovered by \n     the FRA must be addressed. That is why I pushed last week for \n     an amendment to a rail bill in the Commerce Committee that \n     will require FRA to provide Congress with quarterly reports \n     on the nearly 30 recommendations outlined in the Deep Dive \n     report. My amendment was accepted into the bill, which was \n     voted out of the committee favorably, and I urge the Senate \n     to take up the measure swiftly so we can ensure Metro-North \n     is implementing true safety reforms,'' Blumenthal said.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I urge the Senate to ensure Metro-North and other \nrailroads improve safety by voting in support of the bill before the \nSenate.\n  Working with Senator Cantwell, who has been a strong advocate for \ncrude-by-rail safety, we have also included in the bill new \nrequirements for real-time train information to aid emergency response \nofficials in the event of an accident. Senator Baldwin worked last week \nto ensure emergency officials have advance notice of crude oil and \nethanol unit trains traveling through their jurisdictions.\n  This bill also includes a provision for comprehensive oilspill \nresponse plans to ensure railroads are prepared and have resources \npositioned to respond to worst case scenarios, another priority from \nour colleague from Washington State, Senator Cantwell.\n  Further, aiding emergency response efforts, Senators Booker and \nMenendez included provisions that prohibit the withholding of train \ninformation from first responders. Their work will also examine the \nsufficiency of response information carried by train crews addressing \nissues raised in relation to the 2012 derailment in Paulsburo, NJ.\n  Senator Manchin worked to ensure tank car owners and shippers \nannually report on their compliance with the new tank requirements \nrequiring stronger oversight for those important safety upgrades. In \naddition, Senator Manchin and I have agreed on the need for a real-\nworld derailment test of electronically controlled pneumatic, or ECP, \nbrakes. As this testing moves forward, the existing Department of \nTransportation requirements will be kept in place unless the real-world \ntesting and evaluation show the requirement is not justified.\n  Enhancing the bill's grade crossing safety provisions, Senator \nGardner added stronger oversight of the Federal Railroad \nAdministration's actions pertaining to the use of locomotive horns at \nhighway-rail grade crossings.\n  Senator Klobuchar included timely provisions to help address issues \nwith the blocking of crossings as a result of idling trains. The bill \nalso incorporates the work of Senator Roy Blunt, whose TRAIN Act, \ncosponsored by Senators Manchin, Heller, and myself, will streamline \nthe permitting process for rail improvements, making our critical \ninfrastructure dollars go even further.\n  Senator Daines included provisions to improve Amtrak's operations \nthrough the study of new station development options where Amtrak would \nturn a profit, potentially increasing private sector investment in our \nNation's passenger rail system. The reforms extend to project \nfinancing, and Senator Booker's embedded RRIF bill, cosponsored by \nSenators Heller, Carper, and Kirk, will create a faster and more \nflexible RRIF Program.\n  I also applaud Senator Kirk for his contributions to the RRIF reform \nbill, improving the loan process and facilitating more timely and \ntransparent decisions. These RRIF loans can be used for safety \nimprovements, including positive train control. It also explains why \nits inclusion in the broader surface transportation bill is strongly \nsupported by Transportation for America, the States for Passenger Rail \nCoalition, the National Association of Railroad Passengers, the \nAmerican Public Transportation Association, and the Southern Rail \nCommission.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the statement \nfrom Transportation for America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\n\n\n\n                                   Transportation for America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2015.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune: We write to thank you for your \n     leadership on the Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer \n     Protection Act of 2015, which authorizes the federal \n     passenger rail program with the transportation safety and \n     freight provisions under the jurisdiction of the Commerce \n     Committee through 2021.\n       The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection \n     Act of 2015 authorizes the passenger rail program as part of \n     the broader surface transportation program for the first \n     time. The bill incorporates the Railroad Reform, Enhancement, \n     and Efficiency Act (S. 1626) that already received unanimous \n     approval from the Commerce Committee on June 25, 2015. The \n     passenger rail bill would provide sustainable funding and \n     enhancement opportunities for a unified national passenger \n     rail program, while also improving the safety of the rail \n     system. This is an important step in supporting a truly \n     multimodal approach to providing people improved mobility and \n     access to destinations.\n       The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection \n     Act of 2015 also makes progress to improve the movement of \n     freight and enhance U.S. economic competitiveness by \n     improving freight transportation serving agriculture, \n     manufacturing, energy, retail and other sectors. Freight \n     movement is inherently multimodal and multi-jurisdictional. \n     It requires a program with broad eligibilities and a \n     competitive approach to guarantee that limited funding is \n     targeted to the projects with the greatest impact. This \n     proposal moves the federal transportation program in the \n     right direction in addressing the nation's freight needs.\n       We look forward to working with you and your committee to \n     address remaining concerns with the bill, such as the future \n     of the TIGER program; however it is clear that passage of the \n     Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of \n     2015 would be an important step forward in creating a \n     transportation program that will boost the nation's economy \n     and ensure future prosperity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James Corless,\n                                                         Director.\n  Mr. THUNE. Transportation for America wrote that the committee-\nreported legislation would be an important step forward in creating a \ntransportation program that will boost the Nation's economy and ensure \nfuture prosperity. It also stated that the bill would improve the \nsafety of our Nation's rail system.\n  Building on the work of the commerce committee, the multiyear \nTransportation bill also includes a bipartisan extension to the PTC \ndeadline. The bipartisan extension is a rigorous case-by-case approach, \nwith enforceable milestones and metrics.\n  The Secretary of Transportation approves or disapproves of the dates \nin a railroad's updated implementation schedule, including the hard end \ndate for implementation. Under no circumstances can the Secretary \napprove a date for full installation and activation that is later than \n2018. The Secretary also has the authority to identify and require \nchanges to deficient schedules that do not show safe and successful \nimplementation as soon as practicable.\n  Multiple government reports, including from the Government \nAccountability Office, the DOT, and the FRA, have concluded that the \nvast majority of railroads will not meet the December 31, 2015, \ndeadline for PTC implementation. This extension will not delay safe and \nsuccessful implementation of positive train control technology. Rather, \nit offers a realistic approach to ensure this important technology is \nimplemented as quickly as possible without risking shutdowns of rail \nservice that will not meet the current deadline no matter what the law \nsays. This proposal is not novel. Senate bill S. 1006, with original \ncosponsors Blumenthal, Schumer, and Gillibrand, would extend the \ndeadline to 2018 on a case-by-case basis in 1-year increments. Despite \ngood-faith efforts from railroads, the Blumenthal extension recognizes \nthe deadline in current law simply is not attainable.\n  Similarly, in its GROW AMERICA proposal, the administration requested \ngiving the Secretary of Transportation discretion to extend the \ndeadline on a case-by-case basis without any constraints on the dates \nthe Secretary may approve.\n  We follow this model but add explicit constraints on installation and \nactivation by 2018, while allowing the Secretary discretion in \noverseeing testing to ensure that PTC works as intended.\n  Recently, railroads from across the country explained the potential \ndisruption caused by the current unattainable deadline. Virginia \nRailway Express, or VRE, wrote to me stating that ``VRE commuter rail \noperations could be suspended after December 31, 2015'' and has \nrequested more time to ensure that PTC works as intended.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the July 28, \n2015, letter from Virginia Railway Express.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                     Virginia Railway Express,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 28, 2015.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chair,\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson:  This letter \n     supports the deadline extension for certification and \n     interoperability of Positive Train Control (PTC) to December \n     31, 2018 being incorporated into the Surface Transportation \n     Authorization bill (DRIVE Act) now being considered in the \n     U.S. Senate. The Virginia Railway Express is concerned that \n     without an extension to the PTC deadline, VRE commuter rail \n     operations could be suspended after December 31, 2015 even \n     though VRE has done everything in its control to comply with \n     the requirements for PTC established in the Rail Safety \n     Improvement Act of 2008.\n       The extension for PTC represents a common sense, bi-\n     partisan approach and it allows sufficient time for VRE and \n     it host railroads to test, commission and certify PTC for \n     compliance. VRE is also supportive of the Rail Technical \n     Grant program that provides $199 million to leverage \n     financing and provide direct grants to install PTC or for \n     interoperability between rail operators.\n       Approval of the PTC deadline extension to December 31, 2018 \n     gives VRE assurance that commuter rail operations will not be \n     disrupted. I ask that you please support its passage.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                       Doug Allen,\n                                                              CEO.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, one of the freight \nrailroads that collectively have spent over $5 billion in private funds \non implementation, recently sent a letter to the Surface Transportation \nBoard that stated the possibility that ``if Congress has not extended \nthe deadline for PTC operations, as of January 1, 2016, neither \npassenger nor freight traffic would operate on BNSF lines that are \nrequired by Federal law and regulation to have an interoperable PTC \nsystem as of that date.''\n  Critically, as I have noted, this extension is now paired with \nrobust, dedicated, and mandatory funding for PTC implementation among \ncommuter railroads. Recently, the American Public Transportation \nAssociation, or APTA, surveyed its commuter railroad members and found \nthat over 50 percent were deferring maintenance to install PTC and only \n29 percent had a shot at installation by the end of the year. That is \nwhy APTA, the National Association of Railroad Passengers, and rail \nlabor support the inclusion of this critical funding in this underlying \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the American Public Transportation Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                   Transportation Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, July 28, 2015. \n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune: We understand that the manager's \n     amendment on the Commerce Committee title of the bill \n     authorizes $199 million in funding that can be used by public \n     commuter railroads for grants, or to leverage financing, for \n     the implementation of positive train control (PTC) systems. \n     These funds are of critical importance as commuter railroads \n     address the $3.5 billion in costs associated with installing \n     PTC systems under the new deadline and process also included \n     in the bill. APTA appreciates the committee's effort to \n     support implementation.\n       APTA's commuter railroads support the implementation of PTC \n     on all commuter and intercity passenger rail lines, but we do \n     not believe that PTC can be implemented on the entire system \n     by the current statutory deadline, despite good faith \n     efforts. The funds provided in the bill, in conjunction with \n     the authority for the Secretary to oversee implementation of \n     PTC systems by the end of 2018, will help ensure that PTC is \n     safely installed as quickly as possible. We do not think it \n     makes sense for commuter railroads to cease operations on \n     January 1, 2016 because they\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n     were unable to install PTC by the current deadline, despite \n     their best efforts to implement this new technology.\n       Thank you for consideration of our views. We remain \n     committed to PTC implementation and we look forward to \n     working with Congress as it advances this important \n     transportation bill. If you have questions, please contact \n     Brian Tynan of APTA's Government Affairs staff at \n     btynan@apta.com or at (202) 496-4897.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Michael P. Melaniphy,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. APTA wrote: ``These funds are of critical importance as \ncommuter railroads address the $3.5 billion in costs associated with \ninstalling PTC systems.''\n  The National Association of Railroad Passengers wrote: ``Just as \nimportant as the level of the authorization is the structure of the \neligibility . . . RRIF could potentially be used to leverage the amount \nprovided by the DRIVE Act by a factor of ten.''\n  The Senate has an important opportunity to advance deployment of \npositive train control and help commuter railroads get over the finish \nline.\n  In sum, this is a national rail safety and infrastructure improvement \nbill.\n  Amtrak provides service to over 30 million per year, with stops in \nover 500 communities and in 46 States. New York has about 6 million \nriders, Pennsylvania about 3 million, and States such as Florida, \nVirginia, and Washington all have over 1 million riders.\n  This bill also improves the safety of commuter railroads, which \ncollectively have nearly 500 million boardings per year. Metro-North, \nserving New York, Connecticut, Long Island Railroad, and New Jersey \nTransit each have 80 million boardings per year. These passengers \ndeserve the critical safety and infrastructure improvements put forward \nin this bipartisan legislation.\n  The failure to pass this bipartisan DRIVE Act, which includes these \npassenger rail investments and safety improvements, would be a \nsignificant loss to the traveling public who utilize passenger rail \nsystems across the country.\n  I would simply conclude by adding that this is a copy of all the \nletters of support we have received regarding provisions in this \nlegislation, regarding the legislation in its entirety, and I encourage \nMembers of the Senate to support it.\n  In addition to the letters I have already included, there are \nliterally probably hundreds of letters in here from organizations that \nare impacted, affected by, and benefit from provisions in the DRIVE \nAct.\n  So I hope when this comes to a final vote, which I believe it will \nsometime tomorrow, that we will demonstrate in a big bipartisan fashion \nour support for this legislation, not only for what it does for roads \nand bridges but what it does for freight transportation in this country \nand specifically many of the things I have just mentioned that we have \nincluded as part of the rail provisions in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon to talk \nabout something I have had to talk about far too many times--extreme \nRepublicans pandering to their extreme base by attacking women's \nhealth.\n  My Republican colleagues have picked this fight over spending bills, \nover the debt ceiling, and the list goes on. In fact, they even tried \nlast week to attach political riders attacking Planned Parenthood to a \nbill that was supposed to help seriously wounded veterans start \nfamilies. So we know how far they are willing to go to appeal to the \ntea party, and what we are discussing today is more of the same.\n  Republicans are using undercover attack videos, produced by a \nradical, rightwing organization dedicated to taking away a woman's \nright to choose, to once again on the floor try to defund Planned \nParenthood and take away critical health services from women.\n  As Republicans try once again to get in between a woman and her \nhealth care, my colleagues are on the floor today to make one thing \nvery clear: This bill is a nonstarter. We are standing up to be the \nvoices for millions of men and women across the country and to say we \nare not going to let Republicans hurt women and take away their health \ncare--not on our watch.\n  Mr. President, 2.7 women and men visit Planned Parenthood each year \nfor health care. One in five women will visit Planned Parenthood at \nsome point in her life. These women and their families are looking for \neverything from cancer screenings to birth control, to basic primary \ncare, and the bill some of my Republican colleagues have introduced \nwould take all of that away. It would leave women without the providers \nthey know and the providers they trust.\n  I don't think women want the tea party making their health care \ndecisions for them, but under this bill that is exactly what would \nhappen and that is why it is not going anywhere. Republicans can go \nahead and try for the umpteenth time to turn back the clock on women's \nhealth and score political points with their extreme base. They can \npander to the tea party instead of working with us on the real \nchallenges this country faces. We need to be creating jobs, growing our \neconomy, and actually expanding access to health care.\n  We want them to know we are going to be right there as this comes to \nthe floor, fighting back to make sure women come before politics and \nnot the other way around. We have fought this battle before and again \nand again and again. Battles we all thought were settled, that women \nacross the country thought they had won decades ago keep coming back. \nAnd each time we have made it clear: We are not going away.\n  Republicans can keep trying to attack women's health care, they can \nput new spins on old ideas, they can try talking about it in a \ndifferent way, and they can look for any opportunity they want to bring \nthis back up, but they should know we are not going to be fooled and \nthey will not fool women across the country. Women in this country \nshould be able to make their own decision about their own health care. \nOur government should be investing in women's health, helping more \nwomen get access to care, not moving in the opposite direction.\n  I very much hope Republicans finally learn their lesson and move on \nto the other things, but, if not, we need them to know we are going to \nbe here ready to stand and fight for women in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from \nWashington State, a very distinguished and dedicated colleague, and \nothers such as she who are championing this cause of defending Planned \nParenthood. I am proud to stand with Planned Parenthood in advocating \nand championing the cause of women's health care in this country.\n  Planned Parenthood needs no defense and, indeed, this body should not \nbe spending valuable time and energy in this attack on women's health \ncare that is epitomized by an effort to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  Let's be very clear. Planned Parenthood provides countless women \nacross this country with STD testing, breast cancer screening, funding \nresearch in strengthening women's health care, and contraception. None \nof these activities is involved in abortion. They are entirely \nunrelated to abortion. They are about women's health care. The effort \nto defund Planned Parenthood is, in fact, an attack on women's health \ncare.\n  Planned Parenthood should need no defense from any of us because its \nactivities immensely benefit women who depend on it and rely on its \nprofessionals for basic screening, testing, and other activities that \nprotect them from the ravages of cancer and other kinds of diseases \nthat will cost more to this Nation if we deny Planned Parenthood that \nfunding.\n  Planned Parenthood is under attack. It is under siege from a \nsensationalistic and disingenuous kind of publicity that is based on \nundercover videos. People are offended by them, and Planned Parenthood \nhas in fact spoken to the merits of them. I encourage Planned \nParenthood to continue speaking to those videos. Another was released \njust yesterday.\n  Planned Parenthood needs no defense from us because the American \npeople\n\n[[Page S6117]]\n\nsupport it. American women do because they know the reality, which is \ndifferent from what is depicted in those videos. The reality is that \nPlanned Parenthood provides funding for women's health care. So the \nfunding of women's health care by defunding Planned Parenthood should \nnot be the goal or the effect of anything we do in this body.\n  I am proud to stand and urge my colleagues to reject this attack from \nthe most extreme members of the anti-choice movement, which seeks to \nundermine critical access to health care through Planned Parenthood. My \nhope is that congressional opinion, like American public opinion, will \ncontinue to be, as we are, on the side of Planned Parenthood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I will be joined on the floor by the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, who is the \nranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee; Senator McCain of \nArizona, who is the leader behind the Choice movement that took place \nlast year in August; and Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri.\n  As we speak, at this very moment the House is voting. They are voting \non a 3-month extension of the highway bill. But more importantly to us \non the Veterans' Affairs Committee and to our veterans, they are voting \non a bill we have agreed to, to fix the problem at the VA with regard \nto the funding of our hospitals and health care, and to open up a new \nday in terms of Veterans Administration services to the veterans of our \ncountry.\n  I was pleased to be joined by Senator Blumenthal at the VA a couple \nof weeks ago where we had a heart-to-heart, 4-hour meeting with \nSecretary McDonald, Sloan Gibson, and others about the false-intended \npress release that was sent out of the VA saying they were about to run \nout of money, health care was going to be stopped in certain places, \nand some hospitals might be closed. That was a misleading press \nrelease. It was meant to create a crisis that didn't really exist. The \ncrisis was not in not having the money. The crisis was in addressing \nthe money and having to organize it in such a way it could meet VA's \nneeds. What is attached to the highway bill and coming over here is the \nfollowing: redirection of $3.348 billion in the Choice money which was \nappropriated last year into a central fund for health care, just as the \nfunds for non-VA health care and regular health care are. Now all of \nthe money for veterans' benefits is in the same pie. And the \nlimitations on the paying for benefits that were in the Choice bill are \nnot going to be there any longer, so all the money can be used for what \nit was intended, and that is to pay for the benefits for our veterans \nwho have earned them.\n\n  In addition, there will be an addition to the 40-mile rule to say \nthat any veteran who lives further than 40 miles away, or inside of 40 \nmiles but can't get the services they need for their health care, can \nuse Choice to get to a health care provider of their choosing.\n  Choice was passed to react to the terrible crisis in the VA in \nArizona when the Phoenix, AZ, hospital had veterans die because \nappointments weren't kept, veterans couldn't get services, and mental \nhealth issues couldn't be handled. The Choice Act was engineered by \nSenators Burr and McCain, who did a good job.\n  We are proud to be modifying it in this highway extension to be sure \nwe do not run out of funding and not appropriate an additional dime \nother than what we already have. For Members who are listening to these \nremarks and will vote tomorrow, I want them to understand quite clearly \nthat when they read the bill it will show money as emergency funding. \nThat doesn't mean it is new or additional money. It just means the \nmoney that was appropriated last year as emergency funding for VA \nChoice will be able to be used only for benefits for veterans in terms \nof health care no matter what program they are in--non-VA, regular VA \nor VA Choice.\n  We want to see to it that Choice is a force multiplier, Choice is the \nway we get our veterans' timely appointments, Choice is the way we \nutilize and maximize the ability of our country to meet the needs of \nour veterans and bring private sector participation into service for \nour veterans without diminishing or taking away the services our \nveterans get from the VA.\n  I appreciate Senator Blumenthal and the contributions he made in the \nmeeting 2 weeks ago. I want to commend Chairman Miller and Ranking \nMember Brown in the House for all the work they did, and Speaker \nBoehner, who was instrumental in making this come about.\n  I now yield to Senator Blumenthal, then Senator McCain, and then \nSenator Blunt.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, who has correctly and appropriately stated what \nour goal is in seeking the transfer of funding--a goal that will be \nfulfilled by the bill coming to us from the House. It is, in fact, \ncoming to us from the House, but as Chairman Isakson has very correctly \nstated, it is the result of an initiative that he--and I have been very \nproud to join him in this effort--initiated with the VA Secretary at \nour meeting last week. And the leadership of the House has joined in \nthat effort.\n  I am proud and honored to be his partner in this effort, which is \nabsolutely necessary to continue the VA's health care programs. This \ntransfer of $3.4 billion is required by the fact that the community and \ncare programs of the VA will in effect exhaust their revenue streams \nunless we enable the VA to use some of this Choice funding in this \neffort. It is necessary to permit VA programs and veterans to have \naccess to money that is there. It is for the same purpose as the \ncommunity and care programs. They are, in fact, identical programs in \nterms of their basic efforts and goals.\n  The meeting we had--that Chairman Isakson had last week--was very \nproductive and important in reaching a consensus, a bipartisan \nconsensus, and I urge my Democratic colleagues on this side of the \naisle to join this effort to enable VA programs to go forward and to \nmake sure we continue to keep faith with our veterans. We should leave \nno veteran behind when it comes to health care. We must make sure that \nwe fulfill our obligation to all of our veterans in mental health care, \nin physical health care, in primary health care, and all the \nspecialties that are served by this program.\n  I thank my very good friend from Georgia for his leadership in this \neffort. I am proud to be his partner in serving this goal.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Blumenthal and \nalso my friend from Georgia, the distinguished chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, who is ensuring we continue strong \noversight and accountability at the VA. It is much needed.\n  There are a lot of problems, but what the Senator from Georgia has \ndone on a bipartisan basis is to continue the funding to add billions \nof dollars on top of the VA's request. We have approved of every single \nincrease for funding that has been requested, and yet I am disappointed \nthe administration is seeking to use funds originally allocated for the \nVA Choice card to pay for hospital and medical treatment needs.\n  Thanks to the work, though, of the Senator from Georgia and our other \ncolleagues, including Chairman Miller in the House of Representatives, \nwe will ensure the VA health care will continue without any funding \ninterruptions through the summer and into the new fiscal year. We will \ndo this to ensure that our disabled veterans do not suffer from the VA \nbureaucracies' mistakes and mismanagement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator from Georgia if he would agree \nthe Choice card was really a major breakthrough in concept, in that at \nleast a certain portion of our veteran population, rather than having \nto go a long distance in order to get VA care, would be able to go to a \nlocal provider?\n  I wonder if the Senator from Georgia would discuss for a moment, or \ncomment on, whether that program has been viable, whether it is \naccepted or not accepted by our veterans population, and whether we \nneed to make it permanent or not.\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nquestion. It was the Senator from Arizona who initiated the Choice Act \nmovement in August of last year when we had the terrible crisis in \nPhoenix where appointments weren't made for veterans in trouble and, in \nsome cases, some of them died.\n  We created Choice to be sure if a veteran needed an appointment \nwithin 30 days, or immediately, if it was mental health or other \nthings, and the VA medical facility couldn't provide it, they could use \nChoice to go to a local provider, either because of distance or service \noffered. That was initiated in November of last year, and it has grown \nalmost every single month in utility and use because it gives the VA a \nway, when they are backed up, to meet the needs of a veteran without \njust saying we cannot help. It is becoming more and more popular.\n  Not only is it helping veterans to get services on a timely basis, it \nis a force multiplier for the VA. Every time we can use a local \nMedicare-approved physician, which is what Choice does, we are saving \nthe VA having to hire another physician, having to build another \nhospital room, and having to provide another service. Yet the VA has \ncontrol of the services going to the veteran.\n  We have 6.5 million American veterans who have received Choice cards \nsince November of last year. The numbers started out slow, but they are \npicking up every single month because veterans like the fact that they \ncan go closer to home for what the VA can't offer, they can get the \nservice they need if the VA can't offer it, and they can be served in a \ntimely fashion.\n  I thank the Senator for his initiation of this whole movement last \nAugust and for being a part of getting this addition passed today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, and I \nwould ask two more questions.\n  One is, how important is it that we make it permanent, and maybe even \nlook towards expansion of eligibility for the card; and second of all, \nI know the Senator from Georgia has already discussed it, but when we \nhave a $1.7 billion cost overrun on the construction of one VA \nhospital--and we see cost overruns literally everywhere throughout the \nVA on their construction projects--how do we fix that?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, we are fixing it, and I appreciate both \nquestions.\n  On question No. 1, we need to repeal the sunset of Choice, which is \nin 2 years, and make it permanent. Choice is a force multiplier for the \nVA, which is good, and it is an added service for our veterans, which \nis also good. I commit to you as chairman that I am going to work \ntowards eliminating the sunset so Choice is permanent in VA health \nservices from now on.\n  As far as hospital cost overruns, the Senator is right. Denver was \n$1.732 billion--a 428-percent overrun--but look at Orlando, FL, and \nlook at three other hospitals we have built, all of them being two or \nthree times the original estimate. The VA needs to be taken out of the \nbusiness of building hospitals, and we are doing that and transferring \nit to the Corps of Engineers, who are the people who know how to build \nsomething.\n  The VA needs to manage the health delivery system for our veterans. \nThat is what they need to be providing. They do not need to be building \nbuildings. They don't need to be keeping us out of their business. They \nneed, instead, to find private sector solutions wherever they can and \ndo what they were chartered to do, which is to provide services for \nveterans who fought and sacrificed for our country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In other words, from now on, if there is a new VA \nfacility to be built, that will be supervised and constructed by the \nCorps of Engineers?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Exactly. With one exception. If it is a modification to \na CBOC or a clinic or something like that, that is a smaller allocation \nor a smaller appropriation. Maybe anything under $25 million, they \nmight do, but anything over $25 million, such as a hospital, they won't \ndo it. The Corps of Engineers will do it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I am sure it is probably a dumb question, but has \nanybody been held accountable? I am sure that is a stupid question.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. It is the most intelligent question anybody can ask. The \npress questioned me in Denver, when I went there, along with Ranking \nMember Blumenthal, and we looked at the situation firsthand. After \nlooking at it and interviewing the VA people, we were asked by the \nDenver Post how we could explain this mess, and I asked them very \nsimply if they knew what a camel was. They said no. I said that is a \nhorse built by a committee. Well, the Denver hospital is a camel--a \nhorse being built by a committee, most of whom have left and are not \nthere to be held accountable anymore.\n  It is unconscionable and irresponsible for that hospital to be \ncosting what it has cost. We have finally put our arms around it. We \nhave finally put people in place with accountability, and the Corps of \nEngineers is now overseeing the completion of that hospital so we don't \nhave more overruns like we had. It was a matter of nobody being in \ncharge and everybody being in charge--too many chiefs and not enough \nIndians. We had people in charge of health care building buildings, and \nthat wasn't what we needed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think they must have gotten some of those bureaucrats \nfrom the Pentagon.\n  I want to thank both Senator Blumenthal and you, Mr. Chairman, for \nthe great work you are doing. As you know, this whole scandal began in \nArizona at the Phoenix VA, where allegations remain that over 50 \nveterans died while awaiting care. Obviously all of us have an \nobligation to all of our veterans, but I know my colleagues can \nunderstand the special aspects of where this whole thing began.\n  I am very grateful, and on behalf of the veterans of my State, I \nthank both of you for your leadership and your commitment. I will be \ngoing back to my veterans community, and I will be having townhall \nmeetings and meetings with them and ensuring them that at least we \nthink we are taking measures that put us on the right track.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for his patience while we engaged \nin this colloquy.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I want to acknowledge the fact that Choice would have \nnever happened, and this would have never happened, had the Senator \nfrom Arizona not immediately responded when the crisis first started \nand fixed this. We appreciate his leadership, and we are glad to follow \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank our friend from Arizona, the \ndistinguished cosponsor with me of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for \nAmerican Veterans Act, for his great work in this area as well as on \nhealth care generally for our veterans. He has raised one of the most \nprofoundly important as well as intelligent questions about \naccountability--accountability for the debacle and delays in health \ncare and cooking the books that led to the Choice program, but also \naccountability for the cost overruns in the construction of the Aurora, \nCO, facility--$1 billion at least over budget, and months, if not \nyears, of delays, as well as in other construction facilities.\n  I would just say to my friend from Arizona that the chairman and I \nare focused on the accountability issue, and we are working together in \na bipartisan way on a legislative measure that will meet the test of \nconstitutionality as well as effectiveness in holding accountable past \nand future officials at the VA for these kinds of mismanagement and in \nother areas. So I thank him for raising this issue.\n  I apologize to my colleague from Missouri for delaying him from \ntaking the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I join Senator McCain in thanking Senators \nIsakson and Blumenthal for the package we are putting together and \ntalking about. And I join them in thanking Senator McCain for coming \nforward and giving reality to this idea that many of us have advocated \nfor some time--more choices for veterans, more competition to see who \nserves veterans. I think the numbers Senator Isakson has used here \ntoday would indicate that every month veterans are embracing this idea \nof more choices.\n  It makes common sense that there are a few things the veterans health \ncare system should be better at than anybody else. They should be \nbetter at\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\npost-traumatic stress, dealing with that unique battle situation so \nmany of our veterans are facing right now. It is not a disorder; it is \na problem veterans have because of what we ask them to do and where we \nask them to do it. They should be better at IEDs, the explosive \ndevices, dealing with the injuries that come from those kinds of \nattacks, eye injuries and others. They should be better, in all \nlikelihood, at dealing with prosthetics because in the history of \nmilitary service, so many of our people who serve have lost arms and \nlegs. The VA has been good at prosthetics because of that.\n  But, frankly, I don't know very much else we should argue that they \nshould be better at than the place we probably drive by to get to their \nfacility. There is absolutely no reason to think the Veterans' \nAdministration should be a better place to get heart bypass surgery \ndone or a better place to get renal cancer dealt with or a better place \nto do almost anything else. If, in fact, there is a unique VA location \nthat has become better at those things than anybody else, that is a \ngreat place for veterans to go. But our goal should be to get veterans \nthe choice they need to go to the location that works best for them.\n  In looking at veterans mental health, Senator Stabenow and I last \nyear proposed the Excellence in Mental Health Act. Particularly young \nveterans want to have more choices. They want more choices that work \nbetter with work and work better with their families and let them \naccess those kinds of facilities and that kind of assistance in an \neasier way.\n  Seeing the steps this bill begins to take is something we should all \nembrace.\n  We should also hold the VA accountable for doing everything they \ncould--it appears to me--to resist the concept Congress wanted them to \nembrace. This bill addresses some of those obstacles.\n  I joined with Senator Moran in a bill he had so the Veterans' \nAdministration could no longer say: Well, the way we read the law, in \nthe strictest possible sense, if you are within 40 miles of a \nfacility--no matter whether your health care problem can be dealt with \nthere or not--you don't meet the 40-mile criteria. Well, of course the \nintention of Congress wasn't that they meet a 40-mile criteria. This \npiece of legislation, with the help of Senator Blumenthal, Senator \nIsakson, and Chairman Miller in the House, begins to clarify that.\n  I had a bill the House passed some time ago--Hire More Heroes--that \nallows veterans to have some advantage with companies that hiring that \nare right at 50 employees, and because of the difficulties of the new \nhealth care requirements for employers, those employers don't want to \nget to more than 50. The Hire More Heroes provision of this will let \nveterans who have TRICARE--who have veteran-provided care of one kind \nor another--be hired by an employer and not count toward the 50 because \nthey don't need to be counted in terms of who needs health care because \nthey already have it. That is what this does.\n  So I would like to see a better job done. The Cochran facility in St. \nLouis--I think one of the more troubled facilities in the country right \nnow--the big VA hospital there is about to get its eighth Interim \nDirector in 2 years. Now, there is some serious management problem when \none of our major facilities with some significant problems as an agency \nis now looking forward to its eighth Interim Director in 2 years. No \nproblems are going to be solved by half a dozen Interim Directors. The \nhead of the VA needs to understand that just like everybody else does.\n  The waiting list for getting a VA appointment is longer than 30 days \nand is more than 50 percent bigger than it was a year ago.\n  So the choice aspect of this--looking for more flexibility in how to \napply the ability of veterans to get their health care where they want \nto get their health care--is a good thing.\n  I am certainly disappointed that we are looking at another short-term \nextension of the highway bill, but if we have to put something with \nthat short-term extension of the highway bill that moves veterans \nchoice and competing for who can provide health care to veterans in the \nbest way, as this addition does, I think it is a great step in the \nright direction.\n  I certainly want to work with Senator Blumenthal, and the chairman's \npledge to do everything he can to make this competitive environment, \nwhere veterans can get their health care where they want in the best \nway, a permanent part of veterans health care--that is something I want \nto do.\n  One of my good friends introduced me at a meeting at a VA hospital \nabout a year ago. He said: Senator Blunt has been telling me for about \n10 years that we need to have more choice. I have been telling him the \nVA could do the job. I am now convinced that more choice is what we \nneed.\n  Many of our veterans and their families have had great experiences at \nVeterans' Administration facilities, but every one of them should have \na great experience, the best possible experience at whatever facility \nthey go to in gratitude of the service they provided us.\n  I am glad these additions are in the bill. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues as we try to make competition work better, as we try \nto ensure that it is permanent, and as we try to make the Veterans' \nAdministration work for the veterans instead of being focused on \nworking for the Veterans' Administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his support, \nand I appreciate the comments made by Senator Isakson and Senator \nMcCain. We had bipartisan support for this initiative to make sure our \nveterans continue to receive health care that is necessary because \nfunds will be terminated at the end of August if we fail to act. It is, \nin effect, a short-term fix that is necessary because of the present \nstructure of funding within the VA. I think we can take this step and \nleave for another day the question of how long the Choice Program \nshould be extended, if it should be extended at all.\n  My hope is that accountability and funding will focus on making the \nVA even better than it is. The reason for accountability is to make \nsure VA hospitals and providers are giving our veterans world-class, \nfirst-class health care.\n  I welcome the focus of the Senator from Missouri on what the VA does \nwell. I hope it does everything well that it is doing. From primary \ncare, to women's health care, to all of the clinics that are, to the \ninitiatives it is taking in telemedicine, the VA ought to be providing \nthe best health care available in the world to our veterans. They need \nit and deserve it. We need to make sure we keep faith with those \nveterans.\n  I am proud we are taking this step on a bipartisan basis to address \nthe short-term challenge of $3.4 billion that must be transferred from \nthe Choice Program to other accounts in the VA and to make sure the \nmoney is available to provide this funding and keep health care going \nfor our veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, here we go again. Once again, Planned \nParenthood is under attack. A bill is before the Senate that would once \nagain attempt to defund Planned Parenthood. And once again, we are \nseeing the Republican majority putting their partisan agenda ahead of \nthe health of women.\n  For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has been a trusted provider of \nhealth care services. Last year alone, Planned Parenthood of Northern \nNew England served 12,000 women in New Hampshire. Most of them are low \nincome. For many women in my State of New Hampshire, the full range of \nhealth services offered at Planned Parenthood is the most affordable \nand accessible way for them to get the care they need. Ninety-four \npercent of the services provided by Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire \nare prevention-related. We can see on this chart that it is well-women \nvisits, cancer screenings, vaccinations, birth control, breast exams,\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\nand HIV tests. Planned Parenthood provides the health care so many \nwomen need to ensure that they can live their lives in a way that gives \nthem opportunities and gives them reassurance that they are going to \nhave their health.\n  I oppose the legislation that has been introduced to defund Planned \nParenthood. It would make it harder for millions of women--as I said, \n12,000 in New Hampshire last year alone--to get the high-quality, \naffordable care they need.\n  This attack on women's health is politically motivated. It holds \nhostage the millions of women and families who depend on Planned \nParenthood.\n  The highly edited videos that have been circulated are disturbing. \nPlanned Parenthood has apologized, and the secretly taped videos and \nPlanned Parenthood's practices are under review by the Department of \nJustice. That is appropriate. But make no mistake about it--the group \nwho is responsible for theses deceptive videos is motivated by a single \npurpose: to limit access to abortion services. Its three officers are \nprominent in the anti-abortion movement. They have ties to many other \npolitically motivated groups who are working to take away a woman's \nright to choose. They have been tied to organizations that harass \nmedical providers, doctors, and patients, try to limit access to \nwomen's health care clinics, and they actively work to limit the \nreproductive health care decisions a woman can make.\n  Federal dollars are already prohibited from being used to pay for \nabortion under the Hyde amendment except in cases of rape, incest, or \nwhen the health of the mother is threatened.\n  This is not a vote to defund abortion; this is a vote to defund \npreventive health care for women, the kinds of things that are outlined \non this chart--the cancer screenings, the vaccinations, the breast \nexams, HIV tests, and birth control.\n  If you don't like abortion, then you should support family planning, \nwhich is one of the things Planned Parenthood does.\n  By targeting Planned Parenthood, this politically motivated attack on \nwomen's health will limit access to health care services that I think \nwe all agree should be available, the kinds of services that are listed \non this chart.\n  On behalf of the millions of women who are served by Planned \nParenthood, and the thousands of women in New Hampshire, I oppose and I \nwill continue to oppose any attempt to defund Planned Parenthood, an \norganization that is absolutely a critical component of women's health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Vehicle Technology\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, the United States is a world leader in new \ntechnological advancements, and in no sector is that better illustrated \nthan the auto industry.\n  We find ourselves at a critical juncture in terms of vehicle \ntechnology. Advancements such as super-lightweight materials and \nvehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications are \nrapidly coming to market and changing the way Americans get to work, \ntravel on vacation, and move goods and services across the country. \nWith a shared goal in maximizing the potential of these technologies, \nwe must get ahead of the curve and think strategically about how to \nseamlessly weave them together in a way that will best increase public \nsafety, fuel efficiency, and vehicle performance. That is why I am \nexcited to be leading two bills that will provide the tools \nresearchers, engineers, manufacturers, and others need to create the \nnext generation of cars and trucks built in Michigan and in States all \nacross the country.\n  The Vehicle Innovation Act builds on the Department of Energy's \ninnovative work to improve vehicle fuel economy and minimize petroleum \nuse. The Vehicle Innovation Act is bipartisan, with strong support from \nmy lead cosponsors, Senator Alexander and Senator Stabenow. Thanks to a \nteam effort, it passed as an amendment to a bipartisan energy bill in \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources yesterday by a vote of 20 \nto 2.\n  The need for this legislation is clear. Oil dependency is driven by \ntransportation, particularly cars and trucks. Transportation is \nresponsible for 66 percent of U.S. petroleum usage and 27 percent of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. America's dependence on oil poses significant \neconomic, energy, and environmental risks to the United States, and the \nDepartment of Defense has recognized that our reliance on oil puts our \nmen and women in uniform at greater risk.\n  We have 240 million light-duty vehicles on the roads in the United \nStates, and it will take decades of sustained effort to turn over that \nfleet.\n  It is absolutely critical that we develop the advanced technologies \nnow in order to achieve fuel savings in the future and become truly \nenergy independent. The Vehicle Innovation Act establishes a consistent \nand consolidated authority for the Department of Energy's Vehicle \nTechnologies Program, which promotes partnerships with the public and \nprivate sector to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles. Through this \nprogram, the DOE will collaborate with light-duty automobile and \nmedium- and heavy-duty commercial truck engineers, manufacturers, and \nsuppliers to conduct cutting-edge research that will help us advance \nthe future of fuel-efficient cars and trucks.\n  DOE's sustainable transportation initiatives are already making great \nstrides in vehicle efficiency, and VIA will continue to strengthen \nthose activities while providing new authorities to expand their work.\n  The SuperTruck Initiative is a great example of this. Industry \npartners have achieved and exceeded the program goal of a 50-percent \nimprovement in overall freight efficiency on a heavy-duty, class 8 \ntractor-trailer. Some have even reached over a 100-percent improvement. \nMy bill ensures that the DOE will be able to continue working with the \nindustry on supertrucks.\n  Another example that the Vehicle Innovation Act will build on is the \nwork on multimaterial, lightweight vehicles. Holistic vehicle and \nmanufacturing design improvements for reducing vehicle weight can \nresult in weight reduction and fuel economy gains of over 20 percent.\n  The Vehicle Innovation Act is technology neutral. It develops and \nstrengthens the toolbox for auto experts without picking winners and \nlosers. It also directs the Department of Energy to continue its \ninvestment into multiple transformational technologies, such as \nhydrogen and batteries. DOE research and development has cut costs for \nfuel cell systems by 50 percent since 2006. My bill will build on this \nsuccess and expand DOE's focus into the near-term deployments that will \nresult in major savings for the national fleet.\n  The Vehicle Innovation Act also includes new research authorities on \nvehicle-to-vehicle--or V2V--communications systems. This technology \nallows cars to talk to one another and recognize dangers that a \nvehicle's radar, cameras, and other sensors can't detect.\n  As we are working to develop these features in new vehicles, we must \nalso ensure that we are keeping pace with technologies in our \ninfrastructure.\n  Vehicle-to-vehicle infrastructure--or V2I--technology allows vehicles \nto communicate with the road and has the ability to help prevent \ncollisions, relieve traffic congestion, and reduce unnecessary energy \nconsumption. That is why I introduced another bill to promote \ninvestments in V2I technology by authorizing States to use existing \nsurface and highway transportation funding to invest in V2I projects as \nthey upgrade highway infrastructure.\n  An example of V2I in action is a monitor on a bridge that will tell \napproaching drivers if there is a dangerous ice buildup on it. Other \nexamples include traffic signals that warn vehicles of stopped traffic \nor sensors that warn of nearby emergency vehicles for work zones.\n  In 2013 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that \nmore than 32,000 people were killed in vehicle crashes. According to \nNTHSA, V2V and V2I--the two technologies being developed--will be able \nto eliminate up\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\nto 80 percent of vehicle accidents involving nonimpaired drivers once \nthey are fully deployed.\n  I am pleased that my V2I legislation is included in the overall \nhighway bill the Senate is considering this week, and I look forward to \nworking in the fall during the conference to make sure this funding \neligibility language remains in the bill.\n  V2V and V2I technologies are part of the auto industry's future, and \nthese technologies will be readily available in the near term. That is \nwhy it is so important that we make these investments in our \ninfrastructure now to ensure that we can start using these lifesaving \ntechnologies as they become available.\n  Taken together, these two bills represent the type of forward-\nthinking policymaking that Congress should be focused on every day. \nInvestments in research and development have demonstrated the ability \nto transform our society for the better, and I am determined to make \nsure the United States is the country that is driving forward advanced \ntechnology instead of putting on the brakes and being left behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nimportance of protecting women's health and protecting their access to \ntheir health care, in other words, their choice. I strongly oppose what \nis becoming a major effort to defund Planned Parenthood. Planned \nParenthood has ensured women receive the health care they need for \nalmost 100 years now. That was before women even had the right to vote. \nIts founder was thrown in jail for making birth control available, and \nit has been under near-constant attack since then.\n  I think the Senate needs to stand up on behalf of millions of women \nacross this country and vote no on any amendment that would defund \nPlanned Parenthood. This organization is the primary health care \nprovider for millions of American women. One in five women in this \ncountry has been to Planned Parenthood.\n  I have received hundreds of emails and calls from women in California \nabout their support for and experiences at Planned Parenthood. They \ntold me that doctors there listened to them, the nurses became their \nfriends, and they felt valued as patients. Before they went to Planned \nParenthood, they were worried about their health. They didn't know if \nthey would be able to get the care they need, and they didn't have the \ninformation to make smart, healthy lifestyle choices.\n  One young woman from Santa Barbara told me about a health care scare \nshe had when she was 20. Precancerous cells were discovered during her \nannual exam. Planned Parenthood didn't have the equipment to perform \nthe followup procedure she needed, but that didn't keep the clinic \nstaff from helping her. They connected her to the only OB/GYN in the \ncity who accepted low-income patients, and she got the care she needed.\n  She said: ``Since that early detection and intervention, I've been \nhealthy and would not be where I am today without Planned Parenthood.''\n  Another young woman from Victorville, CA, told me it was hard to get \ninformation about how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted \ndiseases and access contraception. Three girls she knew in high school \nbecame pregnant. It wasn't until she visited Planned Parenthood in \ncollege that she felt she could make responsible health care decisions.\n  Another young woman shared her abortion story. She was 19 when she \nbecame pregnant. She felt scared and alone. She said: ``During a time \nwhen a tough decision had been made and a million thoughts were running \nthrough my mind, it was relieving to know that I was in the hands of \npeople whose only goal was to help me.'' And 4 years later, she still \nuses Planned Parenthood as her primary health care provider and \nencourages her friends and family to also use them.\n  I want to say just a little bit about the services Planned Parenthood \nprovides and how it uses Federal funds. Nearly 80 percent of its \npatients are low income, making less than $18,000 a year. Without \nPlanned Parenthood, many of these women could not access the most basic \nhealth care services. That bears repeating. Planned Parenthood is often \nthe only option for women to get their annual checkup. It provides \nbreast exams, contraception, prenatal care, cancer screenings, and \ntesting for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. It also runs \nteen pregnancy prevention and health education programs that reach more \nthan 1 million young people per year. This is what the Federal funding \nPlanned Parenthood receives goes toward.\n  In 2013, Planned Parenthood used Federal funds to provide the \nfollowing: nearly half a million breast exams, nearly 400,000 cervical \ncancer screenings, contraception for 2.2 million patients, and testing \nand treatment for sexually transmitted infections for 4.5 million \npatients.\n  In addition to serving predominately low-income women, Planned \nParenthood operates in some of the most underserved communities in this \ncountry. For example, without Planned Parenthood, 13 of California's 58 \ncounties would not have a single clinic to provide family planning \nservices to low-income women through title X programs.\n  Attacks on Planned Parenthood are a concerted attack on access to \nsafe, legal abortion services in this country. Make no mistake about \nit. The group behind this latest attack, the Center for Medical \nProgress, has longstanding ties to the anti-choice movement, including \nOperation Rescue, which is closely associated with clinic violence.\n  While abortion accounts for only 3 percent of the health care \nservices provided by Planned Parenthood, it is often one of the only \nabortion providers in a State or a region. For example, there are 10 \nabortion clinics in Texas. Just a few years ago, there were 36 abortion \nclinics. Twenty-six clinics were forced to close after Texas passed a \nlaw aimed at ending abortion in the State. The Supreme Court has put \nsome provisions of that law on hold pending further review. But the \npoint is that laws such as the one in Texas force much-needed \nfacilities to close. Just 10 clinics in Texas have met the unnecessary \nand burdensome new requirements, and 5 of those 10 clinics are Planned \nParenthood clinics. If Planned Parenthood closes, Texas loses half of \nits remaining abortion providers in one fell swoop.\n  The goal of the groups pushing this effort is clear. It is to chip \naway bit by bit at a woman's ability to make her own health care \ndecisions in consultation with her family and her doctor. That is their \ngoal--no matter the cost to women across the country who rely on \nPlanned Parenthood for cancer screenings, annual checkups, and other \nessential services--and in my view, this is simply wrong.\n  I am really troubled by the aggressive tactics used by anti-choice \ngroups, such as the illegal filming of a medical procedure and the \nhacking of Planned Parenthood's records. This is disturbing. We all \nknow the danger of leaking confidential information. We know the \npotential for serious violence.\n  In 1994, shortly after I came to the Senate, we passed the Freedom of \nAccess to Clinic Entrances Act in response to a spate of violent \nepisodes targeting women's health clinics. Two doctors, a clinic \nescort, and two receptionists at a Planned Parenthood facility in \nBoston were killed by anti-abortion activists during three separate \nattacks in 1993 and 1994.\n  This week, upon learning that her name and email address had been \npublished, one Planned Parenthood staffer in California told my office \nthat she refused to be intimidated because she knows that is the whole \npoint.\n  I am concerned that the message being sent is that it is OK to commit \ncrimes against Planned Parenthood, its employees, and its patients; and \nit is not. That sort of message can be taken up by extremists and \nbecome very dangerous for women and doctors across the country.\n  Whether you support the right to choose or not--and I very much do--\nwe should all be very careful here. Doctors and clinic staff who \nprovide constitutionally protected health care services and women who \naccess these services should not be terrorized and threatened.\n  In closing, I will return to where I started. I believe that if there \nis a movement to withhold funding from Planned Parenthood, that \nmovement\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\nwill not be successful. I believe that will be defeated right here in \nthe Senate. I do not understand why anyone would even try to do this at \nthis time. This country has so many problems, not the least of which \nare things that I deal with every day in the intelligence community--\nthe fear of extremists, the attacks by terrorists and those who want to \nstrike our homeland. It seems to me that we do not need this fight now, \nparticularly a fight where those who oppose Planned Parenthood, I \nbelieve, will be seriously defeated.\n  If a bill does come before us, I believe it is a mistake, and I would \nurge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we know that our generation, people in the \nSenate and in the House--people in their forties, fifties, and \nsixties--inherited from their parents and grandparents the greatest \ninfrastructure in the history of the world. From the 1940s, 1950s, \n1960s, and 1970s into the Reagan years, when we decided we should \ninvest less in infrastructure, we had this incredible infrastructure we \ninherited from our parents and grandparents. Yet, for whatever reason, \nwe have allowed it to crumble. We haven't invested. We haven't \nmodernized. We haven't even maintained it as well as we should.\n  The dismal state of our Nation's outdated roads and bridges and \nrailways cost Ohioans and North Carolinians valuable time and money and \nenergy.\n  The State legislature in my State and I know the State legislature in \nthe Presiding Officer's State have been on a budget-cutting tear. My \nState legislature has decided to slice in half, and then some, local \nfunding for many things, including infrastructure. As a result, the \nstreets in any town in Ohio, virtually--not just big cities, not just \nsuburbs, but more affluent communities, small towns, and rural areas--\nthe streets and highways continue to crumble. It is because this body \nhas been far too dysfunctional because of the pledges that many elected \nofficials have made to a Washington lobbyist that they will never close \ntax loopholes and will continue to fail to fund infrastructure because \nof what State government has done in my State.\n  But instead of debating a long-term bill with that funding, we debate \na hastily assembled bill, without an open process, without amendments, \nthat no one expects will even be considered by the House of \nRepresentatives. The Speaker of the House, a fellow Ohioan, used a \nfour-letter word to describe this legislation when or if--I assume \nwhen--it goes over to the House.\n  The Senate is considering a bill that doesn't do enough for \ninfrastructure. It makes bad choices about how to pay for these \ninvestments. Yet, at the same time, President Obama proposed a 6-year, \n$478 billion transportation package that would provide a major \nexpansion in investment. It is supported by all kinds of \norganizations--business, labor, contractors, AFL-CIO, manufacturers, \nsteelmakers, concrete makers--businesses that want to have good \ninfrastructure to get their goods to market and want their employees to \nbe able to drive to work or take the bus to work without major damage \nto the axles of their cars when they hit the potholes on too many city \nstreets. Instead, we are looking at a bill that pays for just 3 years \nand offers small increases over current spending levels.\n  Think about how we are doing this. This is a 6-year authorization, \nwith funding for slightly less than 3 years but collecting the money by \nbudget gimmicks over 10 years. What kind of game is this? Instead of \nfunding infrastructure the way we used to when we would come together \nbipartisanly and fund infrastructure with real dollars and real \ninvestments, we are now playing games. That is why in the House of \nRepresentatives the Speaker of the House used a four-letter word to \ndescribe this bill. It is why so many are so dissatisfied in the House \nof Representatives.\n  It will pass with a majority. It will pass with cloture. It has \nalready gotten 60 votes. But they are 60 pretty unhappy votes because \nnobody I know in this body thinks we are doing this anything close to \nthe right way.\n  If we had considered amendments in the regular order as the majority \nleader promised, I would have offered a fully paid for proposal to \nboost the bill's investments and expand the major projects program. Let \nme talk about that for a second.\n  This amendment would fund projects such as the Brent Spence Bridge \nbetween Cincinnati and northern Kentucky. The Brent Spence Bridge, \nbuilt in 1959, 1960, connects Cincinnati with northern Kentucky. I-75 \nrunning north and south goes from Cincinnati to Dayton. The Brent \nSpence Bridge includes I-75 and runs from Cincinnati, to Dayton, to \nLima, to Toledo, to Detroit. I-71 also comes together right at the \nBrent Spence Bridge as it crosses into Ohio--Cincinnati, Columbus, \nCleveland, not far from Akron.\n  So my colleague, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, who \nhas played a major role in transportation and would like to do it \nright, has pointed out several times during this debate, the \nequivalent--get this--that one bridge--4 percent of our Nation's GDP \ncrosses that bridge every day, every week, every month, every year. \nFour percent of our gross domestic product moves back and forth across \nthat bridge; yet that bridge is about 55 years old. There has never \nbeen a serious accident with that bridge. There have been problems. \nThere have been some safety issues. I don't think anybody expects it to \nfall down next year--I am not being an alarmist--but when are we going \nto do something to fix that bridge?\n  Senator McConnell, the majority leader--that bridge, for curious \nhistorical reasons--the Ohio River, which separates there Ohio and \nKentucky--almost the entire Ohio River is considered to be in Kentucky. \nSo this bridge, which covers 4 percent of GDP, is in the home State of \nthe majority leader, and yet the majority leader did not allow another \nSenator to offer an amendment that actually would take care of \nrebuilding and fixing up that historic bridge that is very crucial to \nour economy. Without the Federal Government, that bridge won't get \nreplaced. The State government of Kentucky is not going to do it. Ohio \nis not going to do it. They should play a role. They could toll that \nbridge. Who knows. They should play a role.\n  Federal investment in highways was mapped out by President Roosevelt \nand started by President Eisenhower with the interstates. It was always \nbipartisan until the pledge by far too many Members of this body to \nspecial interest lobbyists who said we can't do that, we can't fund \nthis infrastructure.\n  On the transit side, I would have sought to strike a pilot program \nthat allows pilot projects with any private investment to ``skip the \nline'' of Federal funding, meaning these projects, which are often bad \nfor workers that operate the new line, would have been in a special \ncategory that they surely didn't earn because they haven't served the \nsame public purpose and gone through the same justification process, if \nyou will, as a normal public transportation project.\n  When the majority leader brought a combined transportation bill to \nthe floor last Tuesday, he used his privileged position to prevent any \nSenator from offering amendments. I remember the elections last fall \nwhen Senator McConnell--then the minority leader--said that things will \nbe different in the Senate. It didn't take long for Senator McConnell \nto sort of trump his predecessor by doing it even worse--pardon the \nplay on words with the verb there. This matters because bad process can \nlead to bad outcomes.\n  The Senate, given the opportunity to have a full debate on \ntransportation, would be voting on a much stronger proposal. As the \nPresiding Officer knows, this bill has improved over the last couple of \nweeks.\n  They have taken out--this bill originally was going to slice money \nout of the Social Security fund to pay for highways and bridges and \ntransit. We have never done that before in this body.\n  We were going to take money out of money that was already promised \nand dedicated and about to be spent to help cities that have been \nparticularly devastated by foreclosures. They were going to use money \nfrom that.\n  They were going to use money from community banks--they still are--in \nthis proposal.\n  They are going to charge everybody who is getting a mortgage $50, \n$100, $300 at closing to help pay for transportation--what is that \nabout?--instead of\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\ndoing it right and funding transportation the way we used to, \nbipartisanly, back when Senate candidates and House candidates didn't \nsign pledges from special interest lobbyists where they tie their hands \nand are not able to come up with revenue for a transportation bill. If \nall the committees of jurisdiction over this bill held markups to \nactually discuss the bill, had hearings for the bill, had been able to \namend the bill, it would have been a much stronger bill.\n\n  The chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee did good \nbipartisan work on highways. I commend Senator Inhofe and Senator \nBoxer--one Republican and one Democrat--but their work is the \nexception. The banking committee, on which I serve as ranking member, \ntraditionally developed the public transportation portion of this bill. \nIt is done bipartisanly through the regular committee process. Not even \na hint of that happened this year.\n  The Finance Committee, of which I am a member, has jurisdiction over \nmuch of the revenue that is used to offset funds going into the highway \ntrust fund--no markups there either. As introduced, this bill would \nhave robbed Social Security, as I said, taken money from the Hardest \nHit Fund, as I said, for communities devastated by foreclosure crisis.\n  I invite the majority leader to come to Cleveland--I know he comes to \nCleveland to fund-raise--but come to Cleveland and look at the \nneighborhood I live in. I live in ZIP Code 44105. My wife and I have \nlived there for a couple of years. In 2007, that ZIP Code had the \nhighest number of foreclosures in the United States of America. That \nhappened because of Wall Street greed, in large part, but the fact that \nit did happen means there is far too much blight in this neighborhood. \nThe Hardest Hit Fund matters to clean up some of this neighborhood and \nenable people to get back on their feet.\n  The commerce committee, the third committee--first, there was banking \nand then Finance. Then there is the EPW that did it mostly right. The \nbanking committee was excluded, the Finance Committee was excluded. The \ncommerce committee, which is responsible for highway safety and rail \nsafety, held a markup but not a single Democrat on the committee \nsupported the language in the legislation because they did nothing \nabout public safety. If my recollection is right, younger people are \nallowed to drive trucks--as if we want less truck safety. I say ``young \npeople'' meaning 18-year-olds. I know I am getting older, but I don't \nreally want 18-year-olds driving these rigs when they clearly don't \nhave much experience and less training. It also did not fix some of the \nrail issues we should fix, having seen some of these terrible \naccidents. It was one thing after another.\n  For the past 2 weeks, a large part of the legislation was written in \nthe Republican offices with little input from Democratic Senators. Even \nthough the majority leader has said that times have changed, we are \ngoing to have a full committee process, an open amendment process, \ndebate, and all of that, this didn't happen.\n  The greatest barrier of this bill, aside from the limited growth in \ninvestment, is this bill makes choices about revenue that this Senator \nthinks the Congress and the American people will regret. I have \nmentioned a couple of them. Let me talk about those that were a part of \nthe banking committee, on which I sit, which I think I probably know \nthe most about.\n  Despite opposition from consumer advocates and participants in the \nhousing market, including bankers and realtors, the bill would increase \nthe guaranty fees paid by homeowners that are charged to protect \nagainst losses to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That means when going to \na closing, you are going to be assessed a fee. It would increase the \ncost of homeownership by $4,000 for borrowers who have a 20-percent \ndownpayment for the median home price and would increase even more for \nthose who put less down. That is why a vote for this bill is a vote to \nincrease the cost of homeownership for families across the country and \nputs taxpayers at greater risk. There is a history of opposition to the \nuse of this fee for purposes other than housing. More recently, Senator \nCrapo, a Republican, and Senator Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, \nwrote a provision in this year's budget resolution to prevent this fee \nfrom being misused, and of course they are right.\n  This bill requires the IRS to use private debt collection agencies to \ncollect taxes because the majority leader was looking for anything he \ncould find that might produce revenue--it has nothing to do with \ntransportation--but anyplace he could find in the government funds to \nproduce revenue that then could be used to pay for a highway bill. \nAgain, it is smoke and mirrors and just sort of funny money.\n  One of the ways he did this was to take money from the IRS--even as \nwe cut the budget for IRS debt collection--to take some more of that \nmoney and give it to a private debt collection company to collect this \ndebt. That was considered to be approximately a $2 billion revenue \ngenerator for reasons that aren't quite clear. It has been tried before \nand each time it has lost money and it has been repealed. The companies \nhired for these efforts were found to have frequently harassed low-\nincome families and they violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices \nAct, but the majority leader needed that billion-plus dollars for his \nhighway bill. People here didn't have the guts to stand up and say, no, \nwe may have made this pledge to the special interest lobbyists and we \ncan't come up with revenue, but instead let's actually do this right. \nNo, they aren't going to do that. They take money from the Hardest Hit \nFund, Social Security money, increase costs to middle-class people at a \nclosing who are trying to get a mortgage, and privatize debt \ncollection.\n  It is hard to see how these programs that hurt families--the Hardest \nHit Fund, the debt collection, the Social Security money--how this \nmakes sense to pay for investments for bridges and roads.\n  This bill would reduce the dividends paid to banks with over $1 \nbillion in total assets that are members of the Federal Reserve System. \nThat raises $17 billion. While it might make sense to reduce the \ndividend--you can argue that--I have heard people on both sides of that \ndebate. If we exempted the smallest banks under $1 billion, there are \nplenty of community banks that are $2 to $3 billion in size. Most are \nsmaller, but they will be paying more--hundreds of thousands of \ndollars--millions in some cases. All of the people who voted for this \nbill--voted for cloture, voted for this highway bill--are assessing a \nnumber of community banks in their States for this money. We don't know \nif the new rate of 1.5 percent that Senator McConnell has decided on is \nfair. I appreciate the cutoff of the lower rate of $1 billion, but we \nshould be working this out in committee, discussing it and hearing \npeople on both sides. They started with every bank and arbitrarily cut \nit to set the $1 billion threshold. They arbitrarily dropped the \npercentage from 6 to 1.5. Nobody truly knows what I am talking about \nwhen I talk about this because nobody truly understands this program. \nEven people who are on the banking committee don't know it very well. \nMaybe we should have researched and discussed it and had hearings on \nit. Instead, the majority leader came around to these banks and to this \ncommittee and they thought, hey, we can get $16 billion there by \nchanging a program and nobody knows what it is anyway. Well, he has \ntaken that money from a lot of community banks. More power to him. It \nis another reason I am not going to support this bill. It is ironic \nthat on the fifth anniversary of Wall Street's Dodd-Frank reform this \nbill would undercut rules to help small banks.\n  Before I close I want to be fair and point out some of the good \nprovisions in this bill. First, the Senate voted on a strong bipartisan \nbasis to add an amendment to renew the U.S. Export-Import Bank. This \nBank has helped 350 businesses in my home State, two-thirds of which \nare small businesses. It doesn't cost taxpayers a cent. Interestingly, \nthe Export-Import Bank, begun by President Roosevelt in the 1930s, was \nalways bipartisan. Its reauthorization, continuation, renewal, and \nupdate was always done by Congress on a bipartisan basis. My \nrecollection--I am not quite sure this is precise, but my recollection \nis that only once was there ever a vote in the Senate for the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank because there was no need to \nbecause\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\neverybody agreed with it. Yet because of the far right, the tea party--\nwe used to call them the John Birch Society when they opposed Medicare \nand now they are called the tea party when they oppose the Affordable \nCare Act--has decided this Export-Import Bank, which helps businesses \nand companies, particularly small companies in Dayton, Toledo, \nCleveland, Charlotte, Asheville, and Durham--helps small businesses \nexport their products. They need some help sometimes.\n  Every other country in the world--every other major country, we \nthink, has some kind of an export financing agency such as this, but we \nare not able, for political reasons, call it crony capitalism--the tea \nparty weighed in and convinced a lot of Senate and House Republicans \nthat it is not such a good idea. Right now the Ex-Im Bank is in this \nbill. Hopefully it will stay in over the process. I am hopeful. Because \nthe Speaker used a four-letter word to describe this bill, I am hopeful \nwhen we get a short-term extension--I hate cliches but this is such a \ngood one--when we kick this can down the road again for another 2 or 3 \nmonths, whatever it is going to be, I am hopeful the majority leader \nand the Speaker will include the Export-Import Bank reauthorization and \nmake it long term, but it is not clear if they will.\n  I want to also point out that Chairman Shelby, the chairman of my \ncommittee in banking, with whom I have a good relationship, included a \nnumber of proposals for transit policy that I think make good sense.\n  The mass transit account was created in 1983 under President Reagan. \nIt was done right. Public transit has always received around 20 \npercent, sometimes a little more, of any new revenue that is dedicated \nto growth. We have a tradition in this country that for every $100 we \nare spending on the Transportation bill, $20 of that goes to small bus \nsystems in Lorain, OH, it goes to RTA for trains and rail in Cleveland, \nit goes to major transit systems in New York or anywhere around the \ncountry. This bill initially was less than 20 percent. I appreciate \nChairman Shelby and the majority leader getting it back up to 20 \npercent.\n  There is a new program for competitive bus grants. It is underfunded \nat $190 million a year. This bill increases the amount of American-made \nsteel and other components. That is a good thing.\n  With all my criticism on this bill in the way it was handled by the \nleadership in this House, there are some good things in this bill. I \nhope the Senate will move forward after today with a desire to revive \nthe bipartisan process based on regular order when we address \ntransportation issues.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues in both parties to deliver a \nrobust 6-year transportation bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6124-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6124-S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                            FOIA PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Thune, chairman of the commerce committee, \nregarding the DRIVE Act and the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.\n  I want to thank Chairman Thune for working with me to remove four \nprovisions in the DRIVE Act aimed at carving out information from \ndisclosure under FOIA, three of which were in titles of the bill \nfalling under the commerce committee's jurisdiction. The removal of \nthese four provisions is reflected in the second-degree amendment filed \nby Senator Inhofe, amendment No. 2533, to the McConnell substitute \namendment. FOIA is our Nation's premier open government law and the \nfoundation on which all our sunshine and transparency policies rest. It \nremains an indispensable tool for Americans to obtain information \naffecting public policy, consumer safety, the environment, and public \nhealth. The Freedom of Information Act falls under the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and changes affecting \nthis law should not be enacted without full and careful consideration \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank Senator Leahy for his interest in these matters, \nand I am pleased we were able to work out an agreement to strike these \nprovisions and move forward with consideration of the DRIVE Act. I look \nforward to working with you and Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, on any future proposals to amend the Freedom of \nInformation Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also want to draw particular attention to Section 32003, \nrelated to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's, FMCSA's, \ncompliance, safety, and accountability system, CSA. The CSA system is \ndesigned to evaluate the safety and compliance performance of motor \ncarriers by using data from inspections, crashes, compliance reviews, \nand the Federal motor carrier census to come up with a safety \nmeasurement system, SMS, score for each motor carrier in seven behavior \nanalysis and safety improvement categories, BASICs. It is my \nunderstanding that these scores are currently available to the public \nvia FMCSA's Web site. It is also my understanding that, as originally \ndrafted, this bill would have prohibited FMCSA from making these scores \navailable to the general public via its Web site or via a FOIA request \nwhile FMCSA evaluates and reforms the methodology underlying these \nscores.\n  I have serious concerns about removing this information from public \nview, even for a short period of time. The safety score is one of the \ntools we give consumers and other stakeholders to help fully evaluate \nmotor carriers. While I prefer that these scores remain easily \naccessible on FMSCA's Web site for the general public while the \nmethodology is reviewed, it is critical that the scores remain \navailable under FOIA. Even if the scores are removed from the Web site \nwhile the methodology is reviewed, under the provision, they will \nremain available to law enforcement and regulators for use in \noverseeing the industry. For this reason alone, as well as many others, \nwe should not withhold that information from public scrutiny. Moreover, \nthe Judiciary Committee did not review this new proposed exemption and \nhas not had time to fully consider the potential effects of this \nexclusion.\n  I thank Senator Thune for working with me to remove this FOIA \nexemption. Originally the bill language stated that none of the score \ninformation ``may be made available to the general public (including \nthrough requests under Section 552 of title 5, United States Code [the \nFOIA statute]).'' The Inhofe second degree amendment strikes the phrase \n``including through requests under Section 552 of title 5, United \nStates Code'' in its entirety. Under the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, no new \nFOIA exemption under 5 U.S.C 552(b)(3), is effective unless it \nspecifically cites to 5 U.S.C 552(b)(3). Removing the citation to the \nFOIA statute makes clear that, while the scores may no longer be \nroutinely published and easily accessible to the general public via \nFMSCA's Web site until they have been reviewed and reformed, the scores \nare still subject to disclosure pursuant to a FOIA request, unless an \nexisting exemption is found to apply.\n  Mr. THUNE. For the reasons you stated, I agree that if enacted into \nlaw, nothing in Section 32003 exempts or is intended to exempt \ninformation under the Freedom of Information Act. I would, however, \njust offer two comments to explain to my colleague the rationale for \nand limits of the modified provision. First, the commerce committee has \nreceived information from several objective sources, including the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the Department of Transportation's \nOffice of Inspector General, and the law enforcement community, \nidentifying concerns with the accuracy of the scoring analysis \nperformed by FMCSA as part of the CSA program. As noted by GAO, the \nmanner in which scores are calculated under the program ``creates the \nlikelihood that many SMS scores do not represent an accurate or precise \nsafety assessment for a carrier.'' Accordingly, the bill proposes to \nwithdraw this potentially misleading analysis from public review \ntemporarily, until the program is reviewed and corrected. Nevertheless, \nas underscored by subsection 32003(c), the underlying ``[i]nspection \nand violation information'' submitted to FMCSA under the program \n``shall remain available for public viewing.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 100th \nbirthday of an incredible Nevadan, Gertrude Silvia Rudiak. For more \nthan 70 years, Gertrude has been a leader in southern Nevada and has \nremained committed to her family, community, and faith.\n  Nearly a century ago, on August 2, 1915, Gertrude was born to Jewish \nimmigrant parents in Dickinson, ND. As a child, her family moved from \nplace to place across the country, but it was her parents' \nunderstanding of the value of higher education that brought them to the \nwest coast. In California, she attended the University of California, \nBerkeley, where she received her bachelor's degree in music. Later, \nGertrude built upon her skill set and earned credentials from the \nBusiness College of Oakland in office procedure. With undeniable \ntenacity and the knowledge she gained, she was able to work through the \nGreat Depression.\n  In 1942, Gertrude met the love of her life, George Rudiak, and they \nmarried in September the same year. George was born in Moscow, Russia, \nand the experiences he and his family endured as they immigrated to the \nUnited States greatly shaped the man he became and the civil work he \npursued later in his life.\n  George had received a law degree from the Boalt Hall School of \nJurisprudence at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1940, but \nfinding a job was a challenge. He was able to do some work for the \nState of California and the U.S. Employment Services; and in the midst \nof World War II, George enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps. The first \nplace he was assigned was the Western Flying Training Command at Santa \nAna. George was later transferred to the Las Vegas Gunnery School, \nwhich is now Nellis Air Force Base. Though the young couple was only \nstationed in Las Vegas for a short time, they fell in love with the \ncity and moved back to plant their roots in the desert sand as soon as \nGeorge was honorably discharged in 1946.\n  The Las Vegas of the 1940s was quite different from the Las Vegas of \ntoday. Approximately 21,000 people called the city home, and there was \nracial segregation. Some even referred to Las Vegas as the \n``Mississippi of the West.'' As the first city attorney of North Las \nVegas, a Nevada Legislator, and chairman of the Nevada Equal Rights \nCommission, George was committed to bringing equality to Nevada. \nGertrude supported his efforts; and for more than 70 years, has made \ncivic, religious, and humanitarian contributions of her own that have \nshaped our community. Today, all Las Vegans benefit from the \ncompassionate work of Gertrude and George to make our community a \nbetter and more just place.\n  George Rudiak was a lawyer's lawyer. He was the lawyer we all looked \nto as the gold standard for an ethical, competent, experienced trial \nlawyer.\n  There are truly selfless people in the world, and Gertrude is one of \nthese people. She is dedicated to her five children, their children, \nand their children's children and still finds time to improve her \ncommunity. Over the past seven decades, she has filled traditionally \nmale-held positions on community boards, including becoming the first \nfemale to serve on the board of Temple Beth Sholom, and has been a \nchampion of secular and Jewish education in Las Vegas and Israel. Her \nefforts have been recognized by the Jewish National Fund, the United \nJewish Appeal, and the Anti-Defamation League. Additionally, Mayor \nCarolyn Goodman presented Gertrude with the rare honor of a key to the \ncity of Las Vegas in 2014. On more than one occasion, the city has \ndeclared August 2, Gertrude's birthday, Gertrude Rudiak Day in \nrecognition of her long-standing commitment to Las Vegas.\n  I am grateful for Gertrude's contributions to our State, and I wish \nher a happy 100th birthday. May this year bring Gertrude and her family \nmuch health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6125-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6125-S6126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1965, millions of Americans and nearly \nhalf the country's seniors couldn't afford basic health care. But that \nbegan to change 50 years ago today. President Lyndon Johnson signed \ninto law the Medicare program for the elderly and the Medicaid program \nfor low-income adults, children, pregnant women, and people with \ndisabilities.\n  Although it was signed by President Johnson, it ``started with the \nman from Independence,'' . . . Harry S. Truman. In 1949, Truman became \nthe first President to publically support a national health insurance \nprogram and sent a bill to Congress that would give health insurance to \neveryone age 65 and older. Critics called the idea ``socialized \nmedicine,'' and the effort failed.\n  Sixteen years later, President Johnson believed ``the times had \ncaught up with the idea.'' And he was right. Today, 46 million older \nadults and 9 million people with disabilities depend on Medicare for \nhealth care and economic security. In Illinois, 1.9 million people are \nenrolled in Medicare.\n  And because of the Affordable Care Act, the program has grown \nstronger. The Medicare Part A trust fund is now expected to be solvent \nfor an additional 13 years because of the Affordable Care Act. The \nAffordable Care Act is also helping seniors with the cost of their \nprescription drugs. Since the passage of the ACA, people with Medicare \nin Illinois have saved over $554 million on prescription drugs, because \nwe closed the donut hole. That is an average savings of $925 for each \nIllinois senior. The Affordable Care Act also expanded Medicare \ncoverage of certain preventive services, such as mammograms or \ncolonoscopies, without any cost sharing.\n  Let's not forget this is also the 50th Anniversary of Medicaid. \nMedicaid has been a lifeline for millions of people, especially \nchildren. My friends on the other side of the aisle find it easy to \ndiscredit a government program, but this isn't about a program. It is \nabout the people who benefit from them.\n  Over 54 million people benefit from Medicaid. Before the Affordable \nCare Act, two out of three people on Medicaid were pregnant women and \nchildren. That is 36 million of our most vulnerable citizens. Medicaid \nalso serves people with disabilities, including many low-income \nAmericans with disabilities who would have nowhere else to turn.\n  Before the Affordable Care Act, almost 3 million people were covered \nby Medicaid in Illinois and more than half of all births were covered \nby Medicaid. Now, anyone living below 133 percent of poverty can join \nMedicaid. That's a single person earning less than $15,654 a year, or a \nfamily of three bringing in $26,720. And for this population, the \nFederal Government picks up 100% of the cost. Because of the Affordable \nCare Act, more than 570,000 people in Illinois are now covered by \nMedicaid. I call that a success.\n  Just ask Christopher Greenwood if this law is making a difference. \nChristopher Greenwood is a community health and prevention coordinator \nfor the City of Rockford working to help people sign up for health \ninsurance. He helped a 50-year-old woman enroll in Medicaid, and she \nwas excited to have coverage for preventive services like a mammogram.\n  According to Christopher:\n\n     People aren't realizing the benefits of the Affordable Care \n     Act. It's all about prevention services. When we tell people \n     they need to sign up, they think they don't need it. But when \n     we start telling them the benefits, to see the looks on their \n     faces, it's all really cool.\n\n  You know who else benefits from Medicaid? Providers, hospitals and \ndoctors. Ask a provider back home: What would you prefer? Reimbursement \nby Medicaid or not be paid at all? The answer is obvious.\n  Medicare and Medicaid save lives. The programs provide high quality \nhealth care to millions of people. Yes, we owe something to Truman for \nthis idea. We owe something to Johnson for signing it into law. And \ntoday, we should focus on further strengthening these programs so they \ncan serve future generations.\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this week, we commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, programs that have made such a \ndifference in the lives of so many.\n  Upon signing these programs into law 50 years ago, then-President \nLyndon Johnson reminded us of a shared tradition within our great \nNation--one that ``calls upon us never to be indifferent toward despair \n. . . commands us never to turn away from helplessness . . . directs us \nnever to ignore or to spurn those who suffer untended in a land that is \nbursting with abundance.''\n  That deep-seated tradition--to lend a hand to our neighbors and \nfriends and to honor our mothers and fathers--is what guided Congress \nand country to do the right thing so many years ago. With the stroke of \nhis pen, President Johnson, and all those who fought before and \nalongside him, made sure that there would be care for the sick and \nserenity for the fearful.\n  I know just how important Medicare and Medicaid are for the people \nwho rely upon them. In the 1960s, I was a young social worker in \nBaltimore for ``Operation REASON'' (Responding to the Elderly's \nAbilities & Sickness Otherwise Neglected). Our goal was to help \nMaryland seniors get the health care they needed. You have to remember, \nin those days, when you retired, you usually lost your health \ninsurance, which meant that many seniors also lost access to their \ndoctors and health care.\n  More than half of America's seniors had no health insurance. This \nmeant that middle-class seniors were a heart attack away from \nbankruptcy, a cancer diagnosis away from destitution. It didn't matter \nif you were a senior of modest means or middle-class. Everyone was \nvulnerable.\n  But our job was to help. So, with teams led by social workers and \nnurses, we worked to help sick elderly people get health coverage and \nget to their doctor's office. We were focused on helping seniors who \nhad neglected their chronic conditions because of inability to travel, \nignorance of services available to them, fear of asserting their right \nto such services, or other barriers placed in their way.\n  I saw firsthand how hard Baltimore's seniors were struggling. They \nwere foregoing medical care because they didn't have insurance, because \nthey couldn't afford the bills, or simply because they didn't have \ntransportation to get to doctor's office or hospital. I knew Medicare \nand Medicaid could help these seniors and all seniors.\n  So every single day I would go out to churches and senior citizen \ncenters. I would inform people about their options, organize \ntransportation for them, and help them fill out complicated forms. In \nthose days, we didn't have computers or cell phones. We had to \nphysically go meet seniors where they were. And it worked. After 4 \nmonths of operation, we had 103 clients with a variety of chronic \ndiseases, and we helped them get the care they needed.\n  And Congress took notice of what we were doing. In 1966, I was \ninvited to come testify before Congress in the Senate Subcommittee on \nAging, which was chaired by Senator Kennedy. We told the committee what \nwe were doing, told them who we were fighting for. We were fighting for \npeople in need, people who lived in unsafe housing, had inadequate diet \nand clothing, a dearth of recreational opportunities, who were lonely \nand were in need of health care.\n  These people, our seniors and our families of modest means, were the \nreason Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid in the first place. And \nthank God we did.\n  Today, 55 million Americans--nearly every senior--has access to \nMedicare's guarantee. An additional 68 million of our Nation's most \nvulnerable have health care coverage thanks to Medicaid. Because of \nMedicare and Medicaid, more Americans have health insurance. Before \nMedicare, 48 percent of seniors had no insurance. Today, only 2 percent \nof seniors are uninsured. Out of pocket costs have decreased. Before \nMedicare, seniors paid 56 percent of health care expenses out of \npocket. Today, seniors only pay 13 percent. Life expectancy is longer. \nMedicare has contributed to a 5-year increase in life expectancy after \nage 65. Deaths from heart disease have dropped by a third for people \nover age 65. Our elderly's poverty rate has declined dramatically, from \n29 percent in 1966 to 10 percent today. Seniors have more affordable \ndrugs. Since 2010, over 8 million seniors have saved more than $11 \nbillion on prescription drugs. Kids are getting comprehensive early \nchildhood screenings, and 32 million children nationwide now get needed \nchildhood screenings.\n  In Maryland alone, Medicare ensures that 1 million Maryland seniors \ncan get the health care they need at prices they can afford. And \nMedicaid ensures that 975,000 Marylanders can get the health care they \nneed, including 478,000 Maryland kids--that is one in three of \nMaryland's children--149,000 Marylanders with disabilities, and 77,000 \nof our low-income seniors.\n  Over the past half century, we have seen Medicare and Medicaid \nprolong and enhance the lives of millions of Americans. Ensuring access \nto health care for America's most vulnerable ranks as one of our \nNation's greatest public health accomplishments. That is why I am \ncommitted to doing everything within my power to keep Medicare and \nMedicaid strong, so that these programs can continue helping those who \nrely on them today, as well as those who will need them tomorrow.\n  That means fighting for reforms that keep Medicare solvent, as we did \nin the Affordable Care Act, where we extended Medicare's solvency by \nmore than a decade. It means fighting for improvements that make \nMedicare stronger, as we did in the Affordable Care Act, where we \nclosed the prescription drug ``donut hole,'' where we gave seniors free \npreventive services, where we put the focus on quality of care, not \nquantity of care.\n  And it means fighting to protect these vital programs from those who \nwant to turn them from a guarantee into a voucher and political \npromise, as Republicans have repeatedly tried to do in their budget \nproposals.\n  Make no mistake, Republican proposals to privatize Medicare, to turn \nit into a voucher program, would end Medicare as we know it. I will not \nlet that happen. I will fight side-by-side with those 1 million \nMaryland seniors and 55 million American seniors. We will fight to keep \nMedicare and Medicaid strong and healthy so that they can continue to \nprovide for the health care needs of our citizens\n  As you can see, there is a lot to celebrate as we mark Medicare and \nMedicaid's 50th anniversary. For the past five decades, these programs \nhave accomplished their two main goals: ensuring access to health care \nfor the elderly, for the disabled, and for those of modest means. And \nprotecting people against the financial hardship of health care costs.\n  I consider it a great honor and privilege that I have been able to \ndevote so much of my career to protecting, improving, and fighting on \nbehalf of Medicare and Medicaid and all the people served by these \nprograms. From my days as a young social worker helping seniors and \nfamilies get the health care they needed, to my days in the House and \nSenate fighting against efforts to privatize Medicare or block grant \nMedicaid, to those years spent working to refresh and improve these \nprograms through the Affordable Care Act, including closing the ``donut \nhole,'' expanding Medicaid eligibility, and ensuring seniors could get \nfree preventive screenings.\n  I believe ``honor thy father and mother'' is a good commandment to \nlive by and a good policy to govern by. That is why I have fought to \nsave and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid to ensure that health care is \naffordable, accessible, reliable, and undeniable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6126-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6126-S6127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to express my \ndisdain for the reprehensible actions of Planned Parenthood and my \nsupport for the defense of all the unborn babies subject to this \ngroup's immoral practices.\n  Thanks to the Center for Medical Progress, the Nation has quickly \nbeen made aware that Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country \nhave been modifying their abortion procedures for the specific purpose \nof preserving organs from the fetuses being aborted in exchange for \ncompensation. In the video released this week, a former procurement \ntechnician explains how the procurement of certain body parts warrants \na higher level of compensation,\n\n[[Page S6127]]\n\nstating: ``If you can somehow procure a brain or a heart you're going \nto get more money than just [an . . .] umbilical cord.'' As a father of \nfour, and a strong advocate for the sanctity of life, I am deeply \ndisturbed by reports of these gruesome and inhumane actions.\n  However, Planned Parenthood currently continues to receive funding \nfrom hard-working taxpayers, many of whom also find their practices \ndeplorable. Between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2012, Planned \nParenthood received an average of $500 million per year, totaling $1.5 \nbillion. On top of these high levels of federal funding, Planned \nParenthood has made a profit every year since 1987.\n  Given our current fiscal climate and all our talk of the need to cut \nexcessive and wasteful spending, there is no justification for \ncontinuing to subsidize their profitable venture with taxpayer dollars. \nIt is time for big abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood to be \ninvestigated and defunded, and I have taken several actions to do just \nthat.\n  For the last three congresses, I have been the Senate sponsor of the \ntitle X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act. Title X is a grant program \nthat has unfortunately become a large subsidy for abortion providers \nthat claim to provide family planning and women's health care services. \nMy bill, S. 51, would prohibit the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) from providing this Federal funding to an entity or \ntheir affiliate that performs an abortion.\n  I have also signed on to two letters regarding needed investigations \ninto this matter. In one letter, I joined 49 fellow senators to request \nthat Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell \nimmediately begin a ``thorough review of the compliance of the \nDepartment and Planned Parenthood--one of the Department's grantees--\nwith all relevant and applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and \nother requirements.'' In a second letter, I joined 10 Senators in \nasking both Secretary Burwell and Attorney General Loretta Lynch to \nconduct a full investigation into Planned Parenthood to determine if \nthe organization violated Federal law.\n  Lastly, I am supporting a bill introduced by Senator Joni Ernst that \nwould prohibit Planned Parenthood, or any of its affiliates, \nsubsidiaries, successors, or clinics, from receiving any Federal funds. \nInstead, funds that are currently offered to Planned Parenthood would \nbe available to other eligible entities to provide women's health care \nservices, including diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-\nchild care, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, and cervical \nand breast cancer screenings.\n  The sanctity of human life is a principle that Congress should \nproclaim at every opportunity. The time has come to respect the wishes \nof the majority of Americans who adamantly oppose using taxpayer \ndollars for abortions by denying Federal funds to these abortion \nproviders.

This morning we \n     are talking about innovation in higher education.\n       Ranking Member Murray and I will each have an opening \n     statement, then we will introduce our panel of witnesses. \n     After our witness testimony, senators will each have 5 \n     minutes of questions.\n       Clark Kerr, the former president of the University of \n     California, wrote in his 2001 book, ``The Uses of the \n     University'' that of 85 human institutions founded before \n     1520 and largely unchanged today--about 70 are universities.\n       As for the other 15 institutions--well, among them are the \n     Catholic Church, and the Isle of Man.\n       Kerr wrote: ``Universities are among the most conservative \n     of all institutions in their methods of governance and \n     conduct and are likely to remain so.''\n       If that's true, maybe we ought to pack up this hearing on \n     innovation in higher education and head home?\n       Let's keep our seats for a minute.\n       The world around the universities is changing--especially \n     the students who attend them.\n       First, there are more people attending.\n       Right around the end of World War II, only about 5% of the \n     population 25 years old and up had earned a college degree.\n       When the first Higher Education Act was signed in 1965, \n     only about 10% of this population had a college degree.\n       Now, about 32% of Americans 25 and up have a college \n     degree.\n       Second, American colleges and universities are now serving \n     the most diverse group of students ever--\n       40% are 25 years or older and come to college with \n     experiences in the workforce.\n       Of the 21 million students in higher education, only one-\n     third are full-time undergraduates under 22 years old.\n       Only 18.9 percent of first-time, full-time students live on \n     a campus and students are increasingly coming from a wide \n     array of backgrounds and are the first in their family to \n     attend college.\n       Third, employers need workers with postsecondary degrees.\n       Labor economist Dr. Anthony Carnevale of Georgetown \n     University tells us, if we don't change the trend, we'll be \n     about 5 million short in 2020 of people who have the proper \n     post-secondary skills.\n       Congress needs to help colleges and universities meet the \n     needs of a growing population of today's students--one that \n     has less time to earn their degree, wants flexibility in \n     scheduling their classes, and needs to start earning an \n     income sooner. And Congress may also need to consider new \n     providers of education that don't fit the traditional mold.\n       I have two questions for today's hearing:\n       First, how can Congress help colleges find new ways to meet \n     students' changing needs, and how can we end practices by the \n     federal government that discourage colleges and universities \n     from innovating?\n       And second, should the federal government be considering a \n     new definition for the college or university? There are many \n     new learning models that are entering the landscape, thanks \n     to the internet. We need to consider what role they play in \n     our higher education system, and whether federal financial \n     aid ought to be available to students who are learning \n     outside our traditional institutions.\n       On the first question, how we can stop discouraging \n     innovation, I want to focus one example of innovation--\n     competency-based learning:\n       One of the most promising innovations that traditional \n     colleges and universities are making is through something \n     called competency-based learning.\n       These competency-based models allow students to progress \n     through their studies as they demonstrate competency, \n     enabling skilled and dedicated students to finish degrees \n     more quickly and often at significantly less cost.\n       For example, a working mom studying at the University of \n     Wisconsin has an associate's degree in nursing and wants to \n     get her Bachelors in Nursing to increase her earning \n     potential. Through the university's new Flexible Option, \n     she's able to earn credits and finish tests and assignments \n     on her own time, including between her shift and her son's \n     baseball game. Because the degree program is based on her \n     ability to demonstrate knowledge of the subjects--rather than \n     her ability to sit through courses twice a week--she might \n     finish a Biology course in 8 weeks, but take only 3 weeks to \n     finish a Mathematics course.\n       But it's possible that government regulations may be \n     stifling this new model of learning.\n       The report by the Task Force on Government Regulation, \n     which was commissioned by a bipartisan group of four Senators \n     on this Committee to examine higher education regulations, \n     told us that ``government regulation is a barrier to \n     innovation.''\n       And in one example, they cited a 2010 Department of \n     Education regulation that established a federal definition of \n     a credit hour as a minimum of 1 hour of classroom instruction \n     and 2 hours of outside work.\n       The government relies upon this definition of ``credit \n     hour'' in determining how to award grants and loans to \n     students.\n       Concerning the credit hour definition, the Task Force wrote \n     ``by relying on the concept of `seat time,' the Department's \n     definition has discouraged institutions from developing new \n     and innovative methods for delivering and measuring \n     education, such as competency-based models which don't rely \n     on credit hours.''\n       When Kentucky Community and Technical College System began \n     a competency-based program in 2009, federal time requirements \n     related to the credit hour, which are building blocks of \n     semesters and academic years, got in the way. Now when \n     students finish within the last 5 weeks of the semester they \n     have to wait till the following semester to continue their \n     studies.\n       In 2005, Congress established a provision in the higher \n     education law for competency-based education known as \n     ``direct assessment.'' This provision permitted programs at \n     colleges and universities to use ``direct assessment of \n     student learning, in lieu of\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\n     measuring student learning in credit hours'' as a way to \n     distribute federal aid. The law said that each program had to \n     be approved by the institution's accreditor and the Secretary \n     of Education.\n       Despite this flexibility granted in the law, accreditors \n     and the Education Department have given approval for \n     receiving financial aid to just 6 institutions to offer one \n     or more of these programs.\n       Shifting gears, a second barrier to innovation may be \n     accreditation.\n       In this committee we have begun looking at the \n     accreditation system, recognizing that it must improve, but \n     that it also may be a barrier to innovation.\n       Accreditation is very old-fashioned in many ways--it is \n     still regional, despite the fact that institutions compare \n     themselves to peers across the country and may have little in \n     common with those in closest proximity.\n       It also hasn't kept up with new ways students are learning \n     and the new ways teachers are teaching. Today, some \n     institutions are modifying a professor's traditional role in \n     teaching and evaluating learning.\n       I'm sure there are many other examples of government \n     discouraging institutions from innovating and I hope our \n     witnesses can speak to some of these and ways to make policy \n     more flexible for innovations to come.\n       On the second point--whether we should consider the role of \n     new providers of higher education:\n       I have said that the American higher education system of \n     today is like the American automobile industry of the 1970s.\n       First, it offers a remarkable number of choices of the best \n     products in the world at a reasonable cost.\n       Second, it is not doing enough about challenges that will \n     require major adjustments if, 20 years from now, it wants to \n     be able to make that same claim of superior choices at a \n     reasonable cost.\n       Like the Japanese auto manufacturers that ultimately \n     brought the American auto industry to its knees for a time, \n     there is an emerging market of new or upstart providers of \n     affordable higher education.\n       These are organizations that aren't necessarily colleges, \n     like we are accustomed to, but are providing higher education \n     that may offer students a similarly high-quality education at \n     a lower cost.\n       For example, students are learning technology, software-\n     coding or product design in as little as 12 weeks at places \n     like General Assembly, a school that hires industry experts \n     from places like Apple and Cisco to teach adult students \n     skills that today's employers value.\n       Or they're taking general education classes like college \n     algebra from online organizations like StraighterLine under a \n     monthly subscription fee with credentialed teachers, or \n     attending a MOOC--a Massive Open Online Course that's free \n     and delivered by professors at many traditional colleges.\n       Some organizations such as Mozilla Foundation are \n     developing open-source ``digital badges'' that allow more \n     types of organizations to identify and recognize an \n     individual's subject matter mastery and competency.\n       But there's no place for any of these innovators in today's \n     Higher Education Act or accreditation system. The definition \n     of what is a college has largely remained consistent since \n     1965.\n       Some senators, the President and Secretary Duncan are \n     interested in understanding how to enable an environment \n     where these new providers of higher education can compete \n     with traditional higher education and potentially offer \n     students a lower cost, high quality education.\n       In 2013, President Obama said in documents accompanying his \n     State of the Union that Congress should consider ``a new \n     system . . . that would provide pathways for higher education \n     models and colleges to receive federal student aid based on \n     performance and results.''\n       What he and others are proposing is that students could use \n     federal aid at these new organizations that aren't \n     traditional colleges.\n       A bill from Senator Lee would allow states to create \n     parallel accreditation pathways to broaden the kinds of \n     classes students could attend while also receiving federal \n     aid. Under the bill, students could receive aid for attending \n     specialized programs, apprenticeships, professional \n     certifications, competency tests, even individual courses. I \n     believe Senators Bennet and Rubio are working on legislation \n     that has a similar goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6128-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE UDALL FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to call attention to a remarkable \nfoundation that has benefited thousands of young Americans. The Morris \nK. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation was established by Congress to \nhonor the public service of the Udall brothers. During the past 20 \nyears, the foundation has effectively leveraged modest Federal \nappropriations into unique learning experiences for over 3,000 young \nAmericans who are committed to public service in natural resources, \nNative nations, and environmental areas.\n  The Udall Foundation has rewarded over 1,400 scholarships to college \nstudents in all 50 States, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, \nGuam, and 44 tribal nations, for their work in public service. One of \nthe distinguished college students receiving a scholarship from the \nUdall Foundation comes from my home State of Florida. Ms. Steffanie \nMunguia is a junior at the University of South Florida and is receiving \na scholarship for her dedication to environmental conservation.\n  Additionally, the Udall Foundation has provided more than 200 \nstudents, from 110 tribal nations, the opportunity to gain practical \nexperience in the Federal legislative process, through their Native \nAmerican Congressional Internship Program.\n  The foundation strives to educate underserved middle school youth to \nthe joys of outdoor exploration through their Parks in Focus program. \nThus far, it has introduced more than 1,500 youth to 22 national parks, \nmonuments, and other natural areas.\n  The Udall Foundation benefits countless groups and many areas of our \nenvironment, and I would like to congratulate them on 20 outstanding \nyears. The foundation has delivered real results for people in every \nState in the Nation since its establishment and has earned our \ncontinued support now and in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6128-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6128-S6129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        USHER SYNDROME AWARENESS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to bring attention to a genetic \ncondition known as Usher syndrome. Usher syndrome is the most common \nform of combined deafness and blindness in the United States, impacting \nas many as 50,000 Americans, not including their families, friends, and \ncommunities. It is estimated that 82 percent of those afflicted by \ndeaf-blindness are unemployed. In the United States, the annual \neconomic cost of blindness alone is estimated at 145 billion dollars.\n  Usher syndrome results when there are mutations in genes that are \nimportant for the function of both photoreceptors in the retina and \nhair cells in the cochlea, or inner ear. To date, 11 genes have been \nidentified that can cause different subtypes of Usher syndrome when \nmutations take place. These mutations usually lead to a deficiency of a \nprotein that is critical for the health and function of the retina and \ncochlea. Usher type 1 individuals are born deaf and then learn, often \nbefore adolescence, that they are also losing their vision. Usher type \n2 individuals are born with moderate to severe hearing loss and then in \nthe prime of their adolescent lives are told that they are losing their \nvision. Usher type 3, usually diagnosed during adolescence, leads to \nthe slow loss of both hearing and vision.\n  Life with Usher syndrome requires constant adaptation to the loss of \nvision, caused by retinitis pigmentosa. First is the loss of peripheral \nvision, when the rods are impacted resulting in the loss of night \nvision and the onset of tunnel vision, which shrinks over time to the \nsize of a pinhole. Once the rods are gone, the cones atrophy. Color \nvision and the ability to read lips are lost, further impacting the \nhearing impaired Usher syndrome individual's ability to communicate \nwith others. Often, central vision fades and the person is left \ncompletely blind.\n  During this time--for which there is no prediction of how long the \ndecline to total blindness will take--individuals with Usher syndrome \nare constantly adapting to remain aurally and visually connected. For \nthe hearing loss, hearing aids, cochlear implants, American Sign \nLanguage, closed captioning, assistive listening devices, and tactile \nsign language are among the adaptive strategies used. For the vision \nloss, glasses, magnification, high contrast on computer screens, screen \nreaders, audio descriptive devices, braille, canes, and guide dogs are \nused to compensate for the increasing blindness.\n  To accelerate research, the Usher Syndrome Coalition is raising \npublic knowledge by launching ``Usher Syndrome Awareness Day'' on the \nthird Saturday in September. The theme centers on the autumnal equinox, \nwhich marks the start of days that contain more darkness than light--a \npowerful metaphor for the threat of Usher syndrome. This will be a \nglobal event that starts on one side of the world--Australia--and runs \naround the globe to the farthest point before the international \ndateline in Alaska.\n  Like many, I too have a personal connection with Usher syndrome. A\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\nformer congressional fellow in my office, Moira Shea, has Usher \nsyndrome. She, with her guide dog by her side, took the Metro and came \nto work every day. In addition, she wore hearing aids, read lips, and \novercame whatever adversity came her way. Today, Moira has lost her \nsight but not her vision--of finding treatments and cures for Usher \nsyndrome so that no other generation has to go through what she and \ntens of thousands of other Americans have.\n  With the acceleration of research, it may be possible for Moira and \nthe thousands of others afflicted by this genetic disease to regain \nsight. The technology is there. The Casey Eye Institute at Oregon \nHealth & Science University has started the first human study of gene \ntherapy for Usher syndrome. I am proud that the first clinical trial \nfor Usher syndrome is being conducted in the state that I am privileged \nto represent.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues to raise awareness about \nthis devastating disease, and I applaud the hard work of the Usher \nSyndrome Coalition to make Usher syndrome research a higher priority at \nthe National Institutes of Health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6129-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF EDWARD ``SANDY'' DAVIS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, along with my colleague, the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Sanders, we wish to honor and \nrecognize Edward ``Sandy'' Davis on his retirement after 36 years of \ndistinguished service to the Congress, including 20 years with the \nCongressional Budget Office and 16 years with the Congressional \nResearch Service. Sandy is held in high esteem by both Republicans and \nDemocrats for his insight, extensive knowledge of the legislative \nprocess, and unfailing graciousness in dealing with Members and staff \nover those many years.\n  Sandy started his career at CRS in 1979 and quickly became an expert \nin Federal budget procedures and practices. He prepared over 150 \nreports and memoranda on the budget process and on budget process \nreform proposals, analyzed and edited draft legislation, and prepared \ncommittee and conference report language on major budget process \nlegislation in 1985, 1987, and 1990. A few of his key achievements \ninvolve the development of two reports that are still being published \ntoday: ``Points of Order under the Congressional Budget Act'' and a \n``Manual on the Federal Budget Process.'' Sandy also coached CRS's \nsoftball team--another key achievement of his time there.\n  In 1995, Sandy joined the Congressional Budget Office, quickly \nemploying his expertise in budget laws and in the history of the \ncongressional budget process. He first worked in the Special Studies \nDivision, where he authored an excellent report on the Line Item Veto \nAct. He then worked in the Projections Unit, where he helped prepare \nCBO's budget projections and continued his work on budget process \nissues; for example, he wrote a section in CBO's January 2003 Budget \nand Economic Outlook entitled ``The Expiration of Budget Enforcement \nProcedures: Issues and Options,'' which has often been cited in \ndiscussions on that topic.\n  Because of his extensive knowledge of the budget and his strong \ninterpersonal skills, in 2003 Sandy was appointed CBO's first associate \ndirector for legislative affairs, to serve as the agency's key liaison \nwith the Congress. In that capacity, he worked closely with many staff \nmembers of the House and Senate--fielding and clarifying questions, \nalerting them about a forthcoming CBO publication, keeping them \napprised about CBO's progress in responding to a particular request, \nresponding to concerns about a CBO analysis, and identifying potential \nCBO products that would aid the legislative process.\n  Sandy's professional accomplishments set him apart, but his personal \nethic--his good cheer and thoughtful consideration of his colleagues at \nCBO and on congressional staffs--truly defines him. Whether giving \nsomeone a ``heads-up'' about a hot-button issue, helping Members or \ncongressional staff track down a cost estimate, or just answering \nquestions about the budget or CBO's analyses, Sandy has always been \ngracious, straightforward, and generous with his time and efforts.\n  In short, over the past 36 years, Sandy exemplified the dedication \nand high-quality work that is so critical to the Senate's \ndeliberations. I know my colleagues join me in extending our thanks and \nappreciation to Sandy for his service to our Nation and our very best \nwishes for a happy and productive retirement.\n  I would like to now turn to my colleague, Senator Sanders, for his \nremarks.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Chairman Enzi and join him in commending Mr. \nDavis for his many years of dedicated and outstanding service to CBO, \nthe Congress, and the American people. We wish him all the best.\n  We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Mr. Davis--and really \nall of the hard-working employees at the Congressional Budget Office--\nfor his and their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6129-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING WAYNE AND KATHY TATMAN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on behalf of Wayne and Kathy \nTatman who will be inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame \nat the 103rd Wyoming State Fair in August. Since 1992, Wyoming has \nrecognized individuals each year who have made substantial \ncontributions to agriculture in our State. This year I have the honor \nof presenting this award to Wayne and Kathy with my colleague Senator \nBarrasso.\n  Wyoming natives, the Tatmans have each contributed greatly to the \nagriculture industry and their home community of Lingle. Both have \nserved as educators for the University of Wyoming Extension, a \nstatewide program helping Wyoming citizens and communities address a \nwide range of issues through education and leadership. Wayne's career \nfocused on production and economic issues while Kathy dedicated her \nefforts to consumers. Gary Stone, an extension educator for the \nUniversity of Nebraska, nominated the couple, and said, ``they truly \nare the 'best of the best' when it comes to Wyoming agriculture.''\n  For more than 30 years, Wayne contributed to the UW Extension program \nworking on livestock and crop production, invasive plants, agricultural \nresearch, and water issues. He worked to promote agriculture to \nWyoming's youth through the 4-H leadership program.\n  Kathy joined the UW Extension Cent$ible Nutrition program in 2000. \nShe focused on nutrition, food safety, and food economics, and worked \nwith low income families to provide nutrition and meal planning. Kathy \nwas also vital in developing a nutrition curriculum for the State of \nWyoming.\n  Former UW President Tom Buchanan commented, ``Wayne and Kathy helped \nliterally hundreds of Wyoming residents understand the impact of \nagriculture on so many facets of life.''\n  The Tatmans passed on their love of agriculture and way of life to \ntheir three sons, all of whom earned agricultural degrees from UW and \nare still involved in the industry. Their legacy extends beyond their \nfamily to their community, and the State as a whole.\n  I am proud to have the opportunity to recognize Wayne and Kathy's \nachievements with Senator Barrasso as 2015 inductees into the Wyoming \nAgriculture Hall of Fame. Wyoming is well served by their lasting and \ncontinuing contributions to agriculture and education in our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6129-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6129-S6130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING SHAUN AND LACEE SIMS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, at the 103rd Wyoming State Fair, Senator \nEnzi and I will have the pleasure of introducing Shaun and Lacee Sims \nas 2015 inductees of the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. I am proud \nto say this dynamic husband and wife team exemplify the ideals of the \nWyoming way of life and have made immense contributions to the State \nand national agricultural community.\n  The Sims family has demonstrated their deep-rooted commitment through \nfive generations of involvement in stewardship of the land and \nproduction of high quality livestock. Shaun and Lacee have shared their \npassion for agriculture as parents, and now as grandparents, with their \nchildren and grandchildren.\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\n  Shaun and Lacee have shared their livelihood with countless local \nstudents who have toured their ranch and wind turbine facility. The \nstudents who visit their ranching operation gain valuable insight into \nthe origin of their food and electricity. In addition to educating \nstudents, the Sims have also taught the teachers by hosting the Wyoming \nAg in the Classroom Teacher Institute. As Amy Hendrickson, executive \ndirector of the Wyoming Wool Growers Association observed, ``They have \nserved as educators, mentors, and leaders on a variety of important \nissues affecting Wyoming's agriculture industry, and their example of \ntrue leadership serves as a model for others.''\n  Shaun and Lacee have served in various capacities whenever they have \nbeen called upon. Shaun's service extends from his 14-year tenure with \nthe Uinta County Conservation District Supervisors to his election on \nthe National Association of Conservation Districts Executive Board. As \npresident of the Wyoming Association of Conservation Districts, Shaun \noften sacrifices valuable time on his home ranch to attend all meetings \nfor Uinta County and the State association. Shaun's dedication to the \nState and the industry has not gone unnoticed. He was recently \nappointed to a second term on the Wyoming Board of Agriculture.\n  Like her husband, Lacee has been an active agricultural advocate in \nWyoming. Lacee received the Masters of Beef Advocacy certification \nthrough the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and was appointed by \nWyoming Governor Matt Mead to serve on the statewide Wyoming Beef \nCouncil. Lacee has combined her passion for agriculture with her \ngrowing photography business to tell the story of agriculture through \nan artistic lens. By highlighting the beauty and importance of Wyoming \nagriculture, she is able to capture in photos what words often fail to \nconvey. Patrick Zimmerer, with the Wyoming Board of Agriculture stated, \n``Lacee tells and advocates the story of Wyoming agriculture through \nher lens as a photographer and through social media, telling and \nhighlighting the importance of Wyoming agriculture to a broad audience \nof followers.''\n  Shaun and Lacee Sims represent every positive attribute of leaders in \nWyoming agriculture.

Mr. President, I honor Dunbarton, NH--a town in \nMerrimack County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in \nrecognizing this special milestone.\n  Dunbarton, previously known by many names, including Starkstown, was \nincorporated in 1765 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth and was \nofficially renamed Dunbarton.\n  The town's population has grown since then to over 2,700 residents. \nWith more than 1,600 acres of protected land, Dunbarton is located on \nthe Merrimack River watershed and is rich in natural beauty. Based upon \nits latitude and longitude, Dunbarton is known as the true center of \nNew England.\n  The patriotism and commitment of the people of Dunbarton is reflected \nin part by their record of service in defense of our Nation. \nRevolutionary War General John Stark, his wife Molly and son Caleb, all \nlived in Dunbarton. Another Dunbarton native was Robert Roger, famed \nCommander of Roger's Rangers during the French and Indian War who was \ninstrumental in developing military tactics still used to this day. \nAdditionally, John Ordway, who helped lead the Lewis and Clark \nExpedition, made his way back home to Dunbarton after the expedition \nhad finished.\n  The spirit of community and volunteerism is strong in Dunbarton as \nevidenced by the hard work and dedication of all involved with the \nplanning and celebration of the annual Old Home Day festival, as well \nas this special sestercentennial anniversary.\n  Dunbarton is a place that has greatly contributed to the life and \nspirit of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards to the \npeople of Dunbarton as they celebrate this special day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6130-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN MURPHY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I congratulate Brian Murphy of \nDover, NH. On May, 29 2015, Brian reached an important career milestone \nby working his 250th National Hockey League playoff game as a linesman.\n  Born on December 13, 1964, Brian has been a lifelong resident of \nDover. He graduated from Dover High School in 1982 and continued his \neducation by attending the University of New Hampshire, where he earned \na degree in business administration in 1986. Brian was then hired by \nthe NHL in September 1988. His first game was on October 7, 1988 \nbetween the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals.\n  Linesmen have a difficult and often thankless job. While referees \nofficiate the game and call penalties, linesmen break up fights between \nplayers, drop the puck for face-offs and have to keep up with the pace \nof the game to make offside calls--all while avoiding interference. \nBrian has excelled in every aspect of his career and is one of only 13 \nU.S. born NHL officials. Most officials who work for the NHL are \nCanadian nationals who have relocated.\n  During Brian's 27 years as an on-ice official, he has worked 1713 \nregular season NHL games and the men's hockey games at the 2010 \nVancouver Winter Olympics. More recently, Brian was selected for the \n7th Stanley Cup Finals between the victorious Chicago Blackhawks and \nthe Tampa Bay Lightning in June of this year.\n  As the former president of the National Hockey League Officials \nAssociation, Brian understands the sacrifices and hard work that are \nnecessary to perform his job. I ask my colleagues to join me today in \ncelebrating Brian's career as a linesman. I am delighted to \ncongratulate him on reaching this important career milestone and I wish \nhim many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6130-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6130-S6131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE ASSOCIATION FOR FACILITIES ENGINEERING\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the Association for Facilities Engineering. The \norganization began in Framingham, MA when Henry ``Harry'' S. Dennison, \npresident of the Factory Managers Association, saw a need for increased \ninformation-sharing within the engineering world. Because of this, \nDennison invited a group of 25 mechanics and engineers from the greater \nBoston area to attend the organization's first informal meeting. On \nJune 9, 1915, the organization's constitution was approved, their \nofficers were elected and they began their history as a working, \nprofessional consortium for engineers and mechanics alike.\n  Years later in 1954, a group of engineering clubs associated with the \norganization came together and changed the organization's name to the \nAmerican Institute of Plant Engineers, AIPE. AIPE became the hub for \ncountless engineering societies in New England and elsewhere, including \nthe New England Chapter of AIPE, comprised of New Hampshire and five \nother States. In May of 1996, AIPE's board of directors voted to change \ntheir name to the Association for Facilities Engineering or AFE, in an \neffort to include more than just plant engineers, and to focus on \nbuildings and facilities as a whole.\n  Wayne Saya of Nashua serves among the leaders and board members of \nAFE. As AFE's executive director, Wayne is personally committed to \nfurthering the message and continued success of the association. He \nbelieves that the chapters of AFE have the best tools for problem \nsolving and often cites his motto during mediations: ``Chapters may not \nalways be right, they are just never wrong!'' His continued advocacy is \na vital tool for engineers, mechanics\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\nand buildings that might not otherwise have a say.\n  AFE is a non-profit, volunteer-based organization that considers the \nwellbeing of its chapters before all else. They recognize that a strong \nrelationship with a chapter can mean more opportunities for all parties \ninvolved. With global reach, AFE is inventive and organized--it is the \nonly association of its kind with a fully paperless online presence.\n  It is because of organizations like AFE that our country can continue \nto excel and innovate, while ensuring the needs of engineers are met. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in congratulating this exceptional \norganization for their unparalleled work and commitment. \nCongratulations to AFE for reaching this important milestone, and best \nwishes for the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6131-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ROGER VICKERS\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the life \nand legacy of Marion County Sheriff Roger Vickers who passed away on \nThursday, July 23, 2015 following a battle with cancer.\n  Sheriff Vickers dedicated his life to law enforcement and protecting \nthe community. With more than three decades of service with the \nArkansas State Police, Sheriff Vickers was well respected in the law \nenforcement community by the time he retired from the State police in \n2008 as lieutenant and assistant troop commander of Troop I in \nHarrison. During his time with the Arkansas State Police, he received \nnumerous commendations, including the Valor Award, the highest honor \nbestowed by the State police.\n  His commitment to Marion County led him to run for sheriff. From the \ntime he was elected in 2008, Sheriff Vickers fought tirelessly to \nimprove his community. He was an advocate for building a new jail and \nhis vision is starting to take shape with the Marion County Quorum \nCourt recently approving purchasing land for the project.\n  Sheriff Vickers was a well-qualified law enforcement officer and also \na true public servant. Prior to his career in law enforcement, he \nserved as a marine during the Vietnam war, earning the Marine Corps \nGood Conduct Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and a Presidential Unit \nCitation.\n  I am greatly appreciative for Sheriff Vickers' lifetime of service \nthroughout the State of Arkansas. My prayers are with his wife Joan, \nand his family and friends during this trying time. I hope they find \ncomfort knowing that he made a positive impact on his \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6131-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AIDAN ANDREWS\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

A bill to maximize discovery, and accelerate development and \navailability, of promising childhood cancer treatments, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Capito \nin the introduction of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, \nAccess, and Research, STAR, Act of 2015. This legislation is an \nextension of ongoing bipartisan efforts in the Senate over the past \ndecade to get us closer to the goal of hopefully one day curing cancers \nin children, adolescents, and young adults. Representatives McCaul, Van \nHollen, and Speier are introducing the companion legislation in the \nother body.\n  I first started working on this issue after meeting the Haight family \nfrom Warwick, RI, in June of 2004. Nancy and Vincent lost their son, \nBen, when he was just 9 years old to neuroblastoma, a very aggressive \ntumor in the brain.\n  The heart-wrenching story of Ben Haight highlights the importance of \nthis legislation. It is my hope that one day Ben's story, and thousands \nof other children like him, will be one of survival. With the strong \nsupport of families like the Haights for increased research into the \ncauses of childhood cancers and improved treatment options, I \nintroduced bipartisan legislation that eventually was signed into law \nin 2008 as the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act.\n  This was an important step. Yet, more work remains. With the STAR \nAct, we would take the next needed steps to advance pediatric cancer \nresearch and child-focused cancer treatments, while also improving \nchildhood cancer surveillance and providing resources for survivors and \nthose impacted by childhood cancer.\n  If a treatment is working, doctors elsewhere should know immediately. \nThe same should happen if a treatment isn't working, or if other major \nmedical events occur during the course of a particular treatment. It is \ncritical that doctors, nurses, and other providers are able to \neffectively communicate information about the disease, the treatment \nprocess, and what other health and development impacts children can \nexpect to experience.\n  As such, the STAR Act reauthorizes the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer \nChildhood Cancer Act to help create a comprehensive children's cancer \nbiorepository for researchers to use in searching for biospecimens to \nstudy and would improve surveillance of childhood cancer cases.\n  Additionally, this legislation includes provisions dealing with \nissues that arise for survivors of childhood cancer. Unfortunately, \neven after beating cancer, as many as two-thirds of childhood cancer \nsurvivors are likely to experience at least one late effect of \ntreatment; as many as one-fourth experience a late effect that is \nserious or life-threatening, including second cancers and organ damage.\n  We must do more to ensure that children survive cancer and any late \neffects so they can live a long, healthy, and productive life. This \nlegislation would enhance research on the late effects of childhood \ncancers, improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are \nbetter able to care for this population as they age, and establish a \nnew pilot program to begin to explore improved models of care for \nchildhood cancer survivors.\n  This legislation also provides some clarity for patients and their \nphysicians attempting to access new drugs and therapies from \npharmaceutical companies. When a patient has run out of other options, \nthe last thing they and their families need is to spend months being \ngiven the run-around trying to access a potential treatment.\n  Lastly, this bill will ensure more pediatric expertise at the \nNational Institutes of Health to better leverage the research \ninvestment to improve pediatric cancer research by requiring the \ninclusion of at least one pediatric oncologist on the National Cancer \nAdvisory Board and improving childhood health reporting requirements to \ninclude pediatric cancer.\n  I am pleased that the Childhood Cancer STAR Act has the support of \nthe American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, St. Baldrick's \nFoundation, and Children's Oncology Group, among others. I look forward \nto working with these and other stakeholders, as well as Senator Capito \nto urge the rest of our colleagues to join us in supporting this \ncrucial legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, Mr. Brown, \n        Ms. Baldwin, Mr. King, and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 1884.

A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to improve coal \nroyalties, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to stand up for fairness \nby introducing legislation with my Senate colleague, Senator Tom Udall \nof New Mexico, to ensure American taxpayers receive the full value of \ncoal produced on public lands.\n  The Coal Royalty Fairness Act would require the Interior Department \nto collect royalties for coal mined on Federal lands based on the \nactual market value of coal. This bill is based on current successful \npractices in Montana--the Nation's second largest Federal coal-\nproducing State. Currently, some private mining companies sell coal to \ntheir own affiliated companies at a lower cost than market value, and \npay Federal royalties based on the cheaper, first point of sale.\n  American taxpayers are getting ripped off by coal companies under the \ncurrent, broken coal royalties system. I raised concerns about this 2 \nyears ago, and today, Senator Udall and I are introducing legislation \nto get the public every penny owed by companies that may be taking \nadvantage of a loose system. Instead of subsidizing private coal \ncompanies, it is time to put this money back where it belongs--into \nrural communities and the pockets of taxpayers.\n  Our bill will require the Interior Department to collect royalties \nbased on the actual market value of coal, not the below-market price \nthey charge their own companies.\n  Our bill will also bring some much-needed transparency to the Federal \ncoal program by requiring the Interior Department to publish more \ninformation and calling for Government Accountability Office to review \nthe program every 3 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Udall and me by cosponsoring and \nultimately passing this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1891\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide short-term water supplies to drought-\nstricken California; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nhistoric drought that is devastating California and much of the West \nand to introduce the California Emergency Drought Relief Act along with \nSenator Boxer.\n  The toll on some of our most vulnerable communities is mounting.\n  As of July, 2,091 wells are already dry or will soon run out of \nwater. This puts more than 10,000 people in jeopardy.\n  Rural and disadvantaged communities are some of the hardest hit.\n  Just this month, the Washington Post reported that arsenic had been \nfound in wells serving St. Anthony's mobile home park in the Coachella \nValley at twice the safe concentration.\n  In Porterville, Californians are bathing themselves with bottled \nwater.\n  California is also suffering a massive loss of agriculture \nproduction.\n  A study from UC Davis estimates that farmers will fallow 563,000 \nacres in 2015, a 35 percent increase from last year when farmers \nfallowed 410,000 acres.\n  The State's agriculture sector stands to lose $1.8 billion in direct \nagricultural costs this year, on top of $1.5 billion last year.\n  The San Joaquin Valley is at the epicenter of the drought, and the \npossible damage to our nation's food supply is dire.\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n  The Valley is home to 90 percent of the country's tomatoes, 74 \npercent of our lettuce, and 95 percent of our broccoli. The drought's \neffects on the Valley will extend far beyond California's borders.\n  But the devastating consequences of this drought aren't limited to a \nsingle region.\n  UC Davis also reports that California's economy will lose an \nestimated $2.7 billion in 2015, along with 18,600 jobs.\n  That is on top of $2.2 billion last year and 17,100 jobs lost.\n  Effects on the environment are also destructive.\n  Groundwater reserves in underground aquifers are being depleted, \nwhich is causing the surrounding land to sink.\n  Delta smelt are at their lowest levels since surveys first began in \n1959, while Chinook salmon are imperiled by warmer water in the \nSacramento River.\n  Saltwater from the San Francisco Bay threatens to contaminate \nfreshwater in the Delta, imperiling an entire ecosystem, not to mention \nthe ill effects on drinking water supplies and farmland.\n  Finally, we can't ignore the increasing threat of wildfires. Since \nJanuary 1, the U.S. Forest Service reports more than 5,000 fires have \nburned on state and federal lands, a 10 percent increase over last \nyear.\n  Despite the high likelihood of a strong El Nino this year, one wet \nseason won't fix the problems. Experts estimate that California needs \nat least three above-average precipitation years to cover the current \n37 million acre-foot deficit.\n  Doing nothing is simply not an option.\n  In drafting the bill we're introducing today, we started with the \nbill that unanimously passed the Senate in 2014.\n  We then modified that bill, adding significant environmental \nprotections and removing controversial provisions.\n  We also included a range of provisions to protect and restore \nthreatened and endangered species, as well as a number of programs to \nsupport long-term infrastructure projects like desalination, water \nrecycling and storage.\n  My staff and I have taken dozens of meetings since January.\n  We have met with Congressional Republicans and Democrats, \nenvironmental groups, water districts, and State and local officials.\n  My California staff has visited water projects throughout the State \nto collect ideas, and my staff in Washington has consulted closely with \nFederal agencies to ensure the bill adheres to environmental law.\n  By releasing a bill this summer, months before the rainy season, \nCongress and the public will have ample time to review, debate and, \nwhere necessary, suggest improvements.\n  I expect the bill will receive a committee hearing, allowing every \nmember of Congress and the public to weigh in.\n  Let me briefly discuss how this bill will help.\n  Federal policy will be most effective if it is aligned with the \nState's goals and the State water bond.\n  This means expanding Federal efforts to include long-term solutions \nsuch as desalination, recycling and storage. We also must look at ways \nto help communities that are running out of water.\n  To help those communities, the bill includes a new program to assist \nareas that have suffered the brunt of the drought, communities like \nPorterville and others in Tulare County.\n  Providing emergency supplies like bottled water is a no-brainer, but \nit is a short-term fix.\n  We need to look beyond this emergency at ways we can shift these \ncommunities from vulnerable water sources like wells to more \nsustainable and resilient water systems.\n  We also need to take a close look at desalination and water \nrecycling. These are two of the most promising technologies that may \noffer long-term solutions.\n  The bill identifies 26 desalination projects capable of producing \nmore than 330,000 acre-feet of water.\n  It also identifies 105 recycling projects with the potential to \nproduce about 854,000 acre-feet of water.\n  That is a total of 1.2 million acre-feet of clean water per year, \nenough for 2.4 million households.\n  But these projects aren't cheap. That is why the bill funds a loan-\nguarantee program and other financing mechanisms to help make these \nprojects a reality.\n  Another area we should focus on is storage. This drought has showed \nthat our reservoir capacity is insufficient.\n  Given the consensus that droughts will grow more severe, we have to \nincrease how much water we can hold from wet to dry years.\n  The bill positions the Federal Government as a partner with \nCalifornia to build new reservoirs and expand existing reservoirs.\n  Conservation and groundwater recharge are two more promising areas. \nWhile cities and towns are doing their part, the bill also identifies \nareas where the Federal, state and local governments and the ag sector \ncan do more.\n  Finally, the Federal Government can play a significant role in \nsupporting research on promising technologies, from recapturing energy \nand improving membranes used in desalination to developing strategies \nto minimize environmental effects of smart-water strategies.\n  The bill also includes a number of short-term, low-cost proposals to \nprotect and assist in the recovery of fish populations, including \nsalmon and smelt.\n  This includes authorizations to implement the Endangered Species Act \nrecovery plan for salmon; trap-and-barge fish and address predator \nspecies, two ways to reduce mortality rates; create additional spawning \nhabitat for endangered and threatened species; and improving how water \nsystems are managed using the latest science and technology.\n  The bill's short-term provisions build on legislation that \nunanimously passed the Senate in 2014, with added protections for \nenvironmental and water rights and the removal of several provisions to \naddress environmental concerns.\n  The bill's short-term provisions will help move water efficiently to \nthose areas where it is most needed.\n  Let me be clear--this language was carefully drafted to remain \nconsistent with environmental laws, including the Endangered Species \nAct and the Clean Water Act, as well as all biological opinions.\n  Here are some examples of how the short-term section works.\n  First, by operating the water systems with more precision, we will be \nable to monitor for endangered species like the Delta Smelt and adjust \npumping levels to avoid harming fish. By doing this, more water can be \nmoved to the communities that need it while protecting endangered and \nthreatened species.\n  The bill also directs agencies to open the Cross-Channel Gates on the \nSacramento River during times when salmon are not migrating. This would \nallow thousands of acre feet of water to be moved without harming fish \nor water quality.\n  For water transfers in the Delta--where water sellers and buyers can \nhelp get water where it's needed--we included many additional \nprotections. Every transfer will be reviewed to ensure it is consistent \nwith environmental laws. The transfers, which can only occur in April \nand May, must include only additional water pumped into the Delta on \ntop of the regular river flow.\n  Moving water more efficiently will help supply water to millions of \nCalifornians in urban areas, from Silicon Valley to Southern \nCalifornia.\n  It will also increase water allocations for family farms in the San \nJoaquin Valley. More than 15,000 small farms served by the Friant Water \nAuthority--with an average size of just 83 acres--would benefit.\n  I have introduced many bills during my years in the Senate, and this \nmay be the most difficult.\n  Nevertheless, the goal has remained constant: a bill that can get \nsigned into law that benefits all regions of the State.\n  Congress worked together after Hurricanes Katrina ravaged the Gulf \nCoast and Hurricane Sandy devastated the East Coast.\n  I think we now have a bill that will help the West survive this \nhistoric drought.\n  I look forward to a committee hearing on this bill and to public \ninput to make it even better.\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1895. A bill to amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act for \npurposes of making claims under such Act based on exposure to \natmospheric nuclear testing; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA, by adding \nMohave County, AZ, to the list of counties eligible for downwinder \ncompensation. A similar proposal was introduced today by Congress Paul \nGosar. I am hopeful this bill will help close a painful chapter for \nthose Arizonans who were arguably the most affected by nuclear weapons \ntesting during the Cold War.\n  In 1990, Congress enacted the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to \ncompensate victims or their survivors who suffered certain illnesses \ncaused by fallout exposure ``down wind'' of atmospheric nuclear weapons \ntesting during the 1950's and 1960's. Among other requirements, \neligibility is limited to individuals who can prove their physical \npresence in one of several affected counties. Astonishingly, despite \nits close proximity to the Nevada Test Site, the original RECA law and \nits subsequent amendments never listed Mohave County proper as an \naffected area. I believe the people of Mohave County deserve to see \nrighted this unjust policy which has obstructed their ability to \nqualify for compensation.\n  I understand that several of my colleagues have proposed similar RECA \namendments in previous years. I would hope that these various RECA \nproposals give additional consideration to an April 2005 report by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, NAS, that assessed, among other things, \nwhether additional geographic areas should be added to the RECA \nprogram. The NAS study revealed a much wider area of radioactive \nfallout then originally identified when the RECA law was first written. \nThe report also recommended replacing the geographic area criteria with \na new science-based process for determining compensation eligibility, a \nmethod similar to what's used in the Radiation Exposed-Veterans \nCompensation Act and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act. I believe it is worthwhile for policy makers \nto consider the recommendations of the NAS report.\n  This bill is an expansion of the RECA program and thus I will be \nworking with my colleagues to find funding offsets to ensure there is \nno net increase in government spending if this legislation were \nenacted. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/29/senate-section/article/S6143-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 234--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRINTING OF A COLLECTION OF THE \n                 RULES OF THE COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BLUNT submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.
