Madam President, last week, the Republican-led Senate \npassed two more appropriations bills by a large bipartisan majority. \nBoth bills passed out of committee with unanimous support, were subject \nto hours of debate and deliberation, and included the input of both \nDemocratic and Republican Senators.\n  The first appropriations measure, for transportation and housing \ninfrastructure, will help ensure air travel is safer and more \nefficient, invest in important infrastructure, and strengthen America's \nsurface transportation network.\n  As Senator Collins pointed out last week, this bill includes \n``recommendations from more than 75 Senators from both sides of the \naisle'' as well as more than three dozen amendments. I thank my friend \nfrom Maine for her skilled leadership and hard work with Ranking Member \nReed of Rhode Island and colleagues from both sides to advance this \nmeasure.\n  The second funding measure, for veterans and military construction, \nwill ensure that veterans receive benefits and health care they have \nearned while enhancing oversight and accountability at the VA, helping \nimprove quality of life on military bases for soldiers and their \nfamilies, and advancing critical national security projects like \nmissile defense. As Senator Kirk noted last week, this bill \nincorporates over two dozen amendments, both from Democrats and \nRepublicans. Senator Kirk is a true champion for veterans. I know he \nalways had the needs of our heroes top of mind as he worked with \nDemocrats, with Republicans, and in particular with Ranking Member \nTester of Montana to move this critical bill forward.\n  By returning to regular order and working through the appropriations \nprocess, we have been able to pass appropriations measures like these \nthat support national priorities in a responsible way.\n  I also appreciate Senators working toward a compromise approach for \nZika. Preventing the spread of Zika is a priority for all of us, and I \nam pleased the Senate has approved a compromise provision to focus \nresources on this important health issue. We have now begun discussions \non how best to resolve the differences between the House and the Senate \nand get a bill to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3039-5"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3039-S3040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATION COMBATING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND HELPING \n                              ITS VICTIMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on an important issue the Senate will \naddress today, the Republican-led Senate believes in the importance of \ncombating sexual assault and providing key protections for the victims \nof these heinous crimes. In less than 18 months, we have already passed \nmany different measures to help victims and to help stop these crimes. \nWe passed the Amy and Vicky act, which will help the victims of child \npornography to get restitution from those who profit from their pain. \nAnd because we know the pain doesn't end when these images are \nproduced, it can help victims find the closure they need and deserve \ntoo.\n  We passed an important measure championed by Senator Toomey, who \nworked with Senator Alexander to include in the K-12 education reform \nbill a requirement that States put laws and policies in place to help \nensure schools are no longer able to ship child predators to other \nschool districts.\n  We passed a measure from Senator Portman, who worked with Senator \nMcCaskill to hold an infamous child sex-trafficking company in contempt \nand force it to turn over critical information--information that is \nneeded for their bipartisan human trafficking investigation to \ncontinue.\n  And, of course, we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. \nThe victims of modern slavery deserve justice, and they deserve a \nvoice, which is why--after years of previous inaction--the new \nRepublican-led Senate made it a priority to pass this important anti-\nslavery bill. Of course, it is now law.\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\n  This week we have two more opportunities to protect victims. The \nfirst, contained in a provision within the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, is the End Modern Slavery Initiative Act. This \neffort would address human trafficking beyond our borders with tools to \nhelp end the scourge of modern slavery worldwide. I thank Senator \nCorker for his work on this measure.\n  The second, the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act, will bolster efforts \nto prevent future sexual assault crimes and help victims receive \njustice. We will pass that one today.\n  One group dedicated to combating trafficking noted its strong support \nfor this ``vital'' legislation, which it calls ``essential to the fight \nagainst child sex trafficking.'' The Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act has \nalso received the support of the Nation's largest anti-sexual violence \norganization, RAINN, along with organizations such as the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  I have been involved with the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children since its inception and have had the privilege of \nworking closely with the organization over the years. Protecting \nchildren and bringing justice to victims have been top priorities of \nmine for many years. I have long worked with John Walsh, Adam's father, \nto advance efforts to do so. I supported the original Adam Walsh Child \nProtection and Safety Act in 2006 in order to enhance law enforcement's \nability to track sexual offenders and improve its information-sharing \ncapabilities and to support resources to aid in the apprehension of \nfugitives who commit these offenses. It is an important law, but the \nauthorization for it expired in 2011.\n  It was disheartening to watch reauthorization legislation languish in \nthe Senate and in the Judiciary Committee for years, but then Chairman \nGrassley came along. Not only did he work to reauthorize the bill, he \nworked to make it stronger, with additional rights and protections for \nvictims of sexual assault and human trafficking crimes.\n  As he has done with other priorities, Chairman Grassley realized the \nurgency of moving this reauthorization forward and then worked \ndiligently to advance it. It is just another example of his efforts to \nput the Judiciary Committee to work for the American people.\n  Under a new chairman, the Judiciary Committee has reported out some \n30 bills and has seen more than a dozen signed into law. Time and \nagain, the committee has taken on important issues and worked toward \nreal solutions for our country. We saw a great example of that recently \nwith Chairman Grassley's efforts to help combat the heroin and \nprescription opioid epidemic that is hurting so many communities across \nour country. States like mine have been especially impacted by this \ndrug crisis. I appreciated the steadfast commitment of colleagues like \nChairman Grassley, along with key Senators like Portman and Ayotte, to \naddress the issue and ensure Senate passage of the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act.\n  Chairman Grassley has worked hard to pass other pieces of legislation \nas well, such as a law to protect American innovation in the 21st \ncentury, for instance, and the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \nthat I mentioned earlier. Without Chairman Grassley's commitment in \ncommittee and Senator Cornyn's relentless efforts on the floor, that \nimportant trafficking bill would not have become law. So it is clear \nthat Senator Grassley has led the Judiciary Committee with a renewed \nfocus on providing hope and providing a voice to those in need. We have \njust the latest examples of his commitment in the bill before us today.\n  I commend Chairman Grassley for his strong leadership, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me today in supporting this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3039-6"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARVIN SIMMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on one final matter, I want to close \nby saying a few words about Marvin Simms, who will be retiring from the \nSenate Recording Studio this month after three decades of service.\n  Marvin was one of about a dozen original staffers brought on to help \nshoot the first ever live, gavel-to-gavel broadcast of the Senate \nfloor. He has since become a real pro at capturing the best angles of \nthis Chamber. For Marvin, getting there meant studying up on Senate \nprocedure and teaching himself to instantly recognize a rotating cast \nof 100 different names and faces, an impressive feat in itself. His \ncareer includes a number of historical milestones, from Presidential \ninaugurations and gold medal ceremonies to Supreme Court nominations \nand the occasional all-night filibuster. I am told he is now looking \nforward to having a little more time to focus on his family.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate family, I thank Marvin for his many \nyears of dedicated public service and wish him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3040-1"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last Friday, as he should, President Obama \ngave the Nation an update on the fight against Zika, this virus that \nhas become such a difficult issue to face.\n  Here are the facts, as outlined by President Obama and reported by \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: As we speak, there are \nmore than 500 confirmed cases of Zika in the continental United States. \nThere are at least 800 confirmed cases of infection in Puerto Rico, and \nmost experts believe the actual number is significantly higher. There \nare 279 pregnant women in the continental United States and territories \nwho are being monitored for possible Zika infection. We have yet to \nconfirm any local transmission from Zika-carrying mosquitoes in the \ncontinental United States.\n  Remember, we have had an unseasonably cold spring. That means that a \nmosquito with Zika has not yet infected anyone on the mainland. But the \npublic health experts tell us that is going to change as soon as it \nwarms up, and it is nearing the warmup time now. It is only when the \nwarm weather hits that the mosquitoes become active, and they really \nbecome active. These pests are capable of transmitting Zika and are in \n39 States. Residents of our Nation's most populated cities--such as New \nYork, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston--could be at risk of infection.\n  This map says it all. There are some places where there is only one \ntype of mosquito, and, of course, the worst is the blue, as shown on \nthe map. But there are places where there is a mixture of mosquitoes.\n  There are two kinds of mosquitoes that cause a problem. It is spread \nto people primarily through the body of an infected mosquito. But look \nwhere it goes--from Maine to Texas, even reaching into Northern \nCalifornia, Las Vegas, and we see red up there, in Boulder, CO. So it \nis a concern, a real concern.\n  For pregnant women, contracting Zika could mean devastating birth \ndefects for their children, as we know, with these tiny little heads \nand underdeveloped brains and collapsed skulls.\n  For others, the dangers of Zika range from possible nervous system \ndisorders and potential paralysis to minor symptoms such as rashes and \nfever like the flu. This is the threat that Republicans in Congress \nhave been ignoring for many months now.\n  Back in February--we are fast approaching June. In February, \nPresident Obama sent an emergency appropriations request to Congress \nfor almost $2 billion--$1.9 billion is the exact figure--to fight Zika. \nIt wasn't some number that he picked out of a hat. This is a figure \nthat researchers, public health experts, and doctors explicitly \nrequested, and $1.9 billion is what our country needs. That is the \nnumber that I support and Democrats support. Anything less than that is \nsimply not enough.\n  Republicans did nothing in response to the President's request, \nletting weeks and weeks go by as the number of infected Americans grew. \nBecause of Republicans' refusal to allocate Zika funding, President \nObama had to act. He did the only thing he could do: He used $510 \nmillion in Ebola money to fight the spread of Zika.\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\n  It was 18 months ago that we were first hit with the Ebola scare. It \nwas a scare--and rightfully so. We were panicked about Ebola. Americans \nhad been infected with this awful disease. But the only thing we could \ndo was to do more to find out how we could stop it with a vaccine and \nwith other treatments. It takes money to do that. But to take more than \nhalf a billion dollars of Ebola money and fight the spread of Zika is \ntaking from Peter to pay Paul.\n  What choice did President Obama have? They were ignoring his pleas \nfor help. Now that they can no longer ignore Zika, Republicans in \nCongress are reluctantly going through the motions of providing \nfunding. As my friend the Republican leader said, we have taken care of \nZika here on the floor--how wrong, how misleading. The Senate agreed to \nprovide $1.1 billion--about half of what President Obama requested. But \neveryone knows that is not going to do the trick because that money is \nnot going to be coming until sometime this fall.\n  To make matters worse, the Senate-passed $1.1 billion package would \ndo nothing to pay back the Ebola money. It would pay back a tiny \nfraction of the $510 million in Ebola funds that are so necessary to \ncontinue the work on Ebola. The Senate's $1.1 billion is also wrapped \nup in the appropriations process.\n  Appropriations bills take months to get done. By the time it gets to \nthe President's desk, it will be fall. We will know by then how much \ndamage has been done because of the Republicans' inability and refusal \nto help us with that money. The American people should not have to wait \nthat long. That is why Senate Democrats have repeatedly come to the \nfloor and asked that we move to a Zika funding package as a stand-alone \nbill, separating from the very slow and tedious appropriations process. \nBut each time, Republican leadership has objected. Senate Republicans \ndon't want to expedite the issue. They would prefer that our response \nto Zika be wrapped up in a drawn-out appropriations process. Our Nation \ncannot afford the unnecessary delay.\n  House Republicans could not even pass a budget. Now we are depending \non them to pass an appropriations bill before we do anything on Zika. \nThey don't have a budget. These are the same House Republicans who last \nweek passed legislation to give President Obama a third--$622 million--\nof what the President asked. In fact, it is a little less than a third. \nGuess what. Guess where they are going to get that money. They are \ngoing to take it by raiding more Ebola money. Our Nation has spent the \nlast 2 years fighting Ebola. But although we have been successful in \nresponding to Ebola, it remains a threat. We do not have the ability to \nhandle that disease.\n  Last week, the White House reported that CDC officials in West Africa \nare processing 10,000 new Ebola samples a month. We can't afford to \ndrop our guard on Ebola. That is what the Republicans are telling us to \ndo. If we take these funds away from our Nation's response to the Ebola \nvirus and we use them instead to underfund our response to Zika, we are \nensuring that our defenses against both are inadequate. That is \nirresponsible and terribly dangerous.\n  I don't understand the Republicans' refusal to take Zika seriously. \nWhy do they refuse to listen to the experts who tell us they need the \nfull $1.9 billion to be able to fight this devastating virus? It is as \nif the Republicans are betting that Zika will not be a disaster--like \nthe horse race we had in Baltimore on Saturday. This is not a bet. It \nis as if they are betting against all the experts at the CDC and NIH \nwho say the Zika virus is a real threat to Americans. They are saying \nit is a real threat to Americans because it is. Instead of gambling \nwith the health and safety of millions of Americans, Republicans should \ngive our Nation the money it needs to fight Zika, and they should do it \nnow--not next month, not in the fall but now.\n  As the President said on Friday, we in Congress should not leave for \nthe Memorial Day break without having taken care of this issue. He is \nso right. We have been on record for weeks saying the same thing. We \ndon't need more time off. We already hold the record for working less \ntime. This Senate is working less time than any Congress in the last \nsix or seven decades. We don't need more time off. So next week, rather \nthan taking some time off, let's get the legislation to the White House \nappropriating that money.\n  We have time to get out ahead of Zika, but we need to do it now. That \nwindow is rapidly closing by the day. Let's work together and do it \nnow--Democrats and Republicans--to give our Nation the tools it needs \nto keep the American people safe from the virus. Right now, we are not \nsafe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3040-3"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARVIN SIMMS\n\n  Mr. REID.

He has \nbeen involved in so many of the things I have done in the last 30 \nyears. We started here about the same time.\n  When Marvin began, it was then called the Senate television crew. It \nwas a much smaller operation than it is now. As the Senate evolved in \nthe age of 24-hour press and media--and so much going on with the \nInternet also--so did his job. Over his three decades in the Senate, \nMarvin gained more and more responsibility, culminating in his position \ntoday as the broadcast production director. Marvin has worked on many \nof my television interviews, and he did a superb job.\n  I wish Marvin and his family the best in his retirement. He is an \navid friend of NASA, our national agency that does so much in space and \nall things related to space. He is an avid fan. I hope he will use the \nextra time he has in retirement ``to boldly go where no man has gone \nbefore.''\n  For all you who don't know what I am saying, if you know anything \nabout Star Trek, you will realize this is a phrase from the show's \nopening sequence.\n  Marvin, go boldly where no man has gone before. Thank you very much \nfor your good work.\n  The floor appears to be empty, Madam President.

Madam President, 8 years ago reckless bankers on Wall \nStreet sparked a financial meltdown. Their too-big-to-fail banks \ngambled with our economy, encouraging reckless mortgage lending by \nfunding the slimy subprime lenders who peddled their miserable products \nto millions of American families. Those same banks then gobbled up \nthose dangerous mortgages, repackaged them, and spread huge risks \nthroughout the financial system.\n  The consequences were disastrous. Wall Street greed destroyed $7 \ntrillion in housing wealth and resulted in millions of Americans losing \ntheir homes. It killed 8.7 million American jobs. It gutted hundreds of \npension funds, leaving millions of retirees hung out to dry.\n  Thanks to Washington bailouts, Wall Street is once again flying high. \nCorporate profits are up, and the stock market is soaring. But the real \npeople who were hurt by the financial collapse--the millions of workers \nwho lost their jobs, lost their homes, and lost their retirement \nsavings because of\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nWall Street's reckless greed--many of them haven't bounced back. The \nevidence of this is everywhere, but consider just one recent example. \nEarlier this month, 400,000 participants in the Central States Pension \nFund narrowly escaped having their hard-earned pension benefits slashed \nby as much as 70 percent. Their benefits were on the chopping block \nbecause that fund is in terrible trouble. There are a lot of reasons \nwhy, but one reason is beyond dispute: Wall Street greed.\n  The story is ugly. In the runup to the financial collapse, Goldman \nSachs and Northern Trust were in charge of managing the Central States \nPension Fund and making its investment decisions. Instead of doing what \nwas best for workers and retirees, these financial giants invested \nthose retirement savings in junk bonds and mortgage bonds issued by \nfirms whose names today would fill a Wall Street Hall of Shame: Bear \nStearns, Countrywide, IndyMac, and Lehman Brothers.\n  The crash of 2008 hit the Central States Pension Fund like a shiv in \nthe ribs. In 15 months in 2008 and early 2009, pension assets managed \nby Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust dropped by 42 percent. That is more \nthan twice the losses suffered by other multi-employer pension funds. \nAnd to add salt to the wound--the part that really twists the knife \nhere--from 2005 to 2009, Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust charged \nCentral States $41 million for the privilege of managing and wrecking \ntheir retirement fund.\n  Last month the Treasury Department rejected pension cuts to the \nCentral States Pension Fund for the short term and bought these \nretirees some time. But this story isn't over. Unless the Senate acts, \nthis pension plan will collapse within 10 years. Unless the Senate \nacts, hundreds of thousands of retirees whose pensions are currently on \nlife support will lose those pensions entirely.\n  Tomorrow the Republicans, who control the Senate, are ready to act. \nTomorrow they will bring a pension bill to the floor. Is it a bill to \nhelp save the 400,000 men and women of the Central States Pension Fund \nwhose futures were decimated through no fault of their own? On that \ntopic, the Republicans have nothing to say. Instead, the Republicans \nare bringing up a bill to make it easier--easier--for giant Wall Street \nfinancial institutions to cheat Americans out of their retirement \nsavings.\n  The Senate will be voting to make it easier for shady financial \ninstitutions and unscrupulous financial advisers to mislead investors \nabout the quality of the investments so those advisers can continue \npushing lousy products, just like the junk bonds and mortgage funds \nthat tanked the Central States pension plan. The Senate will be voting \non whether to overturn the commonsense regulations the Department of \nLabor completed last month to protect Americans' hard-earned retirement \nsavings from slick-talking advisers who push complicated products that \ngive great payoffs to the advisers and terrible results for their \ncustomers.\n  Here is the problem: Because of loopholes in the law, it has long \nbeen perfectly legal for investment advisers to push products that \ndrain away customer savings while they generate high fees, free \nvacations, cars, bonuses, and kickbacks for the advisers. These \nconflicts cost American families an estimated $17 billion every year. \nThe new commonsense rule would put a stop to these practices. It is a \npretty simple rule. It would ensure that financial advisers have to \nrecommend products that are in the customers' best interests. No more \npushing products just to generate high fees and payments for the \nadvisers. No more free vacations. No more kickbacks. Why would anyone \non Earth vote to overturn a rule designed to protect Americans from \nfinancial fraud? Why? Because it is an election year, so Senators and \nCongressmen have their hands out, willing to take every dime of Wall \nStreet money they can get. Killing this new rule will cost American \nfamilies $17 billion a year in lost retirement savings, but it will \nsure help to fill up the campaign accounts of the Republican Senators \nwho vote for it. In the meantime, the clock keeps ticking for hundreds \nof thousands of Central States retirees, and the Republicans refuse to \ndo anything.\n  The Republicans who control the Senate may think that tomorrow's vote \nwill help their fundraising efforts. Even so, I will be voting no \nbecause we weren't sent here just to raise money for reelections. We \nweren't sent here to make money for Wall Street and their armies of \nlobbyists and lawyers. We weren't sent here to reward the too-big-to-\nfail banks that tanked our economy and then got billions of dollars in \nbailouts. We weren't sent here to make it easier for financial \ninstitutions to cheat people. The Republicans who run the Senate seem \nto have forgotten that. If they don't remember it soon, you can bet the \nAmerican people will remind them in November.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3041-4"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3042-S3043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know President Obama is visiting \nVietnam. I want to speak briefly about that, but I also want to comment \nabout the contribution many Vietnamese Americans are making in the \nUnited States and particularly back home in Texas. They demonstrate the \nvividness and the life of the pursuit of the American dream because \nthese are some of the most accomplished people in our communities back \nin Texas.\n  Many people don't realize how big of a Vietnamese community Texas \nhas. Many are surprised when I tell them that Vietnamese is the third \nmost commonly spoken language in Texas. Admittedly, English, even Texas \nEnglish, is No. 1 and then obviously Spanish, with 38 percent of our \npopulation of Hispanic origin--but it is still a sizable, vibrant part \nof our State and our communities.\n  I have been particularly impressed by the passion and drive of those \nfrom Vietnam who have now made America their home--how passionate they \nare about things we perhaps take for granted, such as the same freedoms \nwe enjoy here that folks back in Vietnam do not enjoy.\n  As a matter of fact, it is important to remember, even as President \nObama is traveling to Vietnam, that Vietnam is a brutal Communist \nregime that continues to disregard basic human rights. Sure, our \neconomic relationships could bear fruit--and in fact I am encouraged by \nthat and would encourage that--but we cannot forget that, at bottom, \nthe regime is Communist, and it disregards basic human rights.\n  I expect a lot of the conversations the President is having with the \ngovernment will focus on our common threats in the Pacific, \nparticularly the rise and belligerence of China, particularly in the \nSouth China Sea. I am sure it will focus on the need for more robust \neconomic relationships and perhaps the benefits of trade agreements \nlike the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I agree economics and trade are important, but we can't let the \nprospect of greater economic ties dampen our convictions as a \ndemocratic nation to encourage greater freedoms for the Vietnamese \npeople. Recently, Reporters Without Borders ranked Vietnam 175th out of \n180 countries worldwide when it comes to freedom of the media--175th \nout of 180.\n  Unfortunately, the regime does not fare any better when it comes to \nreligious liberty either. The truth is, our two countries will never \nachieve the kind of close relationship that I know many in Vietnam and \nmany in the United States aspire to until Vietnam releases all \npolitical prisoners, demonstrates basic respect for human rights, and \nembraces self-government ideals that we again take for granted in \nAmerica.\n  I believe that until that happens, the United States has no choice \nbut to continue to hold Vietnam at arm's length. That means we must do \nall we can to put pressure on the regime to strengthen freedoms for the \nVietnamese people. I am hopeful, in moving forward, the United States \nwill do a better job of making clear that the Communist regime in Hanoi \nmust improve its human rights record.\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\n  Fortunately, we in the Congress can play a role. Earlier this year, I \nreintroduced a piece of legislation called the Vietnam Human Rights \nSanctions Act, legislation that would impose travel restrictions and \nother sanctions on Vietnamese nationals who are complicit in human \nrights abuses against their follow people. I intend to offer this \nlegislation, the Vietnam Human Rights Sanctions Act, as an amendment to \nthe national defense authorization bill we will be debating this week.\n  The United States simply must do more to support the rights of the \nVietnamese people and freedom-loving people everywhere. We simply can't \ngive a pass to the Vietnamese regime and a pass to their oppressive \ngovernment because, frankly, it is a little inconvenient to bring up \nduring the time we are talking about trade and better economic \nrelationships.\n  This bill is a step forward in the fight for their civil, religious, \nand political liberties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3042-1"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADAM WALSH REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, shortly the Senate will pass another \nimportant piece of legislation, the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act. \nThis is legislation that will better equip the States to track sex \noffenders and prevent abuse. Since the new majority took control of \nthis Chamber, the Senate has prioritized bills that protect victims, \nthat make our communities safer. This latest bill fits that model.\n  For example, I was proud to introduce the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, which was signed into law by President Obama this last \nspring. That happened to enjoy a 99-to-0 vote in the Senate, clearly \nbipartisan legislation directed at helping the victims of human \ntrafficking. I am pleased to report that this law has already begun \nhelping those victims recover and find a path for healing.\n\n  In another example, the Senate Judiciary Committee recently approved \nthe Justice for All Reauthorization Act, legislation I introduced with \nour colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, that will improve the \ncriminal justice system by helping eliminate the backlog of untested \nrape kits in communities throughout the country and by helping victims \nfind justice faster.\n  I might add that, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Grassley of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, the Judiciary Committee has been as \nactive and as productive as any other time I have been in the Senate.\n  Finally, earlier this year we joined several of our colleagues to \nintroduce Kari's Law, another bipartisan bill that would ensure that \npeople have the ability to directly call 911 without having to dial an \nextra number, which happens to be particularly important in hotel rooms \nand other places. Particularly if a young child picks up a phone and \ndials 911, as they have been instructed, it is important that they be \nable to get through.\n  This is a simple change but one that will help law enforcement and \nemergency personnel reach those who need help as soon as possible. I \nhope we can move this legislation forward soon.\n  I am proud of the work the Senate has done in these and other areas \nthis year. I hope this afternoon we can add the Adam Walsh \nReauthorization Act to that list.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise to discuss the Sexual Assault \nSurvivors' Rights Act. I am very pleased this legislation has been \nincorporated into the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act that is before us \nthis afternoon. I thank the chair and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senators Grassley and Leahy, for their help and support in \nmoving this important legislation forward.\n  The Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act builds on the legacy of the \nCrime Victims' Rights Act by establishing our Nation's first set of \ncodified, court-enforceable rights to address unique issues faced by \nsexual assault survivors. These rights, coupled with renewed efforts to \neducate survivors about available options and resources, will help \nempower survivors already in the justice system. In addition, this bill \nwill send a powerful message to survivors all across the country: You \ndo have rights. We do care about you. If you choose to come forward, we \nare going to be there for you, and we are going to ensure a justice \nsystem that treats you with dignity and fairness.\n  As many of our colleagues know, sexual assault remains one of the \nmost pervasive and complex challenges in our justice system. It affects \nevery segment and demographic of our society, young and old, rich and \npoor, rural and urban. The immediate physical harm of an attack can \nresult in a lifetime of emotional scars and lingering stigma.\n  Sexual assault is also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute. \nFor starters, it is the most underreported crime in our country. The \nDepartment of Justice estimates that nearly 70 percent of attacks go \nunreported and only a small percentage of perpetrators go to prison.\n  When we ask survivors why other victims don't come forward and press \ncharges, they tell us our justice system seems to be working against \nthem, not for them. They even say the trauma of an attack can be \ncompounded by the disappointment they feel when our legal system puts \nso many needless obstacles in the path of justice. For survivors, it is \ntoo often a grueling and bewildering process. Many feel intimidated and \nultimately choose not to go forward. Some who may initially file \ncharges give up before their case is resolved or they simply slip \nthrough the cracks. In many States, sexual assault survivors risk \nhaving their untested rape kits destroyed, sometimes without their \nknowledge.\n  This issue came to the attention of my office when a 24-year-old \nyoung woman, Amanda Nguyen, came to my office and told me about her \nexperience with this very issue. She had the tragic circumstance of \nhaving been raped in Massachusetts, and despite the State's 20-year \nstatute of limitations for sexual assault, Amanda has had to return to \nthe same police station every 6 months just to make sure her rape kit \nevidence is not destroyed. That means that every 6 months she has to \nrelive the crime that was committed against her. She has to meet with a \ndifferent person, reexplain her situation, and hope her evidence is not \ndestroyed. What is worse, if Amanda had not been proactive in figuring \nout all the relevant policies, her evidence could have been destroyed \nwithout her even being notified.\n  Fortunately, Amanda didn't give up. She decided this was wrong and \nshe was going to do something about it. She visited a number of offices \nacross Capitol Hill, and when she got to ours, we said: You are right. \nThis is wrong. We need to do something about it, and we worked with her \nand with an organization she started called Rise to put together \nlegislation that could serve as a model for the rest of the country.\n  Fortunately, the Senate has an opportunity to respond to the issues \nAmanda raised and so many people have faced across this country. This \nbill will establish in the Adam Walsh\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\nReauthorization Act the first set of court-enforceable rights for \nsurvivors of sexual assault codified in the U.S. Criminal Code. These \nrights are specifically designed to address many of the unique \nchallenges faced by survivors of sexual assault. They include \ncommonsense changes, such as ensuring that survivors are not charged \nfor the rape kits, requiring that the relevant evidence be kept for the \nentire statute of limitations period, the right to be informed of the \nmedical results of a rape forensic examination, and the right to have \nwritten notice before a rape kit containing critical evidence is \ndestroyed.\n  It is important to note that the rights contained in this bill would \nonly apply at the Federal level. However, they are drawn from best \npractices developed by many States, and we are hopeful they will serve \nas a model and a catalyst for each of the 50 States to enact or improve \ntheir own survivor bill of rights. Already we have heard from several \nState legislators who intend to introduce bills mirroring the Federal \nstandards in this legislation.\n  We know the status quo is not acceptable. Currently, inadequate laws \nwork against survivors, against law enforcement, and against \nprosecutors--serving only the perpetrators who too often remain at \nlarge. It is past time for a reform process that ends the silence \nsurrounding sexual assault, brings it out of the shadows, and gives \nsurvivors a fair shot at justice. This is exactly what the Sexual \nAssault Survivors' Rights Act will do.\n  I am so pleased it has been included in the Adam Walsh \nReauthorization Act that is before us today. Again, I thank the \nJudiciary Committee. I thank Amanda Nguyen and Rise. They have been so \ncritical to getting this legislation included in the Adam Walsh Act, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this bill when it comes to the \nfloor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the Adam Walsh \nReauthorization Act of 2016. Passage of this bipartisan bill will send \na strong and clear message to the American people about Congress's \nsteadfast commitment to keeping our children safe from sexual predators \nand other violent criminals.\n  Many of us supported the original Adam Walsh Child Protection and \nSafety Act, which is so named for a 6-year-old boy who was abducted and \ntragically murdered nearly 35 years ago. Adam Walsh was abducted on \nJuly 27, 1981, from a mall in Hollywood, FL. In what is every parent's \nnightmare, Adam's remains were found 2 weeks later, more than 100 miles \nfrom his home.\n  This year marks the 35th anniversary of his disappearance. In the \nintervening years, his parents, John and Reve Walsh, have dedicated \ntheir lives to protecting children from harm and bringing child \npredators to justice. John Walsh collaborated on the development of the \noriginal Adam Walsh Act, and he has continued to provide invaluable \ninsight regarding the reauthorization bill that is before us today.\n  This bill is yet another bipartisan measure that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported unanimously in the 114th Congress. Senators Hatch, \nSchumer, and Feinstein, who all cosponsored an early Senate version of \nthe 2006 Adam Walsh Act, have once again joined as original cosponsors \nof this legislation. I want to also thank our committee's ranking \nmember, Senator Leahy, as well as Senator Ayotte and other Members of \nthis Chamber who have joined as cosponsors or contributed in some way \nto the bill's success.\n  As a reminder, the Adam Walsh Act originally was enacted in response \nto notorious cases involving children who had been targeted by adult \ncriminals, many of them repeat sex offenders. The names Johnny Gosch, \nEugene Martin, and Jetseta Gage, for example, still bring heartbreak to \nall Iowans. Johnny Gosch was a 12-year-old paperboy delivering \nnewspapers in West Des Moines, IA, when he disappeared in 1982. Two \nyears later, 13-year-old Eugene Martin disappeared in Des Moines, IA--\nalso while delivering newspapers. And 10-year-old Jetseta Gage was \nkidnapped, raped, and murdered by a convicted sex offender in rural \nJohnson County, IA in 2005.\n  The original Adam Walsh Act was enacted in response to these and many \nother cases involving missing children. The 2006 law established \nnumerous programs, but their authorization expired some years ago. \nSeveral of these programs, for which Congress continues to provide \nfunding in the annual appropriations process, are the centerpiece of \nthe Adam Walsh Act and are key to its successful implementation. This \nbill would extend the authorization for these pivotal programs.\n  First, this bill would reauthorize the sex offender management \nassistance program. It is estimated that there are more than 700,000 \nregistered sex offenders in the United States. This program helps \nStates to meet national notification and registration standards for \nthese sex offenders. It also helps State and local law enforcement \nagencies improve their sex offender registry systems and information \nsharing capabilities.\n  Second, this bill would extend the Jessica Lunsford Address \nVerification Grant Program. Who can forget Jessica Lunsford, for whom \nthis program is named? This 9-year-old Florida girl was abducted and \nmurdered by a registered sex offender who lived nearby. Her story is \nnot unlike that of 10-year-old Jetseta Gage.\n  The Jessica Lunsford program authorizes grants to State and local \ngovernments to help fund programs that verify the residences of \nregistered sex offenders. Having accurate information on where sex \noffenders live is crucial to ensuring that law enforcement can \nadequately protect the safety of children and keep the public informed.\n  Third, this bill authorizes continued funding for the U.S. Marshals \nService to support local efforts to track down sex offenders who fail \nto register as such or who later disappear from the system. These \nfugitive apprehension activities, authorized under the original Adam \nWalsh Act, continue to be funded by appropriators, but they need to be \nreauthorized. Extending the authorization signals Congress's continued \ncommitment to ensuring that these activities continue.\n  Fourth, during the committee markup of this bill, I offered a \nsubstitute amendment that incorporates a package of new rights for \nsexual assault survivors. It was accepted with the unanimous support of \nour committee members. Several members worked with me on its \ndevelopment, and I appreciate their contributions. I want to especially \nthank Ms. Amanda Nguyen, a young woman who has bravely spoken out about \nher experience of sexual assault. Amanda, who founded a nonprofit known \nas RISE, originated the idea for a survivors' rights package and urged \nme to incorporate such language in this bill.\n  The package we adopted in the Judiciary Committee includes new \nrights, under our Federal Criminal Code, for victims of sexual assault \noffenses. These rights are in addition to those already available to \nall victims of crime under the Federal Criminal Code. They include the \nright not to be prevented from or charged for receiving a medical \nforensic exam. They include the right to have a sexual assault evidence \ncollection kit preserved without charge for the statutory limitations \nperiod or 20 years. They include the right to be informed of the \nresults of that kit's analysis, as well as policies governing the kit's \ncollection and preservation. They include the right to notice when the \ngovernment intends to dispose of a sexual assault evidence collection \nkit. RISE endorsed these provisions last July.\n  The bill reported by our committee also clarifies that the Justice \nDepartment can make discretionary grants available, under the crime \nvictims fund, to States that agree to notify sexual assault survivors \nof any applicable rights under state law. The bill calls for the \nestablishment of a Federal working group to disseminate best practices \nfor the care and treatment of sexual assault survivors and for the \npreservation of forensic evidence. The\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\nbill also would extend the statutory deadline by which child victims of \ncertain human trafficking and child abuse offenses can file suit \nagainst their perpetrators.\n  We also added language to the bill, at the suggestion of the Judicial \nConference of the United States, to clarify that courts can supervise \nsexual offenders after their release from civil confinement. Courts \nalready do this in practice, just as they do with criminal offenders \nafter their release, but this legislation clarifies judges' authority \nto do so.\n  Before concluding, I should mention that the Adam Walsh \nReauthorization Act not only has the bipartisan support of members of \nthis chamber, but also has the support of groups that advocate for \nchild protection and safety, such as the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children. It has been endorsed by two leading antihuman \ntrafficking organizations, Polaris and Shared Hope International. And \nas already mentioned, the current version has the support of John Walsh \nand RISE.\n  Finally, I want to reiterate that the 35th anniversary of the \nabduction of and murder of young Adam Walsh will take place in July. It \nis my hope that we can send this legislation to the President's desk \nbefore that date passes. As a father and as a grandfather, I cannot \nstress enough the importance of making this bill's passage a priority \nfor the 114th Congress.\n  We cannot bring back Adam Walsh, Jetseta Gage, Jessica Lunsford, or \nthe other innocent children we have lost under such terrible \ncircumstances. But we can do our best to honor their memory and to \nprotect America's present and future children by extending these key \nprograms that were authorized under the original Adam Walsh Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on legislation to \nreauthorize key elements of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety \nAct. I supported this important law when it was first enacted nearly 10 \nyears ago, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this reauthorization \nbill.\n  Both the original legislation and the reauthorization bill we are \nvoting on today bear the name of Adam Walsh, a young boy who was \nabducted and murdered nearly 35 years ago. Since that tragic day, \nAdam's father, John, has been a determined and tireless advocate on \nbehalf of missing and exploited children. I have worked with John Walsh \nand others over the years to protect the most vulnerable among us. As a \nSenator and former prosecutor--but most importantly, as a father and a \ngrandfather--I take seriously my duty to protect the children of \nVermont and every community throughout the country.\n  The Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act will reauthorize two important \nprograms that assist State and local law enforcement agencies to \nmonitor and apprehend sex offenders. Specifically, this legislation \nauthorizes the Attorney General to continue providing grants to State \nand local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to improve sex \noffender registry systems. The bill also reauthorizes funding for \ngrants to improve information sharing and verification and supports the \nwork of the U.S. Marshals Service in helping State and local law \nenforcement to locate and apprehend sex offenders who fail to comply \nwith registration requirements.\n  For more than three decades, the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, NCMEC, has served as a national clearinghouse on \nissues related to missing and exploited children. I know that the \ncenter works closely with the marshals and other Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement agencies, and the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act \nwill help further our support for these collaborative efforts. NCMEC \nhas played a vital role in these efforts, which is why last Congress, I \nhelped lead the fight to reauthorize NCMEC, so that it could continue \nits important work.\n  The bill also includes an important set of provisions authored by \nSenator Shaheen to protect the rights of sexual assault survivors, \nparticularly with regard to sexual assault and rape kits. I want to \nthank and applaud Senator Shaheen for her hard work and leadership on \nthe Sexual Assault Survivors Rights Act. As an original cosponsor of \nher bill, I supported the inclusion of her important measure as part of \nthis bill.\n  I encourage all Senators to support this bill. I hope that the House \nwill take it up and promptly pass it so that it can be signed into law \nby the President. There is no need to delay any longer our support for \nthe Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies that work tirelessly \nto protect the children of our community. But once this bill become \nlaw, our job does not end there. It is not sufficient to just pay lip \nservice to this issue and allow Congress to pat itself on the back for \npassing an authorization bill. Just as we have seen with our efforts to \ncombat the opioid abuse epidemic, a bill that authorizes programs is \nimportant and worthy of support, but ultimately an empty promise if it \nis not backed up with the actual Federal resources that Congress \nauthorizes. I will keep fighting to ensure that Congress puts its money \nwhere its mouth is and provides the funding that is necessary to \nsupport these important efforts. I will continue fighting to improve \nour laws so that we protect the most vulnerable in all of our \ncommunities.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the ``Adam Walsh \nReauthorization Act of 2016,'' an important bill crafted to protect--\nand support--victims of sex crimes. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators \nGrassley and Schumer.\n  The bill reauthorizes important programs that assist States in \nmanaging sex offenders and reauthorizes the U.S. Marshals Service \nefforts to locate and apprehend these offenders. The bill also protects \nthe rights of sexual assault survivors. For example, it includes \nprovisions to ensure sexual assault survivors are notified of their \nrights, such as the right to have a sexual assault medical forensic \nexamination.\n  For many years, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona and I pushed to provide \nvictims of crime with basic protections in the criminal justice system. \nThose efforts culminated with the passage of the Crime Victims' Rights \nAct of 2004.\n  This bill similarly recognizes the rights of victims of sexual \nassault--an important step forward.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision that I authored, along with \nSenator Cornyn, to extend the time for minor victims of sex crimes to \npursue justice against their perpetrators.\n  Across this country, those who were sexually exploited as children \nare courageously coming forward, many years after the abuse took place.\n  My office has heard from a number of victims from California who--in \nthe height of their innocence as children--were subjected to untold \nabuse and sexual exploitation. Many of these victims were not able to \ncome forward until many years later--after they had reached adulthood.\n  To address this, I authored language to extend the statute of \nlimitations for minor victims of Federal sex crimes. Specifically, \nsection 8 of the bill extends the civil statute of limitations until \nthe age of 28 to allow minor victims of sex offenses, including sexual \nabuse and child pornography, to sue their perpetrators.\n  This brings the statute of limitations in line with a similar law \nthat provides a remedy for victims of sex trafficking. This provision \nis one step in the right direction, but we must do more to reform the \nstatute of limitations for minor victims of Federal sex offenses.\n  Indeed, Senator Cornyn and I recently introduced legislation called \nthe Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims Act of 2016. This bill \nwould clarify the law so that the civil statute of limitations for \nFederal sex crime victims begins to run 10 years after the later of \nwhen the victim actually discovers the injury or the violation, or when \nthe victim turns 28 years old. This is important because victims of sex \ncrimes are sometimes abused even before they can remember or understand \nthe abuse--some as young as 3 years old.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will take up and pass the bill I have \nintroduced separately with Senator Cornyn to address this issue.\n  I am pleased to support the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2016 \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Honoring Women Airforce Service Pilots\n\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that last week, \nbipartisan legislation to restore the rights of the Women Airforce \nService Pilots, or WASP, to have their ashes inurned at Arlington \nNational Cemetery was signed into law.\n  I was proud to have led the Senate's effort, with Senator Mikulski, \nto honor this group of revolutionary women who courageously served our \ncountry. I thank Congresswomen Martha McSally and Susan Davis for their \nleadership and for spearheading this bill in the House.\n  On the heels of Pearl Harbor, these trailblazing women bucked the \nstatus quo and made tremendous sacrifices for this Nation. They joined \na groundbreaking flight training program for women, flying noncombat \nservice missions for the Army Air Force to free their male counterparts \nfor combat duty overseas. The WASP willingly put their lives on the \nline for this country during a time of war. This work wasn't easy and \ncertainly contained peril. In fact, 38 WASP died in service to our \ngreat country during World War II. Their sacrifice and love for this \nNation deserves to be celebrated and always remembered.\n\n  Iowa was at one time or another home to at least 25 courageous WASP. \nWhile they were eventually granted veteran status in 1977, it was not \nuntil 2002 that the Army allowed these women to have their ashes placed \nin Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. In 2015 that \nhonor was inexplicably and wrongly revoked by the Army.\n  With less than 100 WASP still living, time was short to do what was \nright and honor these women for their selfless sacrifice and service to \nour Nation. They were role models for women in the military, like me, \nand proved their strength and fortitude in the missions they carried \nout.\n  I want to take this time to honor these extraordinary women and thank \nthem for their remarkable military service. As Memorial Day approaches, \nI am grateful that we can restore a basic honor to them and their \nfamilies through this law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Hatch, Tim Scott, John \n           Cornyn, Mitch McConnell.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am sure that all of our colleagues made \nnote of the latest tragedy, which is most likely a terrorist attack, \nand that is the airliner that disappeared, and now they are finding \npieces of that airliner. We don't know positively what happened, but it \nhas all the earmarks of a terrorist attack.\n  I know that many of my colleagues know that the Director of National \nIntelligence, General Clapper, testified before our committee and said \nthat there are most likely going to be additional attacks in Europe and \nin the United States, either the type that took place in San Bernardino \nor attacks that--Mr. Baghdadi has sent his people into the refugee flow \nto commit attacks on the United States of America.\n  We just finished up a couple weeks ago--a few days ago a defense \nauthorization bill. That bill is a very large bill, and it contains \nreforms and changes in the way we do business. It changes a whole lot \nof things. It also takes care of the men and women who are serving in \nthe military. It provides them with greater capability to fight this \nvirus of radical terrorist Islam, which is threatening the United \nStates of America in a way that has been unprecedented in 70 years.\n  We are subject to attacks like San Bernardino, like what we just saw \nwith the airliner, which is most likely--I am not positive, but it has \nall the earmarks. I have seen enough to know that this is most likely a \nterrorist attack. Meanwhile, ISIS is metastasizing Libya. It is \ncommitting attacks in Baghdad which are killing hundreds of people. We \nsee the terrible atrocities committed by ISIS or Daesh--whichever one \nyou call it--all over the world, in Africa and other parts.\n  So we need this legislation. We need this legislation for the men and \nwomen who are serving. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Dempsey, said that what we are doing now puts us on the \n``ragged edge'' of being able to defend this Nation. The Commandant of \nthe U.S. Marine Corps said the same thing. The Chief of Staff of the \nUnited States Army said: ``We are putting the men and women in the \nmilitary at greater risk.'' Those are his exact words. ``We are putting \nthe men and women in the military at greater risk.''\n  So what are we doing here? We are not moving forward with the bill. \nFor some reason, the majority leader is having to file cloture, and \nthen we wait a number of days, and then we take up the bill, and then \nmaybe we don't finish the bill while we go into recess. Don't we owe \nthe men and women in the military better than that? Shouldn't we take \nup this bill and dispense with it, do a conference with the House and \nsend it to the President's desk so that the President of the United \nStates will sign it and the men and women in the military will be \nbetter equipped, better trained, better able to defend themselves and \nthis Nation, or are we going to go through some kind of foolishness of \nhaving the majority leader having to file cloture and then we wait 48 \nhours? It is being totally divorced from the reality of what is \nhappening in the world. Just a few days ago, a brave young SEAL was \nkilled in Syria, a young man named Keating. I happen to know his family \nvery well.\n  The President of the United States still will not say we are in \ncombat, but the fact is, we are dramatically increasing our presence, \nboth in Syria and Iraq and now Libya. These men and women need \nequipment to fight with. They need to have a military that is the best \nwe can provide them with. So why shouldn't we do it now? Why should we \nwait a couple of days? There is no justification for not moving to this \nbill right now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration--the immediate consideration--of Calendar No. 469, S. \n2943, the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I have \nstated on the record many times, I have great admiration for the \nSenator from Arizona. We came together to the House, came together to \nthe Senate. But I have to say, it is obvious my friend has a short \nmemory. These bills take a long time. That is traditionally how it has \nworked around here. For weeks, we work on these bills.\n  I understand the bill as reported complies with the budget agreement. \nI appreciate that. But the Senator from Arizona, I have been told, \nwants to offer an amendment to expand military spending without doing \nanything to address the middle class. The fight against terrorism, the \nfight for security in our country is more than bombs and bullets; it is \nthe FBI, the Department of Homeland Security; it is what we are doing \nto fight the scourge of drugs. All of those things are important for \nthe security of this Nation.\n  There is nothing being done in this bill to fight ZIKA. Is that a \nsecurity issue? Yes, it is. There is nothing being done to fight \nopioids. Is that a security issue? It sure is. During the time we have \nhad this little exchange, there will be a number of people who will die \nacross America as a result of the overuse of opioids. Flint, MI, has \nbeen going on for months. Those poor people have been ravaged with lead \nin the water.\n  So I would have to say that my friend, as I have indicated, has a \nvery short memory. I don't know how many times he has voted not to \nproceed to a piece of legislation. We need to address those issues that \nI have talked about.\n  I think the people of Arizona, the people of this country, want us to \ndo our jobs. You would think that one thing we could do is look at this \nbill. This bill is not 64 pages long, not 164 pages long; it is 1,664 \npages long. What makes it even more concerning to me and my colleagues \nis the fact that it was basically done in secret. It was a closed \nhearing.\n  So for heaven's sake, let's be brought back to reality. We have been \nvery clear. We think we should take care of the middle class as we take \ncare of the military. We are obligated to do both. The President will \nveto any bill that violates that principle.\n  So before we begin consideration of this bill, it wouldn't be bad if \nwe read it. It wouldn't be bad if we had a chance to study this. It \nwouldn't be a bad idea if we had our staff give us some information on \nthis bill of 1,664 pages.\n  So, without any question, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just say, the bill was reported \nfrom the committee by a vote of 24 to 3. So what the Democratic leader \nis saying is that because we don't fund the IRS, we then should not \nproceed with defending this Nation. That is a remarkable statement.\n  If the Democratic leader is interested in money for the FBI, Homeland \nSecurity, and others, I would be more than happy to consider that, to \nauthorize some additional funding for those agencies of government that \nprotect the government.\n  But what my colleagues have just heard is that we will not move \nforward to provide for the well-being of the men and women who are \nserving, their ability to defend us, take them out of risk as much as \npossible by providing them what they need--which, by the way, 95 \npercent is input and requests from the executive branch, the Defense \nDepartment. So we are not going to move forward on this because we \ndon't include the other agencies of government. That is now putting our \nNation's security and other functions of government on exactly the same \nplane and totally disregards the fact that we are being attacked. We \nare being attacked by cyber. There are plans to attack the United \nStates of America. The Director of National Intelligence said there \nwill be attacks on the United States of America. Where is the \nDemocratic leader? What is he thinking? What could he be thinking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arizona has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We need to move forward with this legislation. We need to \nmove forward with it now for the sake of the men and women who are \nserving and defending this Nation and putting their lives on the line. \nThis is disgraceful.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How many Democratic Senators on the Armed Services \nCommittee voted against this bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. None. I am unhappy to say that the three votes against \nhappened to be on this side of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3047-1"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3048-S3050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADAM WALSH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2016--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Saturday I visited the General Motors \nLordstown plant near Youngstown to celebrate its 50th anniversary. For \nhalf a century, this plant has been an anchor of the Mahoning Valley. \nIt has supported good, middle-class union jobs through good times and \nbad. Seven Ohioans--get this--seven workers at that plant have been \nthere for all 50 of those years. Albert Gifford, Mossco Dubose, John \nBrincko, Robert Polansky, Thomas Koppel, John Rosa, and Stephen Gazdik \nhave helped build 21 different General Motors models since 1966, \nstarting with the Chevy Impala.\n  The car they make now is the Chevy Cruze. My wife and I are proud \nChevy Cruze owners. I drove to the plant in one. I was proud to be at \nGM Lordstown in 2010 to see the very first Chevy Cruze roll off the \nassembly line. The first three Cruzes were painted red, white, and \nblue. They represented the determination of a community and a country--\nthink about the auto industry and the state of the economy back in \n2010. They represented the determination of the country to bounce back \nand succeed in the face of long odds and national naysayers who wanted \nto write off this plant and that community.\n  It has been a rough few years for that industry. Think about where we \nwere less than a decade ago. Auto sales were down 40 percent, 1 million \njobs were at risk of being lost, on top of the 8 million jobs we had \nalready lost as President Obama took office. We heard rightwing \npoliticians on the news calling the American auto industry dead, but \nwhat they meant was they didn't believe it was worth saving. They \nwanted to bet against American companies and against American workers.\n  The workers at Lordstown and at plants like it across Ohio--in \nToledo, in Defiance and Cleveland and Walton Hills and Avon Lake--and \nacross the country proved them wrong. Working together with President \nObama, we invested in rescuing the American auto industry. Right now, \nbecause of the auto rescue, because of workers in Lordstown, in Parma \nand Cleveland and across the Midwest, the American auto industry is \nroaring back to life. GM posted 5 percent gains in sales last year.\n\n  Let's be clear. Ohio and much of the Midwest would be close to a \ndepression if the doubters and the naysayers had their way. But we \nrefused to let the auto industry collapse, and history has proven it \nwas the right thing to do. The people of Northeast Ohio know how \nimportant it was. So do people across the whole State. So do people \nacross that region. The cars made in Lordstown epitomize how central \nthe auto industry is to Ohio's economy. The Chevy Cruze features \ncomponents made at plants all across Ohio. The engine blocks are \nmanufactured in Defiance, the transmissions are assembled in Toledo, \nthe wheels for the Chevy Cruze Eco are made by Alcoa in Cleveland, and \nparts are stamped in Parma and also in Lordstown.\n  Ever since the first Chevy Impala rolled off the lot in 1966, the \nMahoning Valley has depended on Lordstown. This is the industry and the \ncompany on which the great American middle class was built.\n  On Saturday, anyone could see how central this plant is to its \ncommunity. GM estimates that more than 10,000 people--young and old, \nfamilies with their children, vintage car buffs, former workers--turned \nout to watch the parade, stroll through the car show, and tour the \nplant. The line to get into the plant stretched down the street and \naround the block. That is what this plant and this auto industry mean \nto the communities they serve.\n  I know this community and this State will continue to depend on auto \nworkers for another 50 years and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3050-2"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3050-S3051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    USDA CATFISH INSPECTION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, tomorrow, apparently the Senate is going \nto have an opportunity to weigh in on the issue of whether it is good \npolicy to allow uninspected, adulterated Vietnamese catfish into the \nUnited States. That will be the issue before us in the form of a \nresolution to disapprove a USDA regulation.\n  The Senate will vote on whether it is a good idea to expose American \nconsumers to catfish containing illegal antibiotics, heavy metals, and \nother carcinogens. I think the Senate will once again say that we need \nto protect American consumers from these harmful contents of imported \ncatfish, and we need to protect them by continuing a new U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture catfish inspection program.\n  What happened before we had the USDA catfish inspection program? \nUnder previous law, the Food and Drug Administration inspected catfish \ncoming into the United States, principally Vietnamese catfish. What we \nfound out in this program is that only 2 percent of the catfish coming \nin got inspected. The other 98 percent came through without the Federal \nGovernment taking a look at it. What we learned from the information \ngiven to us was that some of the catfish coming in did have these \nharmful chemicals in them. So the farm bill passed by the Congress \nchanged the inspection regime from the FDA to where it is now--the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. Under the Department of Agriculture program, \nalmost all of the catfish will be inspected to make sure it is free of \nthese harmful substances.\n  The people who are trying to go back to the old method of inspection \nmake some claims. They say the new USDA rule is duplicative. They say \nit is a WTO violation. They say it is costly.\n  I will tell my colleagues--and I want my colleagues listening in \ntheir offices to understand this--there will not be a duplicative \nprogram. FDA is out of the catfish inspection business as of March 1 of \nthis year. The only inspections being carried out now are through USDA. \nSo the argument that this new program is duplicative is factually \nincorrect. You can say it as many times as you want to; that doesn't \nmake it true. There is no duplication.\n  Furthermore, there is no WTO violation. The equivalent standards are \nbeing applied both to imported and domestic fish, so the standards are \nthe same. We just want to make sure they are safe. We are pretty sure \nabout domestic catfish. A lot of it is grown in my State of \nMississippi. A lot of it is grown in Missouri, Arkansas, and Alabama. \nThose catfish farms are inspected. The fish are not caught out in a \nriver somewhere; they are inspected where they are grown and are \nharvested under very controlled conditions. We just want all fish \nconsumed in the United States to be as safe as domestically produced \nfish.\n  Thirdly, they say the new rule is costly. Well, the entire program is \ngoing to cost $1.1 million a year through USDA. I would say $1 million \na year to protect the American consumers is a reasonable price to pay. \nIt is not costly in the scheme of things.\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n  Let me tell you what we found so far in the brief history of this new \nUSDA program. We found that catfish coming in from Vietnam was \nadulterated. I can hardly pronounce these words, but I have here a \npublication from Food Chemical News dated today, May 23. It reports \nthat according to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, they \nhave already found two shipments that have just come in in recent weeks \nthat were adulterated. This is Vietnamese catfish that the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture caught that would have been consumed by \nAmerican consumers in restaurants and would have been bought at \nsupermarkets. They wouldn't let it in. They sent it back. Thank heavens \nthey did because one shipment contained gentian crystal violet, so they \ndidn't allow it to come in. That is the kind of inspection this vote \ntomorrow will try to stop. I want to keep those inspections. The other \nshipment that was not allowed in contained malachite green, and it \ncontained enrofloxacin and fluoroquinolone--all chemicals and \nsubstances that are prohibited to be consumed in the United States \nbecause they are not safe. They contain heavy metals, they contain \ncarcinogens, and they contain illegal antibiotics that we are trying to \nprotect U.S. consumers from.\n  I will give credit to the authors of this resolution of disapproval: \nThis would somewhat cut the price of fish in restaurants. But I will \ntell you what. If my colleagues want to foist less expensive catfish \nthat contains heavy metals, antibiotics, and carcinogens off on \nAmerican consumers, let them have at it. I don't think the majority of \nthe Senate wants to do that in the name of a duplicative program--and \nit is not duplicative--and in the name of reducing costs when the whole \nprogram costs about $1 million a year.\n  I want my colleagues to be aware that this vote is going to come up \ntomorrow. It is a very unusual vote. It is a Congressional Review Act \nvote. Thirty of my colleagues have signed a petition, so it must come \nto a vote, and it must come tomorrow afternoon. The vote to proceed \nwill take place tomorrow afternoon. If the motion to proceed is agreed \nto--and I certainly hope it is not--then we will have 10 hours of \ndebate right here in the middle of the week when we should be talking \nabout national defense and all of the issues that really trouble \nAmericans. We have 10 hours of debate, according to the law, on whether \nthe regulation should go forward.\n  I hope we will simply vote against the motion to proceed tomorrow. \nThat way, under the Congressional Review Act, that will be the end of \nthe matter and the Department of Agriculture can keep inspecting and \nkeep protecting American consumers.\n  Americans should be aware this is coming up, and my colleagues and \ntheir staff should get schooled in this rather obscure issue.\n  Should the resolution pass, we will have the very unusual and \nunworkable situation of the farm bill still being the law of the land, \nof the Department of Agriculture still being the agency in charge of \ninspections. That will still be the law; we simply won't have a rule \nallowing that part of the bill to be implemented. So, in effect, since \nthe FDA inspection regime has ended, according to law, we will have no \ninspection whatsoever. That is my understanding of the result should \nthe resolution of disapproval be approved. I don't think it will be \napproved. I think we will stand tomorrow for consumer protection and \nfor applying the laws of consumer safety and food safety evenly and \nacross the board.\n  So I urge a ``no'' vote tomorrow on the motion to proceed.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here to thank my colleagues for \ntheir strong, overwhelming, bipartisan support for the Sexual Assault \nSurvivors' Bill of Rights, an act that I have been proud to help lead \nand champion, along with my colleagues, Senators Shaheen and Leahy. It \nis a cause that I championed as a prosecutor and law enforcer in my \nState, as the Federal prosecutor, U.S. attorney, and then as our \nattorney general in the State of Connecticut. It is a cause that \ndeserves this kind of overwhelming, bipartisan support because for too \nlong survivors of sexual assault have been denied the basic care and \nrights they need and deserve, and for too long they have been \nvictimized twice--first by an assailant who fundamentally violated \ntheir rights and then by the court system and a law enforcement system \nthat failed to respect and recognize their need for those rights to be \nenforced effectively.\n  When a survivor of sexual assault engages the criminal justice \nsystem, she must be secure, absolutely confident and trusting in her \nrights and empowered to make informed decisions. Reporting sexual \nassault requires incredible courage, bravery beyond the imagination of \nmany who fail to understand how much courage is required, and too often \nthe system fails to respect those rights. She deserves a system that is \nworthy of that bravery.\n  Too often, survivors are simply uninformed about what is happening, \nnot told about basic evidence and proceedings, and they find that vital \nevidence was destroyed without their consent or encounter Byzantine \nprocedural barriers to justice. That is wrong.\n  This bill represents important steps toward a system that mirrors \nunsparing prosecution of people who commit these heinous offenses with \nsensitive and fair treatment of survivors.\n  Currently, depending on the jurisdiction, there are a wide array of \ndifferent practices and procedures. Sexual assault victims often \nexperience a complex and cryptic maze of policies that deter those \nsurvivors from pursuing justice.\n  This legislation will address unique challenges faced by sexual \nassault survivors, particularly regarding notice, access, and \npreservation of evidence. The preservation of evidence is particularly \nimportant because the sexual assault evidence collection kits are \nabsolutely vital to justice and successful prosecution.\n  This bill would empower survivors to make more informed decisions \nthroughout the criminal justice process by supporting State efforts to \nbetter notify survivors of available resources as well as applicable \nState rights and policies.\n  Finally, the bill will establish a joint Department of Justice and \nHealth and Human Services working group to more effectively implement \nbest practices regarding the care and treatment of survivors across the \ncountry--a beacon of information and leadership from the Federal \nGovernment to assure that sexual assault survivors are treated with the \nrespect they need and deserve. It is that simple.\n  This legislation does not address every barrier faced by victims of \nsexual assault. There is no question that more action is needed. To \nachieve that, State and local governments must follow suit and must \ncreate a culture, a changed culture of compassion for people who have \nexperienced this heinous crime. It is a crime, and it should be treated \nas one of the most serious and outrageous crimes that anyone can \ncommit. Today the Senate has sent a message that we side with \nsurvivors. We are on their side. We will do everything in our power to \nlighten the burden and pain they bear and help them seek both justice \nand healing, which they truly deserve.\n  I thank my great friends and colleagues Senator Shaheen and Senator \nLeahy for their leadership on this issue. I have been proud to join \nwith them. I thank the Connecticut groups CONNSACS, the Permanent \nCommission on the Status of Women, and the many leaders in Connecticut \nwho have made our State such an important engineer of progress in this \narea.\n  Again, it is a journey that must be continued. The Permanent \nCommission on the Status of Women has done great work and provided \nimportant leadership in this area. I thank Amanda Nguyen for her \ncourage and hard work to make this day a reality. All of my colleagues \nwho joined today in supporting this measure can be proud of the work we \nhave done, the leadership we have shown, and the bipartisanship it \ntook.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the Senate continues to debate funding \npriorities for the American people in the coming year, I want to take a \nmoment to recognize the importance of supporting our Nation's seniors. \nMay is Older Americans Month. This is a time to recognize our \nresponsibility to expand resources for the elderly and a moment to \nacknowledge the important role older Americans play in contributing to \nour country's livelihood and development.\n  Older Americans Month has been recognized annually since 1963, when \nPresident Kennedy designated May as Senior Citizens Month to honor the \ndedication of seniors to our communities. At that time, just 17 million \nAmericans had reached their 65th birthday, with over one-third of all \nseniors living in poverty. With few programs to support their needs, \nPresident Kennedy pledged to highlight elderly contributions to society \nin order to strengthen such services.\n  This year's Older American's Month theme is ``Blaze a Trail,'' aimed \nat raising awareness about the many issues facing seniors today. From \nhigh health care costs, to the availability of healthy foods in \nvulnerable communities, our Nation's seniors deserve the resources they \nneed to enjoy these richer years.\n  Last month, the President signed the Older Americans Act \nReauthorization Act into law, marking the end of a 5-year long debate \non how to reauthorize crucial programs for seniors in underserved \ncommunities. For decades, the Older Americans Act has strengthened \ncommunity assistance for seniors, including through transportation, \ncaregiver support, nutrition, and home-based aid. I am pleased the \nreauthorization remains steadfast in supporting these initiatives, and \nincludes stronger protections for elder rights, while expanding \ndisability and long-term care programs.\n  But we cannot stop there. We must take this as an opportunity to \nunderscore the importance of promoting senior services across all \nsectors. That means coming together as a Congress to produce solutions \nfor long-term sustainability in Social Security and Medicare. It means \nexpanding access to healthy foods across communities, including in \nhospitals and senior-care facilities. This means supporting caregivers \nand families who take time out of their lives to provide for their \nloved ones. And it means ensuring that cost of living adjustments are \nfairly calculated to account for senior expenses year after year.\n  We all have a stake in promoting the livelihood of our Nation's \nelderly, whether it be for our own families or for the children of \nfuture generations. Let us be reminded this May that supporting older \nAmericans is not just a matter of fairness, but a commonsense solution \nto promoting the wellbeing of our Nation at large.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following was ordered to be printed \nin the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3052-1"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADAM WALSH REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today the Senate voted on S. 2613, \nthe Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act. This legislation would extend two \nkey programs that Congress established a decade ago to standardize and \nstrengthen registration and monitoring of sex offenders nationwide. I \nsupport this bill because it has critical provisions that law \nenforcement officers need in order to protect our children from harm, \nand I would have voted in favor of it if I were present for the vote.\n  In 2006, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Adam \nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act. The Adam Walsh Act, which was \nnamed for a 6-year old who was tragically murdered in 1981, established \nnationwide notification and registration standards for those convicted \nof sex offenses. The Adam Walsh Act created a Federal grant program to \nassist State and local law enforcement to implement registration \nsystems and locate those who fail abide by registration requirements.\n  The Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act would reauthorize the Sex Offender \nManagement Assistance Program, a Federal program that assists State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies in their efforts to improve sex offender \nregistry systems and information-sharing capabilities. The bill would \nalso reauthorize the Jessica Lunsford Address Verification Grant \nProgram, a Federal program that assists States and local law \nenforcement agencies in their efforts to verify the residence of all or \nsome registered sex offenders. The reauthorization of these critical \nprograms would provide law enforcement with the tools they need to keep \nour communities safe.\n  I would have voted in favor this legislation today because it helps \ncombat child predators by giving law enforcement officials the tools \nthey need to catch these dangerous individuals and convict them. It \ntakes a comprehensive network of law enforcement agencies on the \nFederal, State, and local levels working together to ensure compliance \nand locate sex offenders, and that is what this bill would do. I also \nsupport this legislation because it would tighten our sex offender \nregistration system and better track registered sex offenders, which \nhelps to protect our children from harm. I also recognize that this \nlegislation has the support of the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, the Nation's foremost missing children's \nclearinghouse.\n  Despite my support for this legislation, I do have concerns with some \nsex offender registration systems. First, more research is needed to \nassess whether or not sex offender registries actually improve the \nsafety of the public. Some research has concluded that sex registries \nhave no demonstrable effect in reducing sex re-offenses and often \nregistered sex offenders have higher rates of recidivism. While our men \nand women in uniform believe they need this tool to combat sex \noffenses, Congress should not rubber-stamp Federal programs in the \nabsence of hard data that demonstrates their effectiveness in keeping \nus safe.\n  I am also concerned that sex offender programs undermine \nrehabilitation because they present significant barriers to \nreintegration into the community. Requiring youth who are adjudicated \nin juvenile court of sex offenses to register as a sex offender is \ncounterproductive to the goal of the juvenile justice system, which is \ndesigned to protect youth from lifelong penalties carried by the adult \ncriminal justice system. The top priority of our government must be to \nprotect the public; but one-size-fits-all solutions do not achieve that \nend.\n  Despite my concerns, I would have voted in favor of the Adam Walsh \nReauthorization Act today because I believe it provides law enforcement \nwith the tools they need to keep people safe. I am committed to working \nwith law enforcement to make sure they receive the support they need \nfrom Congress to effectively do their jobs. However, Congress must do \nits job by ensuring that the programs we endorse have the research to \nsupport them. That effort is critical to both keeping the public safe \nand to ensuring that our justice system is fair for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3052-2"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3052-S3053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL MARITIME DAY\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, yesterday, May 22, 2016, our Nation \ncelebrated National Maritime Day. The United States has always been and \nwill always be a great maritime nation. My home State of Louisiana \nranks first in the Nation in economic impact from America's domestic \nmaritime industry. The American Maritime Partnership shows Louisiana's \n54,850 maritime jobs pump more than $11.3 billion annually into our \neconomy. America's robust domestic maritime industry includes vessel \noperators, marine terminals, shipyards, and workers engaged in the \nmovement of cargo exclusively within the United States.\n  According to a study commissioned by the Transportation Institute and \nconducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, Louisiana also ranks first in \nthe country in maritime jobs per capita, with 1 in every 83 jobs \nconnected to the State's domestic maritime industry, nearly twice that \nof any other State.\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\nLouisiana also ranks third in the Nation in shipbuilding. According to \nthe U.S. Maritime Administration shipbuilding accounts for 29,250 jobs \nand more than $2.23 billion in annual economic impact for our State.\n  However, Congress has the responsibility for ensuring that our \nNation's maritime infrastructure is adequately maintained in order for \nthis industry to flourish. There is no greater maritime asset in the \nUnited States then the Mississippi River and its tributaries. They \nconnect over 350 million acres of farmland to world markets via \ninternational trade through the 12,500 miles of inland navigational \nchannels. Much of the commodities and goods produced in the heartland \nbrought to world markets via the Mississippi River to the Gulf of \nMexico and beyond to foreign nations around the globe.\n  The Mississippi River Basin includes 41 percent of the continental \nUnited States, and the value of the agricultural products and the large \nagribusiness industry in the Mississippi River Basin produces 92 \npercent of the Nation's agricultural exports and 78 percent of the \nworld's exports in feed grains and soybeans, while 60 percent of all \ngrain exported from the United States is shipped via the Mississippi \nRiver from ports throughout the region, including the Port of New \nOrleans, the Port of South Louisiana, and the Port of Greater Baton \nRouge. Barge traffic and navigation on the Mississippi River also \ncarries a vast array of coal, fertilizer, cement, chemicals, and \npetroleum products, so any significant disruption to this navigational \nchannel has huge consequences for the entire U.S. economy.\n  Unfortunately, the recent winter and spring floods in the Mississippi \nRiver Valley have severely impeded navigational traffic along \nsignificant stretches along the Mississippi River ship channel. For \nexample, at Southwest Pass along the lower Mississippi River ship \nchannel, the authorized draft is 47 feet, but due to the excess sand \nand silt washing downstream from the flooding, the ship channel had \ndraft restrictions of 41 feet for a month earlier this year. \nEconomically, for each foot of draft loss a vessel either on the \ninbound or outbound voyage must leave behind approximately $1 million, \nper foot, in cargo behind. This is particularly problematic because the \nlast foot of draft is often where a vessel makes any profits. So during \na month timeframe, each vessel traveling along the Mississippi River at \nSouthwest Pass could potentially have had to leave behind $6 million in \ncargo, an average of 30 vessels per day moving through the channel. An \nunreliable ship channel threatens the viability of barge traffic along \nthe entire Mississippi River system by raising the transportation costs \nto move cargo.\n  Navigation along the Mississippi River system is just one example of \nmany maritime infrastructure challenges our Nation faces. Congress has \nthe responsibility for providing the resources necessary to keep \nAmerica's infrastructure open for business. Inaction is not an option \nif we want to keep United States competitive in the global marketplace. \nAcross America, the domestic maritime industry includes approximately \n40,000 vessels, supports 478,440 jobs, and has an annual economic \nimpact of $92.5 billion. The industry also generates approximately \n$92.5 billion in wages and $10 billion in tax revenues. In honor of \nthis quintessentially American industry and National Maritime Day, I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to find solutions for \nAmerica's maritime infrastructure challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3052-3"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER ROBERT DONNELL\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life \nof Lex ``Butch'' Edward Davis, who passed away on April 11, 2016.\n  Butch Davis called Sherwood, AR, home. He was born in Des Arc, AR, on \nAugust 8, 1944. When he was 16, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. His \nservice from 1961 to 1969 included two tours in Korea and one in \nVietnam, before receiving an honorable medical discharge from injuries \nhe received.\n  Butch was awarded the Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman's Badge, and \nthe Purple Heart.\n  His service resulted in severe wounds that left him with very limited \nuse of his legs and arms and a 100 percent VA disability rating. \nDespite these setbacks, Butch continued an active role in his community \nand among veteran organizations.\n  He served as a VFW commander at Post 395 in Sherwood. He was a member \nof both the Camp Robinson/Camp Pike and Little Rock Air Force Base \ncommunity councils. He launched the community's Veterans Day parade and \nwas the caretaker of the Sherwood Rotary Club Veterans Memorial. Butch \ncould always be counted on to help at every air show and many other \nactivities at Little Rock Air Force Base. His commitment earned him the \nrecognition of ``honorary commander'' at Little Rock Air Force Base. In \n2011, he was honored as one of 15 inductees into the Arkansas Military \nVeterans Hall of Fame.\n  He also gave back to his community in other ways, including serving \nas an alderman in Sherwood from 1998 until 2010 and was even named \nSherwood Volunteer of the Year. He served as co-organizer of the Wheel \nChair Olympics and played an active role in his community and the \ngreater central Arkansas area for many years.\n  A true family man and dear friend, Butch leaves behind many loved \nones, including his wife, Judy, three children, and many other friends. \nI want to offer my prayers and sincere condolences to his loved ones on \ntheir loss. Butch's service and sacrifice speak for themselves, but I \nwould like to take this time to recognize him and join with his family \nand friends in expressing my immense pride in his life and \nlegacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/23/senate-section/article/S3053-3"}, {"day": "23", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3053-S3054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following joint resolution was discharged by petition, pursuant \nto 5\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nU.S.C. 802(c), and placed on the calendar:\n\n       S.J.
