Mr. President, former First Lady, U.S. Senator of the State \nof New York, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will testify before \nthe so-called Benghazi Select Committee tomorrow. In recent weeks, it \nhas become absolutely clear that this committee is nothing more than a \npolitical hit job on Hillary Clinton.\n  I remember a program, ``Queen for a Day.'' I guess this is ``Speaker \nfor the Day.'' Republican Majority Leader of the House of \nRepresentatives McCarthy--here is what he said on a TV show, radio \nshow, or whatever it was:\n\n       Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? \n     But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select \n     committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are \n     dropping.\n\n  Well, that is one reason he was Speaker for the day. There were other \nreasons, of course. But he told the truth. He told the truth. \nCongressman McCarthy isn't the only Republican to speak the truth about \nthis so-called committee. Last week Republican Congressman Richard \nHanna of New York said:\n\n       Sometimes the biggest sin you can commit in D.C. is to tell \n     the truth. This may not be politically correct, but I think \n     that there was a big part of this investigation that was \n     designed to go after people and an individual, Hillary \n     Clinton. After what Kevin McCarthy said, it's difficult to \n     accept at least a part of it was not true. I think that's the \n     way Washington works. But you'd like to expect more from a \n     committee that's spent millions of dollars and tons of time.\n\n  That is an understatement--about $5 million just for this one select \ncommittee. There have been other hearings that have cost huge amounts \nof taxpayer dollars. They are going again tomorrow, and they said be \nready for 8 hours--8 hours of interrogation. And that is what it is, an \ninterrogation.\n  These two quotes are from two House Republicans. Hanna from New York \nis not a Democrat, he is a Republican.\n  The message is clear: The Benghazi Committee is a political \ncalculation meant to influence Presidential elections. And there is \nmore. Now we have found out that one of the Republican staffers on the \ncommittee claims that he--the staffer--was unfairly fired because he \nrefused to unfairly target Secretary Clinton. But what else could be \nexpected from a committee whose sole purpose is to drag a Presidential \nhopeful through the mud?\n  It is no secret that for the last 2 years, numerous Republican-\ndirected organizations with huge amounts of money have been targeting \nHillary Clinton--for more than 2 years--because they knew she would \nlikely run for President and they wanted to soften her up, just as \nMcCarthy said.\n  Look at the committee's record. In 17 months, committee Republicans \nhave held a whopping three hearings--in 17 months. Tomorrow's hearing \nwill be the first public hearing since January. It is October. October \nis winding down. Instead, Republican Chairman Trey Gowdy and his \ncommittee have focused millions of dollars and thousands of staff hours \non Hillary Clinton--and Hillary Clinton only. The committee has \ninterviewed or deposed eight Clinton campaign staffers. Yet Chairman \nGowdy has held only one hearing with an expert from the intelligence \ncommunity and not a single hearing with anyone from the Department of \nDefense, which is clearly a key entity responding to attacks on our \ndiplomatic post. And what have they learned in all that time? Nothing. \nA recent report by the Democrats on the Benghazi Select Committee \nconfirms that none of the witnesses they interviewed supported any of \nthe wild conspiracy theories regarding those attacks.\n  Contrast the Benghazi Committee with the work of the legally required \ninvestigation of these attacks, the Accountability Review Board. This \nindependent review was overseen by respected leaders, Ambassador Thomas \nPickering, who is one of the great diplomats of our time, and ADM \nMichael Mullen. They completed their work in less than 3 months, not 17 \nmonths. The review board immediately put out a hard-hitting report with \na series of recommendations to make sure an attack\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nlike this doesn't happen someplace else around the world. And what was \nSecretary Clinton's reaction to that report? She took responsibility \nimmediately and began to implement the recommendations from the \nAccountability Review Board.\n  In summary, Republicans spent at least $5 million to attack Secretary \nClinton. On this one committee, this one select committee, they have \nspent $4.7 or $4.8 million. Republicans have done little to investigate \nthe Benghazi attacks. And what little work House Republicans actually \ndid only reconfirmed the basic findings of all three of these previous \ninvestigations.\n  House Republicans sadly have used the tragic deaths of four innocent \nAmericans and turned it into an appalling political farce. The very \nnotion that an official House committee was used as a political tool is \ninexcusable. I would suggest that the chairman of that committee should \nbe ashamed of himself. It is even more disgraceful when nearly 5 \nmillion taxpayer dollars were spent on this political hit job.\n  Senate Democrats will continue to fight to get this sham of a \ncommittee disbanded. Weeks ago, we sent a letter to Speaker Boehner \nurging him to bring this disgraceful committee to an end, but, no, they \nare plodding forward. Today, Senate Democrats sent a letter to the \nRepublican National Committee requesting that it reimburse the American \npeople for the Benghazi Committee's expenses. Why did we do that? It is \nonly fair since the so-called committee is clearly a Republican \npolitical organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7368-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate turns its attention to the \ncybersecurity bill. It is way overdue. The bill, which is OK, is better \nthan nothing--let's put it that way.\n  The ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein, \nand the chairman of that committee, Senator Burr, have worked hard on \nthis legislation, which addresses a serious national security issue. In \nfact, it is so serious that we should have addressed this topic long \nago. We tried to. As Senate Democrats, we tried so very hard. We had a \ncomprehensive cybersecurity bill on the floor 3 years ago which was \nmuch deeper and better than this one--3 years ago--but our Republican \ncolleagues blocked us from even debating the bill. We couldn't even \ndebate the bill. Why? They, the Republicans, were told the chamber of \ncommerce didn't like it. At about the same time, the chamber of \ncommerce's whole operation was hacked by the Chinese. The people who \nworked down there expected things to come out in English, but they came \nout in Chinese. But they didn't like the bill anyway, so they told the \nRepublicans to oppose it, and they marched over here and opposed it.\n  Democrats, however, realize cybersecurity is a serious issue. We know \nhow important cybersecurity is for the national security of our country \nand the financial security of our economy.\n  Even though this bill is not our perfect bill, we are going to \ncooperate with our Republican colleagues. Several months ago we reached \nan agreement with Republicans to begin debating this legislation, and \nnow we can process it in an efficient and bipartisan manner.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7368-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before discussing the bill currently \nbefore the Senate, I would like to note that President Obama will be \nheading to West Virginia today with Drug Czar Botticelli to announce \nadditional steps the Federal Government will take to address America's \nprescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic.\n  This epidemic has been particularly devastating to my constituents. \nToday, drug overdoses--principally driven by painkillers--claim more \nKentucky lives than car accidents. Today, increased heroin overdose \nrates account for nearly one-third of all drug overdose deaths in the \nCommonwealth. Today, thousands of innocent babies are born dependent on \nopioids.\n  I recently hosted Director Botticelli in Kentucky to discuss critical \nissues such as these. I am encouraged to see him and the President \nengaged and proposing certain steps that my home State of Kentucky has \nalready embraced.\n  Drug abuse certainly isn't a partisan issue. Many Members of the \nSenate are actively engaged on the matter. I know the President will be \njoined today by West Virginia's Republican Senator and Democratic \nSenator. Finding solutions to this epidemic will require all of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, to work together at the Federal, \nState, and local levels. Today's announcement is encouraging because it \nis always positive to see Republicans and Democrats working together to \naddress this epidemic.\n  Here is another bipartisan opportunity for us to work together on \nthis issue: Let's pass S. 799, the Protecting Our Infants Act. I hope \nthe Senate will pass that important bipartisan legislation very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7368-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7368-S7369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this year, millions of people \nwere affected when the Obama administration was hit by a devastating \ncyber attack. It is an attack that has been described as ``one of the \nworst breaches in U.S. history,'' but it is hardly the last one we will \nface.\n  The challenges posed by cyber attacks are real, and they are broad. \nThey threaten governments, businesses, and individuals. Americans see \nthese threats in the public sector. For instance, as reports have \nindicated, the sensitive personal information of millions who purchase \ninsurance through ObamaCare is especially vulnerable. Americans see \nthese threats in the private sector as well. For instance, despite the \ncyber deal recently agreed upon between China and the administration, \npress reports indicate that Chinese hacking attempts on American \ncompanies and businesses appear to be continuing unabated. Americans \nalso know that a cyber attack is essentially a personal attack on their \nown privacy. It is violating to think of strangers digging through our \nmedical records and emails. It is worrying to think of criminals \naccessing credit card numbers and Social Security information.\n  That is why the Senate will again consider bipartisan legislation to \nhelp Americans' most private and personal information. It would do so \nby defeating cyber attacks through the sharing of information. It \ncontains modern tools that cybersecurity experts tell us could help \nprevent future attacks against both public and private sectors. It \ncontains important measures to protect individual privacy and civil \nliberties. It has been carefully scrutinized by Senators of both \nparties. In short, this legislation is strong, transparent, and \nbipartisan. Republicans and Democrats joined together to pass this \nlegislation through committee, the administration supports it, and the \nHouse has already passed similar legislation. With a little \ncooperation, we can pass it here shortly as well.\n  The chair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Burr, is working to \nset votes on pending amendments and has accommodated other Senators in \nthe form of a substitute amendment. I wish to thank him for his hard \nwork on this legislation. I wish to also thank\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\nthe vice chair, Senator Feinstein, as well. Every Senator should want \nto protect Americans' most private and personal information, which \nmeans every Senator should want to see this bill pass. With a little \ncooperation, we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7369-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7369-S7370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, barely a week goes by that we don't see \nanother harmful consequence of ObamaCare, a poorly conceived and badly \nexecuted law. It has caused costs to millions of Americans. It has \nharmed the quality and availability of care. Now comes further evidence \nthat ObamaCare is a mess of a law, filled with broken promises.\n  We recently learned the Kentucky Health Cooperative, a nonprofit \nhealth insurer created by ObamaCare with Federal taxpayer funds, will \ncease operations and stop offering health care plans at the end of the \nyear. For the second time in as little as 3 years, as many as 51,000 \nKentuckians will lose the health care coverage they currently have and \nwill be forced to choose a new plan--all thanks to ObamaCare. This \nKentucky co-op was a boondoggle from the start. It received nearly $150 \nmillion in Federal loans, including a solvency loan this past November \nin a failed taxpayer bailout to try to keep it afloat. It had the \nlargest recorded loss of all 23 co-ops in our whole country. The \nKentucky co-op had the biggest loss of any co-op in the whole country--\nmore than $50 million in 2014.\n  Things were hardly much better for the Kentuckians who actually \nenrolled in it. Over the past 2 years, the co-op saw double-digit \npremium increases on the individual market. If it had survived, it was \nplanning on increasing premiums for its members by 25 percent in 2016. \nIf this contraption had survived into next year, it was going to \nincrease premiums by 25 percent.\n  Here is what the Kentucky co-op's CEO said about this particular \ngovernment-subsidized health care plan: ``In the plainest language, \nthings have come up short of where they need to be.''\n  That is for sure. If only we would have that kind of honesty from the \nObama administration on the many failures of ObamaCare. The collapse of \nthe Kentucky co-op is emblematic of the situation across the land. The \nObama administration claimed their government-subsidized co-ops would \nprovide affordable and sustainable alternatives to private insurance. \nThe truth is anything but that. What is even more disappointing is that \nthe Obama administration itself predicted a nearly 40-percent default \nrate on its taxpayer loans to co-ops.\n  Now, 21 of 23 co-ops nationwide were losing money as of the end of \nlast year. Enrollment in these co-ops fell below projections for the \nmajority of plans. Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, will \nshut down its co-op, leaving approximately 27,000 enrollees looking for \nnew coverage at the end of the year. In Colorado, the State's biggest \nhealth insurer on their exchange--a nonprofit co-op--also announced its \nclosure this month, forcing 83,000 Coloradans to find new insurance for \nnext year. The same is true in Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, and \nLouisiana. From the bayous of Louisiana to the Pacific Northwest, from \nthe Big Apple to the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, ObamaCare \nco-ops are failing all over America. In all, one-third of the 23 \nObamaCare health co-ops have failed, leaving about 400,000 \npolicyholders nationwide looking for new coverage for 2016.\n  These failures of ObamaCare health co-ops come as absolutely no \nsurprise to those of us who predicted that giving the government more \ncontrol of our health care system would be detrimental to the health \ncare coverage people rely on. I said so on the Senate floor as far back \nas 2009.\n  The administration knew beforehand that this plan was not viable and \nthat tens of thousands of people could lose their coverage. They chose \nto cling fast to a disastrous leftwing experiment with our health care \nsystem over choosing stability and affordable coverage for the many \npeople caught up in ObamaCare and these failed health co-ops. What a \ncolossal mess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the majority leader and point out in today's New York \nTimes, Wednesday, October 21, the big headline--``Insurance Out of \nReach for Many, Despite Law.'' Despite this law, insurance is out of \nreach for many. I know my colleagues who were back home visiting with \npeople around their home State last week, listening to what was on \nconstituents' minds, heard exactly this--the problems of the health \ncare law.\n  I was at home in Wyoming, and I heard from a lot of people who are \nvery concerned about President Obama's collapsing health care law. That \nis what this law is doing; it is collapsing. People in Wyoming learned \nthat one insurance company--WINhealth--will no longer be selling \ninsurance through the ObamaCare exchange in our State. The company said \nit had to stop selling ObamaCare plans because there was no way to make \nmoney without big taxpayer subsidies coming from Washington. This \ncompany was already planning to raise rates significantly next year, \nand it turns out that even that wasn't going to be enough money to make \nit worthwhile. In less than 2 weeks, ObamaCare exchanges across the \ncountry will start selling insurance for next year. The total number of \ncompanies left selling insurance in the exchange for the State of \nWyoming will be exactly one--one. There will be no competition at all \nin the ObamaCare exchange. If your doctor doesn't take that insurance, \nyou are out of luck. If you can't afford it, you are out of luck. Is \nthat how ObamaCare was supposed to work? Is that what the President \npromised the American people?\n  I got an email from one of my constituents yesterday--Al Harris, a \ngreat guy, in Green River, WY, and he wrote: ``HELP!!!!!!'' He said: \n``WINHealth has become the latest casualty of ObamaCare.'' Al says that \nat his business ``I have about 30 people that now will have no \ninsurance . . . at least not this insurance. I am scrambling with few \noptions and I'm convinced any option will be substantially more \nexpensive.'' Al said: ``This train wreck needs to be stopped.''\n  I agree. President Obama and Democrats in Congress made a mess of the \nhealth care system in our country, but they said they had a better way \nof doing things. They said they knew best how to create competition and \nhow health care should operate in America. They created all these \nWashington mandates. They required people to buy expensive coverage \nthat was more than most people wanted, needed or could afford. Then \nthey created the exchanges where people could buy this new, expensive \nWashington-mandated insurance coverage. Now the people of Wyoming are \nleft with one option on the ObamaCare exchange. Buy this insurance from \nthis one company or the IRS will come knocking at your door to collect \na big tax penalty. The penalty is going up next year.\n  Because of the significant failures of the Obama administration, \nrural Americans now have fewer choices. It is not just in Wyoming. We \nlearned last week that insurance co-ops in Colorado, Oregon, and \nTennessee are all closing their doors. Why? Because they have lost so \nmuch money. Eight of the twenty-three health care co-ops in the country \nhave collapsed, completely collapsed in the last couple of months. Co-\nops have closed in New York, Kentucky--as the majority leader said--in \nLouisiana, in Nevada, in Iowa, and Nebraska. Many are in rural areas \nwhere people already don't have a lot of choice.\n  We are talking about one-half million people who are going to lose \ntheir coverage, losing their insurance. Remember that promise President \nObama made: If you like your coverage, you can keep your coverage. \nWhere is the President now? The President says the health care law is \nworking better than he even thought. Amazing. ObamaCare created these \nco-ops claiming to provide low-cost insurance. Then it saddled each of \nthem with so many mandates and so many restrictions that they needed \nmassive taxpayer bailouts. All together, these failed co-ops collected \nnearly $900 million already in taxpayer loans to get the help they \nneeded to get going. That is how President Obama put this together.\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\n  Now these co-ops have sunk, others are sinking, and they are taking \nthe taxpayer loans with them. The ones that are trying to survive have \nbeen saying we are going to have to hike our rates. The co-op in Utah \nplans to raise its premiums by 58 percent starting in January just to \nbe able to stay open. Is that what the President promised when he said \nrates would drop $2,500 per family?\n  In Montana, the rates are set to go up 43 percent for some co-op \nplans. That is not what anyone in America needed, and it is certainly \nnot what rural Americans need. President Obama said the American people \nwere going to get more choices--more choices--because of his law \ninstead of getting fewer choices. Yet he stands up and boldly says it \nis working better than he expected.\n  ObamaCare created the illusion of coverage. Now even the illusion is \ndisappearing. What is even worse for rural Americans is that it is not \njust the coverage that is turning out to be an illusion under \nObamaCare. The care is actually disappearing. Earlier this month, we \nlearned that Mercy Hospital in Independence, KY, will be closing soon. \nThis is the 56th rural hospital to close in the United States since \n2010 when ObamaCare became law. Another 238 hospitals are in danger of \nclosing. The added expense, the regulations, and the other destructive \nside effects of ObamaCare are a big reason for this. The patients who \nrely on these hospitals will have to find some other place to go to get \ntheir medical care--somewhere further away from home.\n  Democrats in Congress--many who live in big cities--may take for \ngranted they can get to a hospital quickly. It is not the case in rural \nAmerica. As a doctor who has practiced medicine for 25 years, I can \ntell you that the extra time people spend traveling to a hospital can \nmake all the difference in the world between life and death. For \nsomeone who has had a heart attack or has been in a traffic accident or \nfor a woman with a high-risk pregnancy, every minute counts. Only 20 \npercent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, and these areas \naccount for 60 percent of all trauma deaths. Americans living in these \nrural areas don't and didn't need President Obama making it tougher for \ntheir rural local hospital to stay open. Mercy Hospital was the center \nof medical care in the community for 100 years. It has provided jobs \nfor nearly 200 people.\n\n  In many parts of the country, such as in Independence, KS, and in \nmuch of my home State of Wyoming, the local hospital can be the biggest \nemployer in the community. If the hospital closes, these people lose \ntheir jobs and the tax base for the community goes down, which means \nfewer services, such as schools, firefighters, and public safety, and \nmaybe the local restaurant or florist won't have enough business to \nstay open. Nurses, teachers, and other workers may move away looking \nfor a better opportunity somewhere else. It would also make it harder \nfor the town to attract new businesses, new doctors, and more teachers, \nand the town suffers.\n  That is what these communities across America are facing. Is that \nwhat President Obama promised the American people? Is that how \nObamaCare was supposed to work?\n  Ezekiel Emanuel is one of the President's architects of the health \ncare law. He says that shutting down 56 hospitals is not enough. He has \nactually written a book about this. It is astonishing. The architect of \nthe President's health care law has written a book, and he says that \nover the next few years--between now and 2020--more than 1,000 \nhospitals will close. There will be 1,000 American communities where \npeople will be farther away from medical care. We will have 1,000 \nAmerican towns in danger because of the lost jobs and lost health care.\n  There is no dispute that we needed health care reform in this \ncountry. We did not need this destructive, disruptive, and dangerous \nObamaCare law. It has been bad for patients, it has been bad for the \nproviders--the nurses and doctors who take care of those patients--and \nit has been terrible for the American taxpayers. It has been especially \nhard on rural communities.\n  We have to do something to stop this corrosive condition that causes \nhospitals to close, insurance co-ops to collapse, and health care \nchoices to disappear.\n  Democrats in Congress need to sit down with Republicans and start \ntalking about the kind of health care reforms that the American people \nneed, want, and deserve.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, I return to the floor this week for my 24th \nedition of ``Waste of the Week.'' I have been coming down every week \nthat Congress has been in session during this cycle talking about \nwaste, fraud, and abuse of hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This is the \n24th edition, and today I want to highlight improper Medicare payments.\n  We all know that Medicare is important to our older citizens, of \nwhich I am one. Tens of millions of Americans depend on Medicare for \ntheir health care coverage, and we all know that we have the \nresponsibility here in this body to preserve these important health \nbenefits for those who depend on them. Preserving these benefits is \nprotecting Medicare from waste, fraud, and abuse. Unfortunately, \nthroughout the history of Medicare, it has been plagued by improper \npayments, and it is shocking to hear the numbers.\n  The Government Accountability Office has reported that improper \nMedicare payments totaled nearly $60 billion in 2014 alone, and over \nthe last 10 years, there has been $336 billion of improper payments in \nthe Medicare system. This figure does not even include improper \npayments for certain Medicare programs whose record keeping does not \ndate back that far.\n  Examples of improper Medicare payments include services that are not \nmedically necessary, duplicative billing for services by providers, \nineligible practice locations, and spending on services that actually \nnever took place. Yes, actions that never took place have been billed \nto the government. It wasn't discovered until later that those \nreimbursements were improper, and it is rampant. This is taking money \nout of American people's pockets. It is also denying those who have \nMedicare the coverage that they are entitled to under the program. It \nis driving Medicare down a road to insolvency that we are going to have \nto deal with, and I think we should have been dealing with it over the \npast few years.\n  Since we can't summon the political will--to my great distress--to \nrecognize the fact that Medicare is careening toward insolvency at some \npoint, which will result in significantly cutting benefits for current \nmembers receiving benefits under Medicare or require massive tax \nincreases to cover the deficit, one of the areas we can deal with now \nis to at least address those issues where we know that abuse has taken \nplace.\n  This is the 24th time I have come down to the floor to talk about \nthis issue, and I have this chart with a thermometer on it to \ndemonstrate the spending that has taken place. We wanted to reach the \ngoal of defining $100 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse. Well, we shot \nway past that. I mean, we just can't catch up with it. These are \nmatters that have been accounted for by the Government Accountability \nOffice. This is not something that Republicans are just making up or \ndrawing from anecdotal items that appear in the paper or are raised on \nthe talk shows. These are examples of what we have already documented.\n  Every once in a while when I come down here, I could talk about the \n$60 billion, and we could add $60 billion to our climbing \naccountability of the total of waste, fraud, and abuse. But every \nfourth or fifth time I like to address something that is so egregious \nthat it draws the public attention to say that we ought to look into \nthis or to press their elected representatives to do something about \nthis matter and say: Can you believe we are wasting money on something \nas frivolous as this?\n  The Washington Post recently said in an editorial about improper \nFederal payments: ``Every misspent dollar lining an undeserving pocket \nis a dollar not available for those who need the help.''\n  Now, from time, as I have said, I try to bring up something that \ncatches the\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\npublic interest. We have talked about Federal grants that were used to \nprove that massaging of rabbits--using rabbits as an example--makes \nthem feel better after a strenuous workout. I think most of us could \nhave figured that out without having to spend some $300,000. I think it \nwas even more than that--as a grant. Somebody came to the conclusion \nthat this would be a worthy project and a good use of taxpayer dollars. \nThat got a lot of attention.\n  Today I will talk about improper payments that were made to ambulance \nsuppliers. Medicare coverage allows ambulance transports when a \npatient's medical condition at the time of transport is such that any \nother means of transportation would endanger the patient's health.\n  If something happens with the patient at home where the spouse \ndecides to drive the patient to the hospital but then comes to the \nconclusion that, no, that could potentially endanger the person's \nhealth further and decides to call 911 instead for an ambulance and \nthey decide they need to transport this person so he or she has medical \ncare on the way to the hospital, then a person is eligible under \nMedicare for transportation by the ambulance if they can prove that is \nnecessary. The transport has to be for a patient who has a condition \nthat is covered under Medicare in order to get a ride home from the \nhospital. So the patient gets transferred both to the medical provider, \nusually the hospital, and is then transported back to his or her house \nif it is medically necessary.\n  As a further requirement to qualify for the reimbursement, the \nprovider who is providing the ambulance service has to meet specific \nqualifications in addition to what I just said. It can only be \ntransportation that takes you to a hospital, a skilled nursing facility \nor a dialysis facility for certain patients, and then the ambulance can \ntake them back home after they have received the care. Unfortunately, \neven with these guidelines, fraud is taking place and millions of \ntaxpayer dollars are being wasted.\n  A recent report by the inspector general from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, which oversees Medicare, found that Medicare \nmade $207 million in questionable ambulance service payments during the \nfirst half of 2012. Shockingly, these payments include $30 million \nwhere Medicare paid for transportation even though the beneficiaries \nmay not have received any Medicare services at either the time of \npickup or dropoff or at the locations or anywhere else. Thus, we are \ntalking about millions of taxpayer dollars that may have been spent on \nphantom transports.\n  These improper charges were made and sent to Washington and the \nambulance services were reimbursed.\n  Can you imagine an ambulance with its lights flashing and going down \nthe road on its way to the hospital while cars pull over to the side of \nthe road, as we are required to do, because presumably the person in \nthe ambulance is in danger and their health is at risk? They need to \nget them to the hospital or maybe the person needs dialysis and doesn't \nhave means of transportation. No, these may be empty ambulances with \ntheir lights flashing--cars pulling over. Then they bill the government \nand are getting reimbursements for the trip to and from the hospital. \nThere has been $207 million of documented improper billing for these \nservices.\n  Let me give one example. One of those services is a Pennsylvania \ncompany that fraudulently billed Medicare $3.6 million for transports, \nand the supplier recruited patients that did not require any transport. \nThey made a deal with them. They said: Look, we are going to use your \nname to submit the billing for reimbursement. We know that you don't \nneed the transportation for anything, but we need to document this so \nwe can get our money back. So what we will do is give you part of the \nreimbursement. We will pay you some of the money that we get if you \nwill allow us to use your name and identity--maybe your Social Security \nnumber or Medicare card number--and you will be in on the deal. So if \nyou get a call from an inspector or somebody trying to verify this \nreimbursement, say: Yeah, I had to go to the hospital or dialysis, and \nyes, that was a legitimate charge. This company was finally identified \nafter charging $3.6 million for transportation that did not meet \nMedicare coverage requirements.\n  You might say: OK, that is one company charged with fraud. You read \nabout that in the paper. The inspector general found that one out of \nevery five suppliers had a questionable billing practice, and that is \nhow it totals up to $207 million. Clearly, this is a problem that has \nto be addressed, and if we address this problem, we can save the \ntaxpayer money or we can at least make sure that this money is going to \ncover the necessary medical treatment for those under Medicare. With \n10,000 retirees entering the Medicare program every day, we need to \nslow down the movement toward insolvency. We need to deal with that \nhere in Congress. We should have been dealing with this issue \nbefore. So by putting these proper safeguards in place, over $207 \nmillion in questionable ambulance services could be eliminated and \ntaxpayers' dollars could be saved.\n\n  This is a small addition to an ever-growing list of savings to the \ntaxpayer if we can eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I will bring up my chart. As I said before, we used to have a \nthermometer here to show this, how we were creeping up, and it went so \nhigh, it started going to the ceiling. We now have a total of \n$117,141,182,855 and change in terms of waste, fraud, and abuse. We \nwill be back next week for the next installment of many more to come.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7371-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7371-S7372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last night the National Defense \nAuthorization Act arrived at the White House and on the desk of the \nPresident of the United States. President Obama has said he is going to \nveto it or he has threatened to veto it. I rise on the floor of the \nSenate today to beg him to rethink his position and caution him before \nhe moves too swiftly to send the message to the rest of the world that \nAmerica is disengaged. If he vetoes the National Defense Authorization \nAct, he is convincing and confirming for Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, \nthe Chinese Government, the Ayatollah in Iran, and the rest of the \nworld that America is relegating itself to a spectator on the sidelines \nof world affairs rather than a beacon of hope for the oppressed, those \nin search of democracy, and those who are at the feet of dictators.\n  It is time that we make sure our military is funded and authorized to \nthe levels that are necessary to confront the world's challenges, which \nare more today than I have ever seen. I have just returned from the \nMediterranean, where I was on the USS Winston Churchill, the destroyer \nthat is dealing with some of the problems of the migration of people \nfleeing totalitarian governments in the Middle East. I was at Fort \nGordon, GA, where the cyber command is now being set up by the U.S. \nArmy. Cyber terrorism and cyber threats are the biggest threats we face \ntoday. I was at Fort Benning, and our Strykers in the brigade are there \nand in need of upgrades and continuation of improvements. I was at Fort \nMoody in Valdosta, GA, where the A-10s are housed, but they are going \naway unless we extend them, and this Defense authorization bill will do \nthat.\n  While the rest of the world is burning and falling apart, this \nPresident is looking the other way and saying: No, I am not going to \nagree with the overwhelming majority of Congress. Instead, I am going \nto put America on the sidelines of world affairs.\n  We cannot afford for that to happen. We are the greatest country on \nthe face of this Earth. We don't find anybody trying to break out of \nthe United States of America; they are all trying to break in. But if \nwe abandon our role of strength, we will never have the peace and the \nprosperity and the democracy we want to see around the world. Instead, \nwe will be a second-string player in the influence of world affairs.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act is one thing the Congress--\nHouse and Senate alike--has agreed upon overwhelmingly. The vote in the \nSenate was a veto-proof vote. The vote in the House was a very \nsignificant vote. The President should read that to understand that the \nrepresentatives of\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\nthe people are saying to him: We want America to be strong. We don't \nwant our military to be reconstituted. We don't want the dictators of \nthe world taking advantage of vacuums that we have created because we \nlooked the other way and we abandoned ourselves.\n  We need to think about something and think about it closely. Right \nnow in Greece, for example, half a million people in the last year have \ngone through there, fleeing Syria, trying to find their way to Europe--\nhalf a million. A million and a half will probably go through there \nnext year. The world is trying to flee oppression and dictators \nwherever they are, and the rest of the free world cannot afford to take \ncare of the rest of the world unless we stop what is happening in the \nMiddle East.\n  Bashar Al-Assad should be stopped. The Russians should be asked to \nretrench and come back. We should get back to the table, being the \nstrongest power in the world and being an effective player in the \nMiddle East and being a power that is feared rather than one that is \nlooked at and left wondering. America is abandoning the role it has \nalways held since the end of World War II, and it would be a shame for \nus to do that.\n  So, Mr. President, let me ask you to do this: Think real hard before \nHalloween because that is when the time runs out and you have to either \nsign the bill or veto it. Think real hard about the America that you \ntook over running as President of the United States 7 years ago. Think \nabout how we got to where we are today. Think about all those who have \nsacrificed and who have lived and died, in some cases, to keep America \nfree. Are you going to look them in the face or their memory in the \nface and say to them: I am just not going to reauthorize the National \nDefense Authorization Act. I would rather play politics with those who \nhave fought and risked their lives for the United States of America.\n  In closing my remarks, I want to tell my colleagues what we did in \nthe NDAA because I want the people of Georgia and the people of America \nto understand what the President will be vetoing.\n  He will be vetoing the improvements in our cyber command as we move \nour new cyber command of the U.S. Army to Fort Gordon.\n  He will be saying to Guantanamo Bay: It is OK, we can move the rest \nof the prisoners from Guantanamo Bay and move them into the United \nStates of America and close Guantanamo Bay--because the NDAA bill \nprohibits that from happening.\n  He will be able to say to Stryker Brigade units: You will just have \nto wait a little bit longer for modernization.\n  He will have to say to our marines on the ground in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and in the Middle East: We are going to do away with the A-\n10s, so you won't have the close air support you have to have in the \ninfantry and in the military to fight the battles of the 21st century.\n  He will be saying to our veterans who come back home from around the \nworld: No, we are not going to do job training so that you can easily \ntransfer from the military into a meaningful job in the private sector.\n  He will say to husband and wives of military families: We are taking \naway your basic housing allowance because there are two of you in the \nsame family getting it and we are cutting it in half. Even though you \nsigned up for a program that guaranteed you would get it, we are \ncutting it in half and taking it away.\n  I don't want to be part of a country that says that to the men and \nwomen who volunteered to fight for us.\n  Let's send the right message to the rest of the world. Let's sign the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. Let's not play politics with those \nwho risked their lives. Let's remember we still are America, the \ngreatest country on the face of this Earth. God has blessed us, but \nwith that blessing comes responsibility. It means the President should \nact, act decisively, act now, and not veto the Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7372-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7372-S7374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FISCAL DEADLINES FACING AMERICA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, to paraphrase Ronald Reagan, ``Here we go \nagain.''\n  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned us that the Federal Government \nwill bump up against the statutory debt ceiling on Tuesday, November 3. \nShortly after that, on December 11, the fiscal year 2016 continuing \nresolution will expire, bringing the prospects of yet another \ngovernment shutdown.\n  Absent a budget deal to suspend sequestration and lift the spending \ncaps imposed under the Budget Control Act, we face draconian spending \ncuts that will harm both our economic recovery and our national \nsecurity. Meanwhile, authority for the Export-Import Bank has expired \nalready, and authority to spend surface transportation funding will \nexpire at the end of this month.\n  This is no way to run a government. It is time to end this mindless \nfiscal brinkmanship and negotiate a comprehensive budget deal that \nresolves all of these issues. The American people demand and deserve no \nless. But first we must act on the debt ceiling.\n  With respect to the debt ceiling, Treasury Secretary Lew wrote to \nHouse Speaker John Boehner on October 15 warning that extraordinary \nmeasures to forestall hitting the statutory debt ceiling will be \nexhausted as soon as November 3. At that point, the Federal Government \nwill have a cash balance of about $30 billion but will be facing \nobligations totaling as much as $60 billion on certain days.\n  Secretary Lew wrote in his letter:\n\n       Operating the United States government with no borrowing \n     authority, with only the cash on hand on a given day, would \n     be profoundly irresponsible. As I wrote previously, we \n     anticipate that a remaining cash balance of less than $30 \n     billion will be depleted quickly. In fact, we do not foresee \n     any reasonable scenario in which it would last for an \n     extended period of time. The government makes approximately \n     80 million payments a month, including Social Security and \n     veteran benefits, military salaries, Medicare reimbursements, \n     and many others. In the absence of congressional action, \n     Treasury would be unable to satisfy all of these obligations \n     for the first time in the history of the United States . . .\n       The creditworthiness of the United States is an essential \n     component of our strength as a nation. Protecting that \n     strength is the sole responsibility of Congress, because only \n     Congress can extend the nation's borrowing authority. \n     Moreover, as you know, increasing the debt limit does not \n     authorize any new spending. It simply allows Treasury to pay \n     for expenditures Congress has approved, in full and on time.\n\n  I couldn't agree with Secretary Lew more. Raising the debt ceiling \nallows us to pay for what has already been appropriated by Congress for \nspending. This has nothing to do with how much we are going to spend as \na nation; it has everything to do with whether we are going to honor \nour bills. The United States of America has to pay its bills. Just as \nwhen American families use a credit card, when a bill is due, it needs \nto be paid in a timely manner. At no time in our history has our \ncountry been unable or unwilling to pay its debts. Raising our debt \nceiling has to be done--not so we can spend more, as Secretary Lew \npointed out, but to pay the bills we already have. Default is not an \noption.\n  Some Republicans, particularly in the House, have suggested that the \nFederal Government can prioritize its payments to avoid a technical \ndefault. Some have dubbed this ``pay China first'' because, as my \ncolleagues know, much of our public debt is held by the Chinese. It is \ndisturbing that our Republican colleagues are considering such a \nproposal. It simply won't work. The Federal Government makes 80 million \nto 100 million payments monthly, including Social Security, veteran \nbenefits, military salaries, and Medicare reimbursements. The Treasury \nDepartment doesn't have the manpower, the computer capability, or the \nguidelines to sort out who gets paid when.\n  The Bipartisan Policy Center has prepared a comprehensive analysis of \nwhat happens if we hit the so-called X-date without lifting the debt \nceiling. As the Bipartisan Policy Center notes, ``The reality will be \nchaotic,'' with the Treasury Department being forced to pick \n``winners'' and ``losers.'' We might have to shut down the entire \nJustice Department, the Federal courts, the\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\nFederal Highway Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, \nand other agencies. These are critically important missions that people \nin this country depend upon. We might have to suspend tax refunds--\nrefunds taxpayers desperately need. We might have to stop paying \nFederal workers, 30 percent of whom are veterans and contractors. As \nthe Bipartisan Policy Center notes, ``On a day-to-day basis, handling \nall payments for important and popular programs, (e.g., Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, Defense, Military Active Duty Pay) will \nquickly become impossible.''\n  Delaying the decision to increase the debt limit jeopardizes our \neconomy and our standing in the world. The mere suggestion that the \nFederal Government might miss a payment caused Standard & Poor's to \ndowngrade our sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA-plus after the \n2011 debt limit standoff.\n  A default is a default. We can't pick winners and losers. If we \ndefault on any of our debt, it will affect our creditworthiness and our \nbond ratings. If we don't transfer the payments to State and local \ngovernments--and a large part of our budget depends upon them receiving \ntheir Federal share of programs--it will cause State and local \ngovernments to default, affecting their bond ratings and increasing the \ncost of borrowing, a hidden tax--not a hidden tax--an additional tax to \nthe taxpayers of this country.\n  During the last debt limit showdown in 2013, yields for targeted \nsecurities in secondary markets rose from 1 basis point in mid-\nSeptember to over 50 basis points just prior to the resolution of the \nstandoff in October. The Government Accounting Office estimates that \nthe 2013 impasse cost the Federal Government between $38 million and \n$70 million in added interest payments to service the debt. This is \nwhat taxpayers had to pay because Congress did not in a timely way \nincrease the debt limit. So it is not only the default, it is the time \nwe take. We have to act now. We should have acted well before now. If \nwe keep playing with fire, we are going to get burned and burned badly.\n  In addition to lifting the debt ceiling, which needs to be done \nfirst, we need to negotiate a comprehensive budget deal. Last week \nadministration officials announced that the fiscal year 2015 deficit \nwas $44 billion--$44 billion--less than the previous year. Last year's \ndeficit was $439 billion. This is still too high, but let's put the \nnumber in context. It was the lowest share of our economy--at 2.5 \npercent--since 2007. As Treasury Secretary Lew pointed out, under the \nPresident's leadership, the deficit has been cut by roughly three-\nquarters as a share of the economy since 2009--the fastest sustained \ndeficit reduction since just after World War II.\n  It is important to remember that the previous administration--the \nBush administration--inherited the biggest surpluses in history and \npromptly squandered them on two ill-conceived tax cuts and a war in \nIraq that was paid for on a credit card.\n  Then we had the biggest recession since the Great Depression. This \nwas the situation the Obama administration inherited--from surpluses to \ndeficits to recession. The Obama administration took effective, \nextraordinary measures to pull the economy back from the brink. \nEconomists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, writing for the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities, estimated that without the measures taken \nin late 2008 and early 2009 the peak-to-trough decline in real gross \ndomestic product, which was barely over 4 percent, would have been \nclose to a stunning 14 percent; the economy would have contracted by \nmore than 3 years, more than twice as long as it did; more than 17 \nmillion jobs would have been lost, about twice the actual number; the \nunemployment rates would have peaked at just under 16 percent, rather \nthan the actual 10 percent; the budget deficit would have grown to more \nthan 20 percent of GDP, about double the actual 10 percent, topping off \nat $2.8 trillion in fiscal year 2011.\n  My point is that the actions taken by the Obama administration pulled \nour economy out of recession and back to growth. It did it in a \nresponsible manner. So we took emergency measures necessary to stop the \neconomic free fall, and since then we have had the fastest deficit \nreduction since just after World War II.\n  We are now using a different policy, as we should. I mention that \nbecause our Republican colleagues want to cut domestic spending even \nmore. That is not sustainable. As the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities noted last year, spending cuts have exceeded tax increases \nby a 3-to-1 margin already. Put another way, for every dollar of new \nrevenue we have received, we have cut spending by $3.27. We have \ncontracted, particularly on the discretionary domestic side.\n  We need to come together and negotiate a deal that keeps the Federal \nGovernment open, not shut. The 2013 shutdown, according to Moody's \nAnalytics, cost the economy $20 billion and 120,000 jobs. Still, the \nso-called tea party Republicans and Presidential candidates want to \nshut down the government right before the holidays in a misguided \nnotion that it will somehow prevent Planned Parenthood from providing \nhealth care services to low-income women and their families. Two years \nago, the same individuals thought that shutting down the government \nwould prevent the Affordable Care Act from being implemented. They were \nwrong then, and they are wrong now. The damage they did--and could do \nagain--is to our economy and our standing in the world.\n  A realistic budget deal will need to protect Federal workers from \nfurther harm. Since 2011 Federal workers have contributed $159 billion \nto deficit reduction. Federal workers have contributed $159 billion to \ndeficit reduction. They didn't cause the deficit. They have endured 3 \nyears of pay freezes and two substandard pay increases since then for a \ntotal of $137 billion. They lost another billion dollars in pay because \nof sequestration-related furloughs. Federal employees hired in 2013 and \nsince 2014 are paying an extra $21 billion for their pensions.\n  Each and every Federal worker is being asked to do more with less as \nagency budgets have been frozen or cut. This is happening to \nhardworking, patriotic public servants who are mostly middle class and \nstruggling to get along as are so many other Americans. Enough is \nenough.\n  Since the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. population has increased by 76 \npercent and the private sector workforce has surged 133 percent, but \nthe size of the Federal workforce has risen just 11 percent. Relative \nto the private sector, the Federal workforce is less than one-half the \nsize it was back in the 1950s and 1960s. The picture that emerges is \none of a Federal civilian workforce whose size has significantly shrunk \ncompared to the U.S. population it serves, the private sector \nworkforce, and the magnitude of its various missions and Federal \nexpenditures.\n  Additionally, picking on Federal workers in a budget deal or shutting \ndown the government hurts veterans. Over 30 percent of civilian Federal \nemployees are veterans, compared to 7.8 percent of the non-Federal \nworkforce. The Federal Government hires a lot more veterans--30 percent \nof our workforce--another reason we should be mindful of what we do to \nour Federal workforce. Do we really want to cut the pay and benefits \nfor these individuals even more than we have already? Do we really want \nto force them to work during a shutdown but not pay them on time or \nforce them to stay home involuntarily and have them worry about whether \nthey will be paid at all? Is this how we want to honor the men and \nwomen who stood in harm's way to defend our Nation and who continue to \nserve us?\n  The missions that are carried out by our Federal workforce are great \nmissions, and they perform more work in a smaller workforce. It is time \nto recognize what they do for our country. Preventing Federal workers \nfrom doing their jobs doesn't just harm them; it harms all Americans \nbecause Federal workers control our borders and make sure our air and \nwater are clean and our food and drugs are safe. They support our men \nand women in uniform and care for our wounded warriors. They help our \nmanufacturers compete abroad, discover cures for life-threatening \ndiseases, and prosecute criminals and terrorists. They maintain and \nprotect critical infrastructure, explore the universe, process passport \napplications, and make sure Social Security, Medicare, and other social \nsafety net programs are functioning properly. When Federal workers do \ntheir jobs, they are\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nhelping each and every American live a safer and more prosperous life.\n  Our tasks here in Congress should be straightforward. First, we need \nto raise the debt ceiling so we can continue to pay our bills and \nmaintain the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Second, we \nneed to keep the Federal Government open for business and keep the \nFederal workers on their jobs. Third, we need to negotiate a \ncomprehensive budget deal that replaces sequestration--a budget that \nmaintains critical Federal investments while spreading the burden of \ndeficit reduction in a fair way and holding Federal workers and their \nfamilies harmless after subjecting them to so much hardship over the \npast several months and years. Fourth, we need to reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank, a bank that helps us with a level playing field on \ninternational commerce, particularly with small companies, and we must \nreauthorize our surface transportation program on a 6-year \nreauthorization. You can't do a major highway, bridge, or transit \nprogram with a Federal partner that gives only a couple months of \ncommitment. We need to have a multi-year transportation reauthorization \npassed.\n  Heretofore, one of the greatest attributes of the American character \nhas been pragmatism. We can acknowledge and respect our differences, \nbut at the end of the day the American people have entrusted us with \ngoverning. That means being pragmatic, sitting down, listening to each \nother, compromising, and providing policies that will stand the test of \ntime. Let us do our job on behalf of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is easy for the public and the press to \nfocus on the issues that divide us in Washington, DC, and around the \ncountry. In fact, in Washington, DC, that is a world-class sport--\nfocusing on division, the things that separate us, the things where we \nclearly can't agree, on occasion--but today I am happy to highlight an \narea marked by broad consensus and true bipartisan spirit.\n  In my time in the Senate I have learned that neither political party \ncan get what they want done if they try to do it alone. The only way \nthings happen are when consensus is achieved, and that takes a lot of \nhard work, a lot of cooperation, and a lot of collaboration. If your \ngoal is 100 percent of what you want or nothing, my experience is you \nget nothing here.\n  I know ``compromise'' sometimes is a dirty word in today's lexicon. I \nwas just rereading a quote from Ronald Reagan, somebody conservatives \nlook to as an example of the iconic conservative leader. He was pretty \nclear that if he could get 75 to 80 percent of what he wanted to \nachieve, he would say: I will take it, and I will fight about the rest \nof it another day.\n  But the good news is we have found a way, amidst a lot of the \ndivision and polarization here, to achieve a bipartisan coalition on \nsome important criminal justice reforms. Last week I stood with a \nbipartisan group and introduced the Sentencing Reform and Corrections \nAct of 2015. This has literally been years in the making, and it was a \nproud and consequential moment for the Senate.\n\n  This week we have kept that momentum going. Senator Grassley, \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, held a hearing Monday to discuss \nthe new bill with various stakeholders, and tomorrow the Judiciary \nCommittee will vote on sending the bill to the full Senate for \nconsideration.\n  This legislation is long overdue and a major step forward for the \ncountry. Similar to other successful efforts--and particularly those \nthat inform my actions in the Senate--I look to experiences in the \nState and what has been tried, tested, and found to work and how it \nmight apply to our job here at the national level.\n  Back in 2007, in Austin, legislators were confronting a big problem. \nThey had a major budget shortfall, an overcrowded prison system, and \nhigh rates of recidivism--repeat criminals--or as one former inmate \nreferred to himself in Houston the other day at a roundtable I held, he \ncalled himself a frequent flier in the criminal justice system. I think \nwe all know what he meant. But instead of building more prisons and \nhoping that would somehow fix the problem, these leaders in Austin \ndecided to try a different approach. They scrapped the blueprints for \nmore prisons, and they went to work developing reforms to help low- and \nmedium-risk offenders who were willing to take the opportunity to turn \naround their lives and become productive members of society.\n  I think we would have to be pretty naive to say that every criminal \noffender who ends up in prison is going to take advantage of these \nopportunities. They will not--not all of them will, but some of them \nwill. Some of them will be remorseful. Some of them will see how they \nwasted their life, the damage they have done to their families, \nincluding their children, and they will actually look for an \nopportunity to turn around their lives after having made a major \nmistake and ending up in our prisons.\n  In my State, we have a pretty well-deserved reputation for being \ntough on crime. I don't think anybody questions that, but we also \nrealize we need to be smart on crime, and we need to look at how we \nachieve the best outcomes for the taxpayers and for the lives which can \nbe salvaged and made productive through their hard work and the \nopportunity we have provided to them. We also realized that even though \nincarceration does work--I don't think anybody can dispute the fact \nthat when somebody is in prison, they are not committing crimes in our \ncommunities and across the country--but here is the rub: One day almost \nall of them will be released from prison. The question then is, Will \nthey be prepared to live a\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\nproductive life or will they be that frequent flier who ends up back in \nprison through the turnstile of a criminal life?\n  So in Texas we improved and increased programs designed to help men \nand women to take responsibility for their crimes and to prepare them \nfor reentry into society. The results were pretty startling. Between \n2007 and 2012, our overall rate of incarceration fell by 9.4 percent--\nalmost 10 percent--the crime rate dropped by 16 percent, and we saved \nmore than $2 billion worth of taxpayer money and we were able to \nshutter three prison facilities in the process.\n  I wish to return briefly to the crime rate. Former Attorney General \nMukasey, a longtime Federal judge in New York, made the point that it \nis not the incarceration rate that measures the success of our \nsentencing practices, it is actually the crime rate.\n  I know there are many people who feel we have overincarcerated, but I \nthink we need to keep our eye on the ball; that is, on the crime rate. \nAs a result of these reforms in Texas, our total crime rate dropped by \n16 percent, something worth paying attention to, but even more \nimpressive than these statistics are the stories I have heard from \nformer inmates who have actually taken advantage of this opportunity to \nturn around their lives. They paint a powerful picture of how these \nreforms can be used and the potential impact of this legislation across \nthe country.\n  Again, nobody is naive enough to think everybody is going to have a \nturnaround story and experience like this, but last week I had the \nchance to visit with a number of faith-based and nonprofit groups in \nHouston this time, as well as some of the former inmates they have \nsupported--all of whom are helping inmates prepare to reenter society \nset up for success rather than failure.\n  I was particularly struck by the story of one young man by the name \nof Emilio Parker. By the time he was 33, Emilio had spent almost half \nof his life in prison, including several years in solitary confinement. \nHe started using drugs at a very early age, and after he became \naddicted he found more and more opportunities for crime to feed his \naddiction. Spending so much time in prison leaves little chance to \nacquire skills to succeed once you are outside, but fortunately for \nEmilio he found the support needed in a group called SER-Jobs for \nProgress in Houston. SER stands for Service Employment Redevelopment. A \nstrange acronym, SER, but it is a community group whose mission is to \nequip people such as Emilio for the workforce. Their organization has \nhelped turn around many lives in astounding ways, and Emilio was no \nexception.\n  When he started the job readiness program SER offered, he didn't know \nhow to turn on a computer, but with their help he graduated with the \nprogram, and it helped put him on a new direction in life--one that did \nnot include prison.\n  His success represents the tremendous opportunity we have before us \nto enact similar reforms on the Federal level in order to offer \nrehabilitation to inmates, reduce crime, and save taxpayers' hard-\nearned money.\n  Part of this legislation is to focus on the people most likely to \ntake advantage of these opportunities, low- and medium-risk inmates. \nIndeed, what we offer them is credit, if they participate in these \nprograms, to lesser confinement; for example, a halfway house or the \nlike. These are the folks we believe are most likely to have learned \nfrom their experience in prison and will take advantage of the \nopportunity and turn around their lives. High-risk criminals who have \nmade a life of crime I think are the least likely to take advantage of \nthese programs and will not be available under this legislation. If it \nis successful, we might want to reconsider that and see whether it can \nbe expanded.\n  The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act truly represents how the \nSenate was meant to function: in a bipartisan manner that can effect \nlong-lasting change for the benefit of the American people.\n  I thank Chairman Grassley for his leadership--this would not have \nhappened without him--and his commitment to bring us together to \ndevelop a bill that provides needed reforms to our criminal justice \nsystem. This is an extraordinary moment, where we have people on \ndiffering ends of the political spectrum coming together and finding a \nplace where we can reach consensus.\n  I am particularly pleased, as I have indicated, that the CORRECTIONS \nAct, authored by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and me, is such a key part \nof this package. Pretty much everyone agrees our prisons are \ndangerously overcrowded and that recidivism rates--when offenders land \nback in prison--are too high. The hard part is coming up with a \nsolution that addresses these problems and yet breaks the cycle of \nreincarceration without jeopardizing public safety. And nothing we are \ndoing will jeopardize public safety. That should be the litmus test of \nanything we do. I do believe this legislation strikes that balance by \nbuilding on our experience in Texas and other States across the country \nand focusing on rehabilitation for low-level offenders and tough \nsentences for hardened criminals.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, who was attorney general of his State \nof Alaska, has had a lot of experience in this area. I remember in law \nschool one of the things we learned is that one of the goals of our \ncriminal justice system is to rehabilitate people--to help them turn \naround their lives--but over the years we have almost forgotten that. I \nthink what we have demonstrated by the Texas experience--and other \nexperience--is that through faith-based volunteers, through job \ntraining, through helping people deal with their drug and alcohol \naddiction--which oftentimes exacerbates their problems and puts them \nbehind bars, like Emilio--we can literally offer a helping hand for \nthose who will take advantage of it. For those who are truly nonviolent \nand low-level offenders, this bill does represent a second chance.\n  This bill also reforms and improves law enforcement tools, such as \nmandatory minimum sentences, without eliminating them or reducing them \nacross the board. This was a tough negotiation because, in particular, \nsome of our Senators were focused on sentence reduction, but I have to \nsay I have been very aware that we can't handle this on an across-the-\nboard basis. Sentences have to be appropriate for the individual \nbehavior and misconduct of the defendant themselves, not just some \nacross-the-board panacea. By targeting those who are most likely to \nreoffend and teaching them how to succeed in the real world, we can not \nonly reduce the crime rate--as our experience has shown in Texas--but \nhelp people turn around their lives and save billions of dollars.\n  So at a time when the news likes to report the divisions and \npolarizations here in Washington--and there are plenty of important \nfights, and I am not opposed to fighting for principles, but there are \na lot of areas like this where we can continue to work together \nproductively. In fact, as I said earlier, the whole system of our \nConstitution was designed to force consensus before big decisions such \nas this are made. That is the way it should be because any time a \nminority or even one political party can force their will on the other \nparty--as we have seen happen before--it doesn't end well. When our \nsystem works the way it should, by people of good faith coming \ntogether, seeing a problem, trying to come up with a solution, and \nworking together on a bipartisan basis, our system works very well. I \nbelieve this is a good example.\n  I look forward to working with all of our colleagues once this bill \nis voted out of the Judiciary Committee--which I believe it will be on \nThursday--as we anticipate action here on the floor. Perhaps other \nSenators have other ideas that will actually improve the legislation we \nhave crafted so far, but I do believe the President is amenable to \nconsidering a bill in this area. He has said so publicly. Again, this \nis another of those rare opportunities we can have to work together \nwith the President to try to solve a problem, help save money, and help \npeople turn around their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I will vote for the cyber security bill. \nObviously, this is a whole new era of attack on our country. On \nSeptember 11, 2001, we certainly realized that the two big oceans on \neither side of our country that had protected us for centuries--the \nAtlantic and the Pacific--no longer provided that protection because we \ncould see, in the case of 2001, an attack from within. Thus, that \nrevised so much of our defense strategy.\n  Now we see the other kind of attack from within that is stealthy, \ninsidious, and it is constant because the cyber attacks are coming to \nthe U.S. Government as well as the U.S. industry, the business \ncommunity, and U.S. citizens. The threat of cyber attack is vast and it \nis varied, from cyber criminals who steal personal information such as \ncredit card and Social Security numbers, to foreign governments or \nstate-sponsored groups that steal sensitive national security \ninformation, that steal our intellectual property, and that put at risk \nour economy and critical infrastructure.\n  I want to give one example of obtaining Social Security numbers \nthrough cyber attacks or through other means. What we found in Tampa, \nFL, is that street crime actually subsided because the criminals had \nfigured that either by cyber attacks or by other means of getting \nSocial Security numbers, they could file false income tax returns and \nrequest refunds. So with a laptop, they could do what they had done \npreviously by breaking into and entering someone's home to steal money, \nand it was so much easier. And that is just one small example, but just \nthe theft of security numbers, which they use on false income tax \nreturns--we think that is an attack which is costing the U.S. \nGovernment, in income tax, at least $5 billion a year.\n  We have heard all about these attacks. Some of us in the Senate have \nbeen affected by these attacks. How many times have we heard that \nhackers have stolen our names, our addresses, our credit card numbers? \nLook what the hackers did to 40 million Target customers and 56 million \nHome Depot customers. They accessed checking and savings account \ninformation of 76 million J.P. Morgan Bank customers. They stole the \npersonal information of 80 million customers of the health insurance \ncompany Anthem. Those are a few examples. Target, Home Depot, J.P. \nMorgan, Anthem--that is just a handful of examples. Also, remember that \nNorth Korea hacked Sony. Iran hacked the Sands Casino. China hacked the \nU.S. Government Office of Personnel Management. They have your \ninformation and they have my information because our information is \nwith the Office of Personnel Management.\n  The attacks keep coming. We are hearing from homeland security, \ndefense, intelligence, and private sector leaders that we have to take \nthis threat seriously and do something about it.\n  I must say that it was one of the most frustrating things for this \nSenator, as a former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, when \nwe were trying to pass this very same bill 3 and 4 years ago and the \nbusiness community, as represented by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nwanted nothing to do with it because they thought it was an invasion of \ntheir privacy. Times have changed, and the hacking continues.\n  We see that finally we are able to get through and put together a \nbill on which I think we can get broad support from many different \ngroups that are concerned about privacy and about sharing of \ninformation in the business community. This bill provides the means for \nthe government and the private sector to share cyber threat information \nwhile taking care to protect the personal information and privacy of \nour people. We all face the same threat, and our adversaries use \nsimilar malware and techniques. Sharing information is critical to our \noverall cyber security.\n  What this does is it directs the Director of National Intelligence, \nworking with other agencies and building on the information sharing \nthat is already taking place, to put cyber threat information in the \nhands of the private sector to help protect businesses and individuals. \nIt authorizes private companies to monitor and defend their networks \nand share with each other and the government at all levels the cyber \nthreats and attacks--all levels of government: State, local, tribal, \nand Federal. This is a point of contention because these activities are \nstrictly voluntary. That is part of the problem we had 3 and 4 years \nago in trying to enact this legislation. It is strictly voluntary, \nlimited to cyber security purposes, and subject to reasonable \nrestrictions and privacy protections.\n  The bill also creates the legal certainty and incentives needed to \npromote further sharing of information.\n  So what the legislation does is it sets up a hub or a portal inside \nthe Department of Homeland Security where cyber threat information \ncomes in, it is scrubbed of irrelevant personal information, and then \nit is shared inside and outside the government quickly and efficiently \nbecause, after all, if you have a cyber attack somewhere in America \nthat suddenly has the opportunity to explode in its application, you \nhave to have a central point at which you can coordinate that cyber \nattack. That is what this portal, this hub in the Department of \nHomeland Security is set up to do.\n  This Senator feels that this bill balances the urgent need to address \nthe threat of continued cyber attacks with privacy concerns. As the \nvice chair of the Intelligence Committee said yesterday, this bill is \njust the first step.\n  I am delighted that Senator Feinstein just walked onto the floor of \nthe Senate. I am quoting what the Senator said yesterday: We can and we \nought to do more to improve our Nation's cyber security.\n  I say through the Chair to the distinguished senior Senator from \nCalifornia that I have shared with the Senate my frustration over the \nlast 4 years, as a former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nthat it was so hard to get people to come together. But now, finally, \neven though it is voluntary, we at least have a point at which, when a \ncyber attack comes somewhere in America, we can centralize that, it can \nbe scrubbed of private information, and then it can be shared in our \nmultiplicity of levels of government and the private sector to help \ndefend against the cyber attacks.\n  These cyber attacks are coming every day. They are relentless. If we \ndon't watch out, what is going to happen has already happened to \nsomeone and it is going to be happening to innumerable American \nbusinesses. I strongly urge the Senate to pass this legislation.\n  Since the senior Senator from California is on the floor, I wish to \ntake this opportunity to thank her for her perspicacity, her patience, \nand her stick-to-itiveness. Finally, 4 years later, it is here, and we \nare going to pass it this week. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida said.\n  Senator, you know what a pleasure it was to have you on the \nintelligence committee. I think you understand the time that we have \nspent to get this bill done, which is now about 6 years, and to take \nthis first step, not because it is a perfect step but because it is a \nfirst step that is voluntary, with new authorities that people and \ncompanies can use if they want to, and if they don't want to, they \ndon't have to. If they want to, it can be effective in enabling \ncompanies to share cyber security information and therefore protect \nthemselves. I know you understand this. I am so grateful for that \nunderstanding and for your help.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will.\n  Mr. NELSON. Will the Senator share her thoughts with the Senate about \nhow the Nation's national security defense depends on us being able--we \nhave the guns, the tanks, the airplanes, the missiles, and all of that, \nbut there is a new type of threat against the very security of this \nNation, and this legislation is a first step.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I can try to. I remember that in 2008 there were two \nsignificant cyber bank robberies: the Royal Bank of Scotland, I think \nfor $8 million, and Citibank for $10 million. This was not public right \naway because nobody wanted it known. Then you see the more recent \nattacks of Aramco\n\n[[Page S7377]]\n\nbeing taken down, Sony, and it goes on and on. The information is not \noften shared publicly by companies who should be asking: This happened \nto our company; can you share anything that might help us handle this? \nThat kind of thing doesn't happen because everybody is afraid of \nliability, and so it is very concerning.\n\n  I remember when Joe Lieberman was chairman of the homeland security \ncommittee, which had a bill. As the Senator will remember, we had the \ninformation sharing part of that bill, and we sat down with the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, I believe on three occasions, to try to work out \ndifferences, and we couldn't. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is massive \nand all over the United States. It includes small businesses, medium-\nsized businesses, and some big businesses, and there was deep concern \namong its members. That took years to work out.\n  Finally, the Senate may be ready to take a first step, and this first \nstep is to permit the voluntary sharing of cyber information, which, if \nit is stripped of private data, will be protected with liability \nimmunity and protected because it goes through a single DHS portal and \ndoesn't go directly to the intelligence community, which was a big \nconcern to the private community. All of this has been worked out in \norder to try to come up with a basis for taking this first step.\n  I am sorry the Senator is no longer on our committee because my \nfriend was really a great asset, and Florida is lucky to have my friend \nand colleague as their Senator.\n  This is just the beginning. All of the iterations on this cyber \nlegislation have been bipartisan, so that has to say something to \npeople. We have learned as we have done the drafting on this, and we \nhave very good staff who are technically proficient. So they know what \ncan work and what can't work.\n  I hope I have answered that question from the Senator from Florida. \nIf I can, I will go on and make some remarks on the managers' \namendment.\n  Yesterday Senator Burr and I spoke on this floor to describe the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, which is now the pending \nbusiness. Senator Burr filed a managers' package on behalf of both of \nus, and I will quickly run through that package.\n  This amendment is the product of bipartisan negotiations over the \npast several weeks within the Intelligence Committee and with sponsors \nof other amendments to the bill. The managers' amendment makes several \nkey changes to the bill to clarify authorization language, improve \nprivacy protections, and make technical changes. It also--and I think \nthis is of note--includes the text of 14 separate amendments. Those \namendments were offered by our colleagues and I am pleased that we are \nable to add them to this legislation.\n  In sum, this amendment has two main components. It makes important \nchanges to the bill that we announced in August to address privacy \nconcerns about the legislation. Second, it includes several amendments \nauthored by our colleagues that had agreement on both sides of the \naisle. I will run through these amendments that will be part of the \nmanagers' package, and I do so hopefully to reassure Members that these \nare positive amendments.\n  First, it eliminates a provision on government use of cyber \ninformation on noncyber crime. The managers' amendment eliminates a \nprovision in the committee-passed bill that would have allowed the \ngovernment to use cyber information to investigate and prosecute \n``serious violent felonies.'' Eliminating this provision is a very \nsignificant privacy change. We made this change because it has been a \ntop bipartisan concern and the provision had been used by privacy \ngroups to claim that this is a surveillance bill. As the chairman made \nclear on the floor yesterday, it is not. One of the reasons it is not \nis because it prohibits the government from using information for \ncrimes unrelated to cyber security.\n  Let me be clear. The chairman said it, and I will say it today. This \nis not a surveillance bill. We have eliminated this provision and \nhelped, I believe, to eliminate these concerns. So, please, let us not \nspeak of this bill as something that it isn't.\n  Second, it limits the authorization to share cyber threat information \nto cyber security purposes. The managers' amendment limits the \nauthorization for sharing cyber threat information provided in the bill \nto sharing for cyber security purposes only. This is another \nsignificant privacy change, and it has been another top bipartisan and \nprivacy group concern.\n  Third, it eliminates a new FOIA exemption. The managers' amendment \neliminated the creation of a new exemption in the Freedom of \nInformation Act specific to cyber information that was in the \ncommittee-passed bill. Cyber threat indicators and defensive measures \nshared in accordance with the bill's procedures would still be eligible \nfor existing FOIA exemptions, but it doesn't add new ones.\n  Four, it ensures that defensive measures are properly limited. The \nbill allows a company to take measures to defend itself, as one might \nexpect, and the managers' amendment clarifies that the authorization to \nemploy defensive measures does not allow an entity to gain unauthorized \naccess to a computer network.\n  Five, it includes the Secretary of Homeland Security as coauthor of \nthe government-sharing guidelines. The managers' amendment directs both \nthe Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, rather \nthan solely just the Attorney General, to develop policies and \nprocedures to govern how the government quickly and appropriately \nshares information about cyber threats. That should be a no-brainer.\n  Six, it clarifies exceptions to the Department of Homeland Security's \nso-called portal. The managers' amendment clarifies the types of cyber \ninformation sharing that are permitted to occur outside the DHS portal \ncreated by the bill. Specifically, the bill narrows communications \noutside of the Department of Homeland Security portal regarding \npreviously shared cyber threat information.\n  Seven, it requires procedures for notifying U.S. persons whose \npersonal information has been shared by a Federal entity in violation \nof the bill. The managers' amendment adds a modified version of Wyden \namendment No. 2622, which requires the government to write procedures \nfor notifying U.S. persons whose personal information is known or \ndetermined to have been shared by the Federal Government in a manner \ninconsistent with this act.\n  Eight, it clarifies the real-time automated process for sharing \nthrough the DHS portal. Here the managers' amendment adds a modified \nversion of the Carper amendment No. 2615, which clarifies that there \nmay be situations under which the automated real-time process of the \nDHS portal may result in very limited instances of delay, modification \nor other action due to the controls established for the process. The \nclarification requires that all appropriate Federal entities agree in \nadvance to the filters, fields or other aspects of the automated \nsharing system before such delays, modifications or other actions are \npermitted.\n  Senator Carper has played a very positive role on this issue. He is \nthe ranking member on the homeland security committee. He sat down with \nboth Senator Burr and me earlier this year. He has proposed some very \ngood changes, and this is one of them, which is in the managers' \npackage.\n  Also, the clarification ensures that such agreed-upon delays will \napply across the board uniformly to all appropriate Federal entities, \nincluding the Department of Homeland Security.\n  This was an important change for both Senator Carper and Senator \nCoons and for the Department of Homeland Security. I am pleased we were \nable to reach agreement on it. Essentially, it will allow a fast real-\ntime filter--and I understand this can be done--that will do an \nadditional scrub of information going through that portal before the \ncyber information goes to other departments to take out anything that \nmight be related to personal information, such as a driver's license \nnumber, an account, a Social Security number or whatever it may be. DHS \nbelieves they can put together the technology to be able to do that \nscrub in as close to real time as possible.\n  This should be very meaningful to the privacy community, and I really \nhope it is meaningful because I want to believe that their actions are \nnot just to try to defeat this bill, but that their actions really are \nto make the bill better. If I am right, this is a very important \naddition.\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Carper and Senator Coons, and I also thank the \nchairman for agreeing to put this in.\n  Nine, it clarifies that private entities are not required to share \ninformation with the Federal Government or another private entity. This \nis clear now. This amendment adds the Flake amendment No. 2580, which \nreinforces this bill's core voluntary nature by clarifying that private \nentities are not required to share information with the Federal \nGovernment or another private entity.\n  In other words, if you don't like the bill, you don't have to do it. \nSo it is hard for me to understand why companies are saying they can't \nsupport the bill at this time. There is no reason not to support it \nbecause they don't have to do anything. There are companies by the \nhundreds, if not thousands, that want to participate in this, and this \nwe know.\n  Ten, it adds a Federal cyber security enhancement title. The \nmanagers' amendment adds a modified version of another Carper \namendment, which is No. 2627, the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act \nof 2015, as a new title II of the cyber bill. The amendment seeks to \nimprove Federal network security and authorize and enhance an existing \nintrusion detection and prevention system for civilian Federal \nnetworks.\n  Eleventh, we add a study on mobile device security. The managers' \namendment adds a modified version of the Coats amendment No. 2604, \nwhich requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out a study \nand report to Congress on the cyber security threats to mobile devices \nof the Federal Government.\n  I wish to thank Senator Coats, who is a distinguished member of the \nIntelligence Committee and understands this bill well, for this \namendment.\n  Twelfth, it adds a requirement for the Secretary of State to produce \nan international cyber space policy strategy. The managers' amendment \nadds Gardner/Cardin amendment No. 2631, which requires the Secretary of \nState to produce a comprehensive strategy focused on United States \ninternational policy with regard to cyber space.\n  It is about time we do something like this. I am personally grateful \nto both Senators Gardner and Cardin for this amendment.\n  Thirteenth, the managers' amendment adds a reporting provision \nconcerning the apprehension and prosecution of international cyber \ncriminals. The managers' amendment adds a modified version of Kirk-\nGillibrand amendment No. 2603, which requires the Secretary of State to \nengage in consultations with the appropriate government officials of \nany country in which one or more cyber criminals are physically present \nand to submit an annual report to appropriate congressional committees \non such cyber criminals.\n  It is about time that we get to the point where we can begin to make \npublic more about cyber attacks from abroad because it is venal, it is \nstartling, it is continuing, and in its continuation, it is growing \ninto a real monster. Let there be no doubt about that.\n  Fourteenth, it improves the contents of the biennial report on \nimplementation of the bill. The managers' amendment adds a modified \nversion of the Tester amendment No. 2632, which requires detailed \nreporting on, No. 1, the number of cyber threat indicators received \nunder the DHS portal process--good, let's know--and, No. 2, the number \nof times information shared under this bill is used to prosecute \ncertain cyber criminals. If we can catch them, we should. We should \nknow when prosecutions are made. Then, No. 3 is the number of notices \nthat were issued, if any, for a failure to remove personal information \nin accordance with the requirements of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I am spending a great deal of time on these details \nbecause there are rumors beginning to circulate that the bill does this \nor does that, which are not correct. This managers' package is a major \neffort to encapsulate what Members on both sides had concerns about. \nAnd I think the numbers of Republican and Democratic amendments that \nare incorporated are about equal.\n  Fifteenth, this managers' amendment improves the periodic sharing of \ncyber security best practices with a focus on small businesses. The \nmanagers' amendment adds the Shaheen amendment No. 2597, which promotes \nthe periodic sharing of cyber security best practices that are \ndeveloped in order to assist small businesses as they improve their \ncyber security.\n  I think this is an excellent amendment and Senator Shaheen should be \ncommended.\n  Sixteenth, the managers' amendment adds a Federal cyber security \nworkforce assessment title. The managers' amendment adds Bennet-Portman \namendment No. 2558, the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act, \nas a new title III to this bill. The title addresses the need to \nrecruit a highly qualified cyber workforce across the Federal \nGovernment.\n  There are just a few more, but, again, I do this to show--and the \nchairman is here--that we have listened to the concerns from our \ncolleagues and we have tried to address them, so nobody should feel we \nare ramming through a bill and that we haven't considered the views \nfrom others. The managers' amendment is, in fact, a major change to the \nbill that reflects this collegial--sometimes a little more exercised, \nbut collegial--discussion. Does the chairman agree?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say that I \ntotally agree. The vice chairman and I have worked aggressively for the \nentirety of the year where we had differences, and we found ways to \nbridge those differences, where we heard from Members, where we heard \nfrom associations, where we heard from businesses. We worked with them \nto try to accommodate their wishes, as long as it stayed within the \nspirit of what we were trying to accomplish, which is information \nsharing in a voluntary capacity.\n  The vice chair and I came to the floor yesterday and said if an \namendment--if an initiative falls outside of that, then we will stand \nup and oppose it because we understand the role this legislation should \nplay in the process.\n  The vice chairman said this is the first step. I don't want to scare \nMembers, but there are some other steps. We are not sure what they are \ntoday or we would be on the floor suggesting those, but if we can't \ntake the first step, then it is hard to figure out what the next and \nthe next and the next are. So I am committed to continuing to work with \nthe vice chairman and, more importantly, with all Members to \nincorporate their great suggestions as long as we all stay headed in \nthe same direction, and I know the vice chairman and I are doing that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman very much. If I \nmay, through the Chair, I want the chairman to know how much I \nappreciate this tack he has taken to be flexible and willing throughout \nthis process, which extends into this managers' package. So I believe--\nI truly believe--what we have come up with in this managers' package \nand what Members have contributed to it makes it a better cyber bill. I \nknow the chairman feels the same way. We can just march on shoulder to \nshoulder and hopefully get this done.\n  I will finish up the few other items I have to discuss because I want \npeople who have concerns to listen to what is being said because these \nchanges have a major impact on the bill.\n  Next, No. 17 establishes a process by which data on cyber security \nrisks or incidents involving emergency response information systems can \nbe reported. The managers' amendment adds Heitkamp amendment No. 2555, \nwhich requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a \nprocess by which a statewide interoperability coordinator may report \ndata on any cyber security risk or incident involving emergency \nresponse information systems or networks. This is a process for \nreporting, and certainly we need to know more.\n  Next, No. 18 requires a report on the preparedness of the health care \nindustry to respond to cyber security threats, and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a health care industry cyber \nsecurity task force. The managers' amendment adds Alexander-Murray \namendment No. 2719. This is a reporting requirement to improve the \ncyber security posture of the health care industry.\n  I don't think anyone wants to have their health care data hacked \ninto. This is deeply personal material and it should be inviolate.\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\n  The provision requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nsubmit a report to Congress on the preparedness of the health care \nindustry to respond to cyber security threats. If we really want to \nhelp protect health care information, we have to know what is going on, \nand that is what this amendment enables. It also requires the Secretary \nto establish a health care industry cyber security task force.\n  Next is No. 19, which requires new reports by inspectors general. The \nmanagers' amendment adds a modified version of the Hatch amendment No. \n2712, which requires relevant agency inspectors general to file reports \nwith appropriate committees on the logical access standards and \ncontrols within their agencies.\n  Let's know what standards and what controls they have. I think it is \na very prudent request of the Senator from Utah, and I am glad we were \nable to include it.\n  Next is No. 20, which adds a requirement for the DHS Secretary to \ndevelop a strategy to protect critical infrastructure at the greatest \nrisk of a cybersecurity attack. The managers' amendment adds the \nCollins amendment No. 2623, which requires DHS to identify critical \ninfrastructure entities at the greatest risk of a catastrophic cyber \nsecurity incident.\n  This is where we have had a number of concerns recently. The \nchairman's staff and my staff are working on this. Remember, this is a \nvoluntary bill, and we do not want any language that might be \ninterpreted to imply that this is not a voluntary bill. I know Senator \nCollins has a lot of knowledge of this area, and I believe we are going \nto be able to work this out.\n  This amendment does not convey any new authorities to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security to require that critical infrastructure owners and \noperators take action, nor does it mandate reporting to the Federal \nGovernment. Its intent, which I applaud, is for the government to have \na better understanding of those critical infrastructure companies that, \nif hacked, could cause extremely significant damage to our Nation.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues for their \nthoughtful and helpful amendments. I am pleased that we have such a \nfulsome managers' package. I believe this managers' package strengthens \nour bill. It adds important clarifications, including meaningful \nprivacy protections, it does not do operational harm, and it further \nimproves the strong bill that the Intelligence Committee passed by a \nstrong vote of 14 to 1 earlier this year.\n  I wanted to do this so that all Members know what is in the managers' \npackage, and both the chairman and I believe that these additions are \nin the best interests of making a good bill even better.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from California and the Senator from North \nCarolina, and I thank them for their important work on the cyber bill. \nI know we are going to be discussing a lot of that, and why it is \nimportant to our national security.\n\n\n                   National Defense Authorization Act\n\n  This afternoon I wish to talk about another important bill that is \nmoving its way through the process of becoming law, and that is the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA.\n  As did many of my colleagues, I spent last week back home in my great \nState of Alaska. In Alaska, it is hard not to see the strength and \npride in our military everywhere, every day, everywhere we go. I will \nprovide a few examples.\n\n  We have what is called the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention, \nan annual convention that we have with a very important group of \nAlaskans. The theme this year was ``Heroes Among Us'' at the \nconvention. It was about heroes among us because Alaskan Natives serve \nin the U.S. military at higher rates than any other ethnic group in the \ncountry--a real special kind of patriotism. I had the honor, really, to \nmeet dozens of these great veterans from all kinds of wars. I met \nveterans from World War II, the Attu campaign. A lot of Americans don't \nrealize that Alaska was actually invaded by the Japanese and we had to \nfight to eject them from the Aleutian Islands. I met veterans from the \nPhilippines campaign under General MacArthur. I met veterans from the \nKorean war who served at the Chosin Reservoir. I had a great \nopportunity to meet an Honor Flight coming back from Washington, our \nveterans from World War II, Korea. Of course, just walking around \nAnchorage you see and hear military members training all the time. We \nhave a great base, JBER, with F-22s ripping through the sky, our \nmilitary members keeping us safe. That sound is what we call in Alaska \nthe sound of freedom, when you hear those jets roaring. It is \neverywhere.\n  In Alaska, we love our veterans and our military. We honor them. We \nknow that providing for the national defense of our great nation, \ntaking care of our troops, and taking care of our veterans is certainly \none of the most important things we do in the Senate. Of course, it is \nnot just Alaska. I am sure when the Presiding Officer was home in the \ngreat State of Nebraska there was the same patriotic feeling of \nsupporting our troops and the importance of our national defense.\n  For the most part, that feeling exists here in Washington. I have \nbeen honored to sit on two committees that focus on these issues a lot: \non the Armed Services Committee and Veterans' Affairs Committee. These \nare very bipartisan committees and where support for our national \ndefense, our troops, and our veterans is across the board on both sides \nof the aisle--no doubt about it. But I do say ``for the most part'' \nbecause, as the Presiding Officer knows, nothing is truly as it seems \nin Washington, DC.\n  I have spoken on the floor, as a number of Senators have, about what \nmotivated a number of us last year to actually throw our hat in the \nring and run for the U.S. Senate. Like the Presiding Officer, I know a \nlot of us were concerned about the country going in the wrong \ndirection, about a dysfunction in Washington, about a government that \nhas run up an $18 trillion debt, no economic growth, our credit rating \nbeing downgraded, no amendments being brought to the Senate floor, no \nbudget for the Federal Government attempted, no appropriations bills \nattempted for years. The most deliberative body in the world was \ncertainly a body that had been shut down, and a lot of us saw a need to \nchange that.\n  So we are starting to change that. We are back to regular order. We \nare talking about debating bills. There have been dozens, if not \nhundreds, of amendments already this year--last year there were only 14 \namendments--and we passed a budget. We passed 12 appropriations bills \nto fund the government--very bipartisan--and we are focusing on the \nissues, whether it is cyber security, defense or taking care of our \nveterans, something the vast majority of the American people want us to \nfocus on.\n  For example, we brought to the floor two critical appropriations \nbills just a couple of months ago--the Defense appropriations bill and \nthe Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill. These passed out \nof the Appropriations Committee by huge bipartisan majorities, 27 to 3 \non the Defense appropriations bill and 21 to 9 on the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs bill. This is what the American \npeople want us to do--get back to regular order, fund the government, \nand put together a budget. So far, so good. That is what we are called \nto do.\n  Here is where the dysfunction of Washington, DC, began to rear its \nhead again: These bills that are critical to our troops, our defense, \nand our veterans--all with strong bipartisan support in committee--were \nbrought to the floor of the Senate and they were filibustered. They \nwere filibustered. The bill to fund our military, that funds our \nnational defense and takes care of our veterans was filibustered--\nblocked--stopped by our friends on the other side of the aisle. I am \nnot sure why. I still don't know why. As a matter of fact, I haven't \nseen anyone who actually voted to filibuster these important bills come \ndown to the Senate floor and say: Here is why we voted against funding \nour troops. Here is why we voted against funding our veterans.\n  I think the overwhelming majority of Americans, regardless of what \nState they live in, would say: No, no, no. You need to vote for these \nbills that are funding our military, veterans, and national defense. \nThat is one of the most\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\nimportant things we want you to do. The bottom line on those votes is \nthat our troops, our veterans, and our national defense were \nshortchanged because they didn't get funded.\n  Let me move on to the Defense authorization bill, what I want to talk \nabout today. This is an annual undertaking that sets the policies, \nprograms, and defense strategy for our military. It also authorizes \nspending on national defense and our military. Again, it is certainly \none of the most important tasks this body does, and I think most \nSenators on both sides of the aisle would agree with that.\n  Once again, as with the appropriations bill, we were working closely \ntogether on a bipartisan basis. I was on the Armed Services Committee \nand this moved through the committee and it was very bipartisan. It was \nvoted out on a strong bipartisan vote to come to the floor. I commend \nChairman McCain, who did a great job on that as the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, and Ranking Member Reed of Rhode Island did a \nfantastic job. I must admit that this Senator feared a little bit of a \nreplay in terms of the scenario we saw with the appropriations bill--\nmeaning strong bipartisan support out of the committee and then coming \nto the Senate floor and being filibustered. I feared this, in part, \nbecause at one point during the Defense authorization debate the \nminority leader came and stated that the Defense authorization bill was \n``a waste of time.''\n  A waste of time? Tell that to the marines, the soldiers, the airmen, \nthe sailors, and their families--those members of the military who are \ndefending our country right now--that this bill was a waste of time. I \nguarantee they would not agree with that statement. Fortunately, \nneither did the Senate. To the contrary, the Senate has now voted on \nthe Defense authorization bill twice, once as an original bill and once \nas part of a conference report with very strong bipartisan and veto-\nproof majorities, with 71 Senators the first time around and 73 when we \nvoted on it a couple of weeks ago. I mention the phrase ``veto-proof \nmajority'' because incredibly the President of the United States, the \nCommander in Chief, has said he is going to veto this bill when it \ncomes to his desk. It was just sent to him yesterday.\n  I don't know how the Commander in Chief is going to explain that to \nthe troops or to their families or to the American people or to the 73 \nSenators who voted for that bill. It is important to recognize that \nalthough we may think this is all inside Washington and no one is \nreally following it, something like this impacts morale when the \nCommander in Chief is saying: Hey, troops, I am going to veto this.\n  This is a copy of the Marine Corps Times. I subscribe and read the \nMarine Corps Times. A lot of marines and members of the military read \nthis all over the world. Guaranteed, our men and women deployed \noverseas read the Marine Corps Times. In this edition there is an \narticle about how President Obama has vowed to veto the Defense \nauthorization bill. We have marines fighting overseas who are reading \nthis, and they are not getting it.\n  This week in the Marine Corps Times:\n\n       The MOAA [Military Officers Association of America] and \n     other military advocacy groups have argued against the \n     presidential veto, calling the legislation a critical policy \n     measure that cannot be delayed. The measure has been signed \n     into law in each of the last 53 years, and includes a host of \n     other specialty pay and bonus reauthorizations.\n\n  In a statement from MOAA officials in this article that thousands of \nour Active-Duty troops are reading:\n\n       The fact is that we are still a nation at war, and this \n     legislation is vital to fulfilling wartime requirements. \n     There comes a time when this year's legislative business must \n     be completed, and remaining disagreements left to be \n     addressed next year.\n\n  To govern is to choose. To govern is to prioritize.\n  President Obama's administration has spent years negotiating the Iran \ndeal and this body spent weeks debating the President's Iran deal. We \nput a lot of time into it, and the President's administration put an \nenormous amount of time into it.\n  On the Iran deal, part of the hope from Secretary Kerry, the \nPresident, and others was that once it got passed by the U.S. \nCongress--by the way, on a partisan minority vote--that Iran would \nsomehow start to change its behavior and say: Look, America is someone \nwe want to partner with.\n  Since the Senate passed the Iran deal, let's see what has happened. \nIran has sent troops to Syria. Iran has backed Hamas, which is now \nengaging in knife-murdering attacks against Israelis. The Iranian \nleader has stated that Israel shouldn't exist within the next 25 years. \nIran has violated the U.N. Security Council ballistic missile \nresolutions, and this Senator and many others think Iran has already \nviolated the deal by firing ballistic missiles with a range of 1,000 \nmiles. Iran has sentenced an American reporter for the Washington Post \nfor spying. I don't think the behavior that a lot of the supporters for \nthis deal anticipated is happening.\n  More broadly, I think it is important to put into context what is \ngoing on with our national security, the NDAA, the moving forward with \nthe Iran deal, and the President's threat to veto the NDAA. The \nPresident's Iran deal, once implemented, will be giving tens of \nbillions of dollars to Iran, the world's biggest state sponsor of \nterrorism--but the President threatens to veto the Defense bill that \nactually funds our military. The President's Iran deal will lift \nsanctions on Iranian leaders such as General Soleimani, who literally \nhas the blood of American soldiers on his hands--but the President \nthreatens to veto U.S. troop pay bonuses and improved military \nretirement benefits. The President's Iran deal gives Iran access to \nconventional weapons, ballistic missile technology, and advanced \nnuclear centrifuges--but the President threatens to veto funding for \nadvanced weapons systems for our Armed Forces. Finally, the President's \nIran deal certainly is going to allow more funding for terrorist groups \nlike Hezbollah and Hamas--but the President is threatening to veto a \nbill that provides additional resources for our troops to fight \nterrorists such as ISIS.\n  To govern is to choose. To govern is to prioritize. Has it really \ncome to the point where the White House is more focused on freeing up \nfunds for Iranian terrorists than funding America's brave men and women \nin uniform? I certainly hope not.\n  I ask all of my fellow Senators who voted for this bill in a very \nstrong bipartisan way and my fellow Alaskans and Americans to reach out \nto the White House. Let them know that you oppose the President's veto \nof this bill.\n  What we need is a strong military, particularly now. We need to \nsupport our troops and our veterans, and we need President Obama to \nsign--not veto--this bill which is critical to our national defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n   43rd Anniversary of the Clean Water Act and EPA's Clean Water Rule\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this past Sunday was the 43rd anniversary \nof the enactment of the Clean Water Act. In 1972, the Clean Water Act \namended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which was the first \nmajor U.S. law to address water pollution. This law was enacted with \nbipartisan support--I could really say on a nonpartisan issue--because \nthe Congress in 1972 and the administration recognized that clean water \nwas in our national interest. It was important to our public health, it \nwas important to our environment, and it was important to our economy. \nThis law established the basic structure for regulating pollutant \ndischarges into the waters of the United States, and it has been the \ncornerstone of our efforts to protect our Nation's waterways.\n  Several times we have done cost analysis of the cost of regulation \nversus the benefit of clean water. It is overwhelmingly on the side of \nthe benefit to our community, better health, better environment, and a \nbetter economy. On this occasion I would like to speak about the recent \nefforts to protect America's waterways, such as the EPA's final clean \nwater rule, and why we should defend these efforts and allow nationwide \nimplementation.\n  In May, the EPA released their final clean water rule, which \ncompleted another chapter in the Clean Water Act's\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\nhistory. As the Clean Water Act worked to restore the health of our \nNation's water resources, we saw the U.S. economy grow, demonstrating \nthat America does not have to choose between the environment and a \nrobust economy. A clean environment helped build a robust economy.\n  Two Supreme Court decisions, however, call on the EPA and the Army \nCorps to clarify the definitions of the waters of the United States. \nThe EPA's final rule restores some long overdue regulatory certainty to \nthe Clean Water Act. I might tell you, in reviewing this rule, it \nbasically reestablishes the longstanding understanding of what were the \nwaters of the United States and what was subject to regulation.\n  This rule allows the Clean Water Act to continue its important \nfunction of restoring the health of our Nation's waters. The rule \nbecame effective this August, but immediately following the \nimplementation and on this anniversary, there have been unprecedented \nattacks on the final rule. As the rule came out, a Federal district \ncourt in North Dakota granted a preliminary injunction, blocking its \nimplementation.\n  The EPA continued to implement the rule in all States but the 13 \nStates that filed the suit that led to the injunction. However, in \nOctober, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided to \nstay the implementation of the rule for the entire country. This \nattempt to overturn the clean water rule is dangerous, shortsighted, \nand a step away from good governance, public health, and commonsense \nenvironmental protection.\n  Let me tell you what is at risk. What is at risk are our Nation's \nstreams and 200 million acres of wetlands. Over half of our streams and \nover 200 million acres of wetland are now at risk of not being under \nregulation under the Clean Water Act.\n  These protections are needed for drinking supplies for one out of \nevery three Americans. I am very concerned about the impact on all \nStates, but let me just talk for a moment, if I might, about my own \nState of Maryland. Marylanders rely upon our water as part of our life. \nWe live on the water. Seventy percent of Marylanders live in coastal \nareas. We depend upon clean water. We are particularly concerned about \nour drinking supply of water as well as the health of the Chesapeake \nBay.\n  We are at risk with the waters of the United States confusion out \nthere because of the Supreme Court decisions and now the stay of this \nrule by the court. The Clean Water Act and EPA's final rules are \nessential to the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Wetland protections are \nespecially critical to the Chesapeake Bay because the wetlands soak up \nharmful nutrient pollution.\n  This past Monday, I was in Howard County at a NOAA announcement of \nthe Chesapeake Bay B-WET grant. These are bay, watershed, education, \nand training funds. These are small dollars that go to institutions to \nhelp educate our children. In this case, the Howard County Conservancy \nreceived a grant because they bring all of the students from the Howard \nCounty public schools to an outdoor experience to rate and judge the \nstreams in our community.\n  The streams, of course, flow into the Chesapeake Bay. They are giving \nus a report card. I must tell you, that report card is not going to be \nas good as it should be. Without the protections in the Clean Water \nAct, it is going to be more difficult to meet the goals we need to in \norder to protect the Chesapeake Bay and all of the watersheds in this \ncountry for future generations.\n  The health of the bay is closely linked to upstream water quality and \nthe restoration and protection of headwaters. It should go without \nsaying that these waters are located in States beyond Maryland's \nborders. Improvements to upstream water quality are positively \ncorrelated with the water quality of the bay. We need a national \nprogram. That is what the Clean Water Act is. It is a national \ncommitment because we know that the watersheds go beyond State borders.\n  In Maryland, we set up the Chesapeake Bay Partnership. Yes, Virginia \nand Maryland are working together, but we also have the cooperation of \nPennsylvania, of New York, of West Virginia, of Delaware. Why? Because \nthese States contribute to the water supplies going into the Chesapeake \nBay. We need to protect these waters.\n  Protecting of America's waters is critically important to public \nhealth. So what is at stake here? What is at stake if we derail the \nclean water rule? The public health of the people of Maryland and all \nStates around this country. Public health and the environment in my \nState and the States of my colleagues have become seriously at risk \nfrom this decision that hinders this essential commonsense guidance.\n  I hope the court moves swiftly to affirm the rule in its final \ndecision and restores the invaluable protections needed for the \ndrinking supplies of one out of every three Americans. As we recognize \nthe anniversary of the Clean Water Act, I want us to continue to defend \nthis Nation's waters from pollution. This act ensures that every \ncitizen receives the clean water they need and deserve.\n  The EPA's final clean water rule provides further regulatory clarity \nthat we need to ensure the health of our water resources. I urge my \ncolleagues to continue to defend and fight for clean water as we \nrecognize the 43rd anniversary of the Clean Water Act. Every Congress \nshould, as its legacy, add to the protections that we provide for clean \nwater in this country. That should be the legacy of every Congress, but \nwe certainly don't want to hinder that record. Therefore, we need to \nimplement the EPA's clean water rule nationwide. I urge my colleagues \nto support such action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2612, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2581, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to \nthe Cotton amendment No. 2581.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                        Mental Health Reform Act\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, for 25 years I have worked in the \nLouisiana public hospital system. You cannot help but notice when you \nwork in a public hospital system, but also in private hospitals, how \noften mental health issues are directly a part of a\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\npatient who comes to see you. It does not just have to be a physician \nseeing patients in the emergency room. Each of our families, mine \nincluded, has a family member or a friend with serious mental illness. \nIt is nonpartisan. It cuts across demographic lines.\n  If I go before a group anywhere in my State, indeed anywhere in the \nNation, and bring up the need to address serious mental illness, all \nheads nod yes. It is true of my family. It is true of yours. It is true \nof almost everybody watching today. I am old enough to remember when \npeople would not speak of cancer. There was a stigma associated with \nhaving cancer. That is long gone, much to our advantage, but for some \nreason, there continues to be a stigma, a shame, associated with mental \nillness. I will argue that stigma and sense of shame has retarded what \nwe can do.\n  This is something that we have to address, we have to discuss, and we \nhave to go forward. The discussion right now, frankly, is being driven \nby tragedy: Lafayette, Louisiana; Newtown; Charleston; Oregon; \nTennessee. We have heard stories and they are beyond heartbreaking, but \nwhat is not spoken of are the broken families, the parents that know \nthere is something wrong with their child but do not know where to go \nto receive help, ending up in an overcrowded emergency room or with \ntheir child in a jail or prison when a more appropriate setting would \nbe elsewhere.\n  It is in the midst of these terrible tragedies that at least we can \nhope they can serve as a catalyst for society and Congress to begin to \nfix America's broken mental health system. Maybe something good can \nhappen, even from tragedies as horrific as these.\n  The question is, If one of the roles of Congress is to respond to \nsocietal needs that justify Federal involvement, should we not ask \nourselves why has there been such a failure to address the issue of \nserious mental illness? I am pleased to say that my colleague, Senator \nChris Murphy, and I wish to change that. We have introduced the \nbipartisan Mental Health Reform Act, which now has 10 cosponsors, both \nRepublican and Democrat.\n  Our bill begins to fix our mental health system and attempts to \naddress the root cause of mass violence, which is recognized but \nuntreated mental illness. How does our bill begin to do so? First, \npatients too often cannot get the care they need and too often have a \nlong delay between diagnosis and treatment. Access delayed is access \ndenied. Access is hampered by a shortage of mental health providers and \ntoo few beds for those with serious mental illness who truly need to be \nhospitalized.\n  Related to this, right now people with major mental illness tend to \ndie from physical illness as much as 20 years younger than someone who \ndoes not have serious mental illness. As a physician, I know if we \ntreat the whole patient, if we integrate care, it is better. Medicaid, \nthough, by policy, will not pay for a patient to see two physicians on \nthe same day.\n  So imagine this: A family practitioner sees a patient who clearly has \nmajor mental illness and, because the patient is right there, would \nlike him to walk down the hallway to see her friend the psychiatrist, \nto have both addressed immediately while the patient is there. Medicaid \nwill not pay the psychiatrist. On the other hand, the patient might be \nseeing a psychiatrist and have seriously high blood pressure or \nevidence for diabetes out of control, but the psychiatrist cannot say: \nWait a second. Let me walk you down the hallway to see my colleague, \nthe family practitioner, because Medicaid will not pay for that. By the \nway, private health insurance will. This is a policy change we need for \npublic health insurance. Our bill would allow patients to use both \nmental and physical health services the same day.\n  Secondly, most people have their first episode of serious mental \nillness between the ages of 15 and 25, starting down a path that ends \nwith their life and their family's lives tragically altered. This bill \nattempts to identify those young folks, stopping that path from ever \nopening up, and preventing the first episode of serious mental illness \nor, if it does occur, leading them on a path of wholeness, a path \ntowards wellness.\n  Another thing our bill does is it establishes a grant program focused \non intensive early intervention for children who demonstrate those \nfirst signs that can evolve into serious mental illness that may only \noccur in adolescence or adulthood. A second grant program supports \npediatricians who are consulting with mental health teams. This program \nhas already been successful in States such as Massachusetts and \nConnecticut.\n  Third, without appropriate treatment options, prisons, jails, and \nemergency rooms have become the de facto mental health care providers. \nMore than three times as many mentally ill are housed in prisons and \njails than in hospitals, according to the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation. Overcrowded U.S. emergency rooms have become the treatment \nsource of last resort for psychiatric patients. We incentivize States \nto create alternatives where patients may be seen, treated, and \nsupervised in outpatient settings, as opposed to being incarcerated.\n  Our bill creates an Under Secretary for Mental Health within the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. This Under Secretary's \nresponsibility would be to coordinate mental health services across the \nFederal system to help identify and implement effective and promising \nmodels of care.\n  It reauthorizes successful programs, such as the community mental \nhealth block grant and State-based data collection. The bill also \nincreases funding for critical biomedical research on mental health. On \ntop of this, it strengthens the transparency and enforcement of mental \nhealth parity by requiring the U.S. Departments of Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Treasury to audit the implementation of the mental \nhealth parity movement to determine the parity between mental and \nphysical health services.\n  Our bill does other things, but the most important thing it does is \nit helps prevent tragedies. It helps families, and it helps those \nbroken individuals affected by mental illness become whole.\n  In 2006, William Bruce of Maine was a 24-year-old who needed help. He \nsuffered with schizophrenia and had been hospitalized. Without \ncontacting his parents, our broken health care system allowed William \nto be released--even though his doctors said he was ``very dangerous \nindeed for release to the community.'' Sadly, 2 months later he \nmurdered his mother at home with a hatchet. This story is tragic and \nheartbreaking, and even worse, it could possibly have been prevented if \nwe had worked then to fix our broken mental health system. We wish to \nfix it now so there is not another such episode in the future.\n  The time for mental health reform is now. If not now, when? If not \nus, who? If not now and not us, there will be more Lafayettes, \nNewtowns, Charlestons, Tennessees, Oregons, and more broken families.\n  This bill does not wave a magic wand, but it puts us on a path where \nwe can say these things that once occurred perhaps no longer will.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on the floor today to join my good \nfriend from Louisiana, Senator Cassidy, as we formally introduce to the \nChamber the Mental Health Reform Act of 2015. I thank him personally \nfor all the time he has put into this not only as a Member of the \nSenate but previous to this as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This effort is patterned after a bill Senator Cassidy and my \nnamesake, Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, worked on for \nyears in the House of Representatives.\n  I wish to begin by sharing a story with you--that is the way Senator \nCassidy ended. I will talk about a woman from Bloomfield, CT, named \nBetsy. She has a 28-year-old son, John, who suffers from \nschizoaffective disorder. It is a serious mental illness whose signs \nbegan showing when John was 15 years old. He was hospitalized--think \nabout this--15 different times between the ages of 15 years old and 18 \nyears old, generally only for time-limited stays ranging from about 5 \ndays to maybe 2 weeks. Despite the severity of the condition, he was \ntold upon discharge there was really nowhere for him to go, no \npermanent solution for this young\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\nman. He was just an adolescent, but his parents were told there was no \nplace for him to be treated. What resulted was not only John getting to \na breaking point but his parents as well.\n  As we know, serious mental illness doesn't affect just the individual \nperson, it also affects family members who are trying to care for them.\n  Without needed supports and services, John became increasingly remote \nand psychotic until he was hospitalized again. Upon discharge this \ntime, John went to a shelter--the only place he could go. Since he \ncouldn't follow the shelter's rules, John, whom his mother said was \n``young, fragile, vulnerable and mentally unstable,'' was kicked out to \nsurvive homeless on the streets.\n  John finally--finally--was able to get a bed at a place that was able \nto house him for longer than 2 weeks, Connecticut Valley Hospital. That \nability to get John stabilized for a longer period of time, get him \ninto a real treatment plan, allowed him to then transfer into a \ncommunity bed in Middletown, CT. That is where John is today. John has \nbeen living successfully out in the community for 3 years. But we spent \nmillions of dollars on John's care, which led to no better outcome for \nhim. We wasted millions of dollars and potentially thousands of hours \nof time because he was shuttled in and out of hospitals without any \nlong-term treatment and without any hope for him and his family.\n  What Senator Cassidy and I are trying to say is that there is a \nbetter way. We are already spending billions of dollars on inadequate \nmental health care in this country. We need to do better, but a lot of \nthis is just about spending money in a more effective way.\n  One of the programs our bill helps fund is an early-intervention \nprogram for individuals who show their first episode of psychosis. The \nprogram the National Institutes of Mental Health just evaluated--with \nfindings released yesterday--was the RAISE Program. And in Connecticut \nwe run a similar program called the STEP Program. What this study \nshowed yesterday is that if you provide wraparound services to an \nindividual who shows a first episode of psychosis--comprehensive, \nimmediate services--you can get a dramatic decrease in the number of \nepisodes they show later in life. In Connecticut, we found that the \nSTEP Program reduced hospitalizations by nearly 50 percent after \nindividuals were given those wraparound services immediately. When they \ndid need hospitalizations later on, they were on average 6 days less \nthan when you didn't provide those wraparound services.\n  These are the types of programs that could have helped Betsy's son \nJohn early so that he could have started his recovery as a teenager \nrather than in his twenties. They could have saved the U.S. Government \nand the State of Connecticut a lot of money as well.\n  The trendlines beyond the anecdotes are very disturbing. Mental \nillness has been on the rise for the past few decades. One out of five \nadults today is coping with mental illness. If you look at the time \nperiod from 1987 to 2007, the number of people with mental disorders \nwho qualify for SSI has risen by 2\\1/2\\ times. From 1980 to 2000, we \nput up to 72,000 people in our jails who prior to \ndeinstitutionalization would have been in psychiatric hospitals--people \nwho are in jail primarily or only because of their psychiatric \ndisorder.\n  Just in the last 2 years alone, the number of people that HRSA \nestimates to be living in a mental health shortage area has gone from \n91 million--that is pretty bad to start with--up to 97 million. That is \njust 2 years of data. Since 2005, we have closed 14 percent of our \ninpatient beds in this country. So what is happening is a dramatic \nincrease in the number of people who are suffering from mental illness \nand a rather dramatic decrease in both outpatient and inpatient \ncapacity. We have to provide more resources to meet the demand, but we \nalso have to spend money better.\n  Senator Cassidy covered our piece of legislation accurately, so I \nwon't go into detail, but I wish to talk about our process. What we \ndecided to do at the beginning of this year was bring together all of \nthe groups--the provider groups, the advocacy groups, the hospital \ngroups--who have worked on this issue for years and then bring in those \nin the House of Representatives who have been working on this as well: \nRepresentative Tim Murphy and Eddie Bernice Johnson.\n  They have a bipartisan reform bill in the House. We decided not to \nstart from scratch but to take their piece of legislation, knowing that \nit has a good chance of passage in the House, and try to build on it \nand improve it.\n  We spent 6 months meeting with all of these groups and coming up with \nour own consensus product that today has the support of a cross-section \nof behavioral advocacy groups all across the country, including the \nNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Council for \nBehavioral Health, the American Psychological Association, the American \nPsychiatric Association, social workers, the American Foundation for \nSuicide Prevention, and the list goes on. We also went out to our \ncolleagues as well, knowing that nothing in the Senate can pass without \nnot just bipartisan support but bipartisan support that reflects the \ndiversity of both of our caucuses. We think we were able to build a \ngood foundation of cosponsors for this bill: Senators Franken, \nStabenow, Blumenthal, and Schumer on the Democratic side, and Senators \nMurkowski, Collins, Vitter, and Capito on the Republican side. We hope \nthat this coalition of groups on the outside, this alliance with a \nreform effort in the House that we believe has legislative legs, and a \ngood one-for-one with some cosponsors in the Senate, will allow us to \nmove this bill forward, and we have to. We have to.\n  So I will end where Senator Cassidy began his remarks, which is why \nthe Nation's attention has turned to this question of how we reform our \nmental health system. We lived through a tragic and gut-wrenching \nepisode of mass destruction in Newtown, CT. Senator Cassidy has had his \nown experience with mass tragedy. The reality is that the reasons why \nwe see these episodes of mass shootings are complicated, but if you \nread the report on Adam Lanza's intersection with Connecticut's mental \nhealth system, you will see that it failed him. It failed him and it \nfailed his family. I don't know that correcting the mental health \nsystem alone would have changed what happened in Newtown, but I know \nthat if we fix our mental health system, we will have a downward \npressure on the episodes of mass violence that happen in this country.\n  But, as Senator Cassidy said, we should fix our mental health system \nbecause it is broken for everyone, regardless of whether an individual \nhas a predisposition towards violence, because, of course, the reality \nis that people with mental illness are much more likely to be the \nvictims of violence than they are to be the perpetrators of violence. \nSo there is no inherent connection between mental illness and violence. \nBut these mass shootings have drawn the Nation's attention to what \nCongress can agree on right now that will try to improve public safety \nacross this Nation.\n  We are not going to get a background checks bill this year. I hoped \nwe could, but we won't. What we can get is a mental health reform bill, \nand that will help everyone--the case in Maine, the individual in \nBloomfield, and millions of others who have had a miserable experience \nwith a mental health system that is broken today, in part because of \nlack of coordination and in part because of lack of funding.\n  I am so thankful to Senator Cassidy for being with me on the floor \ntoday. I am grateful for his friendship and for his cooperation on \nbringing this truly bipartisan Mental Health Reform Act to the floor of \nthe Senate. We recommend it to our colleagues. We look forward to the \nupcoming hearings in the HELP Committee that we both sit on, and we \nhope to be back on the floor of the Senate as soon as possible to move \nforward on its passage through this body.\n  I say thank you to my colleague in the Senate, Senator Cassidy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe\n\n[[Page S7384]]\n\nbill before the Senate, S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing \nAct, and I want to thank the bill's managers for their leadership in \ndrafting this bill and putting a lot of hard work into the bill.\n  Cyber security challenges that threaten us are very real challenges. \nWe receive almost daily reminders of the importance of effective cyber \nsecurity to protect our private data and the safety and security of the \nentire Nation from cyber attacks. These attacks have compromised the \npersonal information of so many Americans as well as sensitive national \nsecurity information. That national security issue might even be the \nbiggest of the ones we hope to deal with.\n  The legislation before us will encourage the government and the \nprivate sector to work together to address these cyber security \nchallenges. This bill helps create a strong legal framework for \ninformation sharing that will help us respond to these threats. The \nbill authorizes private companies to voluntarily share cyber threat \ninformation with each other and with the government. In turn, the bill \npermits the government to share this type of information with private \nentities.\n  The bill reduces the uncertainty and, most importantly, the legal \nbarriers that either limit or prohibit the sharing of cyber threat \ninformation today. At the same time, the bill includes very significant \nprivacy protections to strike a balance between maintaining security \nand protecting our civil liberties. For example, it restricts the \ngovernment from acquiring or using cyber threat information except for \nlimited cyber security purposes.\n  So, as I did at the beginning, I want to salute the leadership of the \nchair and vice chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator \nBurr and Senator Feinstein, for their efforts on this bill. I know from \nthe last couple of Congresses that this type of legislation isn't easy \nto put together. In the 112th Congress, I cosponsored cyber security \nlegislation along with several of my colleagues. This involved working \nacross several committees of jurisdiction. Last Congress, as then-\nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I continued to work with the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence and others on an earlier version of \nthis bill. Unfortunately, Democratic leadership never gave the Senate \nan opportunity to debate and to vote on that bill in the last Congress.\n  Senators Burr and Feinstein were undaunted, however, and this \nCongress they diligently worked and continued to seek input from \nrelevant committees of jurisdiction, including the Judiciary Committee \nthat I chair. They incorporated the views of a broad range of Senators \nand worked to address the concerns of stakeholders outside of the \nCongress. This has produced their managers' amendment.\n  This is a bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support. As with most \npieces of legislation that come before the Senate, it is not a perfect \npiece of legislation from any individual Senator's point of view, but \nin finding common ground, it has turned out to be a good bill that \naddresses a very real problem.\n  It is time for us to do our job and to vote. This is how the Senate \nis supposed to work. Now is the time for action because the question \nisn't whether there will be another cyber attack, the question is when \nthat attack will happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I am here to briefly talk on S. 754, the \ncyber security bill. Yesterday Vice Chairman Dianne Feinstein and I \ncame to the floor and encouraged our Members who had amendments or who \nhad an interest in debating the bill to come to the floor. It was my \nhope that we could finish in a couple of days with the cooperation of \nMembers. We have not gotten that level of cooperation. Therefore, this \nwill take several more days to finish. But it doesn't lessen the \nimportance for those Members who have amendments in the queue--meaning \nthey are pending--to come to the floor and talk about their amendments \nif they would like to. At some point, we will culminate this process, \nand those amendments that have yet to be disposed of will have votes \nwith a very limited amount of debate time included.\n  It is my hope that we will have a wholesome debate and that people \nwill have an opportunity to know what is in this bill if they don't \ntoday. But more importantly, through that debate we are able to share \nwith the American people why a cyber security bill is so important and, \nmore importantly, why we have done it in a way that we think it will be \nembraced and endorsed by not just corporate America but by individuals \nthroughout the country.\n  Let me announce today that this bill will be done either Monday \nevening or Tuesday morning based upon what the leadership on both sides \ncan agree to as it relates to the debate. The Vice Chair and I also \ncame to the floor and we made this statement: We have worked \naggressively in a bipartisan way to incorporate in the managers' \npackage, which is currently pending, 14 amendments, and 8 of those \namendments were included in the unanimous consent agreement made \nearlier this year when we delayed consideration of the bill until the \nday when we moved forward. There were several amendments on which we \nweren't able to reach an agreement or that we believed changed the \npolicy significantly enough that this was not just an information \nsharing bill that was voluntary for corporations throughout this \ncountry. In the absence of being able to keep this bill intact in a way \nthat we thought we needed to, the Vice Chairman and I have agreed to \nlock arms and to be opposed to those additional amendments.\n  Having said that, the debate to date has focused on the fact that \nthere are technology companies across this country that are opposed to \nthis bill. Yesterday the Vice Chairman and I repeatedly reminded our \ncolleagues and the American people that this is a voluntary bill. There \nis nothing mandatory in it. The reality is that if you don't like what \nis in this, if for some reason you don't want to participate in what I \nwould refer to as a community watch program--it is real simple; it is \nvoluntary--do not participate. Choose not to inform the Federal \nGovernment when hackers have penetrated your system and stolen personal \ndata out of it. Just choose not to tell us. But do not ruin it for \neverybody else. In a minute I am going to go through again why I think \nthe cyber security bill should become law, why I think this is the \nfirst step of how we protect the personal data of the American people, \nand why hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses support this \ninformation sharing bill. But I can't stress that enough for those who \noppose this. Most of them are, in fact, companies that hold the most \nprivate data in the world. Let me say that again. Those who are \nexpressing opposition to this bill hold the largest banks of personal \ndata in the world.\n  The decision as to whether they are for the bill or against the bill \nis their decision. The decision whether they utilize this voluntary \nprogram to further protect the personal data that is in their system is \nbetween them and their customers. But I have to say that it defies \nreason as to why a company that holds that much personal data wouldn't \nat least like to have the option of being able to partner with the \nFederal Government in an effort to minimize data loss, whether it is at \ntheir company or whether it is in their industry sector or whether it \nis in the global economy as a whole.\n  The last time I checked, the health of U.S. businesses was reliant on \nthe health of the U.S. economy, and the health of the U.S. economy is \naffected by the health of the global economy. I know the Presiding \nOfficer understands that because he was in business like I was for 17 \nyears.\n  It really does concern me that one could be opposed to something that \ninsulates the U.S. economy from having an adverse impact by the cyber \nsecurity act and believes that they are OK even though it might tank \nthe U.S. economy.\n  At the end of the day, I want to try to put this in 101 terms, the \nsimplest terms of what the information sharing bill does. I am going to \nbreak it into three baskets. It is about business to\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\nbusiness. This bill allows a company that has been hacked--where \nsomebody has penetrated their computer system and has access to their \ndata--to immediately pick up the phone and call their competitor and \nask their competitor whether they have had a similar penetration of \ntheir system.\n\n  It is only reasonable to expect that the first person you would go to \nis a company that has a business that looks exactly like yours. In that \nparticular case, this legislation provides that company with protection \nunder the anti-trust laws. Anti-trust forbids companies from \ncollaborating together. What we say is that if it has do with \nminimizing the loss of data, we want to allow the collaboration of \ncompetitors for the specific reason of discussing a cyber attack.\n  The Senate recognizes I have designed something in this that doesn't \nrequire a corporate lawyer to sit in the room when the decision is \nmade. I have no personal dislike for lawyers other than the fact that \nthey slow things down. To minimize the loss of data means you have to \nhave a process that goes in real time from the bottom of the chain all \nthe way to the decisionmaking and the communication back down, not only \nto that business, but to the entire economy. Having a lawyer that has \nto think whether we can legally do this defeats the purpose of trying \nto minimize data loss. So we give them a blanket exemption under the \nanti-trust laws so they know up front that they can pick up the phone \nand call their competitor, and there is no Justice Department that will \ncome down on them as long as they confine it to the discussion of cyber \nattack.\n  At the same time we initiate what I call business to government, \nwhich means that when the IT department is talking to their competitor, \nthe IT department can put out a notification through the Federal portal \nthat they have been attacked, and that initiates the exchange of a \nlimited amount of information that has been predetermined by everybody \nin the Federal Government who needs to do the forensics of who \nattacked, what tool they used, and what defensive mechanism could be \nput up in the way of software that would eliminate the breach.\n  In the statute we have said, one, you can't transmit personal data \nunless it is absolutely crucial to understanding the forensics of the \nattack. We have also said in statutory language to the government \nagencies: If for some reason personal data makes it through your \nfilters, you cannot transmit that personal data anywhere else within \nthe Federal Government or to the public.\n  We have gone to great lengths to make sure that personal data is not \ndisclosed through the notification process of a hack. I understand that \nthe personal data has already been accessed by the individual who \ncommitted the act, but we want to make sure that the government doesn't \ncontribute to the distribution of that data.\n  In order to create an incentive in a voluntary program for a business \nto initiate that notification to the Federal Government, we provide \nliability protection. Anytime a company allows personal data or data on \ntheir business to get out, there could potentially be a shareholder's \nsuit. What we do is provide a blanket liability protection to make sure \nthat a company can't be sued for the government notification of a \nsecurity breach where data has been removed and it is in the best \ninterest of the government to know it, to react to it, and for the \ngeneral population of businesses in America to understand it.\n  So we have business-to-business collaboration with your competitor, \nanti-trust protection, business-to-government liability protection, no \npersonal data transmitted, and the last piece is government to \nbusiness.\n  It is hard for me to believe that the government didn't have the \nstatutory authority to convey to businesses across America when a cyber \nattack is in progress. The Federal Government has to be asked to come \nin and typically will be asked by the company that has been attacked, \nbut how about their competitors? How about the industry sector? How \nabout the whole U.S. economy? There is no authority to do that. This \nbill creates the authority in the Federal Government to receive that \ninformation from a company that has been penetrated, to process it, to \nunderstand who did it, to understand the attack tool they used, to \ndetermine the defensive mechanism of software that it can be put on, \nand then to notify American businesses that there is an attack \nhappening now, and here is the attack tool and software you can buy off \nthe shelf and put on your computer system to protect you. That is it. \nThat is the entire information sharing bill, and it is voluntary.\n  I will touch on eight items very briefly. Why is there a need for \ncyber legislation? I don't want to state the obvious, but we have \nalready seen that individuals and nation states penetrate the private \nsector and steal personal data, and the Federal Government can steal \npersonal data. I thought it would hit home with my colleagues when the \nOffice of Personnel Management was breached, and now we are up to 22 to \n24 million individuals who were compromised. More importantly, the \npersonal data at OPM extended to every individual who had ever applied \nfor a security clearance, who had ever been granted security clearance, \nand who had security clearances and are now retired, but for some \nreason that application remained in the database. That application, \nwhich consists of 18 pages, has the most personal information one can \nfind. It lists your parents and their Social Security numbers, your \nbrothers, your sisters, where you lived since you graduated from \ncollege. It even has a page that asks you to share the most obvious way \nthat someone might blackmail you. It has probably some of the most \ndamaging personal information that one can have breached.\n  Cyber attacks have harmed multiple U.S. companies. If this weren't \nserious, would the President of China and the President of the United \nStates, when they met several weeks ago, have come to an agreement \nabout how they would intercede if one country or the other commits a \ncyber attack against each other? Probably not.\n  Our bill is completely voluntary, and I think it is safe to say that \nthose who want to share data can, in fact, share data on this.\n  I mentioned the words ``real time.'' What we want to do is create a \nreal-time system because we want a partnership. We want a partnership \nwith other private companies and we want a partnership with the private \nand public sector, and you can't get a partnership by mandating it. All \nyou can get is an adversarial relationship. We maintain that voluntary \nstatus in the hope that the sharing of that information is, in fact, \nreal time. We can control--once you transmit to the Federal \nGovernment--how to define ``real time.'' I have no control over a \nprivate company's decision once they know they have been breached to \nthe point that they actually make a notification to the Federal \nGovernment, but with the liability protection and anti-trust coverage, \nwe are convinced that we are structured from the beginning to create an \nincentive for real time to take place.\n  We protect personal privacy. Many have come to the floor and have \nsuggested that this is a surveillance bill. Let me say to my colleagues \nand to the American people: There is no capability for this to become a \nsurveillance bill. The managers' amendment took those items that people \nwere concerned with and eliminated it. We can be accused of a lot of \nthings, but to accuse this of being a surveillance bill is either a \nsign of ignorance or a sign that one is being disingenuous. It is not a \nsurveillance bill. Be critical of what we are attempting to do, be \ncritical of what we do, but don't use the latitude to suggest that this \nis something that it is not.\n  We require private companies and the government to eliminate any \nirrelevant personal, identifiable information before sharing the cyber \nthreat indicators or putting up defensive mechanisms.\n  This bill does not allow the government to monitor private networks \nor computers. It does not let government shut down Web sites or require \ncompanies to turn over personal information.\n  This bill does not permit the government to retain or use cyber \nthreat information for anything other than cyber security purposes, \nidentifying a cyber security threat, protecting individuals from death \nor serious bodily or economic harm, protecting minors, or investigating \nlimited cyber crime offenses.\n  This bill provides rigorous oversight and requires a periodic \ninteragency inspector general's report to assess\n\n[[Page S7386]]\n\nwhether the government has violated any of the requirements in this \nbill. The report also will assess any impact this bill may have on \nprivacy and civil liberties. In the report, we require the IG to report \nto us whether anybody does anything outside what the statute allows \nthem to do, but we also ask the IG to make a gut call on whether we \nhave protected privacy and civil liberties.\n  Finally, our managers' amendment has incorporated an additional \nprovision to enhance privacy protections first. Our managers' amendment \nomitted the government's ability to use cyber information to \ninvestigate and prosecute serious and violent felonies. Let me raise my \nhand and say I am guilty. I felt very strongly that that should have \nbeen in the bill. If we find during an investigation that an individual \nhas committed a felony that is not related to a cyber attack, I thought \nwe should turn that information over to law enforcement but, no, we \ndropped it. I don't want there to be any question as to whether this is \nan effective cyber information sharing bill.\n  Our managers' amendment limited cyber threat information sharing \nauthorities to those items that are shared for cyber security purposes. \nBoth of these changes ensure that nothing in our bill reaches beyond \nthe focus of cyber security threats that are intended to prevent and \ndeter an attack, and nothing in this bill creates any potential for \nsurveillance authorities.\n  Now, as I said, despite rumors to the contrary, this bill is \nvoluntary. It is a voluntary threat indicator to share with authorities \nand does not provide in any way for the government to spy on or use \nlibrary and book records, gun sales, tax records, educational records, \nor medical records. There is something in that for every member of \nevery State.\n  I can honestly look at my librarians and say we haven't breached the \npublic libraries' protection of personal data. I will say librarians \nare not fans of this legislation. I don't think they have read the \nmanagers' amendment that spells out the concerns we heard and then \nsaid: This can't go there. I am not sure we can statutorily state it \nany clearer than what we have done.\n  Given that cyber attackers have hacked into, stolen, and publicly \ndisclosed so much private, personal information, it is astounding to me \nthat privacy groups would oppose this bill. It has nothing to do with \nsurveillance, and it seeks to protect private information from being \nstolen.\n  There are no offensive measures. This bill ensures that the \ngovernment cannot install, employ or otherwise use cyber security \nsystems on private sector networks. In other words, no one can hack \nback into another computer, even if the purpose is to protect against \nor squash a cyber attack. It can't be done. It is illegal.\n  The government cannot retain or use cyber threat information for \nanything other than cyber security purposes, including preventing, \ninvestigating, disrupting, and prosecuting limited cyber crimes, \nprotecting minors, and protecting individuals from death or serious \nbodily harm, or economic harm.\n  The government cannot use cyber threat information in regulatory \nproceedings. Let me state that again. The government cannot use cyber \nthreat information in regulatory proceedings. If somebody believes this \nis not voluntary and that there is some attempt to try to get a \nmandatory hook in here where regulators can turn around and bypass the \nlegislative responsibility of the Congress of the United States, let me \njust say, we are explicit. It cannot be done. But we are also explicit \nthat the government cannot retain this information for anything other \nthan the list of items I discussed. This provides focused liability \nprotection to private companies that monitor their own systems and \nshare cyber threat indicators and defensive mechanisms in accordance \nwith the act, but the liability protection is not open-ended. This \ndoesn't provide liability protection for a company that engages in \ngross negligence or willful misconduct. I am not a lawyer, but I have \nbeen told that ties it up pretty tightly; that it makes a very small, \nnarrow lane that companies can achieve liability protection, and that \nlane means they are transferring that information to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Last, independent oversight. This bill provides rigorous oversight. \nIt requires a periodic interagency inspector general's report to assess \nwhether the government has violated any of the requirements of this \nact. The report also will assess any impact that this bill may have on \nprivacy and civil liberties as well as an assessment of what the \ngovernment has done to reduce any impact.\n  This bill further requires an independent privacy and civil liberties \noversight board to assess any impact this bill may have on privacy and \ncivil liberties and is, in fact, reviewed internally by an inspector \ngeneral. The inspector general checks to make sure they live by the \nletter of the law. The inspector general makes an assessment on the \nprivacy and civil liberties, and we set up an independent board to look \nat whether, in fact, privacy and civil liberties have been protected.\n  I say to my colleagues, if there is more that they need in here, tell \nus what it is. The amendment process is open.\n  Here is where we are. Privacy folks don't want a bill, period. Some \nMembers don't want a bill, period. I get it. I am willing to adapt to \nthat. I only need 60 votes for this to pass, and then I have to \nconference it with the House that has two different versions. Then I \nhave to go to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and I have to \nconvince the President and his whole administration to support this \nbill. Let me quote the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They support this bill. The National Security Council \ntomorrow is going to come out in support of this bill. Why? Because \nmost people recognize the fact that we need this, that this is the \nresponsible thing to do. This is why Congress was created.\n  If, in fact, there are those who object, don't participate. I say to \nthose businesses around the country, I am not going to get into your \ndecisionmaking, although I think it is flawed. You hold most of the \npersonal data of any companies out there. Yet you don't want to see any \ncoordinated effort to minimize data loss in the U.S. economy. I think \nthat is extremely shortsighted. I think your customers would disagree \nwith you, but the legislation was written in a way that allows you to \nopt out and to say: I don't want to play in this sandbox.\n  I say to my colleagues and to the American people: Is that a reason \nfor us not to allow the thousands of companies that want to do it, \nrepresenting hundreds of thousands and millions of customers who want \nto protect their credit card number, their health records, all the \npersonal data that is out there on them--if they want to see that \nprotected, should they not have that done because some companies say \nthey don't want to play? No. We make it voluntary, and we allow them to \nopt out. They can explain to their customers why. If I am with another \ntech company and they are participating in this, they must be more \ninterested in protecting my data. I think it is a tough sell myself as \na guy in business for 17 years.\n  I know what is up here. Some are looking at this as a marketing tool. \nThey are going to go out and say: We don't participate in transferring \ndata to the Federal Government. Oh, really. Wait until the day you get \npenetrated. Wait until the day they download all of that personal \ninformation on all of your customers. You are going to be begging for a \npartnership with the Federal Government. Then we are going to extend it \nto you, whether you liked it or not, whether you voted for the bill or \nsupported the bill or spoke in favor of the bill or ever participated \nin it. If we pass this bill, which I think we will, they will have an \nopportunity to partner with the Federal Government and to do it in an \neffective way. In the meantime, I think there will be just as many \nbusinesses using a marketing tool that says: We like the cyber \ninformation sharing bill, and if we ever need to use it, we are looking \nforward to partnering with the Department of Homeland Security, the \nFBI, and the National Security Agency because we want to minimize the \nexposure of the loss of data our customers could have.\n  Mark my words. There is a real battle getting ready to brew here. \nAgain, putting on my business hat, I like the idea of being able to go \nout and sell the fact that I am going to partner if something happens \nmuch better than selling\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\nthe pitch that I am going to do this alone. Think about it. A high \nschool student last week hacked the personal email account of the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of \nthe CIA. This is almost ``Star Trek.'' ``Beam me up, Scotty.''\n  There are people who believe that this is just going to go away. It \nis not going away. Every day there is an attempt to try to penetrate a \nU.S. company, an agency of the Federal Government for one reason: to \naccess personal data. The intent is there from individuals and from \nnation states. For companies that think this is going to go away or \nthink they are smart enough that it is not going to happen to them, I \nhave seen some of the best and they are one click away from somebody \ndownloading and entering their system and that click may not be \nprotected by technology. It may be the lack of ability of an employee \nto make the right decision on whether they open an email, and, boom, \nthey have just exposed everybody in their system.\n  So I will wrap up because I see my good friend and colleague Senator \nWyden is here. We will have several days, based upon the process we \nhave in front of us, to talk about the good, and some will talk about \nthe bad, which I don't think exists, but let me assure my colleagues \nthat the ugly part of this--the ugly part of this--is that cyber theft \nis real. It doesn't discriminate. It goes to where the richest pool of \ndata is. In the case of the few companies that are not supportive of \nthis bill, they are the richest depositories of personal data in the \nworld. I hope they wake up and smell the roses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of our Intelligence Committee, I am always \nthinking about the history of the committee. I believe Chairman Burr, \nthe ranking minority member Senator Feinstein, and I have been on the \nIntelligence Committee almost as long as anybody in history.\n  I always like to work with my colleague. This is an area where we \nhave a difference of opinion. I am going to try to outline what that is \nand still try to describe how we might be able to work it out.\n  Mr. BURR. May I thank my colleague?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I think he \ndiplomatically referred to me as old, but I know that wasn't the case. \nHe is exactly right. We have served together for a long time. We agree \non most issues. This is one that we disagree on, but we do it in a \ngenuine and diplomatic way. Contrary to maybe the image that some \nportray to the American people, we fight during the day and we can have \na drink or go to dinner at night, and we are just as likely to work on \na piece of legislation together next week. So that is what this \ninstitution is and it is why it is so great.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Well said. There is nothing better than having Carolina \nbarbecue unless it is Oregon salmon. Yes, we old jocks, former football \nplayers and basketball players, we have tough debates and then we go \nout and enjoy a meal.\n  Here is how I would like to start this afternoon. The distinguished \nchairman of the committee is absolutely correct in saying that cyber \nsecurity is a very substantial problem. My constituents know a lot \nabout that because one of our prominent employers, SolarWorld, a major \nmanufacturer in renewable energy, was hacked by the Chinese simply \nbecause this employer was trying to protect its rights under trade law. \nIn fact, our government indicted the People's Liberation Army for their \nhacking into this major Oregon employer. So no question that cyber \nsecurity is a major problem.\n  Second, there is no question in my mind that information sharing can \nbe very valuable in a number of instances. If we know, for example, \nsomeone is associated with hackers, malware, this sort of thing, of \ncourse it is important to promote that kind of sharing. The difference \nof opinion is that I believe this bill is badly flawed because it \ndoesn't pass the test of showing that when we share information, we \nhave to have robust privacy standards or else millions of Americans are \ngoing to look up and they are going to say that is really not cyber \nsecurity. They are going to say it is a surveillance bill. So that is \nwhat the difference of opinion is.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2621, as Modified\n\n  Let me turn to how I have been trying to improve the legislation. I \nam going to speak for a few minutes on my amendment No. 2621 to the \nbill that we have been discussing and that is now pending in the \nSenate. Obviously, anybody who has been watching the debate on this \ncyber security bill has seen what we would have to call a spirited \nexchange of views. Senators are debating the substance of the \nlegislation and, as I just indicated to Chairman Burr and I have \nindicated to ranking minority member Senator Feinstein, there is \nagreement on a wide variety of points and issues.\n  Both supporters and opponents of the bill agree that sharing \ninformation about cyber security threats, samples of malware, \ninformation about malicious hackers, and all of this makes sense and \none ought to try to promote more of it. Both supporters and opponents \nnow agree that giving corporations immunity from customer lawsuits \nisn't going to stop sophisticated attacks such as the OPM personnel \nrecords breach.\n  I am very glad that there has been agreement on that point recently, \nbecause proponents of the bill sometimes said that their legislation \nwould stop hacks such as the one that took place at OPM. When \ntechnologists reviewed it, that was clearly not the case, and the claim \nhas been withdrawn that somehow this bill would prevent hacks like we \nsaw at OPM.\n  The differences of opinion between supporters and opponents of the \nbill--who do agree on a variety of these issues--surround the likely \nprivacy impact of the bill. Supporters have essentially argued that the \nbenefits of this bill, perhaps, are limited--particularly now that they \nhave withdrawn the claim that this would help against an OPM attack--\nbut that every little bit helps. But there is no downside to them to \njust pass the bill. It makes sense. Pass the bill. There is no \ndownside.\n  Opponents of the bill, who grow in number virtually every day, have \nbeen arguing that the bill is likely to have a significant negative \nimpact on the personal privacy of a large number of Americans and that \nthis greatly outweighs the limited security benefits. If an information \nsharing bill doesn't include adequate privacy protections, I am telling \nyou, colleagues, I think those proponents are going to have people wake \nup and say: I really don't see this as a cyber security bill, but it \nreally looks to me like a surveillance bill by another name.\n  (Mr. TOOMEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Colleagues who are following this and looking at the bill may be \ntrying to sort through this discussion between proponents and \nopponents. To help clarify the debate, I would like to get into the \ntext of the bill for just a minute.\n  If colleagues look at page 17 of the Burr-Feinstein substitute \namendment, which is the latest version with respect to this bill, \nSenators are going to see a key section of the bill. This is the \nsection that discusses the removal of personal information when data is \nshared with the government. The section says very clearly that in order \nto get immunity from a lawsuit a private company has to review the data \nthey would provide and remove any information the company knows is \npersonal information unrelated to a cyber security threat. This \nlanguage, in my view, clearly creates an incentive for companies to \ndump large quantities of data over to the government with only a \ncursory review. As long as that company isn't certain that they are \nproviding unrelated personal information, that company gets immunity \nfrom lawsuits. Some companies may choose to be more careful than that, \nbut this legislation and the latest version--the Burr-Feinstein \nsubstitute amendment--would not require it. This bill says with respect \nto personal data: When in doubt, you can hand it over.\n  My amendment No. 2621 is an alternative. It is very simple. It is \nless than a page long. It would amend this section that I have just \ndescribed to say that when companies review the data they provide, they \nought to ``remove, to the extent feasible, any personal information of \nor identifying a specific\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\nindividual that is not necessary to describe or identify a \ncybersecurity threat.'' The alternative that I am offering gives \ncompanies a real responsibility to filter out unrelated personal \ninformation before that company hands over large volumes of personal \ndata about customers or people to the government.\n  The sponsors of the bill have said that they believe that companies \nshould only give the government information that is necessary for cyber \nsecurity and should remove unrelated personal information. I agree with \nthem, but for reasons that I have just described, I would say \nrespectfully that the current version of this legislation does not \naccomplish that goal, and that is why I believe the amendment I have \noffered is so important.\n  For an example of how this might work in practice, imagine that a \nhealth insurance company finds out that millions of its customers' \nrecords have been stolen. If that company has any evidence about who \nthe hackers were or how they stole this information, of course it makes \nsense to share that information with the government. But that company \nshouldn't simply say here you go, and hand millions of its customers' \nmedical records over for distribution to a broad array of government \nagencies.\n  The records of the victims of a hack should not be treated the same \nway that information about the hacker is treated. Companies should be \nrequired to make a reasonable effort to remove personal information \nthat is not needed for cyber security before they hand information over \nto the government. That is what my amendment seeks to achieve. That is \nnot what is in the substitute amendment.\n  Furthermore, if colleagues hear the sponsors of the substitute saying \nthis bill's privacy protections are strong and you have heard me making \nthe case that they really don't have any meaningful teeth and they are \ntoo weak, don't just take my word for it. Listen to all of the leading \ntechnology companies that have come out against the current version of \nthis legislation.\n  These companies know about the importance of protecting both cyber \nsecurity and individual privacy. The reason they know--and this is the \ncase in Pennsylvania, Oregon, and everywhere else--is that these \ncompanies have to manage the challenge every single day. Companies in \nPennsylvania and Oregon have to ensure they are protecting both cyber \nsecurity and individual privacy. Those companies know that customer \nconfidence is their lifeblood and that the only way to ensure customer \nconfidence is to convince customers that if their product is going to \nbe used, their information will be protected, both from malicious \nhackers and from unnecessary collections by their government.\n  I would note that there is another reason why it is important to get \nthe privacy protections I am offering in my amendment at this time. The \ncompanies that I just described are competing on a global playing \nfield. These companies have to deal with the impression that U.S. laws \ndo not adequately protect their customers' information. Right now these \ncompanies--companies that are located in Pennsylvania and Oregon--are \ndealing with the fallout of a decision by a European court to strike \ndown the safe harbor data agreement between the United States and the \nEuropean Union. The court's ruling was based on the argument that U.S. \nlaws in their present form do not adequately protect customer data. \nNow, I strongly disagree with this ruling. At the same time, I would \nsay to my colleagues and to the Presiding Officer--he and I have worked \nclosely on international trade as members of the Finance Committee--and \nI would say to colleagues who are following this international trade \nquestion and the question of the European Union striking down the safe \nharbor for our privacy laws, in my view this bill is likely to make \nthings even more difficult for American companies that are trying to \nget access to those customers in Europe.\n  To give just a sampling of the leading companies that have come out \nagainst the CISA legislation, let me briefly call the roll. There is \nthe Apple company. They have millions of customers. They know a great \ndeal about what we have to do to deal with malicious hackers and to \nprotect privacy. There is also Dropbox, Twitter, Salesforce, Yelp, \nReddit, and the Wikimedia Foundation. I point to the strong statement \nby the Computer & Communications Industry Association. Their members \ninclude Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, Netflix, eBay, and \nPayPal. Those individual companies I have mentioned have millions of \ncustomers. The organization that speaks for them says: ``CISA's \nprescribed mechanism for sharing of Cyber threat information does not \nsufficiently protect users' privacy.''\n  On top of this, there has been widespread opposition from a larger \nspectrum of privacy advocacy organizations. Here the groups range from \nthe Open Technology Institute to the American Library Association.\n  I was particularly struck by the American Library Association's \ncomments in opposition to this bill. I think the leadership said--\nparaphrasing--something to the effect of when the American Library \nAssociation opposes legislation that authors say will promote \ninformation sharing, they indicate there was a little something more to \nit than what the sponsors are claiming.\n  Wrapping up, I want to make clear, as I said yesterday, that I \nappreciate that the bipartisan leadership of our committee has tried to \nrespond to these concerns. They know that these large companies with \nexpertise in collecting data and promoting cyber security have all come \nout against the bill. I heard talk about privacy protections. I don't \nknow of a single organization that is looked to by either side of the \naisle, Democrats and Republicans, for expertise and privacy that has \ncome out in favor of the bill.\n  So the sponsors of this legislation and the authors of the substitute \namendment, which I have tried to describe at length here this \nafternoon, are correct in saying that they have made some changes, but \nthose changes do not go to the core of the bill.\n  For example, the amendment I have described would really, in my view, \nfix this bill by ensuring that there was a significant effort to filter \nout unrelated personal and private information that was sent to the \ngovernment under the bill.\n  So I hope Senators will listen to what groups and the companies that \nhave expertise in this field have said. I hope Senators on both sides \nof the aisle will support the amendments I and others have offered. The \nSenate needs to do better than to produce a bill with minimal effects \non the security of Americans and significant downside for their privacy \nand their liberty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2626, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 5 or 6 \nminutes on the cyber bill.\n  Unfortunately, I am here to express my distaste for the manner in \nwhich this bill has proceeded. I have an amendment that is not going to \nbe voted on. Let me describe some of the characteristics of that \namendment.\n  First of all, it is bipartisan. It is Senator Graham's and my \namendment.\n  Second, it has had a hearing. We have had a hearing on it in the \nJudiciary Committee. Considerable work has gone into it.\n  Third, it has the support of the Department of Justice. It repairs \nholes in our criminal law for protecting cyber security that we worked \non very carefully with the Department of Justice and which we have had \ntestimony in support of from our Department of Justice prosecutors.\n  Last, it was in the queue. It was in the list of amendments that were \nagreed to when we agreed to go to the floor with this bill.\n  So I don't know how I am going to vote on this bill now. But if you \nhave a bipartisan amendment that has had a hearing, that was in the \nqueue, and that has the support of the Department of Justice and you \ncannot even get a vote on it, then something has gone wrong in the \nprocess.\n  I remember Senator Sessions coming to the floor and wondering how it \nis that certain Senators appoint themselves masters of the universe and \ngo off in a quiet room someplace and decide that certain amendments \nwill and will not be heard. I am very sympathetic to Senator Sessions' \nconcerns right now.\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\n  Let me tell you what the substance of our amendment would do.\n  First, there are people out there around the world in this cyber \nuniverse of fraud and crime who are trafficking in Americans' financial \ninformation for purposes of fraud and theft. If they don't travel to \nAmerica or if they don't have a technical connection to America, we \ncannot go after them. There is an American victim, but we cannot go \nafter them. That is a loophole that harms Americans that this bill \nwould close.\n  I cannot believe there is one Member of this institution who would \noppose closing a loophole that allows foreign criminals access to \nAmericans' financial information for fraudulent purposes but puts them \nbeyond the reach of our criminal law. That is one part of what our bill \ndoes.\n  Second, it raises penalties for people who intrude on critical \ninfrastructure. You can go all around this country, you can go to \nmilitary installations that have way less security concerns than our \ncritical infrastructure, like our electric grid, and you will see \nchain-link fences that say department of whatever, U.S. Government, \nstay out. You cannot go in there to picnic, you cannot go in there \nbecause you are curious, you cannot go in there for a hike, and the \nreason is because there is a national security component to what is \ngoing on in there.\n  Well, there is a huge national security component to our critical \ninfrastructure, like our electric grid. All this would do is raise the \npenalties. You could still go in, but if you get caught doing something \nillegal there, then it is a little different if you are attacking \nAmerica's critical infrastructure than if you are just prowling around \nin some other portion of the Web that does not have that.\n  Again, I think if that came to a vote, we would probably get 90 \npercent of this body in favor. Who is in support of allowing people to \nmess around in our critical infrastructure?\n  The third is botnet brokers. Botnets are out there all over the \nInternet. They are a plague on the Internet. There is no such thing as \na good botnet. Everyone would be better off if they were removed. They \nare like weeds on the Internet. There are people who are brokers who \nallow access to botnets, and because our laws are so out of date, if \nyou are just brokering access to a botnet for criminal purposes, there \nis no offense. Why would we not want to empower our Department of \nJustice to be able to go after people who are criminal brokers allowing \naccess for criminals to botnets to use for criminal purposes against \nAmericans? I don't understand that.\n  Lastly, botnet takedowns. A botnet is a weed. We wait until somebody \nactually encounters that weed and is harmed by it before we allow our \nDepartment of Justice to act. We should be out there taking down \nbotnets on a hygiene basis all the time. We are limited because of this \nartificiality. That is the fourth piece of the bill. It empowers botnet \ntakedowns like the Bugat takedown we just did. We should be doing a lot \nmore of that. Again, unless somebody here is in the botnet caucus and \nis in favor of more botnets out there, this is something which would \nprobably pass unanimously. Yet I cannot get a vote.\n  It is bipartisan, has had a hearing, is in the queue, is supported by \nthe Department of Justice, and those are the four sub-elements of it. \nFor some reason, the masters of the universe have gone off and had a \nmeeting in which they decided this is not going to be in the queue. I \nobject to that procedure.\n  I am sorry we are at this stage at this point because I think that on \nthe merits this would win. This is a bipartisan, good, Department of \nJustice-supported, law enforcement exercise to protect people against \ncyber criminals. I don't know what the sense is that there is some \nhidden pro-botnet, pro-foreign cyber criminal caucus here that won't \nlet an amendment like mine get a vote.\n  I will yield the floor. I see Senator Carper here, and he has done \ngreat work to try to be more productive than my amendment reflects. I \nhope we can sort this out to a point where an amendment like mine, \nwhich was in the queue in the original deal that got us to this bill, \ncan now get back in some kind of a queue so that we can get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I appreciate the yielding by Senator Whitehouse. Let me \njust say that if your provision, Senator Whitehouse, does not end up in \nthis bill and we actually do pass it, I am sure we will conference with \nthe House. There will be an opportunity to revisit this issue. So I \nhope you will stay in touch with those of us who might be fortunate \nenough to be a conferee.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I appreciate that very much, more than the Senator \ncan know.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the cyber \nsecurity information bill introduced by my colleagues, Senators Burr \nand Feinstein. I want to commend my colleagues and their staff for \ntheir leadership and for their tireless efforts on this extremely \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  As ranking member and former chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I have been following cyber security \nand this information sharing proposal in particular literally for \nyears. In fact, when Senator Feinstein first introduced an information \nsharing bill in 2012--that was like two or three Congress's ago--it was \nreferred to Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, on which I \nserved. That bill was ultimately folded into a comprehensive cyber \nsecurity bill that I had the honor of cosponsoring with Senators Joe \nLieberman, Susan Collins, Jay Rockefeller, and Senator Feinstein. We \nwere not able to pass that bill, but I think it has paved the way for \nother cyber legislation, including the bill that is before us today and \na number of the amendments that are going to be offered to that bill in \nthe managers' amendment, especially.\n  Last Congress, I worked with our ranking member on homeland security, \nDr. Tom Coburn, and our House counterparts to get not one, not two, not \nthree, but four cyber security bills enacted into law, signed by the \nPresident. I believe these four bills laid a very strong foundation for \nsome significant improvements on how the Department of Homeland \nSecurity carries out its cyber security mission and really for this \nbill before us too.\n  What the legislation Dr. Coburn and I worked on during the last \nCongress did, in essence, was to better equip the Department of \nHomeland Security to operate at the center of the kind of robust \ninformation sharing program that the Burr-Feinstein bill would set up. \nHow do they do that? One, make sure the Department of Homeland Security \nwould have the ability to attract and retain top-flight talent, much \nlike the National Security Agency already has.\n  The legislation actually takes something called the cyber ops center, \nNCCIC, within the Department of Homeland Security and makes it real and \nfunctional and an entity that people would use and listen to.\n  Finally, we took an old law called FISMA, the Federal Information \nSharing Management Act--we took something that was just a paperwork \noperation, this FISMA legislation--like a once-in-a-year check to see \nhow good a cyber security agency might be--and turned it into not a \npaperwork operation, not a once-every-365-days operation, but a 24/7 \nsurveillance operation on the lookout for intrusions within and across \nthe Federal Government broadly.\n  That legislation, affectionally known as FISMA, was also designed to \nmake clear what the division of labor was between the Office of \nManagement and Budget, OMB, and the Department of Homeland Security on \nprotecting the dot.gov domain. We made it clear that the job of OMB is \nto, if you will, steer the ship. The job of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is to row the ship, to row the boat. That is a good division \nof labor given that OMB only has six employees who work on this stuff \nand the Department of Homeland Security has hundreds. So I think we \nfigured out the sharing of labor, the division of labor, and also made \nsure the Department of Homeland Security has the resources--the horses, \nthe resources--and the technology they need.\n  Sharing more cyber security threat information among and between the \nprivate sector and the Federal Government players who are on the \nfrontline in cyber security is critical for national security. Over the \nlast couple of\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\nyears, we have witnessed many troubling cyber attacks against our \nbanks, but not just our banks, against retailers, health providers, \ngovernment agencies, and God knows how many others.\n  Some of those launching these attacks were just criminals. Some of \nthem were just criminals. They want to steal information. They want to \nmake money off of our personal information, off our intellectual \nproperty, like our intellectual seed corn, if you will, for companies \nlarge and small and for universities as well. Others just want to be \ndisruptive or they want to make political points. Some actors, however, \nare capable or would like to develop the capability to use a cyber \nattack to harm people and cause physical damage.\n  It is long past time for this body to take action to more effectively \ncombat these threats we now face in cyber space. That is why earlier \nthis year I introduced a similar information sharing bill. This bill \nlargely mirrored the administration's original proposal.\n  The administration asked me to introduce their information sharing \nbill. Before I did that, we actually had a hearing in the committee on \nhomeland security. Part of the centerpiece of the hearing was the \nadministration's proposal. We got some good ideas on how to make it \nbetter. We made it better and introduced that bill to use, if you will, \nas a point-counter point in a constructive, positive way with the \nlegislation that worked its way through the Intelligence Committee. But \nwe did not stop there. We took information from a lot of experts and \nstakeholders.\n  The measure we are discussing today shares the same goals as my \noriginal bill--largely the administration's original bill--to increase \nthe sharing of cyber threat information between the Federal Government \nand the private sector and between different entities within the \nprivate sector. I am pleased that we are finally discussing these \ncritical issues on the Senate floor.\n  The substitute amendment we are debating today makes a number of \nimprovements to the bill that was first made public after the \nIntelligence Committee reported it out. It also includes several \nchanges that I, as well as several of my colleagues, have been calling \nfor--including the chairman of our committee.\n  I would like to thank Senators Burr and Feinstein. I thank their \nstaff for working closely with our staff and others to produce what I \nbelieve is a significantly smarter and stronger bill. Is it perfect? \nNo, not yet. But I can say there is always room for improvement. That \nis why we still have a debate on a number of amendments and those like \nthe one mentioned by Senator Whitehouse that may be germane in a \ndifferent kind of way in conference.\n  While there may not be agreement on everything in this bill, I \nbelieve most of our colleagues would come to the conclusion that it \nreally will help to improve our Nation's cyber security and, by \nextension, our national security and, by extension, our economic \nsecurity.\n  First, the bill would ensure that the government--our government--is \nproviding actionable intelligence to private sector entities that are \nseeking to better protect themselves in cyber space. Businesses around \nour country are hungry for information they can use to fend off attacks \nand better protect their systems and their customers. This bill would \nmake the Federal Government a much stronger partner for them.\n  Many companies that I have talked to of late also want to share more \ninformation with the Federal Government about what they are seeing \nonline every day, but they are unsure of the rules of the road. In \nother words, companies want more predictability and they want more \ncertainty when it comes to working with our government. This bill would \ngive them that by clarifying that they won't be putting themselves in \nlegal jeopardy if they choose to share cyber threat information with \nour Federal Government.\n  If companies do want to avail themselves of the legal protections the \nbill offers, they would have to, with two narrow exceptions, use the \ninformation sharing portal at the Department of Homeland Security. This \nputs the Department of Homeland Security, a civilian entity, at the \ncenter of the information sharing process. I think this is smart and \nthe right thing to do. In fact, many experts and companies that I have \ntalked to across the country as recently as last week out in Silicone \nValley and out on the west coast--they agree with what I have just \nsaid.\n  I know many Americans are uneasy with companies they do business with \ndirectly handing over data to an intelligence or law enforcement \nagency. The Department of Homeland Security will carry out its \nresponsibilities under this bill through the cyber ops center I \nmentioned earlier called the National Cyber Security and Communications \nIntegration Center--that is a mouthful. We affectionately call it N-\nKick. It is the cyber ops center. It includes folks from DHS and other \nFederal agencies. It includes a number of representatives of financial \nservices, the utility industry, our retail industry, and so forth, all \ntogether under one roof, talking together and working together to help \nus support one another and make it strong and more secure.\n\n  One of the bills I worked on with Dr. Coburn last Congress formally, \nas I said earlier, authorized this center. We are pleased to see that \nthis bill would make the most out of the resources we have already \ninvested in this cyber ops center, NCCIC.\n  Earlier this month, Secretary Jeh Johnson of the Department of \nHomeland Security told our Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee that beginning in November, the cyber ops center, NCCIC, will \nhave the capability to automate the distribution and receipt of cyber \nthreat indicators. I will say that again--to automate the distribution \nand the receipt of cyber threat indicators that they receive from \nothers, including those in the private sector. In other words, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will have the ability to share \ninformation with other agencies in real time--not next month, not next \nweek, not tomorrow, not in an hour, but in real time, which is really \nwhat this little bill before us today requires.\n  I know that the real-time sharing is incredibly important to the \nbill's sponsors, and it is important to me and probably to many of our \ncolleagues and stakeholders. Equally important, however, is the ability \nof the Department of Homeland Security to apply what I call a privacy \nscrub to the information it receives from industry, the threat \nindicators that come from industry--see something, say something--stuff \nthat they send to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  In the bill that I authored with others in my committee, including \nour chairman, we allow the Department of Homeland Security to, if you \nwill, receive information through its portal from various entities that \nwitness threat indicators, to see it and to put it through the portal, \nto bring it through the portal to do a privacy scrub. That is one of \nthe things the Department of Homeland Security has expertise in doing.\n  I used an example at lunch earlier today. I talked about baseball. I \nknow the Presiding Officer has some interest in baseball. There are \nteams called the Phillies in Philadelphia and the Pirates in \nPittsburgh. I would just say to him, thinking about baseball for a \nminute, let's say you are in the playoffs. Let's say you have a team in \nthe playoffs. You are in the ninth inning, and you need to get somebody \nout of the bullpen to close. You have a one-run lead. You look to the \nbullpen. He is now retired, but Mariano Rivera was the best closer in \nbaseball history. You have Mariano Rivera in the bullpen to come in and \nclose the game, and you have three other guys you just called up from \nthe Minor League, so maybe from AAA.\n  You say: Well, whom do I put in to close the game? Do I put in the \nbest closer we have ever had in baseball history or do I bring in three \nrookies, three Minor League guys?\n  Well, you bring in Mariano Rivera.\n  When it comes to being able to do privacy scrubs, the Department of \nHomeland Security--that is what they do. That is what they do. Now they \nhave the horses, the ability, and the technology to do it even better.\n  I know some of my colleagues are concerned that a privacy scrub will \nslow down the information sharing process. I share those concerns, but \nI have been assured by the Department--the bright, smart people at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--that less\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\nthan 1 percent of the information it receives would actually ever need \nto be reviewed by a human, by a person. The rest--roughly 95 percent to \n99 percent--would be shared with other agencies at machine speed. \nBingo.\n  I am very pleased that DHS has come to an agreement on this process \nwith its agency partners. We will be up and running with a portal in \nthe way I have described in the next couple weeks.\n  One of the amendments I filed speaks to this privacy scrub process. \nIt would make clear that the Department of Homeland Security could \ncarry out an automated privacy scrub in real time and without delay. In \nfact, my amendment would add just one word to the bill so that DHS \ncould continue to automatically remove irrelevant or erroneous data \nfrom cyber threat information.\n  I am very pleased that Senators Burr and Feinstein have taken this \namendment into consideration and have now modified their substitute \namendment to make sure the Department of Homeland Security can do what \nit does best, and that is to apply a privacy scrub--pulling out \npersonally identifiable information that actually shouldn't be passed \non to other Federal agencies. The substitute amendment now calls on DHS \nto work with its agency partners to agree on a process to share \ninformation while protecting privacy. This is a process DHS is already \nundertaking.\n  I thank Senators Burr and Feinstein, as well as our friends at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and other agencies, for working so hard \nto find agreement on this language and for working with my staff and me \non this important matter.\n  Another amendment I put forward with our committee chairman, Senator \nJohnson, aims to improve what we call cyber hygiene across the Federal \nGovernment and to prevent attacks against Federal agencies. This \nlanguage is based on a bill that Senator Johnson and I introduced and \nhad reported out of our homeland security committee by a unanimous \nvote. The amendment does three main things.\n  First, it would require all Federal agencies to implement specific \nbest practices and state-of-the-art technologies to defend against \ncyber attacks. For example, we had experts testify about the importance \nof strong authentication and data encryption. This amendment would make \nsure that agencies are taking these commonsense steps to bolster their \ncyber security defenses.\n  Second, the amendment would accelerate the deployment and adoption of \nthe Department of Homeland Security's cyber intrusion and detection \nprogram, known as EINSTEIN, as in Albert Einstein, but you don't have \nthe ``Albert'' in the name of this technology; it is called EINSTEIN.\n  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with EINSTEIN, with respect \nto homeland security and cyber security, let me take a couple of \nminutes to describe its main features.\n  We had EINSTEIN 1 present at the beginning, EINSTEIN 2 was follow-on \ntechnology, and then there is EINSTEIN 3. EINSTEIN basically analyzes \nInternet traffic entering and leaving Federal civilian agencies to \nidentify cyber threats and to try to stop attacks.\n  This system has been rolled out in phases over the last several \nyears. EINSTEIN 1 is the first step. It sees and actually records \nInternet traffic, much like a guard at a checkpoint watches cars go by \nand maybe writes down and records the license plates. EINSTEIN 2 \ndetects anything out of the ordinary and sets off alarms if a piece of \nmalware is trying to enter a Federal network. For example, a car comes \nthrough and it is not supposed to come through. That would set off an \nalarm and enable EINSTEIN 2 to actually detect a cyber intrusion. It \ndoesn't do anything about blocking. It doesn't block the car, in this \nexample. It doesn't block anything. EINSTEIN 3A, the latest version, \nuses unclassified and classified information to actually block the \ncyber attack.\n  So initially EINSTEIN 1 records basically what is being detected, \nEINSTEIN 2 actually detects bad stuff coming through in terms of an \nintrusion, and EINSTEIN 3A blocks it. The problem is that less than \nhalf of our Federal civilian agencies actually have EINSTEIN 3A in \nplace. They have the ability to record an intrusion, the ability to \ndetect an intrusion, but not the ability to block an intrusion. They \nneed the ability to block. What our legislation would do would be to \nmake sure that agencies have EINSTEIN in place, including the ability \nto block intrusions, within 1 year.\n  Finally, our amendment incorporates the language originally drafted \nby Senator Susan Collins, the former chair of the homeland security \ncommittee and a great colleague of ours for many years, Senator Mark \nWarner, Senator Kelly Ayotte, Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator Dan \nCoats, and Senator Barbara Mikulski. They are all cosponsors of the \namendment Senator Collins offered. These provisions would strengthen \nthe ability of the Department of Homeland Security to shore up cyber \ndefenses at civilian agencies and to address cyber emergencies across \nthe Federal Government.\n  Again, I am incredibly grateful that Senator Feinstein and Senator \nBurr agreed to include our language in the substitute amendment \nlanguage that worked its way through our committee. We had hearings and \nhad the opportunity to mark up the legislation. It worked the way it is \nsupposed to work. And I think that without exception it had bipartisan \nsupport coming through our committee. It is the perfect complement to \nthe information sharing bill we are discussing this week. I think it \nmakes a good bill that much better.\n  I thank the Senators for working with me and Senator Johnson on it.\n  Just one more thing before I close. I know the Presiding Officer \nthinks a lot about root causes, and rather than just address the \nsymptoms of a problem, let's think about what is the root cause of the \nproblem. The Senator who is waiting to follow me on the floor, the \nformer Governor of Maine, thinks similarly. I do too. It is not enough \nto just address the symptoms of these problems. A part of what we need \nto be thinking about is, How do we get to the root cause?\n  Until fairly recently, a lot of our financial services institutions \nin this country were under constant attack by somebody who was trying \nto overload their Web sites and essentially trying to shut them down. \nIt is sort of like when we were first standing up the Affordable Care \nAct, they had so much traffic on their Web site that it would kind of \nbreak down.\n  There are so many cyber threats from around the world. We think Iran \nis behind it. They are trying to do that, to bring down our financial \nservices business--and sometimes with some success.\n  About a year ago, when we got very serious about negotiating with the \nIranians and our partners--the French, the Brits, the Germans, the \nRussians, and the Chinese--some kind of an agreement where the Iranians \nwould give up any hope they had of having a nuclear weapon and the \nterms for our lifting our economic sanctions--when it became clear that \nthose were serious negotiations, that something might actually happen \nfrom those negotiations, guess what happened to those attacks. We call \nthem DDoS. What do you suppose happened? Well, guess what, they started \nletting up little by little until the time we actually voted here to \nlet that agreement be enacted and hopefully be administered and \nimplemented. That was a root cause being addressed.\n  Another root cause we had over in China--for years the Chinese have \nsought to use cyber attacks to get into our most successful businesses, \nsome of our research and development operations in those businesses, \nand work being done within Federal agencies on research and \ndevelopment--actually, the intellectual seed corn for creating jobs and \nopportunity in this country. The cyber attacks were--we believe it was \nChina trying to steal information from our universities. They were \ndoing a lot of research that could lead to economic activity and job \ncreation. We didn't like it. We don't do that. We don't do that to \nthem, and we don't want them to do that to us. We complained about it \nand complained about it and called out some of the folks whom we \nthought were behind this in China.\n  President Xi visited us in this city about 3 week ago. He and our \nPresident had some tough, direct, and probably not entirely comfortable \nconversations. One of them dealt with this\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\nissue, what we believe is the intrusion by Chinese actors in order to \nsteal our intellectual seed corn, in order to maybe have a short step, \na shortcut to economic development, economic activity. They would not \nhave to spend the money, the time, and the energy to do all the \nresearch that would lead to this innovation and job-creation activity. \nThe agreement that came out of that was the Chinese and our country \nhave agreed that neither side will knowingly steal this kind of \ninformation from the other. ``Knowingly'' is a very broad term, and so \nwe have to make sure that ``knowingly'' actually means something. \nSecretary Jeh Johnson, the head of the Homeland Security Department, \nand Attorney General Loretta Lynch have been assigned to build on this \ninitial agreement and see what we can make of it.\n  I will close with this. A lot of people in our country don't \nunderstand what all this cyber security stuff is--intrusion, EINSTEIN, \nand all the items we are talking about that are in the legislation \nwhich is before us this week. They do know this: It is not good when \npeople can steal the kind of information that needs to be protected. \nWhether it is part of the government domain, military or intelligence \nsecrets; whether it is economic secrets or developments that lead to \neconomic gain; whether it is personally identifiable information that \ncan be used for blackmail purposes or to monetize and to somehow make \nmoney off of that information, we know it is not good. There is no one \nsilver bullet to actually stop this kind of activity, but there are a \nlot of silver BBs, and some of them are pretty big.\n  The legislation that is before us today, bolstered by similar \nlegislation that has come out of the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, is a pretty good-sized BB. They are not going to \nenable us to win this war by themselves, but they will enable us to \nmake real progress. It will make us feel a good bit more secure than we \nhave, knowing that this is an enemy across the globe and that a number \nof enemies wish us harm. They are not going to give up. There is a lot \nof money involved. They will be back at us, and we have to bring our \n``A'' game to work every day in the Department of Homeland Security and \nother Federal agencies working in tandem with the private sector.\n  Hopefully, with this information, the folks in the private sector--if \nthey want to get the liability protection and share information with \nthe Federal Government, we want them to use the portal through the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security, \nto the extent that privacy scrub is needed--it does not happen often. \nIt happens less than 1 percent of the time with the information that \ncomes through the portal. The legislation before us, with the \namendments that are offered, will enable us to have that kind of \nsecurity about our private information and at the same time to do a \nvery good job--a much better job--in protecting what is valuable to us.\n  Mr. President, I think that is about it for me. I appreciate very \nmuch the opportunity to speak. I appreciate the patience of Senator \nKing, and I will yield the floor to him.\n  I will just say in closing--no, Senator Blunt, I will yield to you \nnext. It is good to be with both of you. I look forward to working with \nyou on these and, with respect to the Senator gentleman from Missouri, \nvery closely on related matters.\n  Thank you so very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. He and I \nhave worked on legislation together to protect data security, to have \none standard for notifying people whose information has been accessed \nby people who shouldn't have it, and we are going to continue to work \non that and look for opportunities, whether it is this bill or some \nother bill, to add that important element to what we are doing here.\n  I come to the floor today, as I am sure many others have, to express \nsupport for this bill--for the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act--a \nbill that gives us tools we don't currently have, and to break down \nbarriers that we do currently have. This is a bill that would allow \nindividuals who see the information they are responsible for being \nattacked to call others in their same business and say: Here is what is \nhappening to us right now. If you are not seeing it already, you should \nbe looking for it. When they do that, it doesn't violate any \ncompetitive sharing of information. What it does is bring everybody \ninto the loop of defense as quickly as possible and allow them to look \nfor help from the government as well.\n  So I express support for this bill. We know that day after day \nAmericans who read, watch, or listen to the news learn of another cyber \nattack. Some involve attacks of government systems, while others \ninvolve the private sector.\n  In 2012 and 2013, hacker groups linked to Iran targeted American bank \nWeb sites and sustained an attack on those Web sites in a way that was \ndesigned to disrupt people trying to do business--trying to pay their \nown personal bills, trying to do things people should expect to be able \nto easily do.\n  Early in 2014, we learned that cyber criminals had stolen 40 million \ncredit card numbers from a major retailer and had probably compromised \nan additional 70 million accounts. We also have learned that a lot of \ntimes when we hear about these, they seem bad enough at first, but they \nseem a whole lot worse later when we find out what really happened, \nwhen we see how deep these criminals were able to go, how deep these \nterrorists were able to go, how deep these government-sponsored \nentities were able to go to get at information they shouldn't have.\n  In September of that same year, September 2014, we learned another \nmajor retailer had suffered a data breach. In that case there were 56 \nmillion credit card holders.\n  In February of this year, we learned a health insurance provider's \nsystem had been hacked, and 80 million customers were affected. This \nwas a data breach that particularly impacted my State--particularly \nimpacted Missourians--and we saw a huge change in the IRS fraud that \noccurred this year because, we believe at least, because criminals \nsuddenly had all this sensitive personally identifiable information \nthey had stolen. Suddenly somebody besides you was filing your tax \nreturn. Only later did the people who really had the income tax return \nto file find out that somebody had filed it for them.\n  In June of this year--maybe the most surprising to all of us who have \nheard over and over again that the private sector is struggling, we \nsuddenly found out the U.S. Office of Personnel Management increased a \nprevious estimate of how many people were affected by its own data \nbreach. The files of Federal employees and people related to those \nfiles was revised upward to 21.5 million people. Then we found out that \nalso included roughly 5.5 million sets of fingerprints.\n  I am not exactly sure what you could do with somebody's fingerprints \non the Internet today. I can only imagine what you might be able to \nfigure out to do with those fingerprints. Remember, your fingerprints \ndon't change, and probably the government entity responsible for that \nhacking that has those fingerprints is always going to have those \nfingerprints as they think of new and malicious ways to use them. So we \nare talking about well over 100 million Americans who already have \ntheir personal information in the hands of people it shouldn't be in.\n  The challenge before us is as clear as it is urgent. Virtually every \naspect of our society and our economy rely on information technology. \nIt has enabled tremendous economic growth, it has enabled tremendous \nefficiencies in every sector, but it has put all kinds of information \nout there in ways that, looking back, we are going to wonder why we \nmade that information so available in so many places and left so \nunprotected.\n  Federal, State, and local governments rely on that information \ntechnology as well. As the technology advances, its widespread adoption \nhas also opened us to new dangers. Modern cyber security threats are \nsophisticated, they are massive, and they are persistent. This doesn't \njust happen every day, it happens all the time every day.\n  The culprits of these attacks and intrusions range in terms of their \nmotives and their abilities. We just heard of a teenager who figured \nout how to\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\nget into the personal account of the CIA director--at least that is the \npublic media report--and the homeland security director. This is not a \nparticularly sophisticated individual, but obviously a pretty capable \nperson who gets to two individuals that one would think would be the \nmost cautious.\n  Some of these people are bent on sheer vandalism--just the thrill of \ncyber vandalism--while others are determined to steal intellectual \nproperties from American companies. The motive there is clear. It is \neasier to steal intellectual property than it is to go through the hard \nwork of creating it. Suddenly that information is out there, and the \npeople who created it have been robbed.\n  I hear this all the time when I visit companies in my State. We have \nseen cyber intrusions used for espionage. We have seen one major \ncompany attacked for no reason other than to embarrass the company \nbecause a foreign government didn't like something the company had \ndone. It is quite a way to have a movie review, that we are just going \nto destroy as much of your technology as we can by a cyber invasion.\n  A great many more of these people are motivated by greed--pilfering \nother people's identities, getting access to other people's account \ninformation, and selling that information on the black-market. This \nbecomes a real opportunity for them. The more you remove it from the \nperson who initially got it, the harder it is to find out who initially \ngot it and what they did with it.\n  Underneath all this is the implication of more serious attacks that \ncan cause physical harm and can cause mass disruption of critical \ninfrastructure of the country that is very dependent on cyber security. \nThis really begs the question: What are we doing to protect our country \nand our citizens from these cyber adversaries? I have been in Senate \nfor 5 years. I have had the great opportunity to represent the people \nof Missouri here for 5 years. And during every one of those 5 years, we \nhave been talking about how important it is that we do something about \ncyber security. This is the only approach I have seen in those 5 years \nthat has bipartisan support. It has a bicameral consensus. This is \nsomething that can happen.\n  This is a problem that it is time to stop talking about. Do we want \nsome other government to have everybody's fingerprints before we do \nsomething about it? This is the time to do something about it. As a \nmember of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am certainly \nhere to support the chairman of that committee and the vice chairman of \nthat committee to finally pass this bill, a bill to enhance the public-\nprivate partnerships that can provide the kind of cyber defense we \nneed.\n  We need to do that and we need to encourage lots of sharing. We need \nto encourage sharing of attacks. We need to encourage early on, as I \nsaid, the ability to call somebody else in your same business and to \ncontact them and say: This is happening right now. That is the best \ntime to say it. The other option is to say: This happened to us late \nlast night or happened yesterday, but this is happening to us. Is it \nhappening to you?\n  There is lots of misunderstanding about this concept. Without getting \ntoo technical, cyber threats are the malicious codes and algorithms \nused to infect computer systems and attack networks. They are \ntechniques that use bits and bytes. They are the ones and zeros of the \ndigital age that allow hackers to intrude upon private systems, steal \ninformation, perpetrate fraud, or disrupt activities over the Internet.\n  In very dangerous circumstances, these techniques can be used to \nremotely control critical infrastructure management systems, such as \nsupervisory control and data acquisition systems. I saw something on \nthe news the other day where some hackers, for no intent other than \nmaybe just to see if they could do it, had figured out how to take over \none of the cars that was driving itself. Suddenly the car wasn't \ndriving itself; the hacker was driving the car.\n  When a particular company finds itself subjected to some novel new \napproach, the quicker they can share that, the better. When the \ngovernment discovers a new method being used to infiltrate information \ntechnology systems abroad or here, they need to be able to share that \nwith American companies quickly so they can protect themselves. There \nare things the private sector sees that the government does not, and \nthere are things the government sees that the private sector does not. \nThis legislation gives the obligation and opportunity to both of them \nto join together in this important fight. Modern communications \nnetworks move at an incredibly rapid pace. We need to be fighting back \nat that same kind of rapid pace.\n  This bill establishes a strictly voluntary program. Unlike some of \nthe other programs we have talked about to secure ourselves in a post-\n9/11 world, this is a strictly voluntary program that leverages \nAmerican ingenuity to unleash the arsenal of democracy against cyber \nadversaries.\n  When it comes to the cyber threat, we have to act for a common \npurpose. Throughout this debate there has been a great deal of \ndiscussion about the need to protect liberty in the information age. I \ntruly think liberty and security are not at odds with one another in \nthis legislation. When it comes to this bill, it comes the closest to \nhaving the balance we all would like to see. It takes into \nconsideration the importance of liberty, but it also takes into \nconsideration what happens as we protect our security.\n  I would close by saying of all the attacks we have had, and as bad as \nthey have been, none of them have been the sort of catastrophic \ninfrastructure attack that we may see that would impact the grid, that \nimpacts our ability to communicate, impacts our ability to make the \nwater system work, or impacts our ability to make the electrical system \nwork. If that happens, the Congress will not only act, the Congress \nwill overreact.\n  This is the right time to have this debate. Let's put this \nlegislation on the books right now. Let's give the people a law that \nmakes sense at a time when we have the time to debate it, instead of \nwaiting to see the direction we will turn to when we should have \ndebated this and moved in this direction right now. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for this bipartisan bill that I think will wind up \non the President's desk and become law.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my patient friend from Maine, who has been \nwaiting. He and I serve on the Select Committee on Intelligence \ntogether, and I look forward to his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, the United States is under attack. We are \nunder attack--not a week ago, a month ago, September 11 or yesterday, \nbut right at this moment. We are under attack from state actors, from \nterrorist nonstate actors, and from garden-variety criminals. This \ncyber issue is one of the most serious that we face.\n  When I first got here, I was appointed to the Armed Services and \nIntelligence Committees. On those two committees over the past 3 years, \nat least half of our hearings have touched upon this issue and the \nthreat that it presents to this country. The leaders of our \nintelligence community and our military community, in open session and \nin closed session, have sounded the alarm over and over and over. The \nmost dramatic--I don't remember what the hearing was--was when one of \nour witnesses said: ``The next Pearl Harbor will be cyber.''\n  As the Senator from Missouri just pointed out, we are fortunate that \nwe have had a number of warning shots but none have been devastating. \nBut we have had warning shots--at Sony, at Target, at Anthem, at the \nOffice of Personnel Management of the U.S. Government, and at the home \nemail of the Director of the CIA. We have had large and small \nintrusions and cyber attacks that have been more than annoying, but, so \nfar, they haven't been catastrophic. That is just a matter of time. \nThat is why we have to move this bill.\n  This bill isn't a comprehensive answer to this question, but it is at \nleast a piece of it. It is a beginning. We are going to have to talk \nabout other aspects of our cyber strategy, but at least we can pass \nthis bill, which came out of the committee 14 to 1. It is bipartisan, \nand it has support in the House. Let's do something.\n  I do not want to go home to Maine and try to explain to my \nconstituents,\n\n[[Page S7394]]\n\nwhen the natural gas system or the electric system is brought down, \nthat we couldn't quite get around to it because of the difference of \ncommittee jurisdictions or because we had other priorities or because \nwe were tied up on the budget. This is a priority. It is something we \nshould be doing immediately, and I am delighted that we have moved to \nit.\n  Now, as I have sat in the Intelligence Committee every Tuesday and \nThursday afternoon for the past 3 years, it occurred to me several \nmonths into those debates and the discussions of this and other issues \nthat really we in the Intelligence Committee and also we in this body \nreally are working with and weighing and balancing two constitutional \nprovisions.\n  The first is the preamble of the Constitution. The most basic \nresponsibility of any government, anywhere, anytime, is to provide for \nthe common defense. That is why governments are formed, to provide the \nsecurity, and also to insure domestic tranquility. Those two together \nare the basic functions of why we are here--to protect our people from \nharm. And that is clearly what this bill is talking about.\n  But the other constitutional provision in the picture that we also \nhave to weigh is the Fourth Amendment: ``The right of the people to be \nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . . . '' \nThat is a fundamental premise of who we are as a people.\n  These two provisions of the Constitution are intentioned--neither one \ndominates, neither one controls the other--and it is our job in this \nbody to continuously weigh and calibrate these two provisions and their \nbalance in light of threats and evolving technologies.\n  When the Fourth Amendment was written, nobody had ever heard of \ntelephones. They certainly had never heard of the Internet. They never \nthought about any of these things. But they said: The rights ``shall \nnot be violated.'' It is interesting--``unreasonable searches and \nseizures.'' They didn't know the threats we would be facing when they \nsaid it was a fundamental premise of the U.S. Constitution that we \nshould protect against both foreign and domestic enemies. That is what \nwe have to do, and that is what this bill does.\n  This bill is very carefully worked up, with a lot of discussion and \nnegotiation, to be effective in protecting the public, while, at the \nsame time, to be effective in protecting the public's privacy rights in \nrespecting these two principles. We have had warning after warning \nafter warning, and now it is time for us to act.\n  The good news about the United States is that we are the most wired \nnation in the world. Technology has been a huge boon to our economy and \nto our people, and we are way ahead of a lot of the rest of the world \nin our interrelationship with technology and how we have used it to \nenhance our lives. That is the good news. The bad news is that we are \nthe most wired country in the world, because that means we are the most \nvulnerable--asymmetric vulnerability. We are more vulnerable because we \nare more connected. That means we have to take great care in this \ncountry to be sure that we don't allow that vulnerability to result in \na catastrophic loss for our people.\n  Not only are we talking about national security issues, but we are \ntalking about individual people's lives. If the electric grid went \ndown, people's lives would and could be lost--in hospitals, at traffic \nintersections, across the country. If the natural gas system--the vast \npipeline system that links our country in terms of energy--somehow went \nawry because of a cyber intrusion into the operating system, that would \nhave devastating consequences for human lives and also, of course, for \nthe economy of our country. Somebody could get into the routing system \nof a railroad, and a train carrying hazardous material would be caused \nto derail. These are the kinds of things that can happen and will \nlikely happen unless we take steps to protect ourselves.\n  Some of these attacks and intrusions are sponsored by nation-states. \nWe know that. Some of them are sponsored by just garden-variety \ncriminals who are trying to steal our money. Or some of them are large \ninternational criminal organizations that are trying to steal our \ncommercial intelligence and how we build our products and how we \ncompete. Some of them are terrorist organizations that see this as a \ncheap way to attack America. Why go to all the trouble to build a bomb \nand smuggle it into the country and all the risk that entails, when you \ncan disrupt the country in just as great a way with a few strokes on a \nlaptop?\n  It is economic security, national security, economics. It has been \nestimated worldwide that cyber crime costs our country $445 billion a \nyear. That is to the global economy--a half trillion dollars a year. \nSome 200,000 jobs in the United States could be and are being affected, \nand 800 million personnel records were stolen, and 40 million were \nAmericans.\n  The cost of cyber crime is estimated to be between 15 and 20 percent \nof the value created by the Internet. We always talk that we don't want \nany taxes on the Internet. This is a tax. This is a tax we are all \npaying. The users of the Internet are paying to ward off this epidemic \nof cyber crime.\n  It is not only the government. Of course, it is companies, such as \nSony, Target, Anthem, the industrial base, JP Morgan, Home Depot. The \nlist goes on and on. Most importantly, it is not just the big guys. \nSometimes we feel that OK, this is the large banks, the large insurance \ncompanies that have to worry about this. In the State of Maine, we have \nto worry about it.\n  My staff and I in Maine have reached out to businesses large and \nsmall across the State. Every single one, with one exception, listed \ncyber intrusion as one of their greatest issues.\n  The Maine Credit Union League, with $2.5 million a year, and local \ncredit unions are having to deal with cyber intrusion.\n  One of our Maine health care providers has experienced thousands of \nattempts to steal confidential data every year. Keeping the data safe \nis costing them more than $1 million. This is costing us real money.\n  At one of our Maine financial institutions, 60 to 70 percent of the \nemails they get in the bank are phishing emails trying to compromise \ntheir secured data.\n  One of our utilities spent over $1 million a year just on \npreventative costs to defend against cyber crime. This is in a State of \n1.3 million people. This is real. This is real in our State.\n  I had a forum over the August break with businesses throughout \nMaine--mostly small businesses and homeland security. We had 100 \nbusinesses come just to visit and sit for a day to talk about this \nissue. These were small businesses, and all of them were seeing these \nkinds of problems.\n  One was a small business with 35 employees that did a deal overseas, \nand a cyber criminal in effect stole their payment. They sent a fake \ninvoice to the customer overseas, the customer paid it, and the money \nwent to the crook, not to my company in Maine. That is the kind of \nthing that is happening, and that is one of the reasons we have to take \naction today.\n  No business is immune. No individual is immune. And, of course, this \ncountry is not immune.\n  The price of inaction is just too high. This is something we must \nattend to. As I mentioned, this bill is not the whole answer, but it is \na part of the answer.\n  Some people say: Well, it is not broad enough. My answer is this: OK, \nI understand that, but let's do what we can do and then take it one \nstep at a time.\n  Some people say it compromises privacy. I don't believe that it does. \nExtraordinary measures were imported into this bill in order to protect \nthe privacy of individuals. This is not about individual data. This is \nabout a company voluntarily telling the government and perhaps some \nother companies: Here is what I am seeing as an attack. How can we \ncollectively defend ourselves against it?\n  That is what this bill is really all about. We have to take action, \nand now is the time.\n  I thank the chair and the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, \nthe members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the members of the Judiciary Committee, and all of those who \nhave contributed to the finalization of this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  There is an attitude out there that we can't get anything done around\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\nhere. I think this gives us an opportunity to prove that idea wrong. We \ncan get things done. We should get things done. This is a chance for us \nto protect our people, to provide for the common defense--which is our \nmost solemn constitutional responsibility--in a way that also protects \nthe interests of the Fourth Amendment and individual privacy rights.\n  I hope we can move swiftly, complete the consideration of this bill \nthis week, work out our differences with the House, and get this matter \nto the President. We have no place to hide if we don't get this done. \nThis is what we are here for.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who worked so hard to bring us to this \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nwish to thank him on a well-planned, well-thought-out, and very \nconvincing presentation, and an argument that, frankly, I can add very \nlittle to. So I will make my remarks very brief.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for highlighting the absolute \nimportance of the passage of this legislation. And, I might add, he is \none of the most serious and hard-working members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee as well. I won't go any further.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 754. I thank my \ncolleagues, Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein, for their \nongoing leadership.\n  In the short 2 months since this bill was last on the Senate floor, \nthe need for action on information sharing has only increased. It is \nnot for a lack of trying. We have continuously failed to make progress \non this bill. As the Senator from Maine just made clear, that must \nchange. Enacting legislation to confront the accumulating dangers of \ncyber threats must be among the highest national security priorities of \nthe Congress.\n  The need for congressional action, in my view, is also enhanced by \nthe administration's inability to develop the policies and framework \nnecessary to deter our adversaries in cyberspace.\n  Earlier this week we learned just how ineffective the administration \nhas been in addressing our cyber challenges. Within days of reaching an \nagreement to curb the stealing of information for economic gain, \nChina--China--repeatedly, reportedly, continues its well-coordinated \nefforts to steal designs of our critical weapons systems and to wage \neconomic espionage against U.S. companies. It is not a surprise, but it \nserves as yet another sad chapter in this administration's inability to \naddress the cyber threats.\n  I guess in the last couple of days it has been made known that some \nhacker hacked into the information of both the Director of the CIA and \nthe chairman of the homeland security committee. That is interesting. \nAs the President's failed China agreement clearly demonstrates, our \nresponse to cyber attacks has been tepid at best and nonexistent at \nworst. Unless and until the President uses the authority he has to \ndefer, deter, defend, and respond to the growing number in severity of \ncyber threats, we will risk not just more of the same but embolden \nadversaries in terrorist organizations that will continuously pursue \nmore severe and destructive attacks.\n  Addressing our cyber vulnerabilities must be a national security \npriority. Just this week, Admiral Rogers, the head of Cyber Command, \nreiterated, ``It's only a matter of time before someone uses cyber as a \ntool to do damage to critical infrastructure.''\n  My colleagues don't have to agree with the Senator from Maine or me \nor anybody else, but shouldn't we listen to Admiral Rogers, the head of \nCyber Command, probably the most knowledgeable person or one of the \nmost knowledgeable who said, ``It is only a matter of time before \nsomeone uses cyber as a tool to do damage to critical infrastructure.''\n  According to the recently retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Martin Dempsey, our military enjoys ``a significant \nmilitary advantage'' in every domain except for one--cyber space. As \nGeneral Dempsey said, cyber ``is a level playing field. And that makes \nthis chairman very uncomfortable.''\n  I will tell you, it makes this chairman very uncomfortable as well.\n  Efforts are under way to begin addressing some of our strategic \nshortfalls in cyber space, including the training of a 6,200-person \ncyber force. However, these efforts will be meaningless unless we make \nthe tough policy decisions to establish meaningful cyber deterrence. \nThe President must take steps now to demonstrate to our adversaries \nthat the United States takes cyber attacks seriously and is prepared to \nrespond.\n  This legislation is one piece of that overall deterrence strategy, \nand it is long past time that Congress move forward on information \nsharing legislation. We have been debating similar cyber legislation \nsince at least 2012. I am glad this body has come a long way since that \ntime in recognizing that government mandates on the private sector, \nwhich operates the majority of our country's critical infrastructure, \nwill do more harm than good in cyber space. The voluntary framework in \nthis legislation properly defines the role of the private sector and \nthe role of the government in sharing threat information, defending \nnetworks, and deterring cyber attacks.\n  At the same time, it is unfortunate that it has taken over 3 years to \nadvance this commonsense legislation. The threats we face in cyber \nspace are real and imminent, as well as quickly evolving. All aspects \nof the Federal Government, including this body, must commit to more \nquickly identifying, enacting, and executing solutions to counter cyber \nthreats. If we do not, we will lose in cyber space.\n  As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I consider cyber \nsecurity one of the committee's top priorities. That is why the \nNational Defense Authorization Act provides a number of critical \nauthorities to ensure that the Department of Defense can develop the \ncapabilities it needs to deter aggression, defend our national security \ninterests, and when called upon, defeat our adversaries in cyber space. \nI find it unacceptable that the President has signaled his intent to \nveto this legislation that, among other key Department of Defense \npriorities, authorizes military cyber operations and dramatically \nreforms the broken acquisition system that has inhibited the \ndevelopment and delivery of key cyber capabilities.\n  More specifically, the National Defense Authorization Act extends \nliability protections to Department of Defense contractors who report \non cyber incidents or penetrations, and it authorizes the Secretary of \nDefense to develop, prepare, coordinate and, when authorized by the \nPresident, conduct a military cyber operation in response to malicious \ncyber activity carried out against the United States or a U.S. person \nby a foreign power. The NDAA authorizes $200 million for the Secretary \nof Defense to assess the cyber vulnerabilities of every major DOD \nweapons system. Finally, Congress required the President to submit an \nintegrated policy to deter adversaries in cyber space in the fiscal \nyear 2014 National Defense Authorization Act. I tell my colleagues that \nwe are still waiting on that policy. This year's NDAA includes funding \nrestrictions that will remain in place until it is delivered.\n  As we dither, our Nation grows more vulnerable, our privacy and \nsecurity are at greater risk, and our adversaries are further \nemboldened. The stakes are high, and it is essential that we pass the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act without further delay.\n  Let me also mention in closing that probably the most disturbing \ncomment I have heard in a long time on this issue in this challenge is \nwhen Admiral Rogers said that our biggest challenge is we don't know \nwhat we don't know. We don't know what the penetrations have been, what \nthe attacks have been, whether they have succeeded or not, where they \nare in this whole realm of cyber and information at all levels. When \nthe person we placed in charge of cyber security says we don't know \nwhat we don't know, my friends, that is a very serious situation.\n  I want to congratulate again both the managers of the bill in their \ncoordination and their cooperation in this bipartisan effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KING. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be pleased to yield.\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. KING. I ask the Senator, would you agree that this bill \nrepresents an important part of our cyber defense but that in order to \ndeter attacks in the long term, we must have a cyber policy that goes \nbeyond simple defensive measures?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would certainly agree, I would say to my friend from \nMaine, because if the adversaries that want to commit cyber attacks \nagainst the United States of America and our allies believe that there \nis no price to pay for those attacks, then where is the demotivating \nfactor in all of this which would, if they failed, then keep them from \ndoing what they are doing? It seems to me that this is an act of war, \nand I don't use that term lightly but I am trying to use it carefully. \nIf you damage intentionally another nation's military or its economy or \nits ability to function as a government--I would ask my friend from \nMaine--wouldn't that fit into at least a narrow interpretation of an \nact of war? If so, then should we only have defenses? Have we ever been \nin a conflict where we only have defenses and not the capability to go \nout and deter further aggression?\n  Mr. KING. I would suggest to the Senator that if you are in a fight \nand all you can do is defend and never punch, you are going to \neventually lose that fight. I think this is an important area. The \ntheory of deterrence, as distasteful as it might have been, the \nmutually assured destruction during the nuclear era did in fact prevent \nthe use of nuclear arms for some 70 years. I think we need to be \nthinking about a deterrence that goes beyond simply defensive measures. \nI commend the chairman for raising this issue and appreciate your \nthoughtful consideration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it seems as though every week, the American \npeople learn of yet another data breach in which Americans' sensitive, \nprivate information has been stolen by cyber criminals or foreign \ngovernments. This is a critical national security problem that deserves \naction by Congress. But our actions must be thoughtful and responsible, \nand we must recognize that strengthening our Nation's cyber security is \na complex endeavor with no single solution.\n  According to security researchers and technologists, the most \neffective action Congress can take to improve our cyber security is to \nrequire better and more comprehensive data security practices. That is \nwhy earlier this year, I introduced the Consumer Privacy Protection \nAct. That bill requires companies to utilize strong data security \nmeasures to protect our personal information and to help prevent \nbreaches in the first place. Companies that benefit financially from \ngathering and analyzing our personal information should be obligated to \ntake meaningful steps to keep it safe.\n  But rather than taking a comprehensive approach that addresses the \nmultiple facets of cyber security, the Republican majority appears to \nbe focused entirely on passing the Senate Intelligence Committee's \ncyber security information sharing bill. While legislation to promote \nthe sharing of cyber threat information could, if done right, be useful \nin improving our cyber security, it is a serious mistake to believe \nthat information sharing alone is the solution. Information sharing \nalone would not, for example, have prevented the breach at the Office \nof Personnel Management, nor would it have prevented other major \nbreaches, such as those at Target, Home Depot, Anthem, or Sony.\n  Instead of ensuring that companies better safeguard Americans' data, \nthis bill goes in the opposite direction, giving large corporations \nmore liability protection and even more leeway on how to use and share \nour personal information with the government--without adequate privacy \nprotections.\n  Also troubling is the fact that the Republican majority has been \nintent on jamming this bill through the Senate without any regard for \nregular process or opportunity for meaningful public debate. Only last \nyear, the Republican leader declared his commitment to ``a more robust \ncommittee process'' and plainly stated that ``bills should go through \ncommittee.'' But the bill was drafted behind closed doors by the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and it has not been the subject of any open \nhearings or any meaningful public debate. The text of the bill was only \nmade public after it was reported to the Senate floor, and no other \ncommittee of jurisdiction--including the Judiciary Committee--was \nallowed to consider and improve the bill.\n  The Judiciary Committee was prevented from considering this bill even \nthough it contains numerous provisions that affect matters squarely \nwithin our jurisdiction. First and foremost, the bill creates a \nframework of information sharing that could severely undermine \nAmericans' privacy. The bill also overrides all existing law to provide \nbroad liability protections for any company that shares information \nwith the government. It also overrides important privacy laws such as \nthe Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, and the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, over which the Judiciary Committee \nhas long exercised jurisdiction. CISA even amends the Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, and creates new exemptions from disclosure.\n  This is just the latest attempt by the majority leader to bypass the \nJudiciary Committee and jam a bill through the Senate that contains \nprovisions within the jurisdiction of the committee. The bill reported \nby the Senate Intelligence Committee includes a broad and unnecessary \nFOIA exemption. FOIA falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and changes affecting this law should not be \nenacted without full and careful consideration by the Judiciary \nCommittee. This important transparency law certainly should not be \namended in closed session by the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  Shortly after the text of the bill was released, I shared with \nChairman Grassley my concern that the Judiciary Committee should also \nconsider this bill. He assured me that there would be a ``robust and \nopen amendment process'' if this bill were considered on the Senate \nfloor. But only a few weeks later, the Republican leadership--with \nChairman Grassley's support--attempted to jam the Intelligence \nCommittee's bill through the Senate as an amendment to the National \nDefense Authorization Act, NDAA, without any opportunity for meaningful \ndebate. Republicans and Democrats joined together to reject the \nmajority leader's effort to force the cyber security bill onto the \nNDAA. Despite this rebuke from both sides of the aisle, just a few \nweeks later, the majority leader again attempted to jam the bill \nthrough the Senate in the final days before August recess, without any \nserious opportunity to debate and offer amendments.\n  The majority leader's actions have been part of a consistent \ndisregard for regular order. He has talked about providing an \nopportunity for fair debate, but at the same time, he has used all \nprocedural mechanisms to stifle process on this bill. Yesterday \nafternoon, the Senate moved to consideration of this bill--but then not \neven 2 hours later, the majority leader moved to end debate. That \nspeaks volumes about whether the majority leader is really interested \nin a full and open debate, and it is not how the U.S. Senate should \noperate--particularly when it comes to a bill with such sweeping \nramifications for Americans' privacy.\n  Senator Feinstein, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, \nhas consistently said that the Senate ``should have an opportunity to \nfully consider the bill and to receive the input of other committees \nwith jurisdiction in this area.'' She has worked hard to improve the \nunderlying bill with a managers' amendment that addresses a number of \nmy concerns, particularly in regard to FOIA, limiting the sharing of \ninformation for cyber security purposes only, and ensuring that the \nbill would not allow the government to use information to investigate \ncrimes completely unrelated to cyber security. I appreciate these \nimprovements, and Senator Feinstein's efforts to include them in the \nbill. But again, this bill still has some serious problems and requires \na full, public debate. The bill still includes, for example, a FOIA \nexemption that I believe is overly broad and unnecessary.\n  In July, the Department of Homeland Security wrote a letter to \nSenator Franken stating that in their view the bill raises significant \noperational concerns and certain provisions threaten to severely \nundermine Americans' privacy. Last week, the Computer & Communications \nIndustry Association--an\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\norganization that includes Google, Facebook, and Yahoo!--voiced serious \nconcerns that the bill fails to protect users' privacy and could \n``cause collateral harm'' to ``innocent third parties.'' And this week, \nmajor tech companies such as Apple, Dropbox, Twitter, and Yelp have \nvocally opposed the bill citing concerns for their users' privacy.\n  The latest version of the bill contains a number of improvements that \nI and other Senators have been fighting for, and I am glad to see that \nwe are making progress. But we still have work to do on this bill, and \nthe Senate must have an open and honest debate about the Senate \nIntelligence Committee's bill and its implications for Americans' \nprivacy. I agree that we must do more to protect our cyber security, \nbut we must be responsible in our actions. Legislation of this \nimportance should not be hastily pushed through the Senate, without a \nfull and fair opportunity for Senators to consider the ramifications of \nthis bill. Unfortunately, by moving so quickly to end debate, it \nappears that the majority leader is trying to do just that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to support the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act of 2015.\n  Cyber security is the most pressing economic and national security \nthreat facing our country today. As a member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I am keenly aware of the damage cyber \nattacks cause on our Nation. As vice chairwoman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I believe we must have a clear and \ncomprehensive approach to funding cyber security.\n  In boardrooms and around kitchen tables, concern over cyber security \nis heightening. It is gaining new traction following the cyber attack \non the Office of Personnel Management, which compromised the personal \ninformation of more than 22 million Federal employees, contractors, and \ntheir families.\n  The American people expect serious action by Congress. This can and \nmust be done, while respecting privacy and avoiding data misuse by the \ngovernment or businesses. Congress must act with a sense of urgency to \npass the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. If we wait for another \nmajor cyber attack, we risk overreacting, overregulating, overspending, \nand overlegislating. The time to act is now.\n  Our Nation is under attack. Every day, cyber attacks are happening. \nCyber terrorists are working to damage critical infrastructure by \ntaking over the power grid or disrupting air traffic control. Cyber \nspies are moving at breakneck speeds to steal state secrets, \nintellectual property, and personal information. Cyber criminals are \nhacking our networks, stealing financial information, and disrupting \nbusiness operations. These cyber attacks can disrupt critical \ninfrastructure, wipe out a family's entire life savings, take down \nentire companies, and put human lives at risk. In the past year alone, \nwe've seen cyber attacks against Sony, Home Depot, UPS, JP Morgan \nChase, Experian, T-Mobile, Scottrade, and the list goes on. The \neconomic losses of cyber crime are stunning. In 2014, the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies and McAfee estimated the annual \ncost from cyber crime to be over $400 billion.\n  I have been working on cyber issues since I was elected to the \nSenate. Our cyber warriors at the National Security Agency are in \nMaryland, and I have been working with the NSA to ensure signals \nintelligence was a national security focus even before cyber was a \nmethod of warfare.\n  In my role on the Intelligence Committee, I served on the Cyber \nWorking Group, which developed findings to guide Congress on getting \ncyber governance right, protecting civil liberties, and improving the \ncyber workforce.\n  As vice chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee and the Commerce, \nJustice, and Science Subcommittee, I put funds in the Federal checkbook \nfor critical cyber security agencies. These include the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, which investigates cyber crime; the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, which works with the private \nsector to develop standards for cyber security technology; and the \nNational Science Foundation, which researches ways to secure our \nNation. As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I \nfight for critical funding for the intelligence and cyber agencies, \nincluding the National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, \nand Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, who are coming up \nwith the new ideas to create jobs and keep our country safe. These \nfunds are critical to building the workforce and providing the \ntechnology and resources to make our cyber security smarter, safer, and \nmore secure.\n  This bill does three things from a national security perspective. \nFirst, it allows businesses and government to voluntarily share \ninformation about cyber threats. Second, it requires the Director of \nNational Intelligence to share more cyber threat information with the \nprivate sector, both classified and unclassified. Third, it establishes \na Department of Homeland Security ``portal'' for cyber info-sharing \nwith the government to help dot-gov and dot-com in a constitutional \nmanner. These three provisions are an innovation. Despite all the \namazing talent companies have, many are being attacked and don't even \nrealize it. This legislation allows unprecedented dot-com and dot-gov \ncooperation. There are also key provisions on privacy protections and \nliability protection for companies that monitor their own networks or \nshare information.\n  Why do we need a bill to make these vital partnerships happen? \nAmerica is under attack every second of every day. The threat is here, \nand it is now. If we do not act or if we let the perfect be the enemy \nof the good, this country will be more vulnerable than ever before, and \nCongress will have done nothing.\n  This bill is not perfect. The Department of Homeland Security's role \nhas been criticized by many, including myself. I have been skeptical \nabout their ability to perform some duties assigned in this bill. I am \nstill skeptical, although less so than before. But this bill takes \nimportant steps to diversify government and private sector actors, so \nwe are not just focusing on DHS, but also keeping civilian agencies in \ncharge. We cannot have intelligence agencies leading this effort with \nthe private sector. Some would like to see that go further, but that is \nwhat the amendment process is for.\n  People in the civil liberties community worry that this bill could \nallow government intrusions into people's privacy. This was of \ntantamount concern for me. If we don't protect civil liberties, the \nadded security is for naught because we lose what we value most: our \nfreedom. The authors of this bill, especially Senator Feinstein, have \nmade key improvements on issues of law enforcement powers and \nprotecting core privacy concerns. While not everyone is entirely \npleased, this bill has made important strides to balance information \nsharing and privacy.\n  The business community is concerned because it fears strangulation \nand overregulation. They worry that they will open themselves up to \nlawsuits if they participate in the program with the government. I have \nheard from Maryland businesses and these are valid concerns. \nImportantly, this bill has made strides in accommodating business and \nbuilds a voluntary framework to allow businesses to choose that \nprotection. Protection does not come without responsibility for \nparticipants, but this bill links the need for cyber security, \nappropriate liability protection, and the expertise of our business \ncommunity in a way that answers a lot of companies' concerns. We cannot \neliminate all government involvement in this issue because it simply \nwon't work, and we will lose key government expertise in the Department \nof Defense, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and elsewhere. However, we \ncan work to try to minimize it while maintaining the government's role \nin protecting national security.\n  I am so proud that the Senate came together in a bipartisan way to \ndraft and pass this legislation. The Senate must pass this legislation \nnow. Working together, we can make our Nation safer and stronger and \nshow the American people we can cooperate to get an important job done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2557\n\n  Mr. President, today I wish to speak about my amendment to the cyber \nsecurity bill. This amendment would provide an additional $37 million \nfor the Office of Personnel Management, OPM,\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\nto accelerate completion of its information technology, IT, \nmodernization and thwart future cyber attacks.\n  This additional funding would allow OPM to make needed upgrades to \ncyber security and network systems 1 year ahead of schedule. This means \nOPM will not have to wait another year to protect sensitive personnel \ndata by implementing hardware and software upgrades recommended by \nsecurity experts.\n  The $37 million is designated as an emergency under the Budget \nControl Act of 2011.\n  For over a year, the Office of Personnel Management's systems were \ncompromised. This hack exposed the financial and personal information \nof 22 million Federal employees and their families, contractors, job \ncandidates and retirees. This is unacceptable.\n  OPM's retirement services and background investigation databases \ncontain the most sensitive data OPM holds, including Social Security \nnumbers, health information and fingerprints.\n  I have heard from employees across the government. Data breaches \nundermine morale and complicate their ability to serve the American \npeople.\n  OPM has moved to provide protections, but that is not enough. \nSecuring these systems must be done now. We can't wait for the next \nbudget cycle.\n  I urge support for my amendment. This is a crisis, so we ought to \ntreat it like one. Twenty-two million Americans who entrusted their \ndata and fingerprints to the government deserve the highest standard of \nprotection.\n  There is a reason OPM was exploited. Federal cyber security has been \nweak. The Appropriations Committee has consistently given agencies the \nresources they asked for to protect their dot-gov systems. But under \nsequester-level budgeting it hasn't been enough. Constrained agencies \ndon't ask for what is truly needed to do the cyber security job.\n  Tight budgets mean immediate problems get requested and funded before \nother much needed IT protection and maintenance. We aren't even doing \nthe simple things.\n  After the OPM breach, the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, \nconducted a cyber sprint. OMB asked agencies to take four minimal \nsteps: No. 1, deploy Department of Homeland Security malicious activity \ndetectors; No. 2, patch critical vulnerabilities; No. 3, tighten \nprivileged user policies; and No. 4, accelerate deployment of \nmultifactor authentication.\n  While there was improvement, only 14 of the 24 agencies met the \nfourth goal. Some of it is a lack of will, but some is a lack of \nresources.\n  OPM knows it needs to harden its information technology.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment, providing $37 million in \nemergency spending to harden OPM systems now--not a year from now. \nThese funds meet the criteria for being designated as emergency \nspending as set out in the Budget Control Act of 2011. OPM's needs are \nurgent, temporary, and, regrettably, unforeseen.\n  What does it mean to designate funds as emergency spending? It means \nno offsets, so we don't pay for this amendment by drawing from existing \nfunding used to defend the Nation or help America's families.\n  The need is urgent--our adversaries are still trying to attack us. \nThe need is temporary--these are one-time costs to accelerate IT \nreform. And the need is unforeseen which is sadly the reason they were \nnot requested in the President's fiscal year 2016 budget in February.\n  Some say this funding is premature, and OPM is not ready to deploy it \neffectively. However, those reports were written before Beth Cobert \nbecame OPM Acting Director. She is turning OPM around, but she needs \nthe resources to secure OPM's IT systems, and cyber security is a \ncritical issue.\n  Government can't be reckless with the sensitive data it has. We must \ndo better with dot-gov and get our own house in order. We know what OPM \nneeds to do--they have the will, they have a business plan, and now \nthey need the wallet.\n  Vote for my amendment No. 2557 to get OPM the resources it needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3594\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, last week when I was back in my home \nState of Wisconsin, I had the privilege of hosting a roundtable with \ncollege students from all across the southeastern area of the State. \nThe focus of the conversation was how we in Congress could help keep \ncollege affordable and accessible. During the course of that \nconversation, it was abundantly clear that most of the students were \nvery frustrated that Congress could not take some of the most \ncommonsense steps to make that happen. I told them that I shared their \nfrustration and ensured them that I would be going back to Washington, \nDC, this week to fight on their behalf.\n  This morning I hosted a Google Hangout and spoke with campus \nnewspapers from across the State of Wisconsin to reiterate my \ncommitment on this issue. So here I am, almost 1 month from the day \nthat I last stood here on the Senate floor, 1 month since a single \nUnited States Senator stood up and blocked a commonsense and bipartisan \nmeasure that would have continued to provide critical financial support \nfor America's low-income college students.\n  In the short month since our efforts to reauthorize the Federal \nPerkins Loan Program were obstructed, the immediate impacts are already \nbecoming quite clear. Last week, the Coalition of Higher Education \nAssistance Organizations began surveying colleges and universities that \nparticipate in the Perkins loan program to learn more about how this \nobstruction is impacting their students. After a few days, they heard \nfrom over 100 students outlining how allowing Perkins to expire is \nharming students and institutions alike. There are real impacts being \nfelt by real students right now across America. If we don't act, this \ndamaging impact will ripple across our community. Therefore, we cannot \nsit idly by.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3594, which is at the desk, that the \nbill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, this is incredibly frustrating. I am \ngoing to spend a few minutes talking about how this objection, this \nobstruction is impacting the students of America and the higher \neducation institutions of America. There are real impacts that are \nbeing felt right now. Students who have previously received Perkins \nloans will lose their future eligibility if they change institutions or \nacademic programs. Students seeking Perkins loans for the upcoming \nwinter and spring semesters will not be eligible at all if we don't act \nsoon to reauthorize this program. Finally, all future students will be \nineligible for this program.\n  This afternoon right before I came down to the Senate floor, I \nreceived a letter from the president of the University of Wisconsin's \nsystem, Ray Cross--a letter that was co-signed by all 14 of the UW \nsystem university chancellors. In their message, they shared compelling \ninsight into how the sudden end to the Federal Perkins Loan Program is \nalready affecting Wisconsin students. They then closed their letter \nwith this:\n\n       [W]e need to keep this program in place. After all, our job \n     is to help students who would not otherwise be able to attend \n     higher education and to help them overcome barriers, \n     particularly financial barriers, all of which helps to ensure \n     access, retention, completion, and a skilled workforce. These \n     are goals upon which all of us can agree.\n\n  One month ago our colleagues in the House of Representatives--a body \nrarely called a place of agreement--took up and passed a measure that \nwould extend this student loan program for 1 year. I previously called \nup that bill here in the Senate and asked unanimous consent that we \nextend the Federal Perkins Loan Program. While I look forward to a \nbroader conversation about improving Federal supports for students as \nwe look to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, I don't believe--and I \nstill don't--that we can sit idly by while America's students are left \nwith such uncertainty.\n  As everyone heard, I asked unanimous consent to proceed to the \nconsideration of the bill, and one Senator stood up on behalf of \nRepublican leadership and blocked our ability at this\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\npoint in time to extend the Federal Perkins Loan Program by 1 year.\n  Again, I understand a desire, and frankly, share a desire to have a \nbroader conversation about Federal student aid as part of the Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization effort. I still do not think it is right \nor fair to let this program expire to the detriment of thousands of \nstudents in need. Frankly, this is a perfect example of why the \nAmerican people are so upset with Washington.\n  Since 1958, the Federal Perkins Loan Program has been successfully \nhelping Americans access affordable higher education with low-interest \nloans for students who cannot borrow or afford more expensive private \nstudent loans.\n  In Wisconsin, the program provides more than 20,000 low-income \nuniversity and college students with more than $41 million in aid, but \nthe impact of this program isn't just isolated to the Badger State. In \nfact, the Federal Perkins Loan Program aids over half a million \nstudents with financial need each year across 1,500 institutions of \nhigher learning.\n  The schools themselves originate, service, and collect the fixed \ninterest loan rates, and what is more, institutions maintain loans \navailable for future students because these are revolving funds.\n  Since the program's creation, institutions have invested millions of \ndollars of their own funds into the program. In addition to making \nhigher education accessible for low-income students, the program serves \nas an incentive for people who wish to go into public service by \noffering targeted loan cancellations for specific professions in areas \nof high need, such as teaching, nursing, and law enforcement.\n  As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, and as a Senator representing a State with such a rich \nhistory of higher education, it is among my highest priorities to fight \nto ensure that the Federal Perkins Loan Program continues for \ngenerations to come, but unfortunately, as we saw, one single Senator \nstood up again today and said no to students across America who ask for \nnothing more than an opportunity to pursue their dreams--students such \nas Andrew.\n  Andrew is currently a student at the University of Wisconsin in \nStevens Point. Without the support of his Perkins loan, Andrew said he \nwould not have had the means to attend college. He has little to no \nincome at his disposal. Today, not only is Andrew making the dean's \nlist every semester, but he now has his sights set on attending law \nschool, also at the University of Wisconsin. Andrew said: ``Without the \nassistance I get from the Perkins Loan I would be forced to either take \nout other high-interest loans, or delay my graduation date, or drop \nout--which is the last thing I want to do.''\n  Today this body also stood up and once again said no to students such \nas Nayeli Spahr. Nayeli was raised by a single mother who was an \nimmigrant and worked two full-time jobs. Nayeli attended 10 different \nschools in 3 different States before she finished high school. Without \nthe Federal Perkins Loan Program, Nayeli said her opportunity to get a \ncollege education would have been ``an illusionary dream.''\n  Today Nayeli is the first in her family to finish college and is now \nin her last year of medical school. She is planning to work with those \nwho are underserved in our urban communities. She finished by saying:\n\n       The Perkins loan program helped me reach this point. And \n     its existence is essential to provide that opportunity for \n     other young adults wanting to believe in themselves and to \n     empower their communities to be better. Please save it!\n\n  You don't have to look very far to find the dramatic impact that this \ninvestment has on America's students. There are thousands of stories \nlike the ones I just shared, representing thousands of students who are \nstill benefitting from the opportunities provided to them by this \nhugely successful program.\n  I am disappointed and frustrated that our bipartisan effort in the \nSenate has again been obstructed. I will continue to fight to extend \nsupport for America's students in the form of extending the Federal \nPerkins Loan Program so that we can find a way to show the half-million \nAmerican students who rely on this loan program that we are standing \nwith them and that we are committed to helping them build a stronger \nfuture for themselves and our country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Wisconsin and \nother Members who are here on the floor to talk about the Perkins Loan \nProgram. It is a really important program. It serves the needs of many \nof the students in our States, and it serves a unique need. It provides \nflexibility that other programs don't provide, and it also allows the \ncolleges and universities to actually contribute to it.\n  I hope we can get this 1-year extension done, and I hope that the \nobjection will be overridden by the common sense of doing something \nthat the House has already done. By the way, the House of \nRepresentatives did it for 1 year also at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment because there is no reason to pay for a 1-year extension of \na program that is a loan program where the colleges and universities \ntake the payments that are made--the repayments--and put them back into \nthe program. So this program is at no cost, and it is certainly an \nimportant program that we ought to continue.\n  I know there is discussion about broader education reform, and I \nsupport that. I know this program is not perfect. There are other ways \nthat we could possibly improve it. I am perfectly willing to enter into \nthat discussion and debate it. We should have that debate. We should \ndebate how to make sure college is more affordable for all students, \nbut let's not at this point stop this program that is working and is \nproviding for young people in my State and around the country what they \nneed to be able to afford a quality education.\n  I was out here a few weeks ago talking about this program, and at \nthat time I talked about some specific schools and the people in my \nState who depend on this program. It is the oldest Federal program out \nthere that allows students to be able to take advantage of some kind of \nhelp in order to get through school, and boy, it is needed now more \nthan ever with tuition costs going up and more and more families \nfeeling the squeeze.\n  When I go back home, I hear from parents and the students themselves. \nIt is tough. Wages are flat, and in many cases declining. Yet expenses \nare up, and this is one of them, along with health care and electricity \nbills. This is not the time to stop the program but to continue this \nreally important program. At the same time, we need to engage in the \nimportant debate of how we can reform higher education more generally \nin order to ensure that everybody has access to an affordable \neducation.\n  Since 1958, this program has provided more than $28 billion in loans. \nIt is a program that supports 60 different schools in my State. In the \nBuckeye State of Ohio, we have 60 schools that have loans under this \nprogram. Last year, more than 25,000 Ohio students received financial \naid through this program--3,000 young people at Kent State and over \n1,700 at the Ohio State University in Columbus.\n  One of those students is an outstanding young woman. Her name is \nKeri. She is a junior at Kent State. She interned for me last summer. \nWhen I talked to Keri about this program, she said that this is \nsomething she absolutely needs to be able to stay in school.\n  Keri is a young woman for whom I have a lot of respect because she \nfought the odds. She was in foster care. She went from one foster home \nto another while she was growing up. Yet she not only fought the odds. \nShe is now excelling in college and doing a great job, but she doesn't \nhave the resources to stay in college without this program. She is a \nPell grant recipient, but she also needs the Perkins Loan Program to be \nable stay in school.\n  This is not just about numbers, folks. This is about people. This is \nabout Keri. This is about young people whom we want to be able to have \nthe opportunity and to be able to get the education they need to get \nahead, because it does provide help for those who are most in need.\n  Well beyond Ohio, of course, 1,700 postsecondary institutions now \nparticipate in this program. It shouldn't be\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\ncontroversial. Again, the House passed it for 1 year. It is something \nthat does not require a new appropriation. It is a flexible program. So \nmany of our student loan programs, including the Pell Grant Program and \nso on, are programs where the schools cannot provide any kind of \nflexibility. With many of our families and many of our students, Keri \nbeing an example, that flexibility is really important. Circumstances \nchange. They may find themselves in a situation where they need a \nlittle help to stay in school so they can finish their academic major. \nThey may find they need a little bit of help because of an unfortunate \nevent that they could not anticipate happening in their families, and \nthis program provides that flexibility. Again, the colleges and \nuniversities actually contribute to it. It is a matching program where \nthey have to step up and be counted.\n  Let's not allow these students to fall through the cracks, and let's \nconsider what happens if we do allow that to happen. Students who are \napplying for the winter semester, which starts in January, or the \nspring semester may well find that they are not able to receive the aid \nthey need.\n  I am told that students can lose their eligibility if they change \ninstitutions or if they change their majors. These kids could fall \nbetween the cracks even if they have a Perkins loan now.\n  Finally, of course, if we don't act pretty soon, then next fall when \nthere will be up to 150,000 freshman looking for a Perkins loan, they \nmay find they are not eligible for it. This is not acceptable. Let's be \nsure we do everything we can here to make sure that college is not \nroad-blocked for low-income students who are trying to get a college \ndegree and pursue their dreams. Let's help them get ahead.\n  Let's pass this. It creates certainty for the students who benefit \nfrom the loans, it creates certainty for these colleges and \nuniversities, and it ensures that students who need this funding are \nnot stopped and blocked by these high tuitions.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues Senator Collins and Senator Casey, whom \nI see is on the floor. I also wish to thank Senator Baldwin, Senator \nAyotte, Senator Murphy, and I see Senator Coons and others who are \nhere.\n  This is bipartisan, and it is something we can do here in the Senate, \njust as the House has already acted. Let's not block this program \nbecause this could block the students from attaining the educational \nbackground they need to be able to succeed in life. Let's move forward \nwith this while at the same time continuing our discussion on the need \nto ensure that higher education is more broadly reformed to allow \neverybody to have that opportunity to pursue their dreams.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof Senator Baldwin and Senator Portman. I thank them for making this \nbipartisan clarion call to bring this body together on behalf of \nstudents. There are over 6,000 students in my State of Connecticut.\n  I believe Senator Blumenthal is going to give some remarks as well to \nadd Connecticut's list of schools and to debate this issue on the \nfloor.\n  We have over 1,000 students at the University of Connecticut, over \n700 at Yale University, 600 at the University of Bridgeport, 500 at \nCentral Connecticut, and 400 in Eastern Connecticut. All across \nConnecticut, students are able to attend college because of the Perkins \nLoan Program. As one of the few Members of the Senate who is still \npaying back my student loans, who is also saving as fast as I can for \nmy two boys who will hopefully go to college, this debate we are having \ntoday strikes me as crazy. We should be having a debate about how we \nexpand access to college. Instead, we are simply trying to protect the \nexisting access we have.\n\n  In 10 years the United States has gone from the No. 1 country in the \nworld with respect to the number of 25- to 35-year-olds with college \ndegrees to number 12 in the world. In 10 years we have gone from first \nto twelfth. The answer for that is the cost of college. The cost of \ncollege is making it unaffordable for people to start and unaffordable \nfor many others to complete it.\n  The Perkins Loan Program is one that doesn't require any additional \nexpenditure of taxpayer dollars. Those 6,000 kids in Connecticut will \nget to continue to attend college with Perkins loans, with no \nadditional obligation on behalf of taxpayers. That is as good a deal as \nwe can get--no additional expenditure from the Federal Government and \nhundreds of thousands of kids all across the country--6,000 of them in \nConnecticut--get to continue in college.\n  I simply wanted to come to the floor to express my bewilderment that \nthe Republican leadership is standing in the way of simply preserving \nthe student loan programs that are on the books today. If we go back \nhome to our districts, we are not going to hear from a lot of people \nwho are sympathetic to this argument. They want Congress to be talking \nabout how to make college more affordable. They would be as bewildered \nas many of us are that Republicans in the Senate are trying to make \ncollege less affordable, when there is absolutely no additional \nexpenditure required in order for us simply to preserve the Perkins \nLoan Program as it currently exists.\n  Let me just add one story to the mix--the story of Amanda, who is a \nsenior at the University of Hartford. Her family makes about $67,000 a \nyear. People are going to be familiar with her story because that is \njust a little bit too much for her to be able to qualify for a Pell \ngrant. So she has to work two different jobs to put money on top of her \nStafford loans, to put money on top of the contribution her parents \nmake, just to get into the neighborhood of being able to afford \ncollege, but what makes that final difference for Amanda is the Perkins \nloan.\n  The only reason she is able to go to the University of Hartford is \nbecause of the Perkins loan. She is doing everything we ask. Her \nparents are putting in some money, she is taking out loans, and she is \nworking two jobs. She says:\n\n       I can't imagine how difficult it would have been if federal \n     funding sources such as the Perkins loan had been eliminated \n     as options for me. I've utilized the Perkins loan offered to \n     me, in the full amount, every single year to resolve my \n     account balance. Even now, in my senior year, I have no \n     choice but to work two jobs and I'm barely getting by. \n     Without the Perkins and other financial aid, I truly believe \n     that I would have had to transfer to a community college \n     where I would not have been able to accomplish nearly as much \n     as I have here at the University of Hartford.\n\n  On behalf of her and the six other students in Connecticut who will \nlose their Perkins loan eligibility as long as this Republican \nobjection lasts, I hope it will come together.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I stand to join in with the voices we have \nalready heard from, including Senator Murphy of Connecticut and Senator \nPortman of Ohio--bipartisan, of course--who have stood in support of \nthe unanimous consent request of Senator Baldwin, blocked by the \nopposing party, that we move forward with reauthorizing the Perkins \nLoan Program.\n  The voice that I think is so often missing from the deliberations in \nthe Senate is the voice we just heard brought forward by Senator Murphy \nof Connecticut, the voice of our constituents--the constituents who \nconnect with us when we are home in our States; the constituents who \nreach out to us by letter and by email. I just wanted to add the voices \nof my constituents from the State of Delaware.\n  Apparently, our colleagues have failed to hear from thousands--even \nhundreds of thousands--of our home State constituents who rely on \nFederal Perkins loans. This program is a critical lifeline for students \nacross the country who would be well on their way to a college degree \nif it weren't for the skyrocketing, unsustainable costs of higher \neducation. I think Congress's failure to reauthorize the Perkins Loan \nProgram is already having a negative impact on students and on \nhouseholds across our country. We can see the real-world impact in our \nhome States if we will but listen to our constituents.\n  Let me give two examples of Delawareans who have recently reached out \nto me.\n  Frank, an incoming University of Delaware student, was counting on \nthe\n\n[[Page S7401]]\n\nPerkins Loan Program to help cover a gap in affording the cost of his \nhigher education. Now that those funds are no longer available, now \nthat the Perkins loans have expired, his family is struggling to figure \nout how they will pay for his education.\n  There is also Taylor, a Delawarean, already a college student, who \nhad signed up for a promising new course of study because of a Perkins \nloan that would make the additional cost possible. Without this funding \nmoving forward, future students like Taylor will also have to turn to \nprivate loans--sometimes less accessible, sometimes less affordable--to \nfill that gap. Frank and Taylor's stories are just a few examples of \nmany that I have received in my office from constituents or \nconversations I have had at home in Delaware.\n  When I am with working Delawareans, there is no topic raised more \nfrequently amongst those in my age bracket of how they can afford to \nsend their kids to college. Just the other night, standing around on \nthe sideline of a soccer game, I heard a whole group talking about how \ncan we possibly afford the skyrocketing expenses of higher education.\n  So the question we are here today to address isn't the great big \nquestion of how can we make college affordable, it is just a simple \nquestion of how can we extend the Perkins Loan Program. I am proud to \njoin with my colleagues in calling for a permanent extension of this \nprogram. In my State of Delaware, nearly 2,000 Delawareans last year \nreceived Perkins loans from 2013 to 2014. Those are 2,000 of my \nconstituents who had the chance to go to college, invest in their \neducation, improve their lives for the better, and that is in just 1 \nyear of the program.\n  In the 50 years since Perkins was created, the program has awarded \nnearly $30 billion through 26 million loans across this entire country. \nThose are big, abstract numbers, but for my colleagues who remain \nundecided on whether to support the extension, I urge them to think \nabout the Franks, the Taylors, their constituents, and folks from towns \nand cities, big and small, all across this country. They are not asking \nfor a free education. The average Perkins loan is just $2,000. It is \nnot even a rounding error in the scope of the total Federal budget that \nwe fight over here week in and week out, but that is an amount that one \nstudent, one family can singlehandedly determine--for an aspiring \nteacher or a business owner or an inventor or someone who just wants to \nadvance themselves through education--whether they can continue their \nsteady forward progress.\n  This extension alone is not the Higher Education Act reauthorization \nmany of us have been calling for; it is not the substantial education \ninvestment many of us know would be a huge boost to our country, its \ncompetitiveness, and our constituents' well-being; it is not a perfect \nsolution to the Delawareans I talk to every day who wonder how they can \nafford college; it is an important start. So let's come together and \nact. Even the House of Representatives, of all places, has acted on a \nbipartisan basis to extend the Perkins Loan Program. We can and should \ndo the same.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this critical issue, and I \nurge this Chamber to come together to approve an extension of the \nFederal Perkins Loan Program without delay.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the same subject that \nmy colleague from Delaware just raised and so many others before him. \nIt is bipartisan. This loan program, which we have had the luxury, I \nguess, all these years of relying upon, has allowed us to say that as a \ncountry we value higher education. We value that for no matter what \nfamily a person is from or what level of income. As I have often said, \nwe believe not only in the context of early learning, when someone is \nat the beginning of their learning years, but much later when they are \nin the years of higher education, that they can learn more now and earn \nmore later. That linkage, that direct nexus between learning and \nearning, is a substantial factor in whether someone can have a good job \nand a career and success in their life.\n  However, for a lot of folks, the cost of college, as so many have \noutlined today, becomes an impossible barrier over which they cannot \nclimb, especially if they are low income. All they are asking for is a \nfair shot--a fair shot at learning, a fair shot at going to an \ninstitution of higher education.\n  We know this program has meant so much not only to folks across the \ncountry, but when we look State by State and examine the number of \nstudents, the number of families who are affected now, it is \nextraordinary, whether we are talking about the Presiding Officer's \nhome State of Colorado or Senator Coons and his constituents in \nDelaware or Connecticut or Wisconsin or Ohio. Wherever we are, we can \nsee the numbers.\n  In Pennsylvania, 40,000 students today are beneficiaries of the \nPerkins Loan Program. We are told as well that this isn't just a \nprogram that affects all different income levels; this is a program \nwhich is designed and has benefited those who most need it. We are told \nthat one-quarter of recipients are from families with incomes of less \nthan $30,000. The maximum loan amount per student is $5,500. If someone \nis going to a school where it costs $45,000 or $50,000, that may not \nseem like a lot, but for a lot of students who are at institutions that \nare not so high in cost, that is a big number--or a fraction of that \nnumber is a big number. If you are going to graduate school, you can \nget up to $8,000 from the Perkins Loan Program. It is a 10-year \nrepayment period. As the Senator from Ohio pointed out, it is a \nrevolving fund. So as one student is paying their Perkins loan back \nover 10 years, another student is benefiting from that revolving fund.\n  We have all had individuals in our States--I have talked a couple of \ntimes about Nikki Ezzolo. Nikki is a recent graduate of Edinboro \nUniversity. She had a long and difficult pathway through her higher \neducation years. She is a single mom. She was in school and then out of \nschool. When she finally got through school and had the benefit of a \nPerkins loan, among other things, she said the following in talking \nabout her own circumstances as a single mom:\n\n       I am proud to be a college grad and my daughter is proud of \n     me too. I am so grateful for getting a Perkins loan to help \n     me. I know that I wouldn't be where I am right now--\n\n  Meaning with a job after graduating from Edinboro--\n\n     without it, and that is a really scary thought.\n\n  So she is thinking about where she would have been without a Perkins \nloan. Where she would have been is highly likely out of school and \ntherefore not working. And the job she got is with a major company in \nour State.\n  So that is Nikki.\n  I also mentioned on the floor a couple of weeks ago--and I will not \nrepeat it, but I just want to remind folks of her name. Kayla McBride. \nShe is a recent graduate of Temple University in Philadelphia. She is \nin one corner of the State in Philadelphia, the opposite corner of the \nState where Nikki went to school in Edinboro. She indicated she \nreceived a Perkins loan to help with tuition after her mother was laid \noff.\n  Then we have another example, someone I met during the break, right \nnear my hometown. We were meeting with students all across the State \nabout this issue. One of them was in Wilkes-Barre. His name is Anthony \nFanucci, the student body President, and a senior at Wilkes University \nin Wilkes-Barre. Anthony's father works overtime to pay for his \ntuition, and Anthony works every weekend and two jobs over the summer. \nHis Perkins loan helped him stay in school. I met Anthony and he spoke \nthat day in public. Among the things he said was the following:\n\n       My strengths got me to Wilkes University, but without \n     financial funding, your strengths and your resume and what \n     you've done before that mean nothing. I never ever seek pity \n     for my financial situation because my financial situation is \n     far from rare.\n\n  He is talking about so many students out there who face a fork in the \nroad at some point. If they have Perkins, they can likely stay in \nschool. If they don't have Perkins, many of them--far too many--will \nnot be able to continue their higher education.\n  We know the program expired on September 30. Here is what it means \nfor--here is the practical implications\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\nfor students. No new students can receive loans, and while the current \nrecipients are ``grandfathered'' for 5 years, there is uncertainty \nbecause we have never been in this circumstance where the program has \nexpired and we don't know exactly what will happen with regard to the \nimplementation of any kind of new changes or new policy by the \nadministration. It is important to note that some will not be \nbenefiting from the grandfathering provision. A student would not be \ngrandfathered if they do one of the following: if they change their \nmajor, if they alter their course of study, or if they transfer. I \nshould also mention the cutoff for the grandfathering was June 30, \n2015.\n\n  Let's consider one of those circumstances--if they change their \nmajor. We are told by a recent study in our State that 75 percent of \nstudents will change their major at some point in their years in \ncollege. Let's just say that it is 50 percent or 33 percent. Whatever \nthe number is, that is a lot of students changing their major and \nthereby maybe taking themselves out of the protection of that \ngrandfathering provision for Perkins loans now that we are in the \nperiod after it has expired.\n  Financial aid officials who have written to us talk about other \ncircumstances. I won't read a full letter, but in one letter we got \nfrom a financial aid official they talked about ``significant changes \nin a family's financial circumstances'' and ``unexpected financial \ndifficulties.'' That is the real world of real students and real \nfamilies without Perkins or at least with the uncertainty with regard \nto Perkins. Neither situation in my judgment is acceptable. Not having \na 1-year extension to a Perkins loan program makes no sense to me and \nto a lot of students. If we had an extension, we could debate if \nsomeone wanted to make changes or debate the elements of a program, but \nhaving it expire makes no sense. Even if the expiration doesn't \ndefinitively impact you, the uncertainty about that should not be part \nof a college student's experience. While they are studying, while they \nare getting through their coursework, especially as freshmen, they \nshould have the certainty or at least the expectation that it will \ncontinue to help them.\n  In summary we should, No. 1, continue to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to solve this problem. The good news is, despite the \npartisan rancor and divisions in Washington and in the Senate and the \nHouse, on this we have broad bipartisan support--something on the order \nof 28 co-sponsors, and at last count 6 are Republicans. So we have got \nfolks in both parties working on this.\n  We all believe that we have an obligation to do everything we can to \nsupport higher education. No student should have to drop out of college \nbecause Congress has not done its job.\n  We have more work to do on this, and I would urge those who have \nconcerns about it or want to have another point of view be debated, \nthat I hope we could work together to get through this impasse and get \nthe Perkins loan at least extended for 1 more year as was done in the \nHouse most recently by voice vote.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this discussion by very good Senators--\nand I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania and the other Senators \nwho have spoken. The Senators from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are both \non the education committee and we have worked well together and we will \ncontinue to discuss this. This shows how difficult it is to do what \nmost Americans have said they would like to see us do, which is to \nsimplify, deregulate, and make it easier and simpler for students to go \nto college. That is what we are trying to do in the Senate.\n  Almost every witness who came before us said this: It is too \ncomplicated to fill out a form for the current form of student aid, so \nsimplify it. The witnesses have said: Have one undergraduate student \nloan, have one loan for graduate students, and have one loan for \nparents. Right now undergraduate students might have three different \nloans with different interest rates and different terms.\n  The application process is so complicated that it turns away \nmillions, we have been told, of students who are frustrated by that. \nThe repayment program, which is very generous--not for the Perkins \nloan, which I will get to in a minute, but for all other direct loans--\nis so complicated that students don't take advantage of it.\n  We are toward the end of our work in the Senate education committee \nto take our giant student loan program, which loans more than $100 \nbillion taxpayer dollars a year and has more than $1 trillion dollars \nof outstanding loans, and simplify it to make it easier and cheaper for \nstudents to go to college.\n  One way to do that is to replace the Perkins loan with a direct loan \nthat has a lower interest rate and a more generous repayment plan. What \nwe are proposing to do is to replace the Perkins loan with a direct \nloan that is available to every single student who is enrolled in an \neligible accredited college. You show up, you enroll, you get the loan. \nThat is available to you. The interest is 4.29 percent today. That is \nlower than your Perkins loan, and when you pay back the direct loan, \nyou may pay it back like a mortgage over 10 years or you may pay it \nback over 20 or 25 years, not paying more than 10 or 15 percent of your \ndisposable income. And if you haven't paid it back after those years, \nit is forgiven. That is what the taxpayers have said to the students. \nSo that lower interest rate and generous repayment program are not a \npart of the Perkins loan program. What we, a bipartisan group of \nSenators, are saying is that we need to replace the Perkins loan with \nthat better opportunity.\n  Let's be clear about who is affected by this. Perkins loans are about \n1 percent of all student loans. So, about 99 percent of those students \nwho have student loans are not affected by this discussion. Of those \nwho have Perkins loans, you can keep your Perkins loan. The Department \nof Education notified all the institutions early in this calendar year \nand said the Perkins loan expires in the fall. If you grant a new \nPerkins loan this fall, it will be a 1-year loan. For everybody else \nwho has already got a Perkins loan, you can keep receiving Perkins \nloans through the end of your program. So, in almost every case, you \neither got a 1-year loan if you got a new loan for the first time, or \nif you are already in a program, you keep it through to the end of your \nprogram. That is the situation.\n  It is important for students to know that the bipartisan effort here \nis to simplify the student loan program and give them a lower interest \nrate and a better repayment program. Why would you not want that \ninstead of this? One might say we may want to have both. Sure, you \nwould like to have both, but the Congressional Budget Office says it \nwill cost $5 billion over 10 years to continue the Perkins loan \nprogram. The testimony we heard and our recommendation by this \nbipartisan group of Senators is we have a better use for that $5 \nbillion.\n  We might have a higher amount of money that you could borrow. We know \nthere are going to be more Pell grants granted if we simplify the \napplication process and the repayment process. We would like to give \nstudents the opportunity to use their Pell grants year-round. Some way \nwe have got to pay for that, and one way to pay for that is to simplify \nthe system. If we take $5 billion to continue the Perkins loan program \nso we can give students a higher interest loan and a worse repayment \nprogram, we are also taking money away from the new Pell grants, from \nthe possibility of a year-round Pell grant, and from the other reforms \nthat we would like to make. Why should we be trying to change this now, \nwhen the Department has notified all the institutions that this is how \nthings are going to be?\n  We are toward the end of our work in our committee. We work in a very \ngood bipartisan way. We don't agree on everything; we don't expect to. \nBut Senator Murray and I have the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. We expect to be able to do that with the Higher Education Act. The \nSenators will have a chance to offer amendments in the committee and on \nthe floor. If the full Senate decides that it wants to keep the Perkins \nloan program and take $5 billion out of the funds available to give \nyear-round Pell grants to students or the extra Pell grants that we \nwould be able to grant by simplifying the application and instead \ncontinue a program with a higher\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\ninterest rate and a worse repayment program, then the full Senate can \ndo that. I won't recommend it and I won't vote for it, but that is the \npurpose here.\n  It is important for everyone considering this to know that President \nBush recommended that the program end. President Obama recommended that \nthe program be changed and folded in, in effect, with the regular \ndirect loan program.\n  The Federal Government hasn't contributed any new money to the \nPerkins loan program since 2004 because most people know that it is not \nas good a loan opportunity for almost all students. It is not as fair a \nuse of the money as is the direct loan program.\n  I prefer private loan programs, but the Congress has decided it is a \nFederal loan program. To reemphasize, if you are enrolled in any \naccredited institution, and we have 6,000 of them, all you have to do \nis show up and you are eligible for the loan. We think you are better \noff. You will be less likely to over borrow and you will be more likely \nto go to college if it is a simpler program and if you have a single \nundergraduate loan, a single graduate loan, and a single loan for \nparents. That is the purpose behind my point of view on this.\n  This Senator would like for our committee to finish our work. \nHopefully we can do that and give it to Senator McConnell and let him \nput it on the floor early in the year, and the Senate can decide which \nloan programs it wants. If we want to continue the mumbo jumbo of \nstudent loan programs we have today, which discourage students from \ngoing to college and taking advantage of repayment programs and \ndiscourage the kinds of education that most of us want, then the Senate \ncan do that, but I will be arguing against that.\n  That is why I asked the Senator from Arizona to object today to \nbringing immediately to the floor this continuation of a program that \nevery institution in the country knew was supposed to end when it \nended, and that one President has tried to end and another President \nhas tried to change. Almost every witness that came before our \ncommittee said that students will be better off. Students are the ones \nwe care about. As long as we are fair to taxpayers, students will be \nbetter off if we simplify the system and have a single undergraduate \nloan, a single graduate loan, and a single loan for parents.\n  In addition to that, there is a Federal grant system. If you are in \nColorado or Tennessee or Connecticut or Pennsylvania and you want 2 \nyears of college, for those who are eligible for the Pell grant, which \nyou do not have to pay back, the 2 years of college is basically free. \nThe average tuition for a 2-year community college is about $3,300 a \nyear, and the average Pell grant is about $3,300 a year. So we are \noffering the students of this country--it is never easy to pay for \ncollege, but the taxpayers have been pretty generous. Basically, we are \nsaying that everywhere in the country if you want 2 years of college \nand you are in the 40 percent of community college students that are \nlower income, your 2 years are basically free. If you need more money, \nyou are entitled to a loan that you can pay back at an interest rate \nthis year of 4.29 percent. That is a low interest rate for somebody \nwith no credit rating and no collateral. You can't get that anywhere \nelse, but you can get it from the Federal Government so you can go to \ncollege. We are saying in addition to that, you can pay it back over 20 \nyears with your disposable income. If that isn't enough, if you are a \nteacher or fireman or someone who has not made as much to pay it back, \nit is forgiven by the taxpayers. We would like the Perkins loan \nstudents to have the lower interest rate and the more generous \nrepayment program, and that is why I object to circumventing the \ncommittee's decisions.\n  Let us finish our work. Let us make a decision that we should be able \nto make as a whole Senate by early next year, and let the students who \nalready have Perkins loans continue all the way through to the end of \ntheir program. Let the students who got it for the first time since \nJuly know that they will have that program for this 1 year. This is \nwhat every single university in the country was told about earlier this \nyear and reminded of by the Department of Education in September.\n  Let's do this in an orderly way and let's put the students first. All \nof us are interested in helping students make it easier and simpler to \nattend college. I think our bipartisan proposal will replace the \nPerkins loan with a direct loan opportunity with a lower interest rate \nand a more generous repayment program. It is a better deal for students \nand avoids spending that $5 billion that I would like to use for the \nyear-round Pell grant and for the additional Pell grants that are going \nto be created by a simpler student aid program.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I do respect the expertise and \nexperience and dedication of my colleague and friend from Tennessee. I \nespecially understand and am grateful for his leadership as the \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction over this legislation. I understand that he is moving \ntoward reform and overhaul of the current system of financial aid and \nloans that will make it better for students. That is the goal, that it \nwill be ready perhaps sometime early next year.\n  As we know from our experience in this body, timelines frequently \nshift and give way. So early next year may turn into later next year or \nthe spring of next year or at some point in time. In the meantime, \nfutures are in the balance--the futures of students in Connecticut and \naround the country who are trying to plan in their senior year. Their \nfaces and voices are with me and with all of us every day. Their \nfutures are the future of this country.\n  The House has extended the Perkins Loan Program for 1 year. Why won't \nthe Senate do it? My colleague from Tennessee urges that we simplify \nthe program. Well, let's simplify decisions that are being made right \nnow at the kitchen tables and the living rooms of families across the \ncountry and make available this option even as we simplify and reform \nthe program because the failure to do so vastly complicates and \nconfuses the lives of students who are making real-life decisions while \nwe debate. We are, in fact, debating right now a cyber security \ninformation sharing act which pertains to the cloud and computing that \ntakes place in the cloud. We are talking here in the clouds compared to \nreal-life decisions being made by students and their families every \nday. I am hearing from them. I am hearing from financial aid \nadministrators, for example at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, CT, who \ntell me that there is a level of anxiety and angst they have not seen \nin recent years because of this body's inaction, its failure to \ncontinue a program that has worked and worked well for countless \nstudents. In fact, in the 2014-2015 school year, institutions in \nConnecticut disbursed over $20 million through the Perkins Loan \nProgram, using that funding to provide targeted financial aid to \nsupport their very neediest students. Low-income students who face a \ngap in funding and who have to make hard decisions about real dollars \nand cents need this program not early next year but right now.\n  The Senate's failure to act, as the House has done, to extend it for \n1 year, abrogates its responsibility. In previous years, Quinnipiac, \nfor example, would have been able to offer these students Perkins loans \nto close the gaps between what financial aid they are receiving and \nwhat they need to continue their education. This year, they are telling \nstudents: Sorry, no help available.\n  These students are the future of our country. They are the ones who \nare going to be doing the computer science that is necessary for our \ncyber security. They are the intellectual infrastructure of this \ncountry. Our failure to invest in them--and this expiration is only one \nreflection of that failure to invest--is a failure for the entire \ncountry.\n  I received a note from Nicole Deck--a sophomore at the University of \nNew Haven--telling me how she benefitted from the Perkins program. She \nis pursuing a double major in marine biology and environmental science. \nShe wrote to me saying: ``I appreciate every day that I spend at the \nUniversity of New\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\nHaven thanks to the aid of the Federal Perkins loans.''\n  She said: ``Receiving money from the Federal Perkins Loan has allowed \nme to achieve many of my goals and has opened many doors of \nopportunity.''\n  The doors of opportunity for Nicole in marine biology and \nenvironmental science on the shores of Long Island Sound, where she can \nput that science to work to help to save Long Island Sound and to help \nus nationally to preserve our environment, are not only doors of \nopportunity for her, they are doors of opportunity for our whole \ncountry. The failure to extend the Perkins loan program closes those \ndoors.\n  I met recently with seniors at the New Britain High School. At New \nBritain High School, these seniors are thinking about where they will \nbe going to school. They are making life-changing and transformative \ndecisions about their futures based on their financial alternatives. \nWhen I asked them ``How many of you have, in effect, abandoned the \nschool of your first choice because you couldn't afford it and Federal \naid was not available and no scholarships were accessible?'' about half \nof them raised their hands.\n  I thought to myself, well, things often work out for the better but \nsometimes not. Sometimes futures are constrained and warped and \ndistorted because a young person with great potential is unable to \ndevelop it because of an avenue of education blocked by financial \nunaffordability.\n  My colleagues have stated very powerfully and eloquently and it has \nbeen a bipartisan debate about what the Perkins Loan Program means to \nso many students.\n  I will close by saying that this program involves an example of real \ninstitutional skin in the game. It requires institutional capital \ncontributions as a requirement for a school's participation. It fills \nthe gap of affordability that affects our very neediest and often most \ndeserving students.\n  Our constituents will rightly ask us: Did you reject the student loan \nprogram?\n  No, we did not reject it.\n  Did you renew it?\n  No. We simply allowed it to die.\n  This program has gone into the cloud. We have allowed this to expire \nwhen we could extend it for 1 year without really damaging the reform \neffort underway.\n  I want to repeat that I respect the HELP Committee chairman's \nintention and goal to reform all student loan programs, but in the \nmeantime, futures of American students are affected unfairly and \nunwisely by the inaction by this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his eloquent \nremarks. Let me offer this different perspective. You don't need a \nPerkins loan to go to a 2-year college. The average tuition at a \ncommunity college--and they are a terrific opportunity in my State and \nmost States--is about $3,300. About 40 percent of the students who \nattend them qualify for a grant of about, on average, $3,300. So those \n2 years are free for most students who need the money. Those students \nare also entitled to a direct loan if they enroll at the community \ncollege. Usually it is $4,000, $5,000, to $6,000. They just walk up and \nthey are entitled to it if they think they need it.\n  You probably don't need a Perkins loan to go to most of the State \nuniversities. At the University of Tennessee, the tuition and fees is \nabout $12,000. Many of the best colleges and universities are State \ninstitutions.\n  You are entitled to your Pell grant. You are entitled to your direct \nloan. Then many States and universities have their own programs. For \nexample, in Tennessee there is the HOPE Scholarship, and almost all of \nthe students at the University of Tennessee Knoxville have one.\n  Where the Perkins loan has been useful--and I will grant that--has \nbeen at the expensive private colleges. If it is $50,000 a year to go \nto a private college, you can get your Pell Grant, you can get two \ndirect loans, and then you can get a Perkins loan. Then you can end up \nbeing in the newspaper for having borrowed so much that people write \narticles in the Wall Street Journal about how we have created a \ncircumstance where students are overborrowing and cannot pay back their \nstudent loans.\n  So I think the question really is, Should taxpayers spend $5 billion \nmore over the next 10 years to make it possible for a the student to go \nto a $50,000-a-year tuition school or should taxpayers spend that money \nto create a year-round Pell Grant and hundreds of thousands of \nadditional Pell Grants for low-income students who want another 2 years \nor 4 years of education? I think that is the question.\n  Government is about setting priorities. If we had an unlimited amount \nof money, we could do everything. Except, we do have a problem with \noverborrowing and complexity. When you add a third loan on top of two \nother loans so that can you go to a $50,000-a-year tuition college, \nthat is a choice an American has to make. I am proud of the fact that \nwe have those choices. But we have lots of 18-, 19-, 20-year-olds, and \nmany graduate students, too, who 5 or 10 years later will find they \ncannot pay it back.\n  I think we are better off with a single undergraduate loan, a single \ngraduate loan, and a single parent loan that is available to every \nsingle student. I think we are better off using whatever savings we \nhave to expand the number of Pell Grants and to offer a year-round Pell \nGrant.\n  As I said before, every single institution--all 6,000 of our \ninstitutions were told by the Department of Education earlier in 2015: \nIf you grant a Perkins loan this fall to someone who never received one \nbefore, it will be for 1 year because the program is ending.\n  Also, they were told: If someone already has a Perkins loan, you will \nbe able to keep it all the way through the end of their program.\n  So this is an honest difference of opinion. There are a lot of \nuniversity presidents--I know a bunch of them. They like the program \nbecause it gives them one more tool to use. The question is not just \nwhether they like the program; the question is, What is best for the \nstudents? I think taking the available amount of money we have and \nexpanding it for simplifying the student aid system and making the \nyear-round Pell and the other programs available to students who need \nit the most--I think that is what we should be doing.\n  We will finish our work in the Senate education committee hopefully \nwithin a few weeks. We will have it ready to come to the floor. We can \ndebate it, and the Senator from Connecticut and I can continue our \ndiscussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2582\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Flake \namendment No. 2582 that is currently pending before the body. This \namendment is very simple. It simply adds a 6-year sunset to the bill. \nThis amendment also keeps in place the liability protections \nestablished by the Cyber Security and Information Sharing Act for \ninformation that is shared pursuant to the requirements of the bill. \nFurthermore, the amendment ensures that the requirements on how the \ninformation is shared under the act is to be handled remain in effect \nafter the sunset date.\n  That is all this amendment does. It simply sunsets the bill in 6 \nyears, and it does so in a reasonable and responsible way. I believe in \nthe sunset provision. It is good for us to consider our past decisions \n6 years from now, to determine whether what we enacted is operating \nwell, and to debate the overall success of the legislation that we \npassed 6 years prior. We ought to do that, frankly, on a lot of other \nlegislation we pass.\n  I do believe the bill we are currently considering, as it is written, \nstrikes the right balance. It puts in place the proper privacy \nprotections, and I plan to support the legislation. However, it is \nimportant to make sure that we are forced to go back and evaluate it in \nthe years to come to make sure we actually got it right. Given the \nnature of the bill being debated before us, it is all the more \nimportant to do so in this instance.\n\n  I would also note that this 6-year sunset is similar to sunset \nprovisions that were included in both House-passed cyber security \nbills. So if it is in the House, we ought to have it in the Senate as \nwell.\n  Both the Protecting Cyber Networks Act, which passed the House by a \nvote\n\n[[Page S7405]]\n\nof 307 to 116, and the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement \nAct, which passed the House by a vote of 355 to 63, include a 7-year \nsunset.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it does \nstrengthen the bill. It ensures that we evaluate, as we should, any \nlegislation that we pass to ensure that it is having its intended \neffect.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 697\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. Over 2 years ago, \nI sat down with now the late Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey in \nan attempt to find compromise and to work together on updating the \ndrastically outdated Toxic Substances Control Act. Updating this law \nwas a long-time goal and passion of Frank's. It was a real goal of \nmine, although we came at it from very different directions, at least \ninitially. I am saddened Frank isn't here with us to see it finally \nbeing brought up for consideration on the floor of the Senate. We \nworked closely together and forged a significant, productive, positive \nbipartisan compromise--the sort of work we don't see often enough in \nthe Senate or the Congress itself, but we got it done here, and it is a \nstrong, positive compromise in substance as well.\n  After Frank's passing, Senator Tom Udall stepped in to help preserve \nFrank's legacy and continued working with me to move this reform \nforward. We have done that consistently over months and months, working \non issue after issue, detail after detail, to produce a strong result. \nI am very proud of the substance of this result because it achieves two \nvery important goals: On the one hand, we certainly protect health and \nsafety and give the EPA the proper authorities to do that with regard \nto chemicals in commerce. On the other hand, we make sure we don't \noverburden industry and put them at a disadvantage in terms of \nremaining America's world leaders in innovation and chemistry. We are \nworld leaders now. We innovate, we produce new chemicals and new uses \nand new products on a spectacular basis, and we certainly don't want to \nthreaten that. Our Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st \nCentury Act doesn't threaten it. It enhances it, it protects health and \nsafety, and that is why I am so proud of this bipartisan work.\n  We have done that work so completely we are now in a position to pass \nthis bill through the Senate in very short order. In fact, we only need \n2 hours of floor time, and we need no amendment votes related to the \nbill in any way. That is virtually unheard of in the Senate, but it \ngoes to the work that so many folks have done on both sides of the \naisle. So with 2 hours of floor time, no amendment votes, we can pass \nthis bill and move it on to the House. We have been in contact with the \nHouse for months, so we are very hopeful we can follow up our action \nwith House action and a final result in relatively short order.\n  Mr. President, that is why we are coming to the floor today, to ask \nunanimous consent to establish that process in the near future--a very \nsimple, very short process so we can get this done and achieve this \nresult. Again, no amendment votes are necessary--whether they are \ngermane, related or unrelated, no amendment votes are necessary--and \nthen pass it on to the House. I certainly hope we can have that \nagreement to move forward in a productive fashion.\n  With that, let me yield to my Democratic colleague Senator Udall, who \nhas been such a great partner in this effort following Frank \nLautenberg's unfortunate passing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Vitter. It has \nbeen a real pleasure working with him on the Toxic Substances Control \nAct. I think we have brought this a long way.\n  First, let me speak on the pending cyber security legislation, and \nthen I will be seeking unanimous consent to process another bill.\n  Protecting our national security and economic interests from cyber \nattack is a very important priority. I commend Senator Burr and Senator \nFeinstein for their hard work on their legislation. I know they have \nalso gone through a lot to get floor time on their bill and are working \nto process amendments. It is clear they have made a serious effort. I \nrespect the chairman, vice chairman, and their staffs for their work.\n  My understanding is this will pass with a large bipartisan majority \nin the Senate. As Chairman Burr stated yesterday, the House has already \nacted on cyber security legislation. He is eager to start reconciling \ndifferences and get a bill to the President's desk. That is what good \nlegislators do.\n  As the chairman knows, I have also been working for a number of years \non a complicated legislative project, working with Senator Vitter, \nSenator Inhofe, and many other Senators of both parties. We are very \nclose to the reform of the totally outdated Toxic Substances Control \nAct. We all know TSCA is broken. It fails to protect families and it \nfails to provide confidence in consumer products. We have a chance \ntoday to change that and to show that Congress can actually get things \ndone.\n  I am pleased Chairman Burr is a cosponsor of our legislation, along \nwith over half of the Senate. After years of work, we are now also in a \nposition to seek unanimous passage of TSCA reform so we can go to \nconference with the House of Representatives. It has been a long road \nwith lots of productive debate and discussion and cooperation and \ncompromise. This is a balanced bill, one that Republicans, Democrats, \nindustry, and public health groups can all support moving forward.\n  Not everyone loves our Senate product, but its staunchest opponents \nare now ready to allow for Senate passage. We can then reconcile our \nbill with the House, just as Senator Burr seeks to do on cyber security \nlegislation. We have cleared this legislation on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle with a short time agreement. My understanding is that there \nis nearly unanimous consent--unanimous signoff--on the Republican side \nas well.\n  With that, I join with Senators Vitter and Inhofe in asking for \nunanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic \nleader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 121, S. \n697; further, that the only amendment in order be a substitute \namendment to be offered by Senator Inhofe; that there be up to 2 hours \nof debate equally divided between the leaders or their designees; and \nthat following the use or yielding back of that time the Senate vote on \nadoption of the amendment, the bill be read a third time, and the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURR. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me say to the authors, I have deep \nrespect for both of you, and you have done an incredible job with this \nbill. It is one of the reasons I am a cosponsor, because it is good \nlegislation.\n  It is no surprise to the Senate that I have had a deep desire to add \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund reauthorization, which has \nexpired, as an amendment to this bill. I seek no time. I only seek the \nvehicle for an up-or-down vote and a ride--a ride that I can't seem to \nget by itself. As a matter of fact, I think the authors of this bill \nknow that I have said if somebody can offer me a stand-alone \nopportunity to debate and vote on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nwe can unanimous consent TSCA. We can't achieve that. I certainly don't \nwant to take anything away from what I think is a great bill, and I \nwouldn't even require time, I would only require a vote.\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\n  So I would ask the authors to modify their unanimous consent request \nto include a vote on the Burr-Ayotte-Bennet amendment in relation to \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent that the consent be modified to \ninclude a vote on the Burr-Ayotte-Bennet amendment in relation to the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Is there objection to the modification?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have an \nopportunity to update and reform the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nand to do so in a way that would ensure it works more efficiently and \nhelps solve the problems facing our Federal Government and States. To \ndo so, we need to pursue a few goals.\n  First, more money from the LWCF should be sent to the States to \nimplement the worthwhile projects. When the LWCF was conceived, 60 \npercent of its funding was required to go to the States. That statutory \nrequirement was removed years ago, and now just 12 percent of LWCF \nmoney is given to the States, with minimal Federal strings attached.\n  Next, the LWCF should be used to solve, not to exacerbate, the \ncurrent Federal lands maintenance backlog. The Federal Government has \nundertaken an impossible task in trying to manage more than 600 million \nacres of variant terrain dispersed across thousands of miles. Evidence \nof the Federal Government's failure to manage its holdings is found in \nthe $13 billion through $20 billion maintenance backlog, a number that \nhas grown nearly every single year since President Obama has been in \noffice.\n  Since LWCF was created some 50 years ago, Congress has appropriated \nnearly $17 billion to the fund, and 62 percent of this money has been \nspent on land acquisition, resulting in 5 million acres being added to \nthe Federal estate.\n  We should work together to improve the LWCF. Let's work together to \nmake sure that North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and every \nother State in this country gets more money. Let's work together to \nmake sure that the Federal Government only acquires such land as it can \nadequately manage.\n  On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. BURR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, again, I respect Senator Burr, but I am \nvery disappointed in that objection. I take a back seat to no one in \nsupporting the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It is extremely \npopular in New Mexico and critical to enabling our outdoors economy. \nSenator Burr has been a strong leader on the LWCF. He has brought much \nneeded attention and passion to the issue of reauthorization, and I \nwant to work with him on that. But the current strategy of holding TSCA \nhostage for LWCF is not the proper one. This is the sort of thing that \ngives the Senate a bad reputation for dysfunction, and I do not see how \nit will lead to any progress on LWCF. I have not objected to Senator \nBurr's efforts to pass reauthorization in the Senate. In fact, I have \nappraised his efforts. I share his frustration that a small minority of \nRepublicans have blocked his efforts. But now, instead of one bill \nbeing blocked, we have two. Without this objection, TSCA would pass \ntoday almost unanimously after years of hard work.\n  So instead of holding TSCA hostage, why not consider LWCF on Senator \nBurr's legislation?\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee).

Mr. President, in the small business committee, we have \nbeen working on significant legislation that goes to disaster recovery, \nthe Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act. \nWe are ready to move that legislation and pass it through the entire \nSenate.\n  Since Hurricane Katrina devastated my State of Louisiana in 2005, I \nhave fought to support disaster victims and improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of our Nation's disaster relief and recovery efforts. I \nhave continued this vital focus on disaster mitigation and recovery as \nChairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I \nstand by my principle that when people are there for you, you will be \nthere for them. Following my brief remarks, I will ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate pass H.R. 208, which has passed the House \nunanimously, with the Vitter amendment.\n  With Superstorm Sandy, similar to after Katrina, we continued to \nsee--and both the GAO and IG confirmed--significant shortcomings with \nthe SBA's disaster loan programs, particularly application processing \ntimes and inaccurate information, which discouraged victims from \napplying for assistance. H.R. 208 reopens the SBA disaster loan program \nto those victims for one year, and also includes vital reforms and \noversight to the SBA's disaster loan program. This bill does not cost \nanything as the funds have already been appropriated but sit unused.\n  The RISE After Disaster Act, which is included in my amendment, \npassed out of the Small Business Committee with unanimous support, and \nwill provide long-term recovery loans to small businesses through \ncommunity banks after SBA disaster assistance is no longer available; \ndirect Federal agencies to utilize local contractors for response and \nrecovery efforts, rather than government contractors from Washington, \nDC, and other areas; address contractor malfeasance, such as the \nChinese drywall crisis, by allowing homeowners and businesses to use \ntheir SBA disaster loans to remediate their property; provide \nincentives for innovative firms doing research and development to stay \nin the disaster-affected area, rather than move elsewhere; and require \nthe SBA to take steps to establish a web portal for disaster \nassistance, whereby applicants can track the status of applications and \napprovals, as well as submit required supporting documentation \nelectronically.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Sandy in 2012, and Joaquin just \nthis month--along with far too many other natural disasters--have all \nillustrated the devastating effects of hurricanes and flooding on our \ncommunities. As Chairman of the Senate Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, I am committed to serving small businesses \nacross the country and ensuring that they are afforded the resources \nand assistance in order to protect themselves from and recover after \ndisasters.\n  This means rigorous oversight of the SBA's disaster loan programs and \nextensive examination of economic recovery efforts, agency \ncoordination, and the efficiency of disaster assistance delivery. Small \nbusinesses are vital to every community's economy and serve as the \nmajor source of jobs--one great incentive to have folks return after a \nmajor disaster--and is why helping them to more quickly recover is one \nof the most effective and beneficial tactics we can and should take.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 208 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 208) to improve the disaster assistance \n     programs of the Small Business Administration.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Vitter \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\na third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2747) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 208), as amended, was ordered to a third reading, was \nread the third time, and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2117, which is a 60-day \nextension of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I believe the \namendment number is 2717.\n  Mr. UDALL. It is amendment No. 2717. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall. He is a cosponsor of \nthe permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nI came to the Senate prior to the expiration of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund with the hope that my colleagues would give it a 60-\nday extension. It has now expired. The 60-day extension on an expired \nact isn't even an offer that is on the table.\n  For my colleagues, let me just remind you that the Land and Water \nConservation Fund has been around a long time--50 years. Some say: They \nhave $20 billion in funds; why don't they just draw on it? It is \nbecause they receive about $900 million a year in royalties off of \noffshore exploration of energy. Congress in its infinite wisdom said if \nwe are going to tap our natural resources we are going to put part of \nthe royalties of that back into conservation. The unfortunate thing is \nthey never got the $900 million a year. Our appropriators in the \nCongress have seen fit to give them on average over the life of this \nfund about $390 million a year.\n  Some of my colleagues suggest that there is a fund over there, the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, and you could just tap it. Well, no, \nthere isn't. The appropriators spent that money long ago. As a matter \nof fact, this year it was just over $350 billion for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  So as delighted as I am that he has sponsored the permanent \nreauthorization, most Members believe that we should reauthorize this \npermanently. So I would ask the Senator to modify his unanimous consent \nrequest to make the amendment read that we would take up the Murkowski-\nCantwell permanent extension language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2717, as modified, which is \na 1-year extension of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURR. I object to the last unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BURR. And on the current unanimous consent request, if I can \naddress that, reserving the right to object, again, without being \nrepetitive, this is a 1-year extension. The beauty of the effort by \nSenator Cantwell and Senator Murkowski, a bipartisan approach to the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, addresses exactly what Senator Lee \nasked for, a reformed bill. This is a package that has been negotiated \nby Republicans and Democrats--the chairman of the energy committee and \nan individual who is extremely invested in the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  So I would once again ask the Senator to modify his unanimous consent \nrequest to make that amendment read that we move to the Murkowski-\nCantwell permanent extension language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. BURR. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I can't tell you how disappointed I am. The \nSenator from North Carolina objects to making an unrelated amendment to \nhis bill, but he insists on one to ours. It seems we are at a \nstandoff--a standoff with a bipartisan TSCA reform that\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nhas already moved through the Senate. We have done incredible work on \nthis with Senator Inhofe, Senator Vitter, and 60 cosponsors who are \nready to roll with this with a very short timeline, and yet we have \nthis objection.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund reauthorization also has a \nstrong majority of the Senate in favor. Fifty-three Senators signed a \nletter led by Senator Burr recently, and I am confident there are over \n60 supporters for this. I am also confident that we will reauthorize \nand continue to fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. As the \nranking Democrat on the interior subcommittee, that is an extremely \nhigh priority for me. But for some reason, TSCA is being held up by \ndemands for a vote on unrelated Land and Water Conservation Fund \nlegislation. I don't see how this would help matters. This \ndysfunctional situation is what gives the Senate a bad name.\n  Again, I respect Senator Burr. I know he does not seek a \ndysfunctional Senate. On the contrary, I have watched him do his best \nto get the Senate to function on this important cyber security \nlegislation. But this calls out for leadership and cooperation, not \nultimatums. I will keep doing what I can to continue the conversation \nand bring people together on a path forward.\n  TSCA reform is ready. We will be back one way or another. We will \npass in the Senate this bill. We will resolve our differences with the \nHouse, and this critical reform will go to the President's desk. With \nthat, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall for his work on TSCA. \nHis description is pretty accurate. I am doing what the Senate \nhistorically has always done, allowing any Member of the Senate to \nexercise their authority as a Member of this austere body to amend any \npiece of legislation, and the Senate has functioned for a long time \nbased upon that. It is just recently that we have not allowed that to \nbe exercised. In other words, one Senator can't come to the floor and \noffer an amendment. He can't come to the floor and propound a unanimous \nconsent request without objection. It has to change. I dare say that \nTSCA has overwhelming support and so does the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. For us to get functional we have to return to where \nwe expect Members to come. I have nongermane amendments on the cyber \nsecurity bill, and they would all receive a vote if somebody hadn't \nobjected, and we would actually see the Senate process exactly like it \nis supposed to, where if a nongermane amendment has 60 votes in favor \nof it, then it is added. I am not scared to have nongermane amendments \non my bill. I have them, and because of somebody's fear, they will get \nknocked off and two Members of the Senate, a Republican and a Democrat, \nwill not get their day to have a vote on their bill.\n  I don't object to the Land and Water Conservation Fund being a part \nof it, as I just expressed. What I object to and what I am disappointed \nabout is that there would be an offer to do a 60-day extension or a 1-\nyear extension from a Member that I know supports permanent \nreauthorization, because this whole deal on TSCA is to make me look \nbad. Well, you know what; so be it. I am willing to accept it. I have \nhad the hounds sicced on me. We are at a point now where there is no \ndamage you can do, and what we saw was a nice orchestrated process that \nwas supposed to make me back down.\n  It is not going to happen. I believe in the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. The Senate will take it up, whether it is on this \nbill or another bill or as stand-alone bill.\n  And let me just say to my good friend that what we are doing has not \nbeen a surprise. I shared with all the authors of this bill that I am \ngoing to amend it. I am going to amend it with this. So I hope he \nagrees that I am not trying to pull a swift one. I have been straight \nup on this since the beginning, and I will continue to press for it.\n  Here is the solution. Allow us to have a debate on the Land and Water \nConservation Fund permanent reauthorization on the floor of the Senate \nwith an up-or-down vote. If we don't get 60 votes, it doesn't pass. \nThat is the way the Senate is. If Members want this bill or any other \nbill passed, it is very simple. Let's get the process back like it is \nsupposed to be, and with one assurance: that we will get an opportunity \nto debate the Land and Water Conservation Fund and have a vote. I am a \ncosponsor of your bill. I will lift my objection, my attempt to try to \namend it, and we will pass it by unanimous consent. It is that simple, \nand there is described the history of how the Senate has always worked. \nLet's get back to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to act to reauthorize the Perkins Loan Program--the Nation's \noldest Federal student loan program and a critical lifeline for \nthousands of low-income students with exceptional need.\n  This crucial program has the support of many higher education groups, \nincluding the Association of American Universities, the National \nAssociation of Independent Colleges and Universities, the American \nAssociation of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the National \nAssociation of Financial Aid Administrators, the Coalition of Higher \nEducation Assistance Organizations and many others--as well as dozens \nof individual colleges and universities across the country. Despite \nthis broad support, funding for Perkins Loans expired on October 1.\n  While our colleagues in the House unanimously approved the Higher \nEducation Extension Act--which would extend the Perkins Loan Program \nfor 1 year--the Senate has yet to act. And that inaction has left \nthousands of current and future students scrambling to figure out how \nto pay for school and institutions struggling to find another way to \nhelp students afford their education.\n  This program has existed with broad bipartisan support since 1958 and \nhas provided more than $28 billion in loans to students in all 50 \nStates. In the 2013-2014 academic year alone, more than 539,000 new and \nreturning students benefited from the Perkins Loans Program--including \n46,065 students in California.\n  Unlike the Federal direct lending programs, Federal Perkins loans are \nmade and then repaid to the individual university. They are offered at \na low, fixed rate of 5 percent--and repayment doesn't begin for 9 \nmonths after a student graduates, giving them enough time to get on \ntheir feet. The program also includes important loan forgiveness \nopportunities for those who decide to enter public service after \ngraduating.\n  This program particularly helps students who have tapped out all \nother Federal student aid options and still face a gap in paying for \nschool or other expenses. It helps students bridge that funding hole so \nthey don't have to turn\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\nto expensive private loans--which don't have the same protections as \nFederal student loans.\n  But without this program, the California State Student Association \nestimates that more than 3,400 students in the California State \nuniversity system alone could be forced to take out private loans or \ndelay graduation.\n  Student loan debt now exceeds $1 trillion. That's more than credit \ncard debt. It's more than auto loans. In fact, it is second only to \nmortgage debt in this country. We owe it to current and future students \nto make sure college is as affordable as possible. That is what the \nHigher Education Extension Act and the Perkins Loan Program do.\n  We have no time to spare now. Let's get back on track and take up the \nextension bill that the House already passed and ensure our students \nare not left in the lurch. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7409-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           STOP SANCTUARY POLICIES AND PROTECT AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, from January through August of 2014, over \n8,100 aliens that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had \nidentified for deportation were released back into our communities by \nsanctuary jurisdictions. Over 5,000 of those released had a criminal \nhistory. In that same time period, 1,900 of those 8,100 went on to be \ncharged with another 7,500 crimes.\n  These are crimes that would not have been committed had local \nauthorities cooperated with Federal authorities in enforcing our laws.\n  This summer, everyone heard the case of Kate Steinle who was shot and \nkilled in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who had seven felony \nconvictions and had been deported five times. Rather than turn him over \nto ICE, San Francisco released him, allowing him to commit more crimes. \nThis guy even admitted that he was in San Francisco because their \nliberal laws would protect him.\n  While this one case received the media attention it deserved, many \nother preventable crimes don't.\n  For example, the city of Los Angeles released one immigrant who had \nbeen arrested for the continuous sexual abuse of a child. ICE wanted \ncustody of this deviant. ICE tried to get custody of him. However, \nrather than hand him over to Federal law enforcement and get this guy \nout of our country and away from our children, Los Angeles ignored \nICE's detainer and released him. He was later arrested for sodomy of a \nvictim under 10 years old. Another child became a victim of this \npredator because liberal policies would rather release him into our \ncommunities then get him out of our country.\n  This year, sanctuary cities have already released more than 9,000 \ncriminal aliens from jail and these criminals are committing more \ncrimes.\n  In California, an immigrant was arrested for battery last year, but \ninstead of turning him over to ICE, the local sheriff released him. \nThis July, he raped and beat a 64-year-old woman so severely that she \ndied 8 days later--yet another preventable death due to the intentional \nfailure of a jurisdiction to comply with federal law.\n  How many more do we have to have before people realize what these \npolicies are doing to our communities? Over 300 States, cities, and \ncounties have sanctuary laws, ordinances, or policies that protect \ncriminals and hurt the innocent. These jurisdictions continue to \nreceive money from the Federal Government even though they continue to \nignore Federal laws and rebuff Federal agencies working to enforce the \nlaws.\n  Enough is enough.\n  I believe that, if a jurisdiction chooses not to cooperate with \nfederal law enforcement, they should not be the beneficiary of federal \ngrants. This is why I cosponsored S. 2146, the Stop Sanctuary Policies \nand Protect Americans Act, which my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle filibustered. It is why I have cosponsored similar legislation \nintroduced by Senator Sessions.\n  Unfortunately, others would rather let politics come before doing \nwhat they know is right and failed to protect our communities from \nfurther victimization. When the proper enforcement of current law could \nsave lives and protect the innocent, how could you not vote to do so?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7409-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          REMEMBERING TECHNICAL SERGEANT STEPHANIE McLAUGHLIN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we honor the life and service \nof TSgt Stephanie McLaughlin, whose passing signifies a great loss to \nboth our State and country. I send my condolences and prayers to her \nparents, Sharon and Fred; her partner, Harold Kiesling; and the rest of \nher family in this time of mourning. Technical Sergeant McLaughlin was \nan incredible servicemember, going above and beyond to defend our \nfreedom and uplift the local military community. She was an invaluable \nmember of the Nevada family, and her service will never be forgotten.\n  Technical Sergeant McLaughlin was born on April 27, 1974, and \nattended North Hunterdon High School in New Jersey, where she graduated \nin 1992. She joined the U.S. Air Force in 1993 and then the New Jersey \nAir National Guard in 1997. Throughout her career, she served at \nLangley Air Force Base, Virginia; the Pentagon, Washington, DC; McMurdo \nStation, Antarctica; Ramstein Air Base, Germany; and Carson City Joint \nForce Headquarters, Nevada. She worked for several two, three, and four \nstar generals during her service, including Maj. Gen. Ron J. Bath, \nretired. Most recently, she served as confidential assistant to the \nadjunct general of Nevada, Brig. Gen. William Burk. Her efficiency in \nher work and devotion to her job could never be replicated.\n  Throughout her service, Technical Sergeant McLaughlin was awarded \nnumerous accolades, including the Meritorious Service Medal, four Air \nReserve Forces Meritorious Service Medals, the Air Force Commendation \nMedal, and two Air Force Achievement Medals. I am grateful the Nevada \nfamily was given the opportunity to work with Technical Sergeant \nMcLaughlin and learn by her example.\n  She embodied only the greatest of Nevada's values with passion, \nfearlessness, and drive that made her a remarkable individual. Her \nlegacy of empathy and determination will echo on for years to come \nthroughout the Silver State. She was one of a kind, and we are lucky to \nhave had such a strong individual working within our State. We will \nalways remember her for her courageous contributions to the United \nStates of America. My office enjoyed working alongside Technical \nSergeant McLaughlin, and I am thankful for all of her hard work and \ndedication to veterans across Nevada. She was always the first one to \nvolunteer in helping others, which was shown both throughout her career \nand throughout her time working in the local community.\n  Technical Sergeant McLaughlin was a shining example in Nevada's \nmilitary community and put forth a tremendous effort working with the \nNevada Military Support Alliance. She deeply cared for veterans across \nthe State, bringing together hundreds of Nevadans to support our \nwounded and fallen warriors, their families, and loved ones. Technical \nSergeant McLaughlin sacrificed countless hours helping plan events and \nfundraisers in support of our State's heroes. I had the pleasure of \nattending multiple Nevada Military Support Alliance galas planned by \nTechnical Sergeant McLaughlin and have seen firsthand the incredible \nimpact she had on Nevadans, active military servicemembers, and \nveterans. The footprint she left on this community will be felt for \nyears to come.\n  Throughout her life, Technical Sergeant McLaughlin demonstrated \nunparalleled selflessness, both in defending our Nation and in \nsupporting her fellow servicemembers. Her patriotism and drive will \nnever be forgotten. Today, I join the Nevada family in celebrating the \nlife of an upstanding Nevadan, TSgt Stephanie McLaughlin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7409-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7409-S7410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING KANSAS CITY KANSAS COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Kansas City \nKansas Community College and its efforts to support innovation and \nentrepreneurship by launching 100 Garages, an initiative of the KCKCC \nInnovation Center to connect area inventors with local makers who can \nhelp translate ideas into products. The initiative enables local makers \nwho have skills and equipment to\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nassist those with ideas and inventions by helping them find each other \nthrough an online database and other avenues. Additionally, as part of \nthis initiative, KCKCC is launching a class to guide potential \ninventors from the idea phase through patent searches, licensing, \nprototyping, and product creation to market and revenue generation.\n  The story of America is a story of entrepreneurs--individuals who \ntook great risks to pursue their dreams. These entrepreneurs built the \nfoundation of the American economy from its earliest days by pushing \nforward innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing \nchallenges. Innovation by entrepreneurs not only improves our lives, \nbut also results in the creation of countless new jobs and \nopportunities for Americans.\n  Many of our favorite and most inspiring stories about innovation and \nentrepreneurship are those that trace their beginnings to the family \ngarage. Many Fortune 500 companies, such as Ford, Apple, and General \nElectric, got their start with passionate, committed individuals, a \npromising idea, and a great deal of hard work. Often, the greatest \nbarrier to creating something innovative and transformative is bringing \ntogether people and their respective potentials. I commend KCKCC for \nits efforts to promote innovation and the spirit of entrepreneurship in \nKansas City, Wyandotte County, the State of Kansas, and the \nregion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7410-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING COOK ME SOMETHIN' MISTER\n\n Mr. VITTER.

Preau took to what \nshe knew best: her family's beloved jambalaya recipe. Raising $100,000 \nin just 3 months at college tailgating events across the country, Preau \nknew she had a hit. Over the next few years, Preau--known for much of \nher life as the ``Jambalaya Girl''--perfected and expanded her \nseasonings, which were selling as quickly as they were stocked on the \nshelves of local grocery stores. Having roots firmly planted in the \nLouisiana culinary scene, Preau's family were some of the first folks \nto cook and serve jambalaya at the French Quarter Fest in New Orleans's \nfamous Jackson Square. The family also enjoyed a close relationship \nwith the late, world famous Cajun Chef Paul Prudhomme who had a hand in \nblending the ``Jambalaya Girl's'' seasonings.\n  Today, Preau's operation has grown into full-time endeavor with five \nfull-time employees producing the ``Jambalaya Girl's'' products in her \nhometown of New Orleans. Enjoying great success, Kristen and her \njambalaya have gained national recognition and was recently named a Top \n100 Small Business in the country for 2015 by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the Louisiana Small Business Administration's, SBA, Women in \nBusiness Champion, and the Women's Business Enterprise Council, WBEC, \nSouth Role Model of the Year for 2014, among others.\n  Congratulations again to Cook Me Somethin' Mister for being selected \nas Small Business of the Week, and thank you for your inspiration for \nwoman entrepreneurs across Louisiana.

In \nhonor of National Women's Small Business Month, I would like to \nrecognize Healthe Habits for Living of Lafayette, LA, as Small Business \nof the Week for their commitment to helping folks reach and maintain \nhealthy lifestyles.\n  In 2007, after a personal battle with medical issues, Jill Hurley \nopened Healthe Habits for Living with the mission to help train, coach, \nand advise other adults in the appropriate skills for exercise, \nnutrition, and mental strategies to live a healthy lifestyle. Putting \nher education to work in order to develop a unique approach to battling \nheart disease, Jill has become accustomed to the physical and mental \nchallenges of individuals suffering from heart disease. To complement \ntheir life skills counseling in nutrition and long-term mental success \nstrategies, Jill and her team of physical and occupational therapists \nalso provide physical strength training to their patients, encouraging \nand enabling a balanced active lifestyle that parallels healthier life \nchanges.\n  Named the Small Business Administration's, SBA, 2011 Women in \nBusiness Champion for Louisiana, Jill's proven endeavor to assist \nothers in reaching their healthy living goals has expanded to three \nsuccessful locations across south Louisiana and currently employs an \nall-female staff of six physical and occupational therapists. Since \nopening her first location, Jill has continuously hired some of the \nmost qualified and successful therapists in Louisiana, and she \nencourages her staff to further their educational training as they \nbuild outstanding careers in the therapy field.\n  Women-owned small businesses have an unequivocal impact on our \ncommunities and the lives of those who need assistance the most, and \nHealthe Habits for Living is a testament to the extraordinary \nachievements of women entrepreneurs across America.

Mr. President, family-owned small businesses \nprovide parents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to teach their children the \nvalue of hard work and taking risks to pursue one's dreams. This is \nespecially true for 2 Sisters' Salsa Company, which started as a \nkitchen conversation between family friends and has since grown into a \nsuccessful women-owned venture. In honor of National Woman's Small \nBusiness Month, I would like to recognize 2 Sisters' Salsa of \nPlaucheville, LA, as this week's Small Business of the Week.\n  2 Sisters' Salsa Company began when family friends, the Deshotels and \nBordelons, began occasionally making salsa in their kitchen. After a \ncouple of batches, they began to refine their recipe until they created \na finished product to their liking. They soon realized that their salsa \nhad immense potential, so they began jarring and labeling their product \nfor store shelves, which was receiving excellent reviews from friends \nand family. As the company grew, the need for an original name became \ncritical to the development of their small business. They settled upon \n2 Sisters' Salsa in honor of the two sets of sisters of the Deshotels \nand Bordelon families. With a new name and growing clientele, the \ndaughters of the two families went from being the namesake of 2 \nSisters' Salsa Company to full-time employees, helping their parents \nwith production and sale of their salsa products.\n  Today, 2 Sisters' Salsa has expanded from the Deshotels' kitchen to a \nnew facility in Avoylles Parish producing 5,000 salsa products a day. \nAs the reigning world champion for the medium salsa category, 2 \nSisters' Salsa can be found in over 100 restaurants and retail \nlocations.\n  The hard work and creativity of Patrick and Brooke Deshotels; Jason \nand Stacy Bordelon; and their daughters Sara, Emily, Shellie, and Rayne \ncertainly deserve recognition, especially as we celebrate National \nWomen's Small Business Month. Congratulations again to this week's \nSmall Business of the Week, 2 Sisters' Salsa Company, and I wish you \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7410-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7410-S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7411-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/21/senate-section/article/S7411-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \nDECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13413 OF OCTOBER 27, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO \n   THE SITUATION IN OR IN RELATION TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE \n                              CONGO--PM 29\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.
