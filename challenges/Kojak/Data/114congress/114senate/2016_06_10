Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of Senator Reed \nand of course of Senator McCain. They have worked very hard on this \nbill, but it is not a good bill. I am going to vote against cloture for \na lot of reasons. The White House has announced they have scores of \nreasons to veto the bill, and they will.\n  I also am concerned about the so-called robust amendment process we \nwere supposed to have under the new Senate leadership. We have Senator \nGillibrand, who has worked for years. All she wants is a vote, and she \nhasn't been given that opportunity. We have many other Senators. I know \nevery Senator who has an amendment can't offer it, but, gee whiz, we \nhave had a handful of amendments. I think we have been very outgoing \nand doing what we can to make sure these managers' packages are \napproved, but it has been unfair, the whole process. So for that, and \nmany other reasons, I will vote no on cloture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/10/senate-section/article/S3787-8"}, {"day": "10", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2943, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2017 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\n\n  \n\n       McCain amendment No. 4607, to amend the provision on share-\n     in-savings contracts.\n       Reed (for Reid) amendment No. 4603 (to amendment No. 4607), \n     to change the enactment date.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to talk \nabout a truly shameful change that is buried away in this bill. It is a \nchange that would put us on a path to go back on a promise that we made \nto our servicemembers just 6 months ago and a change, if left unfixed, \nthat will pull the rug out for men and women in the Armed Forces who \nare prepared to make the highest sacrifice for the country they love.\n  In case any of my colleagues are unaware, a single line in this \nmassive Defense bill on page 1,455, buried in the funding chart, would \nzero out a new program that is intended to help men and women in our \nmilitary realize their dream of having a family even if they go on to \nsuffer catastrophic injuries when they are fighting on our behalf. I \ndon't know how this line got in there, I don't know who thought it was \na good idea, and I don't know why, but what I do know is this: It is \nwrong and it has to be fixed.\n  I just want to tell my colleagues that 6 months ago the Pentagon \nannounced a pilot program that would offer servicemembers who are \ngetting ready to deploy an opportunity at cryopreservation--in other \nwords, freezing their eggs or sperm. This new program gave our \ndeploying servicemembers not just the ability to have reproductive \noptions in the event they are grievously injured but some deserved \npeace of mind. It took us a step forward in the promise we have made to \nour servicemembers to support them when they sacrifice so much for us, \nand it meant they wouldn't have to worry about choosing between \ndefending their country or a chance of having a family some day.\n  This new program was met with widespread praise and relief. Men and \nwomen who were getting ready to deploy--many of whom were thinking \nabout exploring cryopreservation, using their own money if they could \nafford it--were assured that their country had their back.\n  While the pilot program was not groundbreaking, these services have \nlong been available in the private sector, and, in fact, fertility \npreservation techniques have been used by the British Armed Forces for \nyears. It reflected a basic level of respect for servicemembers who are \nwilling to risk suffering catastrophic injuries on our behalf, and it \nsent a clear message that no matter what happens to them on the \nbattlefield, we will be ready to stand with them with whatever they \nneed.\n  I was hoping this new program was a step we could build on, a move in \nthe right direction, an important part of our larger work to help our \nwarriors who sustained grievous injuries achieve their dream of \nstarting a family, which is why I was so upset when I learned this bill \nwould move us the other way. It would take this promise we just made to \nour warriors and toss it in the trash. It would be a slap in the face \nto the men and women who serve us proudly and heroically. And honestly, \nit is the wrong thing to do.\n  Many people here in the Senate are quick to honor our military with \ntheir words, but for the men and women who signed up to fight on our \nbehalf and are looking ahead to potentially massive sacrifices, we owe \nthem so much more than that. We owe them action, respect, and a shot at \ntheir dream of having a family. We need to fix this bill. We owe them \nthat much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer \nMurray amendment No. 4490 relating to fertility treatments and that the \nSenate vote in relation to this amendment with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reluctantly have to object, and that is \nbecause there is an objection on this side, which I have to honor.\n  I thank Senator Murray for her advocacy for the people who are \nserving in our military in uniform, and this is at least an important \naspect of military life, and I thank the Senator for that.\n  I also thank Senator Gillibrand, who will speak in a moment on an \nissue that has been of great importance to her for several years now. \nShe has been an advocate of this very compelling issue of sexual \nassault in the military.\n  Unfortunately, we have an objection to all the amendments, and that, \nin my view, is a great disservice to this body, to the men and women \nserving in the military, and to the American public. It shouldn't \nmatter whether I happen to agree or disagree with Senator Gillibrand or \nSenator Murray; they deserve debate and votes, and they are not getting \nthem because of these objections.\n  I wish to also point out that we are working on amendments by Senator \nMoran, Senator Corker, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Shaheen.\n  I might point out gratuitously that one of the things I have seen in \nrecent years is involvement on issues that bring new perspectives from \npeople like Senator Gillibrand, Senator Murray, Senator Ayotte, Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Fischer, and Senator Ernst. They have brought \nperspectives to our committee and to this body that have been very \nhelpful.\n  All I can say is this: Senator Murray, I will continue to fight to \nget a vote on your amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his remarks, \nand I thank the leaders.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow a vote on my amendment No. 4310.\n  We now know far more about the extent of the military sexual assault \nproblem than we did last year. We have more data, we have reviewed more \ncase files, we heard from more survivors, and it is clear that very \nlittle has changed despite the Department of Defense's persistent \nclaims that things are getting better and that they are making \nprogress.\n  When the Department of Defense estimates that 20,000 servicemembers \nwere sexually assaulted this year--the same number as in 2010--that is \nnot progress. When an estimate of 8 out of 10 military sexual assault \nsurvivors don't report the crime, that is not progress. When more than \nhalf of all retaliation cases--58 percent of them--are perpetrated by \nsomeone in the chain of command of the accuser, that is not progress. \nWhen the percentage of survivors willing to report openly has declined \nfor the past 5 years, that is not progress. When 62 percent of \nsurvivors have experienced retaliation since 2012 and there has not \nbeen one prosecution of this enumerated crime, that is not progress. \nWhen it is confirmed by the Associated Press that the Pentagon \nblatantly misled the Senate in order to skew our debate, this is \nperhaps the ultimate time that they are not making progress.\n  Our military justice system is broken. It is failing our men and \nwomen who so bravely serve. No matter how many small reforms we make, \nas long as commanders with no legal experience are continuing to make \nthese important decisions about violent sexual crimes, we are not going \nto solve this problem. Our commanders are great at winning wars and \ntraining troops. They are not prosecutors. They are not even lawyers. \nThey are warfighters, and their job is to keep our country safe, not \nmake legal judgments about whether to prosecute a rape.\n  Once and for all, let's take this decision to prosecute these crimes \nand instead give it to trained military prosecutors. Let's give our \nservicemembers a justice system that is worthy of their service. This \nis our chance, and I urge everyone to vote yes if we have a vote.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked \nfor S. 2943, notwithstanding rule XXII, that Gillibrand amendment No. \n4310, the Military Justice Improvement Act, be considered in order \npostcloture, and that it be in order to offer amendment No. 4310, and \nthe Senate vote in relation to that amendment with a 60 affirmative \nvote threshold, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, it is the same comment I made to \nSenator Murray. It is with profound reluctance because it is not the \nway we are supposed to conduct business here in the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n  I have reached such a level of frustration that I would even consider \nchanging the rules of the Senate that one individual out of 100 can't \nbring everything to a screeching halt, and that is what is taking place \nhere over an issue.\n  One of the amendments that is being held up is literally putting the \nlives of our interpreters in Afghanistan at risk. That is the view of \nGeneral Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker, General Nicholson, and others. If \nwe don't allow these people to come to this country, they are going to \ndie. It is that serious. Senator Gillibrand's and Senator Murray's \namendments are important, and I do not in any way diminish them, but we \nare talking about human lives of people who assisted us in carrying out \nour mission in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that is what is at stake here.\n  I reluctantly object, and I want to assure Senator Gillibrand that I \nwill do everything in my power--which is not a lot right now when you \nlook at the rules of the Senate--to get a vote. I may have some \ndifferences with Senator Gillibrand, but no one has been more dedicated \nto addressing this issue of a very difficult and frankly embarrassing \nside of the military today, and that is the incidence of sexual \nassaults.\n  I reluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been to a few of these rodeos, and I \nthink the only way we are going to get some fairness here is that we do \nnot invoke cloture.\n  As I said, I have been through this a number of times. I think if \nthat happens, people will understand. We have to have a few votes--not \na lot of votes but a few votes.\n  I was on the floor yesterday when Senator McCain made this emphatic \nstatement that, frankly, only he could make. He was talking about how \npeople's lives are in jeopardy here, especially with the Shaheen \namendment.\n  We don't have to change the rules of the Senate, but I suggest that \nwe do not invoke cloture, give us some time to work out a few \namendments, and I think that can happen.\n  We have two experienced legislators. The chairman of the committee \nand ranking member of the committee, Senator McCain and Senator Jack \nReed of Rhode Island, are two of the best we have here in the Senate, \nand we should move forward in a way that is expeditious yet productive.\n  Earlier this morning I said that a robust amendment process has not \ntaken place here. There hasn't been an amendment process. You can blame \na lot of people, but it hasn't happened.\n  I think this is an important piece of legislation. Senator McCain and \nI have worked on this issue for years, and we have been at odds on \noccasion. He was upset that I didn't bring the bill forward quickly \nenough, but I do remember that we always brought it to the floor. I can \nremember on one occasion when he and Senator Levin, who has since \nretired, finished this bill in 2 days, and we had a good bill that came \nout of here. There were no vetoes, no threats of veto, and we worked \nout the problems. So I would hope that we can move forward and get some \nfairness in this bill.\n\n  It is a huge bill. I have some differences in the bill, but it is not \nfair that we don't have a better process than what we have had so far. \nSo I would suggest that others vote no on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I simply want to underscore the importance \nof these amendments that Senator Murray and Senator Gillibrand are \nputting forward. There can be disagreement on the substance, but the \nmerits, the importance, and the criticality should be obvious to all of \nus. I would hope to find a way to have votes on these amendments.\n  The same logic applies to Senator Shaheen and Senator Moran. They \nhave amendments that they have worked tirelessly on for days. They are \nbeing frustrated, not by the majority of the Senate but by a few \nindividuals.\n  I think we have reached the point now where we have very little time \nleft. If we could come together at least on a good-faith package of \nconsents to deal with all of these or a majority of these and then \ncontinue to work forward for votes on all of them, I think that would \nbe the appropriate thing to do.\n  So, again, I just want to underscore the fact that the issues that \nSenator Murray and Senator Gillibrand have raised are deserving of a \nvote, and we should have a vote on these issues.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     469, S. 2943, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2017 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n         John McCain, John Cornyn, Orrin G.

MEREDITH MARCH AGAINST FEAR''\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 488, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 488) recognizing the historical \n     significance and the 50th anniversary of the ``James H. \n     Meredith March Against Fear,'' a 220-mile walk down Highway \n     51 from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 488) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I think this is a very appropriate time \nto recognize the Meredith March Against Fear. On June 5, 1966, 4 years \nafter becoming the first African-American student to enroll at the \nUniversity of Mississippi, James Meredith began his historic Meredith \nMarch Against Fear. The march began at the Peabody Hotel in downtown \nMemphis and would conclude some 3 weeks later at the Mississippi State \nCapitol in Jackson.\n  On June 6, Mr. Meredith and his small band of supporters encountered \ngunshots about 1 mile south of Hernando, MS. James Meredith was shot \nthree times on that day and was taken to a hospital. Although he would \nrecover, Meredith was unable to complete his March Against Fear, and \nthe leadership was taken over by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Floyd \nMcKissick, and Stokely Carmichael. By the time the march reached the \ncity limits of Canton, the number of marchers had doubled to 250. By \nthe time it concluded in Jackson, there were 15,000 people in \nattendance. This overwhelming turnout made it the largest civil rights \ndemonstration in the history of the State of Mississippi. More than \n4,000 African Americans were registered to vote from rallies and drives \nduring the march along U.S. Highway 51.\n  Mr. Meredith still lives in Jackson, where he is frequently seen \nwearing his Ole Miss cap and attending Ole Miss athletic events in \nOxford. He will turn 83 1 day before the 50th anniversary of the \nmarch's conclusion.\n  Today, the Senate recognizes the courageous leadership of James \nMeredith. I think it is appropriate that this resolution is sponsored \nby the three current Members of the Senate who are graduates of the \nUniversity of Mississippi--Senator Cochran, Senator Shaheen, and this \nSenator.\n  I commend the Senate on its recognition of this important individual \nand this significant milestone in the history of the civil rights \nmovement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as we move forward with cloture, I wish \nto make a clarification for the record.\n  There has been a lot of conversation about this issue of the role of \nwomen as far as Selective Service is concerned. At the time the \namendments were filed, there was no amendment, except one, from the \nSenator from Utah, who is on the floor.\n  As soon as we began consideration of the bill, I said to the Senator \nfrom Utah: When do you want to do your amendment on women in the \nSelective Service?\n  His response was that he wanted to do another amendment first.\n  I said: Look, the way things work, you may have great difficulty \ngetting that up. Nor has the Senator from Utah or anyone else raised \nthe amendment for a vote.\n  So I am sorry to say that out there, there seems to be some \nconversation that Senator McCain was blocking a vote on women in the \nSelective Service. I am not. Right now, if it were germane--and I don't \nknow if it is germane or not--I have repeatedly said that if that \namendment is up for consideration, I would be glad to have that \namendment considered and to have it voted on.\n  So I want to clarify that for the record. I did not block any \namendment concerning women being eligible for Selective Service. I want \nthe record to be very clear.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today I recognize Thomas Galyon of \nRogers, AR, as this week's Arkansan of the Week for his advocacy work \nwith the Arkansas chapter of the national ALS Association.\n  Tom was diagnosed with ALS in 2014 and has been a tireless advocate \never since. Tom isn't one to let ALS hold him back. In fact, after \nspending 33 successful years in the tourism industry, Tom decided \nretirement wasn't for him and went back to work as the property manager \nfor the Center for Nonprofits at St. Mary's in northwest Arkansas. As \nluck would have it, the ALS Association is headquartered in the very \nbuilding Tom manages, making his commitment to their organization that \nmuch stronger.\n  Recently I had the opportunity to meet with Tom when he came to \nWashington to advocate on behalf of the ALS Association. We had a long \ndiscussion, where I learned about Tom's story and the struggle of \nnearly 20,000 other Americans who are currently living with ALS. During \nour meeting, Tom asked me to address the problem that persons with ALS \nface when seeking disability insurance.\n  I was proud to work with my colleague Senator Whitehouse to become \nthe lead Republican sponsor of the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, \na bill that would waive the 5-month waiting period to receive \ndisability insurance program benefits for those living with ALS. While \nthe waiting period may be prudent in many cases, for ALS it consumes a \nlot of the remaining life expectancy once you get a diagnosis of ALS.\n  We now have nine sponsors. As we gain more support, I am hopeful this \nbill will move forward and eventually become law.\n  In a testimony about his journey with ALS, Tom writes: ``Until there \nis a treatment or a cure for ALS I will continue to be an avid advocate \nfor change in government policies and procedures that affect all ALS \npatients in a negative way.''\n  I encourage all Arkansans to take a lesson from Tom's words: Advocacy \nworks. If there is a bill or regulatory matter that impacts your life, \nI want to hear about it. To become an advocate, contact my office and \ntell me your story. It is part of my job to represent you in the \nSenate.\n  Tom's journey is a remarkable one. He has not let the unexpected \ndiscourage him. In fact, he has used his diagnosis to teach others \nabout ALS and\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\nbring us closer to a cure. As Tom himself always says, ``Blue skies \nalways.'' I think that is a mantra everyone in the Senate and Arkansas \ncould adopt, too. It is my honor to recognize Thomas Galyon as this \nweek's Arkansan of the Week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nFiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, a bill upon which \nwe have fortunately invoked cloture today and which I hope will allow \nus to proceed to finish this vitally important legislation.\n  I wish to commend both Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for \ntheir leadership as they worked together. Their bill puts us on a path \ntoward addressing the myriad threats we face today. In fact, in my \nyears in the Senate, it is difficult to think of a time in which we \nhave faced more threats from more different adversaries around the \nworld. These national security challenges include the challenges posed \nby ISIS, as it continues to control territory and key cities in Syria \nand Iraq and spreads to other countries, such as Libya and Nigeria; Al \nQaeda and other Islamic extremist terrorist groups determined to attack \nour country and our allies; Russia's aggressive operations in Ukraine, \nthe Baltics, and Syria; and China's aggressive military activities in \nthe South China Sea.\n  This bill funds programs that ensure our Nation's continued presence \nand deterrence missions, including $271 million to help complete the \nconstruction of two DDG-1000 Destroyers. These ships provide \ncapabilities including stealth technology, electric propulsion, and a \nsmaller crew size. The Navy recently accepted delivery of the first \nDDG-1000, the Zumwalt--a major milestone for this revolutionary \nprogram. Given the ship's cutting-edge technology, unique hull, and \nadvanced combat systems, the shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works in my \nState should be commended for their exceptional work and dedication in \nbuilding the largest naval destroyer and the most advanced naval \ndestroyer in history.\n  The bill before us also includes $3.2 billion for the procurement of \ntwo Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyers as part of a multiyear procurement \ncontract, as well as incremental funding for a third fiscal year 2016 \nFlight Three Destroyer. This much needed additional destroyer, which \nranks No. 2 on the Navy's unfunded priorities list, will be built at \nBath Iron Works. As the workhorses of the Navy, these destroyers help \nensure that our Navy's capabilities remain unrivaled in delivering \npower and presence across the globe. From freedom of navigation \nmissions in the South China Sea to addressing Iranian aggression in the \nStrait of Hormuz, these ships signal to enemies and allies alike that \nthe U.S. Navy is ready to respond wherever and whenever it is needed.\n  After years of advocacy, I am pleased this legislation also includes \nan important provision that requires the Department of Defense to \nfinally comply with the Berry amendment by outfitting new recruits with \nhigh-quality athletic shoes made in America by skilled American \nworkers. This amendment, sponsored by my colleague Senator King, is \nbased upon stand-alone legislation that I introduced with my colleague \nfrom Maine. It is good not only for our troops but also for American \nmanufacturing. It is time to stop relying on goods manufactured in \nforeign countries to outfit those who wear the uniform of our Nation. \nIt is past time for the Department's circumvention of the Berry \namendment to be ended when it comes to athletic footwear.\n  This bill also provides for investments in our public shipyards, \nwhich are strategic assets for our national security. For Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard in Kittery, ME, almost $75 million is authorized for \nnecessary upgrades, including $18 million for unaccompanied housing, \n$30 million for utility improvements for nuclear platforms, and $27 \nmillion to construct a replacement for a medical and dental unit that \nis in a building that is 100 years old and does not meet current safety \nstandards.\n  As the senior member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, \nand Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, I am \npleased these authorizations match the funding included in our Military \nConstruction and VA spending bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly \na few weeks ago. These investments at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \nwill result in the high-quality facilities that shipyard personnel \ndeserve as they maintain, repair, and modernize our nuclear submarine \nfleet.\n  The bill also provides the resources necessary to help our allies and \npartners around the world. I am pleased it would authorize $50 million \nfor the U.S.-Israel Anti-Tunneling Cooperation Program. The terrorist \norganization Hamas continues to construct tunnels from Gaza to Israel, \nwhich have been used by terrorists to sneak across the border and carry \nout attacks on Israeli citizens.\n  Meanwhile, we have the problem of Iran, which has continued to defy a \nU.N. Security Council resolution on its ballistic missile program by \nconducting flight testing of missiles that are inherently capable of \ndelivering nuclear weapons that could someday reach the United States. \nThey already are capable of reaching Israel, which is why this bill's \ncontinued support for the U.S.-Israeli cooperative missile defense \nprograms is so important.\n  I am pleased to note that the National Defense Authorization Act \ncontains several measures supporting our servicemembers, who perform \nthe important missions we assign them. These provisions include a 1.6-\npercent pay raise and reauthorization of bonuses and special pay to \nhelp encourage retention. I know this has been a real problem, for \nexample, for the Air Force in retaining the pilots it needs, who \noftentimes can make so much more money and have far easier missions and \nhours in the private sector.\n  I filed an amendment, as I did last year, to strike a provision in \nthis bill that would unfairly discriminate against women \nservicemembers. The provision mandates that if two or more \nservicemembers live in the same house, the amount of the basic \nallowance for housing payable to each member would be divided by the \ntotal number of members in the house. That means, in cases where a \nservicemember resides with his or her Active-Duty spouse or if a member \nresides with military roommates, each would proportionately lose his or \nher stipend for housing under this bill. This disproportionately \naffects female servicemembers because 20 percent of them are married to \nanother servicemember. In contrast, less than 4 percent of Active-Duty \nmen are married to Active-Duty women servicemembers. I hope we can \nchange this provision.\n\n  Other provisions of this bill would provide additional protections \nfor survivors of sexual assault to move closer to the goal of \ntranslating the military's stated policy of zero tolerance into \nreality. Specifically, the bill would create a new punitive article in \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice that criminalizes acts of \nretaliation. The article would hold servicemembers accountable if they \nthreaten or take adverse personnel action against those who report or \nplan to report retaliation.\n  Finally, this bill would direct the Pentagon to rein in unnecessary \nand wasteful spending by reducing the number of general and flag \nofficers by 25 percent. This is an issue that I have been working on \nwith Chairman McCain since 2012, and I am pleased to see the continued \nfocus on ending the practice of rank inflation.\n  I should mention that I have the greatest respect for the high-\nranking officials as well as for all who serve in our military. But \nthis is an issue that we do need to deal with, and I believe this bill \nstrikes the appropriate balance. We owe it to taxpayers to assess every \nefficiency and use every cost-saving measure while also ensuring the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her patience. I know the Senate is \nsoon to\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\nadjourn. I urge support of this important bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/10/senate-section/article/S3791-1"}, {"day": "10", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION AND FEMALE VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION \n                                 BILLS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it was encouraging to see the Senate \nvote to advance the National Defense Authorization Act this morning. It \nreflects a recognition by this body of the importance of the bill and \nthe moment. The defense authorization act will promote defense \ninnovation and research, it will modernize retirement benefits for our \nmen and women in uniform, and authorize the pay raises they deserve. It \nwill help prepare our country for the threats of today and the \nchallenges of tomorrow, and it will better enable the next Commander in \nChief, regardless of party, to deal with them as well. That is critical \ngiven that the next President is about to inherit an array of threats \nand troubling instability in the Middle East.\n\n  Yesterday Senators laid out many ways in which President Obama's \nforeign policy has fallen short. One was lack of strategic vision. Take \nfor instance his unnecessary threat to veto this very bill. He doesn't \nlike bipartisan prohibitions on transferring hardcore terrorists from \nGuantanamo's secure facilities to American communities or unstable \ncountries. We include similar bipartisan provisions year after year \nafter year. He makes similar threats year after year after year, but he \nsigns the bill year after year, so it is time to quit that.\n  This bill just advanced in the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 68 to \n23. The funding levels this bill authorizes is exactly the same as what \nPresident Obama requested in his budget, and unless the President is \nactually more concerned about a campaign slogan from back in 2008 than \nhe is about grave threats we face in 2016, he will sign it.\n  I thank colleagues on both sides for their hard work on this \nlegislation, particularly Chairman McCain. He is always on guard for \nour men and women in uniform, and he is always standing up for our \nnational security. This bill is a reflection of his commitment. It is \nan important step for the American people, but it is not the only one \nwe took this past week.\n  It has been reported that we lose over 20 veterans each day to \nsuicide, and one study has revealed that suicide rates among female \nveterans grew by 40 percent between 2000 and 2010. This is \nheartbreaking, and it underlines the importance of the Female Veterans \nSuicide Prevention Act that the Senate passed earlier this week. This \nlegislation will require the VA to take a closer look at this issue and \nassess which mental health care and veteran suicide prevention programs \nare most successful for our female veterans. It builds upon the \nprogress of the Clay Hunt Act, an important law we passed last year \nthat provides more of the suicide prevention and mental health support \nour veterans deserve.\n  As Senator Ernst recently reminded us, our servicemembers have \nselflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms, and we should help \nensure that they are prepared to transition back to civilian life, \nwhich includes access to quality and timely mental health care they \ndeserve. Senator Ernst knows what it means to serve. I thank her for \nher continued leadership for Iowa and for her work on this bill with \nSenators Boxer, Blumenthal, and Brown.\n  This veterans mental health legislation is another example of what we \ncan accomplish when we work together to find solutions for the American \npeople, and it is another example of a Senate that is back to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/10/senate-section/article/S3792-1"}, {"day": "10", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SOCIAL IMPACT PARTNERSHIP BILL\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 1089, \na bill to encourage and support partnerships between the public and \nprivate sectors to improve our Nation's social programs, and for other \npurposes, known as the Social Impact Partnership Act, SIPA. This \nlegislation would facilitate the creation of public-private \npartnerships that have the goal of improving the outcomes from our \nNation's social services spending in order to benefit both the people \nintended to be helped by those programs and the U.S. taxpayer. It would \ndo so by creating the Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact \nPartnerships, which would recommend to the Treasury Secretary that the \nFederal Government enter into agreements with State and local \ngovernments and private investors to pay for successful social \nimprovement programs funded by private investors out of savings those \nprograms create for the Federal Government.\n  The bill appropriates $300 million for this purpose and aims to \nensure that the savings to the Federal Government from the projects \nselected will exceed that $300 million. If a social services program is \nnot successful, the Federal Government will not pay for it. In this \nway, SIPA helps to reorient Federal social spending towards measurable \nimprovements in the lives of those served.\n  While I am supportive of the bill, I do want to note for the record \nthat this bill could benefit from further assurances at a committee \nmarkup that the funded projects will result in governmental savings.\n  The appropriations for the legislation should be offset with spending \nreductions in other areas, as has been done in the companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  There should be a specified role in the legislation for CBO and OMB \nto certify for taxpayers that the Federal performance payments \nauthorized in the bill for successful projects do not exceed actual \nprogrammatic savings and that this bill provides better social outcomes \nfor equal or less total money spent.\n  Finally, the bill should ensure that there is no way for any program \nstakeholder, government official, or member of the Federal Interagency \nCouncil on Social Impact Partnerships to unduly influence the measured \noutcome of these funded projects, which is required to receive federal \npayments. As part of these protections, there should be strict conflict \nof interest rules in place to prohibit those involved in selecting and \nmeasuring the projects from having a financial interest in their \noutcome.\n  The purpose of the Social Impact Partnership Act is to establish \nfunding for innovative social service projects that work and ending \nfunding for those that do not. If there is any evidence that such \ninnovation is not occurring and SIPA is becoming yet another wasteful \nand politically influenced government program, I will work to end it.\n  I thank Senators Hatch and Bennet for their great work on this bill, \nand I look forward to its markup in the Finance Committee and passage \nin the full Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/10/senate-section/article/S3792-2"}, {"day": "10", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3792-S3793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BILLY COX\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Baxter \nCounty Sheriff's Deputy Billy Cox, the American Legion Department of \nArkansas Law Enforcement Officer of the Year Award recipient.\n  Deputy Cox has dedicated 13 years to law enforcement and currently \nserves as the Norfork school resource officer. He provides a law \nenforcement presence, but also uses his skills and experiences to help \nstudents learn and grow in a safe environment through D.A.R.E. and \nother youth safety programs. Having worked as a paramedic for two \ndecades, he also teaches CPR to high school students.\n  Known as Officer Billy to the students and educators around the \nNorfork School District, Deputy Cox is a positive role model for the \nstudents. Students rely on him to listen to their problems, and he is \nalways patient and willing to listen. Norfork High School Principal \nBobby Hulse says Deputy Cox means a lot to the students and staff.\n  His dedication to law enforcement has earned Deputy Cox \ncertifications in drug abuse education and gang resistance education. \nHe is a State-certified drug recognition expert.\n  The American Legion Department of Arkansas Law Enforcement Officer of\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nthe Year Award recognizes law enforcement officers who exceed their \nresponsibilities in uniform and show a commitment to community service. \nDeputy Cox was nominated for this award by his supervisor, Lt. Ralph \nBird, because of the huge impact he has had on students and citizens in \nthe county.\n  Deputy Cox is well-deserving of this recognition. His dedication, \ndevotion, and commitment to Baxter County and the Norfork School \nDistrict are apparent every day.\n  I offer my congratulations to Deputy Billy Cox for receiving this \nhonor and wish him continued success in his law enforcement \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/10/senate-section/article/S3792-3"}, {"day": "10", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the first and second times by unanimous \nconsent, and placed on the calendar:\n\n       H.R. 3826.

A bill to withdraw certain Federal land located in Malheur \nCounty, Oregon, from all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal \nunder the public land laws, location, entry, and patent under the \nmining laws, and operation under the mineral leasing laws, to provide \nfor the conduct of certain economic activities in Malheur County, \nOregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Southeastern \nOregon Mineral Withdrawal and Economic Preservation and Development Act \nto provide a boost to the rural Oregon economy and to protect the \nworld-renowned Southeastern Oregon landscape. I am pleased to introduce \nthis bill with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley.\n  In Southeastern Oregon, the high desert landscape is home to hundreds \nof millions of acres of public lands that have hosted cattle ranching \nand visitors and locals for generations. These lands are supported by \nOregonians who grew up there and who rely on them as a long-time \nlinchpin for their local economies. The equation is simple: Healthy \npublic lands mean healthy economies in this part of Oregon. And outside \nthreats to those lands place local economies in peril.\n  I understand that companies, including foreign companies, want to \ncome into Southeastern Oregon to explore for minerals, including \nuranium. This is deeply troubling because these mining operations are \ndangerous--to the existing local economies as well as to the \nenvironment, over all. By potentially hamstringing the creation of jobs \nin agriculture and recreation, and stunting the growth of small \nbusinesses, blocking mining in these areas protects this local \npotential.\n  Senator Merkley and I are introducing this bill because the risks \nposed by mineral exploration to the communities and their way of life \nare far too great to roll the dice.\n  Not only does our bill protect more than 2 million acres from mineral \nexploration and extraction, it creates and expands programs to support \nSoutheastern Oregon communities so they can grow their economies and \nbuild on their strengths. These programs include grants to develop \nmodern and efficient water storage systems to keep livestock out of \nrivers and streams and reduce the need to transport water. They also \ninclude infrastructure grants to improve roads for farmers and \nagriculture-related businesses, as well as job training for veterans \nand young people get started in agriculture. Finally, our bill would \naddress broader economic issues by establishing an Agriculture Center \nof Excellence to expand local agriculture research, providing \nadditional assistance to local and rural firefighters, improving water \nand wastewater systems, and deploying broadband service and cellphone \ntowers.\n  With these investments in Southeastern Oregon, communities can create \njobs, train a new generation of workers, and modernize their economies. \nAll those gains can be achieved while protecting Malheur County's \nnatural landscape and ensuring that the historic uses of the land can \ncontinue without interruption from harmful mining operations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/10/senate-section/article/S3796-1"}, {"day": "10", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3796-S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 488--RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND THE \n  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ``JAMES H.

Res. 488\n\n       Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States, in Brown v. \n     Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), ruled that \n     separating children in public schools on the basis of race \n     violates the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in the years following Brown v. Board of Education, \n     347 U.S. 483 (1954), some Southern States, including the \n     State of Mississippi, continued to uphold racial segregation;\n       Whereas, in 1962, the first African-American integrated the \n     University of Mississippi (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``Ole Miss'');\n       Whereas, in 1965, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. \n     10301 et seq.), which passed Congress with bipartisan support \n     and was signed by President Lyndon Johnson, prohibited racial \n     discrimination in voting;\n       Whereas, in 1966, 4 years after integration, the first \n     African-American student at Ole Miss planned a 220-mile march \n     from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi (referred to \n     in this preamble as the ``Meredith March Against Fear'')--\n       (1) to challenge the fear that dominated the day-to-day \n     lives of African-Americans in the Southern United States, \n     specifically in the State of Mississippi; and\n       (2) to encourage the 450,000 unregistered African-Americans \n     in the State of Mississippi to register to vote and to go to \n     the polls;\n       Whereas, on June 5, 1966, the historic Meredith March \n     Against Fear began at the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis, \n     Tennessee;\n       Whereas the self-reliant and determined leader of the \n     Meredith March Against Fear carried no food, clothing, or \n     sleeping bag, and was joined only by a small number of \n     African-American supporters and Whites from the North;\n       Whereas on reaching the border between the States of \n     Tennessee and Mississippi, the marchers were greeted with \n     hostility;\n       Whereas, on June 6, 1966, the Meredith March Against Fear \n     continued south along United States Highway 51 through DeSoto \n     County toward the town of Hernando, Mississippi;\n       Whereas 150 African-American men and women greeted the \n     marchers at the town square in Hernando, Mississippi;\n       Whereas the visit of the marchers to Hernando, Mississippi, \n     embodied the purpose of the Meredith March Against Fear, ``to \n     explain [to African Americans] that the old order was \n     passing, that they should stand up as men with nothing to \n     fear'';\n       Whereas, on June 6, 1966, about 1 mile south of Hernando, \n     Mississippi, the leader of the Meredith March Against Fear \n     was shot 3 times by an attempted assassin;\n       Whereas, on June 7, 1966, national civil rights leaders, \n     including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Floyd McKissick, and \n     Stokely Carmichael, resumed the Meredith March\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\n     Against Fear while their leader recovered from the attempted \n     assassination;\n       Whereas, over the next 3 weeks, the marchers weathered \n     violence and tear gas, but accomplished what the Meredith \n     March Against Fear set out to accomplish;\n       Whereas voter rallies and drives along United States \n     Highway 51 resulted in more than 4,000 African-Americans \n     registering to vote;\n       Whereas the Meredith March Against Fear featured many \n     African-Americans defying the intimidation of hostile Whites;\n       Whereas, on June 25, 1966, the leader of the Meredith March \n     Against Fear, along with 125 allies, resumed the march from \n     the Canton, Mississippi, courthouse, located 15 miles north \n     of Jackson, Mississippi;\n       Whereas the number of marchers doubled to approximately 250 \n     by the time the Meredith March Against Fear reached the city \n     limits of Canton, Mississippi;\n       Whereas 1 mile north of Tougaloo College, the marchers were \n     met by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and hundreds of \n     additional followers;\n       Whereas hundreds of supporters were led through the iron-\n     rod gate at the main entrance to the Tougaloo campus in \n     Jackson, Mississippi;\n       Whereas, on June 26, 1966, the Meredith March Against Fear \n     concluded with a walk from Tougaloo College to the \n     Mississippi State Capitol building in Jackson, Mississippi;\n       Whereas approximately 15,000 individuals attended the \n     climactic conclusion of the Meredith March Against Fear, \n     making it the largest civil rights demonstration in the \n     history of the State of Mississippi; and\n       Whereas the self-sufficiency and resolve that motivated the \n     Meredith March Against Fear made its leader a revolutionary \n     and a powerful figure in the history of the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the ``James H. \n     Meredith March Against Fear'';\n       (2) recognizes the discipline and focus required to \n     complete the James H.
