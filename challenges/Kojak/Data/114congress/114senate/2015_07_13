Madam President, cowboy poet Georgie Connell Sicking \nconveyed my feelings for the Nevada desert in her poem ``Nevada's \nSubtle Beauty.''\n  This picture I have in the Chamber has appeared all over the country. \nIt appeared, for example, in the Washington Post a week or so ago, and \nthere are other pictures that show this at more of a distance. The man \nthere is so small compared to the vastness of the Nevada terrain. But \nhere is what Georgie Sicking said in her poem:\n\n     Have you gone outdoors one morning after a summer rain,\n     With a gentle breeze blowing across a black sage valley\n     And smelled the earthy sagey freshness, none like it on this \n           earth.\n     It sure makes life worth living, and you know when God was \n           giving, He didn't short-change Nevada.\n     Have you ever in the afternoon watched the mountains changing \n           colors,\n     From the shadows as they grow from brown and black to tan and \n           violet,\n     Or sometimes the deepest blue.\n     Ever changing, ever different, they seem to smile, then \n           frown,\n     Waiting for sky colors to be added as the sun goes down.\n     If these things I mention you have seen and felt and known,\n     Beware, for Nevada has a hold on you and will claim you for \n           her own.\n\n  This is not Iowa terrain. It is very typical Nevada terrain, the \ndeserts of Nevada. It is perfect. It is peaceful. It is the Nevada \ndesert. It feels right. To me, it feels like home.\n  Last Friday, President Obama permanently protected over 700,000 acres \nof land in Eastern Nevada as the Basin and Range National Monument, \nwhich photographer Tyler Roemer has captured beautifully in these \npictures.\n  The land President Obama designated as a monument--two basins and one \nrange--is a perfect example of the stark beauty of the Nevada desert. \nThis monument is an area where the Mojave Desert meets the Great Basin \nand Joshua trees and cactus give way to sagebrush. This monument is an \narea that is home to desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, and \npronghorn antelope.\n  This monument is an area that provided food and shelter for Native \nAmericans and is where one can see their history today in incredible \nrock art panels we call petroglyphs. This monument is an area that \nreflects the pioneering western history from early explorers to the \nranching that still exists.\n  Four or five years ago, I visited this area. I had been in the area \nbut not here. I went there for a number of reasons. I had been informed \nof a five-decade-old art project in the middle of the vastness of this \ndesert. While going to see this work of art, I also saw the unique \nbeauty of the Nevada desert, and it is unique. After I completed my \ntrip, in giving this a lot of thought and contemplation, I became \npassionate about doing something to protect and preserve this \nincredible work of art and the stark beauty of the desert, both of \nwhich are priceless.\n  This picture is part of the City. This work of art has taken 48 years \nto construct. It is the size of the National Mall here. It is a couple \nmiles long and very wide--almost a mile wide. It is something that is \nin the center of the Basin and Range National Monument. It is called \nthe City. It is a grand modern art sculpture the size of, I repeat, the \nNational Mall, part of which you can see in this photo from a group \ncalled the Triple Aught Foundation.\n  The creator is internationally renowned artist Michael Heizer, who is \nknown all over the world. He has been working on this project, as I \nindicated, since 1972.\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\n  The New York Times has called City ``the most ambitious sculpture \nanyone has ever built, one of those audacious improbable American \ndreams at the scale of the West, conceived for the ages.'' The canvas \nwhich makes up the background of his art is the untouched desert land \nof the Basin Range, which makes it all the more monumental. Hundreds \nand hundreds of people worked on this under the guidance of Michael \nHeizer. He has done remarkable stuff all over the world. The latest \nthing he did is in Los Angeles--in the middle of the city of Los \nAngeles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. That is a big project, \nbut it pales in comparison to this. What he did there, he moved a rock \nweighing 400 tons 102 miles through the cities of California. It is \ncalled Levitated Mass. The thing in L.A.--this 400-ton boulder--looks \nlike it is suspended in space. It is not. But people walk under it.\n  I talked very recently to the Los Angeles County Museum director, and \nhe said this thing needs no advertising. People come to see this. And \nthat is the same way this will be. This is a wonderful piece of art.\n  One of the art critics for the Washington Post said it was the most--\nand I am paraphrasing--significant piece of art in the last 50 years in \nAmerica.\n  When I first brought this up to President Obama, he said: Tell me \nwhat it is. Explain it to me. I said: I can't. How, Madam President, as \nyou are presiding over this body, would you describe this? It is really \nhard to describe, and we are only seeing a tiny bit of this. It is 2 \nmiles long and 1 mile wide, approximately.\n  He has done amazing things. He has developed his own dirt. We have \nplenty of dirt in the desert, but he was afraid it would be washed \naway. This will never be washed away--the same up here.\n  As I indicated, he has art projects all over the world, but he is \nfrom Nevada. He has spent a lot of his time in Nevada for the last 48 \nyears, in addition to his other projects. So I am very happy this has \nhappened in Nevada.\n  By using his authority under the Antiquities Act, President Obama has \nhelped preserve the life, history, and culture of Nevada--the land I \nlove.\n  Look at this. This has been preserved for my children, my \ngrandchildren, their children, and their grandchildren. This is \nexquisite.\n  Nevada is growing very rapidly. In the southern part of the State--\nLas Vegas--there are about 3 million people now. People are traveling \nall over Nevada, and we don't have--even though it is a very large \nState--much unspoiled land, but this is something that has not been \nspoiled. There are no roads through it, no railroads, no power lines. \nThis is beautiful, and I am so glad the President did this.\n  As renowned journalist Steve Sebelius wrote in his Sunday column in \nthe Las Vegas Review-Journal, ``Preserving the land from development \nwas the right thing to do. History will bear that out, long after the \nwails of the disaffected have ceased to echo through the desert canyons \nof Nevada's newest monument.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the No. 1 preventable cause of death in \nAmerica today: tobacco. People who use tobacco--smoking or chewing--\ndevelop a myriad of health problems, and many die prematurely.\n  Tobacco companies are a big business in America. They have been for a \nlong time. And they really try their best to recruit new customers when \nthey go into junior high and high schools. Now they are in the e-\ncigarette business too, but I want to stick with tobacco for a moment. \nThe notion, of course, is, if you can addict a child to nicotine, they \nwill continue to smoke and eventually become a lifelong user of tobacco \nproducts.\n  It has been a long time since I have engaged this industry in \npolitical contest. It was a little over 25 years ago when I was a \nMember of the House of Representatives that I boarded an airplane in \nPhoenix, AZ, at the last minute--a United airplane. I went to the \nticket counter and said to the woman at the counter: Can I get on this \nplane?\n  She said: If you hurry, you can get on there. Here is where you are \ngoing to be seated.\n  And I said: Wait a minute. This is in the smoking section of the \nairplane and you have me in a center seat in the smoking section. Isn't \nthere something you can do?\n  She looked at my ticket and said: No, Congressman, there is something \nyou can do.\n  So I got on that plane and flew from Phoenix to Chicago in the \nsmoking section of the airplane--there used to be such things--and \nthought to myself: This is madness. Here I sit, a nonsmoker, breathing \nin all this secondhand smoke, and there is an elderly person in the so-\ncalled nonsmoking section two rows away, and there is a lady with a \nbaby, and why in the world do we have to be subjected to this?\n  So I came back to Washington and introduced a bill in the House of \nRepresentatives to ban smoking on airplanes. After a lot of work and a \nlot of good luck, I found out that the largest frequent flyer club in \nAmerica--the House of Representatives--did not much like smoking on \nairplanes either, and I won--it surprised a lot of people--beat the \ntobacco lobby.\n  I called my friend Frank Lautenberg, the Senator from New Jersey, and \nasked him if he would take up the cause in the Senate. He did it \nmasterfully. The two of us passed the law and changed the way America \nlooked at smoking on airplanes.\n  Neither Senator Lautenberg nor I knew this was a tipping point in \nhistory. I did not know it. But people started thinking: If secondhand \nsmoke is dangerous on an airplane, why isn't it dangerous on a train, \nin a bus, in an office building, in a hospital, in a restaurant? Today, \n25-plus years later, if you walked into someone's office on Capitol \nHill and they had an ashtray in the middle of the table, you would \nthink: What are they thinking? People do not do that anymore.\n  It used to be standard and no one thought twice about lighting up. \nThat was just your personal preference. Things have changed in America, \nand the number of people using tobacco products has declined because \nthey have come to understand it is dangerous, it can kill you.\n  But we are not the only country on Earth that has figured this out. \nMany other countries are ahead of us in terms of regulating tobacco. If \nyou travel overseas, take a look at cigarette packages. Ours still look \npretty fancy. They have a little label on them. But in other countries, \nthe cigarette packages are very stark and very limited in what they can \nsay about the product. Most of what they contain are health care \nwarnings: Tobacco can kill you. Tobacco can harm a fetus in a pregnant \nwoman. These stark reminders are to discourage people from using \ntobacco products because countries overseas, just like the United \nStates, understand how dangerous they are.\n  So it was in that context that I was amazed to read something a few \nweeks ago. The New York Times published a devastating series of \narticles on how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been playing a global \nstrategy to fight against effective tobacco control laws in other \ncountries--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce fighting tobacco control laws \nin other countries.\n  Why would the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--once considered a pillar of \nthe American business community--be a champion promoting the sale and \nconsumption of a deadly tobacco product in another country? It does not \ncompute. One reason? The power, the money, and the influence of Big \nTobacco is still very strong. The stories and letters published by the \nNew York Times made it clear that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has \neffectively rented out its letterhead to the tobacco industry, \njeopardizing not only the reputation of the Chamber but all the member \ncompanies that belong to it.\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\n  I stand here today to salute one company that has fought back at this \nrevelation of this activity by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. CVS \nHealth--you know them from their drugstores and pharmacies--announced \nit was going to quit the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because the Chamber's \nefforts to promote tobacco conflict with the CVS corporate policy that \ndecided over a year ago to stop selling tobacco products in their \ndrugstores.\n  I congratulate CVS Health. It is pretty bold when they decide they \nare going to walk out on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of these \nrotten policies they have in discouraging tobacco control overseas. \nMaybe this decision by CVS will give the Chamber of Commerce a reason \nto think twice about a policy that is going to result in deadly \naddictions and terrible disease. It should. The Chamber should end this \ninsidious campaign as quickly as possible. Without question, CVS Health \nhas shown again, as they did last year, that protecting the public \nhealth is good business and it is essential to good, responsible \ncorporate citizenship.\n  The World Health Organization estimates that tobacco kills more than \n6 million people worldwide every year. In the 21st century, 1 billion \npeople--1 billion--are expected to die as a result of tobacco. And many \nof these deaths are in the poorest nations on Earth--8 out of 10 of \ntoday's smokers living in low-income and middle-income countries. It is \nunconscionable that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is going after the \nlaws to protect the people in these poor countries.\n  More than a decade ago, the World Health Organization adopted an \ninternational treaty focused on reducing tobacco consumption. This \ntreaty, supported by 180 countries, obligates nations to employ \npractices to reduce tobacco use. We have made a lot of progress in the \nlast 10 years. Madam President, 49 countries have passed comprehensive \nsmoke-free laws protecting over 1 billion people. Madam President, 42 \ncountries have strong, graphic warning labels, covering almost 20 \npercent of the population that buys these products. These policies save \nlives and prevent cancer, heart disease, and lung cancer.\n  It is hard to imagine how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce can \nrationalize policies that literally promote the death of innocent \npeople from the use of tobacco.\n  Hats off to the CVS Health corporation for stepping up and showing \nresponsible corporate citizenship in resigning from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. Maybe if the U.S. Chamber of Commerce comes to its senses, \nCVS might consider rejoining it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S4989-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, over the Fourth of July recess, I joined \nwith Senator Bill Nelson and we went to Haiti. It is not a popular spot \nfor Members of Congress to go on a weekend, but we made a point of \ngoing. It was a return trip for both of us.\n  Our visit the first time was 5 years ago, after the devastating \nearthquake that left the capital city of Port au Prince in ruins, \nclaimed more than 200,000 lives, and more than 1 million people were \ndisplaced from their homes. I recall visiting the island that many \nyears ago, 2 years after the earthquake, and witnessing the ongoing \ndevastation--people still living in tents. So it was with some \nsatisfaction to see that Haiti has come a long way. Buildings are being \nrebuilt, the overwhelming majority of those displaced have found \nhousing, and the economy is starting to recover.\n  The United States has been a major contributor to Haiti's recovery, \nand I want to praise the dedicated American Government officials who \nwork in a challenging environment--notably under the incredible and \ntireless and amazing leadership of our U.S. Ambassador in Haiti, Pam \nWhite, a career employee of USAID and now our Nation's Ambassador to \nHaiti.\n  I noted that the Senate recently confirmed a couple of President \nObama's nominees to become Ambassadors. There are now dozens still \nwaiting. Can you imagine the United States of America in our Embassies \noverseas with no Ambassador month after month after month, when worthy \npeople have been nominated and the U.S. Senate refuses to even consider \nan Obama nomination for Ambassador? Many of these are not political. \nThey are career. They spent their career working in the State \nDepartment. Now, at the end of their career, they are named Ambassador, \nand the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, under Republican \nleadership, refuses to call President Obama's nominees for these \nambassadorial posts.\n  In many countries, the foreign minister in those countries counts the \ndays and weeks that the United States has not had an ambassador. It is \nan embarrassment. I hope the majority party now will at least give the \nPresident and our Nation the opportunity to put good representatives of \nour countries overseas.\n  Madam President, I wish to say a few words about the current \nPresident of Haiti, whose term ends this year. His name is Michel \nJoseph Martelly. He is known as Sweet Micky, which used to be his stage \nname when he was a rock and roll singer. He has now been the President \n4\\1/2\\ years and has done some very good things. He wisely guided his \nnation through the post-earthquake process and a lot of political \nchange.\n  The end of his term marks an important moment for Haiti and its \nfuture. Given that the Haitian Parliament dissolved in January, the \nsuccess and timeliness of these elections cannot be overstated. I urge \nthe political parties and candidates to renounce the use of electoral \nviolence and to participate constructively in the upcoming election. \nAnd I hope that the neighboring country, the Dominican Republic, will \njoin with Haiti in resolving some very vexing immigration problems \nbetween these two countries. These are problems which involve some of \nthe poorest people on that island of Hispaniola. We need to find a way \nto treat them in a decent and humane fashion so they can ultimately be \nlocated in a place where they can maintain their dignity and their \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S4989-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4989-S4990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on the floor now when we return for \ndebate is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has been \nnamed the Every Child Achieves Act, and is before the Senate this week. \nWe may finish it. The issue is our opportunity on a periodic basis to \ndebate the future of K-12 education in America. Millions of Americans \nfollow this debate. It affects their local schools and school \ndistricts.\n  It was under President George W. Bush that there was an amazing bill \npassed called the No Child Left Behind Act. What was amazing, \npolitically, was that President Bush--a Republican and a conservative--\ncalled for a larger role by the Federal Government in evaluating school \ndistricts and teachers and in deciding whether they were succeeding. It \nwas controversial from the start. Ultimately, we have moved away from \nit.\n  This new bill takes a much different approach. Instead of testing, \ntesting, testing and grading school districts, we are basically \nshifting the responsibility back to the States to do this. It remains \nto be seen whether this is or will be an improvement.\n  We learned a lot under No Child Left Behind when we took a close look \nat test scores. To say what the average test score is at a school meant \nvery little--or nothing--when we broke out the students at the school \nand found out that some were doing exceedingly well and some not so \nwell at all. We could find groups of students--some minority groups, \nfor example--who were not doing very well at school, but the other kids \nmight have brought the scores up. So now, by disaggregating scores, we \ncan target our efforts and make sure that some students have a fighting \nchance.\n  It remains to be seen, under this Every Child Achieves Act, whether \nwe have gone far enough or too far in shifting the responsibility back \nto the States.\n  I will mention very briefly, because I see my friend and colleague \nfrom Vermont on the floor, that there is one amendment here that I have \noffered with Senator Capito. This bipartisan amendment would require \nStates to include information on their State report cards about \npostsecondary enrollment rates at public and State institutions. It \nwill allow States to go further and include information on private, \npublic,\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nand out-of-State enrollment as well. It would encourage States to \nproduce and publish data on remediation rates on students, so we can \nbetter understand which high schools are truly preparing their students \nfor postsecondary education. Much of the data is already collected by \nthe States. So the additional burden would be minimal.\n  Ensuring students coming out of high school are college and career \nready is an important goal of the bill. Our commonsense bipartisan \namendment would help track whether that goal is being met.\n  The amendment is supported by the Business Roundtable, Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, Education Trust, National Center for \nLearning Disabilities, National Council of La Raza, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and America Forward.\n  There is one other amendment I have, and I will close on this. When \nit relates to high school athletics, many of us are concerned about the \nincidents of concussions occurring in sporting events. I filed an \namendment based on my Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act. \nIt is supported by the American Academy of Neurology, American College \nof Sports Medicine, Illinois High School Association, NCAA, Major \nLeague Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football \nLeague, National Hockey League, and many others.\n  It directs States to develop concussion safety plans for public \nschools to protect student athletes from this dangerous injury. Most \nimportantly, it would require the adoption of a ``when in doubt, sit it \nout'' policy, promoted by the medical community. This means that a \nstudent athlete suspected of a concussion would be removed from play \nand prohibited from returning to play that same day, no matter what. It \ndoesn't make any difference how much he pleads or what the score of the \ngame is or who is sitting in the stands. If you think you have evidence \nof a concussion, be safe. Don't put that student athlete back on the \nfield.\n  It would take the decision on when to put an injured athlete back in \nthe game out of the hands of the coach, the athlete, and the parents. \nWhile I don't believe we will be able to get the adoption of the full \namendment, I am pleased that a substitute includes a clear statement \nthat allows funds to be used to develop these policies. I thank \nChairman Alexander and Senator Murray for working with us to include \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my dear friend, the senior Senator from \nKansas, is going to speak next, but he has graciously allowed me to \nhave the very few minutes I asked for, and then he will be recognized \nas soon as I give my statement.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the submission of S.

Madam President, I rise to talk about the bill we have \nbefore us today.\n  We in the Senate have a unique opportunity long overdue and a \nresponsibility to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. The acronym is ESEA. This legislation is long overdue. It is vital \nfor our children and their future that we get it right when addressing \neducation policy. The consequences will be seen for years to come.\n  I would like to acknowledge and especially commend the work of \nChairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray, who worked so \nhard to get us to this point. This is something rather unique in the \nSenate. We are coming together. We are percolating with regards to \nimportant bills. This is a tremendously important bill.\n  Due to their bipartisan leadership, the Every Child Achieves Act was \napproved back in April by the HELP Committee, of which I am a proud \nmember, 22 to 0. I was very proud to vote yes.\n  Let me repeat that. It passed 22 to 0. Because of that hard work, led \nby Senators Alexander and Murray, we are currently debating ESEA in the \nSenate for the first time since 2001. That is 14 years--14 years--that \nwe have not had a reauthorization bill come to the Senate floor, and \nthere is a lot of hope that it will pass. This is a prime example of \nwhat is possible when the Senate functions as it should and committees \nare actually able to legislate.\n  Recently, 10 national education groups, representing educators, \nprincipals, school boards, superintendents, chief State school \nofficers, parents and PTAs, and school business officials, called on \nthe Senate to consider the Every Child Achieves Act to reauthorize the \nESEA.\n  Daniel Domenech, executive director of the School Superintendents \nAssociation, wrote this in a letter:\n\n       The nation's K-6th graders have spent every day of their K-\n     12 experience under an outdated and broken ESEA. Our students \n     want and deserve more.\n\n  His remarks perfectly summarize the issues at hand.\n  I want to turn to a critical issue for States and school districts. \nOver the last few years, the administration has doubled down on Federal \nmandates and has used the waiver process to create law by fiat--thereby \ncircumventing Congress and allowing those who have a Federal agenda in \nWashington to make too many decisions that are best left to the States \nand the school districts. It is evident that waivers have been granted \nonly to those States that agree to implement the administration's \npreferred education policies. That is just not right.\n  In fact, the New York Times has referred to the waiver process as \n``the most sweeping use of executive authority to rewrite Federal \neducation law since Washington expanded its involvement in education in \nthe 1960s.''\n  Under section 9401 of current law, the ``Secretary may waive any \nstatutory or regulatory requirement of this Act for a state education \nagency, local education agency, Indian tribe or school'' if that entity \nreceives funds and requests a waiver.\n  Language included in the Every Child Achieves Act amends section 9401 \nto clarify that the waiver process is intended to be led by State and \nlocal requests, not Washington mandates. This will help ensure the \nprocess is State-driven and will allow for greater flexibility and \ninnovation.\n  In July 2011, the Congressional Research Service issued a report \nproviding an overview of the Secretary's waiver authority under ESEA \nand warned of potential legal limits and challenges to the Secretary's \nflexibility proposal.\n  The report states: ``If the Secretary did, as a condition of granting \na waiver, require a grantee to take another action not currently \nrequired under the ESEA, the likelihood of a successful legal challenge \nwill increase.''\n  I have worked long and hard for language in the bill--years and \nyears--that will prohibit the Secretary from imposing any additional \nrequirements to waiver requests not authorized by the Congress. I am \nfully committed to fighting this one-size-fits-all Federal education \nagenda because I firmly believe local control is best when it comes to \neducation.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act, in its current form, puts an end to \nWashington mandates and allows Kansans to make their own decisions \nabout the best way to improve education. While this legislation heads \nin the right direction in reducing the Federal footprint, I want to \nremind my colleagues it is important that we avoid adding back Federal \nmandates and prescriptive requirements.\n  As we move forward, I will continue to push to return K-12 education \ndecision-making to State and local control, where we can establish the \nbest policies to ensure that every child receives the highest quality \neducation.\n  Now, I would like to briefly discuss something called Common Core and \nthe Federal overreach in education. Common Core started out as a State-\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\nled effort to create high standards that States would voluntarily \nadopt, but the administration had different ideas.\n  In homes across America, parents are raising questions about what \ntheir children are being taught. In many cases, parents are hearing \nthat local curriculum decisions have been driven by the Common Core \neducation standards that most States adopted in a hurry under Federal \npressure with little or no public input.\n  Decisions about what children are taught are best made on the local \nlevel as close to parents as possible. The Federal Government should \nnot have overriding influence over State and local education decisions. \nSimply put, the Department of Education has incentivized and coerced \nStates into implementing Common Core education standards. Some within \nour education community in Kansas have even called this practice a \nbribe.\n  The administration made it a criterion for States to adopt Common \nCore standards to have a reasonable chance to receive Federal funding \nunder the multibillion-dollar Race to the Top Program and used Federal \nfunds to develop Common Core-aligned tests. They have also threatened \nto withhold waivers from the onerous provisions of the No Child Left \nBehind Act if States do not adopt Common Core or similarly aligned \nstandards and assessments. This is wrong.\n  For that reason, earlier this year, I reintroduced the LOCAL Level \nAct, S. 182, to explicitly prohibit the Federal Government's role and \ninvolvement in Common Core. My legislation would strictly forbid the \nFederal Government from intervening in a State's education standards, \nits curricula, and assessments through the use of incentives, mandates, \ngrants, waivers or any form of manipulation. Simply put, my legislation \nwill preserve State education autonomy.\n  A State will now be free from Federal interference in how to decide \nwhether to use Common Core or any other type of academic standard. I am \npleased the bill before us includes the language from my LOCAL Level \nAct and will, once and for all, end the administration's use of waivers \nto force or incentivize States to adopt Common Core standards.\n  It will end the Obama administration's--and, for that matter, any \nfuture administration's--ability to use any tool of coercion to force \nStates to adopt Common Core or any set of standards at all, whether it \nis Common Core by another name or some new set of standards--period.\n  I thank Chairman Alexander for including my language because I firmly \nbelieve it will prohibit the administration from finding additional \nways to promote a State's adoption of Common Core.\n  I want to emphasize setting high standards for our schools, our \nteachers, and our children obviously is the right thing to do. But we \nwill decide those standards in Kansas, and those decisions will be made \nin other States as well. We need to get the Federal Government out of \nthe classroom and return our community decisions back to where they \nbelong--in the community.\n  If the Every Child Achieves Act becomes law, we can finally say \ngoodbye to Federal interference in what we teach our kids in school. \nChairman Alexander has stated that with this bill, we have the first \nopportunity in 25 years to restore decision-making back to States, \nlocal school districts, superintendents, principals and teachers, local \nschool boards, parents, and especially the students. He is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Every Child Achieves Act that is pending before the Senate. I want \nto commend Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for working in \nsuch a great bipartisan fashion that brought this bill to the floor \nthat will improve the quality of education for children across our \ncountry.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act puts States and local officials back in \ncontrol of our local schools. As we heard from the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Roberts, his hard work on this bill also stops the Department of \nEducation from conditioning Federal funding on the adoption of national \nstandards like Common Core.\n  Importantly, this bill also makes sure parents and taxpayers continue \nto have access to important information about how the schools in their \ncommunities are performing. The Every Child Achieves Act deserves the \nSenate's support this week. Last week, the Senate unanimously adopted \nan amendment that will allow community school programs the flexibility \nto use Federal funds to pay for a site resource coordinator at their \nschool or local education agency. This is important to the State of \nWest Virginia. We have community schools. Community school programs \nprovide important health, nutrition, and other key services for many of \nour West Virginia students who are, unfortunately, living in poverty.\n  The amendment passed last week will allow those programs to better \ncoordinate with community partners to provide resources and support for \nour children in need. I was happy to work with Senator Brown and my \nfellow Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, to see that that \namendment passed.\n  I also want to talk briefly about a bipartisan amendment I introduced \nwith Senator Durbin--he spoke about it a few minutes ago on the floor--\nthat takes important steps to create transparency for students and \nfamilies. It does so by allowing students and parents to know the \nquality and progress of their schools as it relates to college \nreadiness.\n  This amendment will require States and local educational agencies to \ninclude postsecondary enrollment data on the existing report card \nmeasures that are included in the Every Child Achieves Act. It also \nencourages the inclusion of data on postsecondary remediation.\n  It is supported by dozens of organizations, including the College \nSummit, the Business Roundtable, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nbecause this amendment seeks to improve the education outcomes of our \nstudents.\n  Parents and students alike deserve to know they are being adequately \nprepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. Including \nthese simple, easy-to-understand measures on State and local report \ncards will provide them with the information they need to make informed \nchoices about their future education. Additionally, the data will help \nStates and school districts target limited resources to the schools \nthat need it most. This amendment was carefully crafted to avoid \nputting onerous and additional burdens on our schools and States. \nNearly all States already have made the investments necessary to \ncollect, link, and report this data. In fact, the majority of States \nare already reporting it. Currently, 40 States produce high school \nfeedback reports that include postsecondary enrollment data. More than \n30 States already include some measure of postsecondary success, such \nas remediation rates.\n  Adding postsecondary enrollment and remediation rates to existing \nreport card measures included in Every Child Achieves Act would make \nsure students, parents, educators, and policymakers have access to \ncritical information about how well our high schools are preparing \nstudents to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. The end \nresult will be successfully restoring decisionmaking to those who know \nbest--the students and their parents.\n  I urge everyone to support this amendment and also to support the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S4991-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4991-S4992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the urgency of \npassing the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which takes the same \nprotections that children have against discrimination on the basis of \nrace and national origin and gender and disability, and it extends \nthose protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender children--\nLGBT children. That is it. It is a simple bill. It stands for the \nprinciple that LGBT kids have a right not to be bullied just because of \nwho they are.\n  There are people who will say: What can you do to stop bullying? Kids \nwill be kids. Boys will be boys. I don't think that is right. Because \nwhat we\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\nare seeing in our schools today is not just teasing; it is not \nplayground behavior. What we are seeing is more than just bullying. We \nare seeing discrimination. Let me explain what I mean.\n  If a Black child was referred to by a racial slur at school, would we \nsay kids will be kids? If a Jewish student got beat up because he wore \na yarmulke to school, would we wave it off and say boys will be boys? \nIf a shop teacher told a female teacher she didn't belong in his class, \nwould we be fine if the school just looked the other way?\n  No, we would not. In fact, there are Federal civil rights laws that \nare specifically designed to stop this kind of conduct. But if a gay \nchild is relentlessly harassed by his classmates, if a principal tells \na girl she can't go to her senior prom because she wants to bring \nanother girl as her date or if a school stands by as teachers, \nstudents, and other administrators refer to a transgender child not as \n``he'' or ``she'' but as ``it,'' there is no law that was written to \nprotect those children. Our laws fail those children, and that is just \nwrong. We can change that.\n  The bullying of LGBT children in our schools has reached epidemic \nproportions. More than 30 percent of LGBT kids report missing a day of \nschool in the previous month because they felt unsafe. Nearly 75 \npercent of LGBT students say they have been verbally harassed at \nschool, and more than 35 percent of LGBT students report being \nphysically attacked. You cannot learn if you dread going to school. It \nhas been estimated that, on average, LGBT kids comprise 40 percent of \nall homeless youth. To be sure, family rejection is a leading factor, \nbut LGBT kids' inability to escape verbal harassment and physical \nattacks makes them drop out, which makes them much more likely to be \nhomeless. That is unacceptable. Our children should not have to \nexperience that kind of hate at school, and, as we have seen all too \noften, some of them just can't endure it.\n\n  A few years ago, I met a wonderful woman named Wendy Walsh, the \nmother of Seth Walsh, whose photo is next to me here. Wendy told me \nthat Seth had endured years of anti-gay harassment at school in \nTehachapi, CA. When he was in the fifth grade, other students started \ncalling him gay, and as he got older the harassment became more \nfrequent and more abusive. By seventh grade, taunts and verbal abuse \nwere a constant part of Seth's day. Students called him faggot and \nqueer. He was afraid to use the restroom or to be in the boys' locker \nroom before gym class.\n  Seth had always been a good student, receiving A's and B's, but as \nthe harassment escalated, he started to get failing grades. Friends \nreported that he became depressed and withdrawn. Wendy desperately \ntried to get school district officials to do something, but her pleas \nwere brushed aside, and in September of 2010, Seth hanged himself from \na tree in his family's backyard. He was 13. Seth left a note expressing \nhis love for family and friends but also his anger at the school.\n  Justin Aaberg was a rising sophomore at high school in Anoka, MN, my \nhome State. Justin played the cello. In fact, he composed music for the \ncello. His mother Tammy told people that he was a ``sweet boy who \nseemed to always have a smile on his face.'' Justin came out to his mom \nwhen he was 13. In July of 2010, Justin hanged himself in his bedroom. \nHis mother later learned from Justin's friends and from messages he \nleft before his death that he had been the victim of incessant bullying \nat school. Justin was 15 when he died.\n  Carl Walker Hoover was a Boy Scout and a football player for his \nschool in Springfield, MA. But starting in the sixth grade, the kids at \nCarl's school started to bully and harass him for ``acting gay'' or \n``acting like a girl'' even though he didn't identify as LGBT. When \nCarl's mother, Sirdeaner Walker, learned about the harassment, she \nspoke to his principal, his teacher, and his guidance counselor \nrepeatedly, asking the school to intervene. But in April of 2009, \nSirdeaner found her son hanging by an extension cord on the second \nfloor of her home. In the letter Carl left behind, he said he simply \ncouldn't take it anymore. Carl was 11 years old.\n  Justin, Seth, and Carl's stories are not anomalies. They are just a \nfew of the many tragic cases in an epidemic of school bullying against \nLGBT kids or kids who are perceived to be LGBT.\n  The bill we are debating this week is an education bill, a bill about \ntaking the steps necessary to secure better and brighter futures for \nour children. It is our responsibility not just as Senators but as \nadults to protect children and to help them flourish. Children who are \nafraid to go to school can't get a good education.\n  Think about the children in your life--your son or your daughter, \nyour grandchild or your niece or nephew--and what it must be like for a \nchild in your life to get up and face the school day ahead not with \nexcitement but with anxiety and fear, with dread and shame. This \nshouldn't happen in America. In America, we have passed laws that guard \nagainst harassment in our schools on the basis of race, national \norigin, sex, and disability, but LGBT students face bullying and \nintimidation without recourse.\n  This amendment would simply provide LGBT kids with the same legal \nremedies available to other kids under our Federal civil rights laws. \nIt says that schools would have to listen when a parent calls and says: \nMy child isn't safe, and then the school has to do something about it. \nIt would ensure that LGBT kids have the same protections, not some of \nthe same protections, as other kids.\n  This is not a revolutionary idea. In fact, more than a dozen States \nhave already passed laws that protect students from discrimination \nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity, and it is working. In \nStates that have protections for sexual orientation and gender identity \nin schools, LGBT students report nearly one-third fewer instances of \nphysical harassment and nearly half as many instances of physical \nassault as in States lacking these protections.\n  We have come incredibly far in our understanding of LGBT people in a \nvery short period of time not just as a country but as a body. In 2013, \nby a vote of 64 to 32, the Senate passed ENDA, the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act, which would prohibit job discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It would prohibit \nfiring someone or harassing them at work for being gay or transgender. \nIt would protect adults.\n  Now it is time to protect kids and to put in place policies to ensure \nthat a child of 11 or 13 or 15 is allowed to live their life and \ndiscover who they are--to discover that maybe they are a great cellist \nor a first-round NFL draft pick--without facing taunts and intimidation \nand physical violence in the school. It is our responsibility as a \ncountry and as a body to protect our children. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to do just that by supporting the Student Non-Discrimination \nAct and voting for it as an amendment to this bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S4992-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4992-S4993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PROTECTING STUDENT PRIVACY ACT\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, we do not have to look any further than \nthe recent data breaches at the Government Office of Personnel \nManagement, Target, Home Depot, Sony, Neiman Marcus, and countless \nothers to know there are pitfalls to the rush to store our personal, \nsensitive data online. And there is no information more personal and \nmore sensitive than that of school-aged children.\n  The business of sifting through and storing the records of grade \nschool and high school students is growing as fast as students are. By \ncollecting personal information about students' test results and \nlearning abilities, teachers may find better ways to educate their \nstudents. We can help improve their test scores, improve academic \nachievement, and prepare students for the future.\n  The increased use of data analysis of student performance holds \npromise for increasing student achievement, but at the same time there \nare perils from a privacy perspective. Putting the sensitive \ninformation of students in the hands of third parties and private \nsector companies raises a number of very serious questions about the \nprivacy rights of parents and their children. The information being \ncollected is about students as young as 5 years old.\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\n  As a nation, we have already decided that children require extra \nprotection, and that is why in the House of Representatives I was the \nprincipal author of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or \nCOPPA, which is what it is called. COPPA is the communications \nconstitution for protecting children when they are online. I believe \nvery deeply that parents, not private companies, should have the right \nto control information about their children, even when a child's data \nis in the hands of a private company.\n  We know that the pre-K through 12 educational software and digital \ncontent market is currently worth more than $8 billion. I will say that \nagain. An $8 billion industry has now been built up around pre-K \nthrough 12 educational software, and nearly all of America's school \ndistricts rely on cloud services for a diverse range of functions that \ninclude data collection and analysis related to student performance.\n  As data analytics companies increasingly play a role in the education \narea, Congress must act to ensure that safeguards are in place for \nstudent data that is shared with third parties. Show-and-tell should be \na classroom exercise with students, not with students' personal and \nsensitive information.\n  A child's educational record should not be sold as a product on the \nopen market. That is why earlier this year I introduced the Protecting \nStudent Privacy Act with Senators Hatch and Kirk. That is why today my \ncolleague Senator Hatch and I are offering a bipartisan amendment which \nthe Senators will be asked to vote on which will establish a commission \nto report to Congress on how we protect student privacy and parental \nrights in the digital age.\n  These recommendations the Senators will be voting on here today will \ninclude a number of things--No. 1, how to prevent marketers from using \neducational records to target students with advertisements. The goal \nhere is to help young scholars make the grade--not to have private \nsector companies make a sale. They should not be using the information \nthey have in order to target young kids with products. That should be \nan issue for which we have a national policy.\n\n  No. 2, when should student information be deleted? Permanent records \nof children shouldn't be held permanently by private sector companies, \nbut only by students and their parents.\n  No. 3 is how parents should be able to access and correct private \ninformation about their children. Just as there could be an erroneous \ncharge on a credit report and that should not prevent someone from \ngetting a loan, a false grade or a false bit of information on a report \ncard shouldn't prevent a young person from getting into the college of \ntheir choice, and parents should have the ability to say they want that \nchanged.\n  No. 4, how do we ensure that outside vendors, outside companies that \nhandle and store this sensitive information put in place the strongest \npossible data security standards? This is a business. These companies \nare making money, saying: We will store this information so you don't \nhave to build more physical storehouses. We will put this information \nup into the cloud. That will be a real cost savings for the school \nsystem. Well, how much security is that private sector company now \ngoing to build around the cloud with all of that information? Are they \ngoing to have the highest level of cyber security protections built in? \nOr are they just going to buy something that is dirt cheap and say they \nhave security precautions but, like Target, like Sony, like the Office \nof Personnel Management, they will not have actually put in place the \nsecurity protections which will ensure that children's most sensitive \ninformation is not compromised as it is being stored up in the cloud.\n  The reality is that our data is being increasingly compromised, and \ncompanies of all shapes and sizes must devote the resources necessary \nto protect that information. As it is stored in the cloud and as it is \nbeing subjected to malicious attacks, there must be a security system \nthat can repel those attacks.\n  The amendment Senator Hatch and I bring to the floor here this \nafternoon at 5:30 brings together privacy experts, parents, school \nleaders, public advocates, and the technology industry in order to \ntackle how to best balance protecting students' personal information \nwhile promoting greater academic achievement. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan amendment.\n  There is a Dickensian quality to this digital world. It is the best \nof technology and the worst of technology simultaneously. It can be \nused to enable and ennoble. It can be used to degrade and debase. How \nwe choose will only be determined by human beings and by those who \nrepresent them in the Senate. We have to ensure that we put in place \npolicies that ensure we have the best use of these digital technologies \nwhile not having children and their parents be robbed of the private \ninformation that is so sensitive to the long term well-being of a child \nas they are developing.\n  That is what this amendment is all about here today. I urge an \n``aye'' vote.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, just 12 days ago, Kate Steinle was \nwalking along Pier 14 in San Francisco with her father when she was \nshot by an individual in this country illegally. At the age of 32--a \nvery young age--her life was taken. Friends and family mourned her \ndeath and laid her to rest late last week.\n  Kate Steinle should be with us today. Her death is a result of weak \nimmigration policies, an insecure border, and a lack of will to enforce \nthe law. Her alleged killer was deported five times and has a rap sheet \nthat dates back to 1991. Despite his criminal background, San \nFrancisco's sanctuary policy allowed this man to walk the streets.\n  Today we are learning that there are thousands of detainers placed \neach year on undocumented immigrants by Federal officials, but these \ndetainers go ignored.\n  Detainers are requests to another law enforcement entity that it \nwants to take custody of a person. The Federal Government will ask, for \ninstance, a State or local jurisdiction to hold an individual for 48 \nhours until the Federal Government can assume custody.\n  According to government documents provided by the Center for \nImmigration Studies, between January and September of 2014, there were \n8,811 declined detainers in 276 counties in 43 States, including the \nDistrict of Columbia. Of the 8,811 declined detainers, 62 percent of \nthem were associated with over 5,000 individuals who were previously \ncharged, convicted of a crime or presented some other public safety \nconcern. And nearly 1,900 of the released offenders were arrested for \nanother crime once they were released by the sanctuary jurisdiction.\n  This is very disturbing--not only to me but to most Americans. There \nis no good rationale for noncooperation between Federal officials and \nState and local law enforcement. Public safety is put at risk when \nState and local officials provide sanctuary to lawbreaking immigrants \njust to make some political point.\n  But San Francisco isn't the only one to shoulder blame here. The \nObama administration has turned a blind eye to law enforcement in this \narea, even releasing thousands of criminal aliens on its own, many of \nwhom have gone on to commit serious crimes--even murder. They have also \nturned a blind eye to sanctuary cities, all while challenging States to \ntake a more aggressive approach to immigration and enforcing \nimmigration laws.\n  That is why I wrote to Attorney General Lynch and Department of \nHomeland Security Secretary Johnson just last week. I urged them to \ntake control of the situation so that detainers are not ignored and \nundocumented individuals are safely transferred to Federal custody and \nput into deportation proceedings. I implored them to take a more direct \nrole in this matter.\n  This administration needs to stop turning a blind eye to State and \nlocal jurisdictions that thumb their nose at the law and harbor \ncriminals who are evading immigration authorities.\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\n  But this isn't a new issue for this administration. I wrote to then-\nSecretary Napolitano in 2011 and asked her to intervene in Cook County, \nIL, another sanctuary jurisdiction. I wrote to her again, along with \nthen-Attorney General Holder, about sanctuary cities in January of \n2012. They failed to do anything at the time. In fact, since then, \nadministration officials have made it clear that detainers did not have \nto be honored.\n  The man charged with the murder of Kate Steinle told officials that \nhe sought refuge and moved to San Francisco precisely because of its \nsanctuary policy.\n  This is a tipping point, however. There are many other victims we \nneed to remember.\n  That is why, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I plan to hold a \nhearing on the President's immigration policies and the tragic effect \nthey are having on Americans. I have invited the head of U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement as well as the Director of U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services to testify. Before they testify, I \nplan to have relatives of victims present to tell Congress how their \nloved ones and how their lives have been forever changed because of \ncriminal aliens. This hearing will take place next Tuesday.\n  This is far too important an issue to go unresolved. The \nheartbreaking death of Kate Steinle at the hands of a criminal alien in \nthe country illegally underscores the need for swift and decisive \naction to prevent further tragedies of this nature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S4994-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1177, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1177) to reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every child \n     achieves.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Alexander/Murray amendment No. 2089, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Murray (for Peters) amendment No. 2095 (to amendment No. \n     2089), to allow local educational agencies to use parent and \n     family engagement funds for financial literacy activities.\n       Murray (for Warren/Gardner) amendment No. 2120 (to \n     amendment No. 2089), to amend section 1111(d) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 regarding the \n     cross-tabulation of student data.\n       Alexander (for Kirk) amendment No. 2161 (to amendment No. \n     2089), to ensure that States measure and report on indicators \n     of student access to critical educational resources and \n     identify disparities in such resources.\n       Alexander (for Scott) amendment No. 2132 (to amendment No. \n     2089), to expand opportunity by allowing Title I funds to \n     follow low-income children.\n       Alexander (for Hatch/Markey) amendment No. 2080 (to \n     amendment No. 2089), to establish a committee on student \n     privacy policy.\n       Murray (for Franken) amendment No. 2093 (to amendment No. \n     2089), to end discrimination based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools.\n       Murray (for Kaine) amendment No. 2118 (to amendment No. \n     2089), to amend the State accountability system under section \n     1113(b)(3) regarding the measures used to ensure that \n     students are ready to enter postsecondary education or the \n     workforce without the need for postsecondary remediation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe that providing all of our \nstudents with a quality education is one of our most important national \npriorities. The workforce in the years to come will depend on today's \nstudents being able to create and take on the jobs of tomorrow, and \nproviding students with the chance to learn, grow, and thrive will help \nour country continue to compete and lead in the 21st-century global \neconomy.\n  Today we are continuing our work on the Senate floor to make sure all \nof our students have access to a quality education by working to fix \nthe badly broken No Child Left Behind law. I thank Chairman Alexander, \nthe senior Senator from Tennessee, for working with me on this \nbipartisan bill. He has been a great partner throughout this process. \nThe bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in \nthe right direction. It gives our States more flexibility while also \nincluding Federal guardrails to make sure all students have access to a \nquality public education. But I want to work, of course, to continue to \nimprove and strengthen this bill throughout this process on the Senate \nfloor. I want to make sure struggling schools get the resources they \nneed. I want to make sure all of our kids, especially our most \nvulnerable students, are able to succeed in the classroom.\n  Finishing this process and getting a bill signed into law isn't going \nto be easy. Nothing in Congress ever is. But students and parents and \nteachers in communities across our country--including in my home State \nof Washington--are looking to Congress to fix this broken law. We \ncannot let them down. We need to work across the aisle to provide a \nquality education for all students, regardless of where they live or \nhow they learn or how much money their parents make.\n\n  So I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Alexander as we \nmove this through the Senate floor and to conference--and I think he \nagrees with me--and, hopefully, to the President to get it signed into \nlaw. I see the chairman is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I do agree with the Senator on our \ngoal. We had a good week last week. We had a large number of amendments \nthat were agreed to, a number were adopted in addition to ones we had \nin committee. We need to finish this week. We need Senators to do what \nmembers of the committee did, which is to pursue a result exercising \nsome restraint. If we all insist on everything we have a right to \ninsist on, nothing would ever happen.\n  As Senator Murray said, teachers, Governors, school boards, and \nparents are expecting us to get this job done. We can do it. The House \ndid its part last week. We can finish our work this week. Put it \ntogether and then she is correct, we want a result, not just a \npolitical speech, which means we need to have the President's signature \nin the end. So we have a bipartisan process. We are 7 years overdue. \nThis is a bill everybody in the country who cares about education wants \nus to act on. We have had a remarkable consensus on what we need to do.\n  Basically, what we are saying is that we want to keep the important \nmeasurements of student achievement so parents and teachers and \ncommunities can know how children are doing, how schools are doing, \nwhether anyone is being left behind, but we want to restore to States \nand local school boards and communities and classroom teachers the \nresponsibility for deciding what to do about the results of those tests \nand make sure they are appropriate and make sure there are not too many \ntests.\n  We believe that is the real way to improve teaching, to improve \nschools, and to have real accountability. So we have taken lots of \ndifferent opinions and we have put them together in a bill. I was \nthinking over the weekend, having a bill on elementary and secondary \neducation is like going to a football game at the University of \nTennessee. There are 100,000 people in the stands, and they all are \nexperts on football, whether it is Iowa or Washington or Tennessee.\n  Well, we are all experts--and so are most of our citizens experts on \neducation--but we need to have a consensus here. We are close to one. I \nthank Senator Murray and the majority leader and the Democratic leader \nfor creating an environment in which we so far have been able to \nsucceed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, as we speak, negotiations are ongoing \nbetween Iran and the P5+1 countries regarding one of the greatest \nthreats to global security today; that is, a potentially nuclear-\ncapable Iran. If both sides reach a final negotiated agreement, this \nbody will have to consider whether the agreement truly prevents Iran \nfrom becoming a nuclear state or whether it paves the way for the \nleading state sponsor of terror to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n  Agreeing to a bad deal would pose a serious threat to the national \nsecurity of the United States, to Israel, and our other allies. We \ncannot take this decision lightly. We should not base our votes on the \nlegacy of the President. We will be dealing with the consequences of \nthis potential agreement long after President Obama leaves office.\n  There are specific terms of any final agreement that are vital to \npreventing Iran's nuclear weapons capability. One-hundred percent \ncertainty is impossible in matters of intelligence, particularly with a \nregime like Iran's that has a history of being less than forthright \nabout its nuclear program. In fact, on June 21, the Iranian Parliament \nvoted to bar inspectors from military sites. As they were passing this \nresolution to bar inspectors from military sites, they were chanting \n``Death to America.''\n  Let's not forget that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism \nin the world. It is critical that the International Atomic Energy \nAgency be able to conduct extensive inspections at all military \nfacilities, including unannounced inspections, to ensure that Iran is \nupholding its commitments.\n  A final deal must ensure that we have verifiable evidence that Iran \nis complying with the terms of the agreement before lifting sanctions. \nA final deal must permit international inspection to occur anytime, \nanywhere. A final deal must require Iran to disclose and dismantle its \nnuclear infrastructure, its uranium stockpile, and all other aspects of \nits nuclear program as specified in six--let me repeat--six U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n  A final deal must ensure Iranians never get a nuclear weapon. If Iran \ndoes violate these terms, the deal must guarantee that strong sanctions \ngo back into place immediately. It took years to get in place the \nsanctions we have today. It was largely because of these sanctions that \nIran was forced to come to the negotiating table. The sanctions are \nworking. I would also like to address the notion that we either come to \na deal or we resort to military action. This is a false choice. In \nfact, accepting a bad deal now will make military action more likely \ndown the road. A bad deal will provide Iran with an influx of cash to \ncontinue sponsoring terrorism around the world, while failing to \nprevent them from ultimately obtaining a nuclear weapon when this deal \nexpires.\n  Like so many Montanans I have heard from, I truly hope negotiations \nare successful. However, I am concerned the that based on the framework \nagreement that we have seen so far, the final agreement will ultimately \nfail to safeguard our national security and prevent a nuclear-armed \nIran. No deal is better than a bad deal. If the final agreement the \nPresident presents falls short of the requirements I have talked about \ntoday, I will not support it.\n  Over the past month, we have now blown through four deadlines. It is \nstarting to look like Groundhog Day in Vienna.\n\n\n                             safe kids act\n\n  Madam President, on a separate note, this past week the Senate began \ndebating legislation about our Nation's educational system. In the same \nweek, we learned more about a major data breach at the Office of \nPersonnel Management, which put more than 21 million American's \npersonnel information at risk. Those events and the policy debates \nbring to light an issue that often does not gather a lot of \ninformation; that is, protecting our student's personal information and \ndata in the digital age.\n  As a father of four, this issue is particularly personal to me. To \ndate, countless schools across the United States utilize electronic \nrecords to update student information and transfer data from one school \nto another. But as the data is collected, it is important students' \nprivacy is maintained and that the data is being stored safely and \nsecurely. In 2014, a working group was formed to address the issue of \nstudent data privacy. This group produced the Student Data Privacy \nPledge, which intended to set self-imposed principles to ensure that \ninformation collected from students is kept both secure as well as \nprivate.\n  This week, I will be introducing legislation called the SAFE KIDS \nAct, that builds on these ideas by empowering the Federal Trade \nCommission to oversee and enforce the collection, storage, and usage of \ncovered information. This bill will put important reforms in place to \nprotect students privacy, to establish greater security and \ntransparency measures, and to encourage innovation among education \ntechnology providers, and better ensure accountability in keeping our \nstudents' information safe.\n  As someone who spent more than 12 years in the technology sector, I \nam excited to see technology being used in innovative ways in our \nschools. As a father of four, I also want to ensure that there are \nproper safeguards in place to protect our kids' personal data in an \nincreasingly data-driven world.\n  I also want to thank Senator Blumenthal for joining me this week to \nintroduce this important legislation to protect students' personal \ninformation and for his continued work on this issue. With that in \nmind, I will yield the floor so we can hear more from Senator \nBlumenthal on this most important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator Daines \nfor his extraordinarily valuable work on this bipartisan bill, which \nwill help protect students, help safeguard the privacy of young people, \nwhich would be considered separately from the measure now before us, \nthe Every Child Achieves Act, which will strengthen the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to ensuring that every child has access to a \nhigh-quality education.\n  The bill Senator Daines and I are offering ensures that every child \nis protected during their education from invasive and intrusive sharing \nand selling of highly private information about their educational \nprogress--all kinds of sensitive, personal data that are accumulated \nand collected by school authorities and the companies that contract \nwith them in the course of that child's education.\n  When a parent signs a take-home form permitting their children to use \na learning application in math class, for example, they have no \nassurance right now--none--regarding what information the app company \nwill collect or how the app company will protect that information. That \nkind of very personal, identifiable, confidential information is \ninadequately protected in many school systems around the country. If \nthat app company fails to protect the personal information of the \nstudent and their family, it could be stolen by hackers. It could be \nbreached. We have seen how Federal files have been breached on a scale \nthat none of us would ever have imagined--supposedly protected \ninformation--and we are talking about companies leaving vulnerable \nchildren's information potentially on the same scale--millions of \nchildren being at risk of their data being breached and stolen by \nhackers. But we are also talking about that information being bought \nand sold, exchanged by companies. The current protections against that \ncommercial exploitation are inadequate. Children and their parents and \ntheir families deserve better protection of their privacy.\n  It is a big business. It is a huge and burgeoning business for those \ncompanies. They may serve a very worthwhile purpose for many of those \nchildren and for many school authorities who need someone to organize \nand apply software to the raw information that is collected in test \nscores or other kinds of educational data. But it is not data that \nbelongs to the companies; it belongs to the student and the school \nauthorities, and it ought to be protected not only because of who owns \nit\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\nbut because of whom it belongs to. It belongs to students as a matter \nof morality, not just legality.\n  We are introducing student digital privacy legislation, the SAFE KIDS \nAct. This week Senator Daines and I will introduce it to establish \nstrong and vital protections that will give parents the peace of mind \nthey need and deserve. Our bill would prohibit companies from reselling \nstudent data--something corporations should never profit from doing. \nThe SAFE KIDS Act would also prohibit companies from using student \ndata, including a personal profile of a student, for any targeted \nadvertising. This kind of marketing goes on in our society.\n  Our legislation also requires companies that hold student data to \nenact robust protections, such as proper encryption of that data, which \nwill prevent the theft of personal information.\n  Under our bill, parents are empowered to access their children's \ninformation, request corrections of any erroneous information, and \nrequest deletion of certain student data.\n  Our bill charges the FTC with the responsibility to implement and \nenforce the SAFE KIDS Act, and it enables States to enact stronger, \nmore demanding protections if they choose to do so. It establishes a \nfloor, not a ceiling. It does not preempt stronger measures if States \nchoose to move forward.\n  This measure is in no way incompatible with the provision and \namendment on which we will vote tonight that deals with another aspect \nof this issue in establishing a commission. I support that amendment. \nThe commission would issue recommendations on a number of specific \ntopics, such as preventing targeted advertising, limiting data \nretention, and providing parents with complete information. Those \nissues are complex, and they need the kinds of studies and research the \ncommission would provide. And the results of that commission would help \nto inform the FTC regulations that would be issued under the SAFE KIDS \nAct that Senator Daines and I are introducing this week.\n  I look forward to supporting the Hatch-Markey amendment, voting for \nit, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the SAFE KIDS Act \nbecause they enable a comprehensive approach to student privacy.\n  Make no mistake--this data is in danger and so is the privacy of our \nstudents. In a world that has become enormously invasive and intrusive \nand where personal information is so much at risk, our students, \nchildren, and their families deserve this protection. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n\n                   Background Checks and Gun Violence\n\n  Madam President, I wish to talk for just a moment about the \ndisclosure last week that Dylan Roof, the alleged killer of nine \ninnocent people in Charleston, SC, was able to buy guns without first \npassing a background check. The reason, very simply, was the default-\nto-proceed loophole in the law, which allows--but does not require--\nfirearms retailers to proceed with a gun sale after 3 days if an \napplicant's background check is still pending.\n  Undoubtedly, more facts will come to light. Certain facts are unknown \nnow as we speak, but the FBI acknowledges that a completed background \ncheck would have uncovered Dylan Roof's prior arrest on a drug charge \nand his drug addiction. Those discoveries would have barred him from \npurchasing the .45-caliber handgun he used to take nine lives in that \nunspeakable, horrific tragedy.\n  In effect, Dylan Roof's exploitation of this loophole is not an \nanomaly. In the last 5 years, the default to proceed loophole has led \nfirearms retailers to proceed with 15,729 gun sales to prohibited \npersons--people who were deemed ineligible to purchase a firearm once \ntheir background checks were completed. In effect, those 15,729 people \nwere able to circumvent the law because of that loophole that enabled \nthem to do so on a default to proceed after 3 days.\n  After that default-to-proceed loophole is exploited, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives then has the difficult, \ndangerous, and often impossible job to retrieve the firearms that are \nsold. In fact, it is often impossible to even expect that they can once \nthose firearms are sold without proper recordkeeping or any \nrecordkeeping. We make that job harder every day by underfunding and \nhamstringing the work of the ATF in our appropriations bills. That \ncreates that impossible task for them.\n  Responsible gun retailers can act today. The law allows retailers to \ndecide whether to permit gun sales to proceed after that 3-day default \nperiod has elapsed. They have a duty to ensure that their products do \nnot get into the hands of dangerous individuals. They have that moral \nduty. They have that social responsibility.\n  In 2008, Walmart, which is the Nation's largest gun store, agreed not \nto transfer firearms without a background check even if the 3 days have \npassed without it. The short-term inconvenience to retailers is \nminimal. In the vast majority of cases, a background check is completed \nwithin minutes and the retailer knows whether they may proceed with the \nsale.\n  After the horror visited on the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, no \nresponsible gun retailer should give the benefit of the doubt and hand \nover a gun without a definitive completion of that background check.\n  Over the weekend, my colleague Senator Murphy and I urged the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to immediately review this failure in our \nbackground check system and potential remedies, lest this legislative \nbody's silence on the matter be taken as a consent on the repeated \nfailures we have witnessed. In the long run, this system must be made \nas effective and error proof as possible, and it should be extended to \nsales not covered now by the law.\n  As Senator Murphy and I and many of our colleagues in the Senate have \nurged consistently and repeatedly, the failure to adopt a \ncomprehensive, universal background check system is inexcusable, but we \nalso have to make sure loopholes in the current law are eliminated, as \nthe FBI and the Department of Justice have recommended, by extending \nthat 3-day time period and otherwise increasing the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the background check system.\n  Senator Murphy and I will be taking additional steps to try to make \nit more effective. Gun retailers can step up in the meantime to stop \ndangerous people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons and \ntaking lives--innocent lives--as happened in Charleston. They can, very \nsimply, stop selling guns to people who have not passed that background \ncheck even if the 3 days have expired, even if that default period has \ncome and gone. They can do that on their own.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, including continuing \nthe great work Senator Murphy and I have sought to do together in \nmaking America safer and better and improving our background check \nsystem and making sure commonsense, sensible gun violence prevention \nmeasures become the law of the land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, first, I compliment the Senator from Connecticut on \nhis initial statement related to student privacy. I think it is an \nessential element to clarify that privacy is meant to protect but not \ninadvertently inhibit our ability to give help to those who desperately \nneed it.\n  Certainly, I wish to associate myself with his remarks on doing \nsomething about the background check, the timely response. I think the \nmassacre at Emanuel AME Church deeply troubled the Nation, and the very \nleast that can come out of this is not only the flag coming down and \nall that meant, but other barriers to safety should come down as well. \nI want the Senator from Connecticut to know that he has my admiration \nand my support.\n\n\n                      Protecting Federal Employees\n\n  Mr. President, while we are waiting for the vote, in approximately 15 \nminutes, I know Senator Kaine will be coming to the floor to talk about \nan important postsecondary education remediation reform, but I want to \ncomment on the 21 million Federal employees whose personnel records \nhave been hacked by--it looks like--a foreign government. I am not \ngoing to go into the who and the attributing of who did the hacking, \nbut I do want to say that, first of all, those Federal employees need \nto feel they have a government on\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\ntheir side to now protect them. We should have protected them in the \nfirst place with the security of dot-gov and certainly our personnel \nrecords.\n  Now, in addition to a bill I have introduced and cosponsored with my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, where we have put in \nadditional credit protection, credit monitoring, and liability \nprotection, I have also sent a letter to the President today.\n  The President of the United States is not only the Commander in Chief \nbut he is the Chief Executive Officer of something called the U.S \nGovernment dot-gov, and therefore, OPM is his HR operation. With all \ndue respect to our President, I have called upon him, on behalf of the \n300,000 Federal employees and Federal retirees who I have in my State, \nthat they take additional and immediate action to provide lifetime \ncredit monitoring, lifetime credit protection and unlimited liability, \nand that we also get a new contractor.\n  I know we want to get a new contractor that does security checks, but \nI want a new contractor that is supposed to be answering the phone. I \nwant a new contractor answering the phone and responding to my Federal \nemployees, and I have conveyed that to the new Acting Director of OPM, \nBeth Cobert. I think she has a lot of skill and a lot of knowledge. I \nknow she comes to the White House from the private sector, McKinsey & \nCompany, but I conveyed to her that it is outrageous what is happening \nto Federal employees. They try to call to get help to find out what has \nhappened to them, and they are on the phone for 1 hour or 2 hours, and \nwhen they finally make contact, they get disconnected.\n  These are our Federal employees, who we count on, many of whom to \nprotect the Nation--many of whom to protect the Nation. Our cyber \nshield is down to protect them, and we are also not protecting them in \nterms of our response to our cyber shield being down.\n  Who are these Federal employees in Maryland? Well, first of all, they \nare people who work at the National Institutes of Health trying to find \ncures from dreaded diseases and all of the laboratory staff and so on \nwho support them. Or they are over at FDA or they are over at Goddard \nSpace Flight Center helping to manage the Hubble telescope. In addition \nto that, we have people involved in and also who are direct hands-on \nwith national security.\n  Maryland is the home to many Foreign Service officers. They not only \nhave the information about their own Social Security numbers and their \nown health information but that of their spouses and their minor \nchildren. We are also the home to the National Security Agency. Most of \nthe National Security Agency is made up of civilian DOD personnel with \nthe highest of security clearances.\n  So my feeling is we have to get in there really quickly to protect \nthem. We have to also do something about this contractor--that he ups \nhis game or we tell him up and out. Up your game or up and out.\n  The third thing is the President really needs to convene an all-\nhands-on-deck on how we are going to protect dot-gov in this country.\n  There will be more to say about this bill and so on, but I see \nSenator Kaine is now on the floor to discuss and present his \npostsecondary remediation amendment, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland, and I \nsecond the comments she has made about the status of our employees who \nhave been jeopardized. I am excited to work together on the legislation \nintroduced last Friday to provide them some protection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2118\n\n  Mr. President, I do rise on behalf of an amendment that will be voted \non within the next hour, Kaine amendment No. 2118, which is a \nbipartisan amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. It is an \namendment to promote career readiness indicators and make sure our \nstudents, when they finish high school, are not just ready for college \nbut they are ready for careers.\n  This is part of a series of amendments I have worked on in a \nbipartisan basis, some of which have been included in the underlying \nbill and one of which was passed as a floor amendment last week.\n  I thank the managers, Senators Alexander and Murray, for working \ntogether to support this bipartisan amendment. We need to work to make \nsure we help all of our students graduate from high school ready for \npostsecondary education and the workforce.\n  Over the past 40 years, the percentage of jobs that require some form \nof postsecondary education has doubled from 29 percent to now nearly 60 \npercent, but the education system hasn't kept pace with the demand for \na more highly educated and skilled workforce. More importantly, we need \nto define what that is--highly educated and skilled--to incorporate \ncareer and technical training, which, for a variety of reasons in the \nlast generation or so, was sort of an undervalued part of the spectrum \nof American public education.\n  Within a very few years--by 2020, when our pages are now going to be \nout in the workforce--two-thirds of jobs will require at least some \nform of postsecondary education. But projections demonstrate that as a \nnation we will fall short by nearly 5 million workers. We are already \nseeing these shortages and having to deal with them, for example, \nthrough specialty visas. That is fine for the economy, but wouldn't it \nbe better if we could train those in school right now to be skilled in \nthe areas where the jobs are needed?\n  The career readiness amendment addresses this problem by \nencouraging--not requiring but encouraging--States to include in their \naccountability systems the types of indicators that demonstrate \nstudents are ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. These \nindicators would include State-designed measures to integrate rigorous \nacademics, work-based learning and career and technical education, or \ntechnical skill attainment and placement. That will be the core of this \nbill.\n  By doing this, we send a strong message to schools, businesses, \nparents, and students that it is critical to be prepared for the \nworkforce of the 21st century regardless of postsecondary education \nplans. As I have talked to educators, counselors, and parents, they \nhave often commented upon the degree to which career and technical \ntraining has sort of been downgraded and that students aren't \nencouraged in that area, even though there are great professions to \nachieve in this area.\n  Under the amendment, schools and districts would have an incentive to \npartner with businesses and industries to provide career pathways for \nstudents. It is important for State accountability systems. I say this \nas a Virginian who is very proud of the Virginia accountability system. \nIt is currently kind of managed by my wife, who is the secretary of \neducation in Virginia. But it is important for these systems to measure \nand reward schools for helping students earn industry-recognized \ncredentials or earn credit for college while in high school.\n  Just as an example, if you are a Virginia student and you take the \nVirginia Standards of Learning Test and you pass, that doesn't \nnecessarily mean anything in North Carolina, and much less Oregon. But \nif you are a Virginia high school student and you pass a Cisco Systems \nadministrator exam, you can take that credential, move to Oregon and \nget a job tomorrow. These industry credentials are, in many ways, more \nknown, more valued, and more portable than high school credentials \nState by State.\n  Schools across the country are providing this kind of important \nlearning opportunity. Here are just two examples, and then I will \nconclude. In Alexandria, just across the Potomac, the Academy of \nFinance at T.C. Williams High School instructs students in money \nmanagement skills, financial planning, and business development. \nStudents complete a 3-year sequential program, start working at an on-\nsite credit union in the school, and they get early college credit for \nthat financial literacy.\n  At the other end of the State--in southwest Virginia, in Vinton, near \nthe city of Roanoke--William Byrd High School, after struggling during \nthe 1990s to prepare students for college and career, sought input from \nnearby businesses and implemented programs in engineering, \ncommunication, business, and marketing to match local job needs. These \npartnerships are helpful\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nin helping students find jobs, and they have also engendered student \ninterest in the curriculum. The school has a 90-percent graduation \nrate, and 83 percent of students go on to postsecondary education.\n  I want to thank Senators Portman and Baldwin--I think Senator Portman \nwas planning on speaking, and may still--for their involvement and \nworking together with me on this particular amendment and on the Senate \nCTE Caucus.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative, and \nagain, I thank the bill managers for working together with us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to \nmake a presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2080\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of an amendment I have \noffered along with my friend, the junior Senator from Massachusetts. \nThis amendment advances an important priority: protecting student \nprivacy in an era of vast data collection and tenuous security \nprotections.\n  Advances in education technology are revolutionizing the way students \nlearn in today's classroom. Going forward, it is important to balance \nthe need for innovation to allow students to take advantage of the new \nlearning tools with the need to make sure children's private \ninformation is protected. We must also ensure continuing to improve \neducation through research, while not necessarily allowing researchers \nand their employers access to sensitive data.\n  To this end, our amendment sets up a commission to come back with \nrecommendations for how to update our outdated Federal education \nprivacy law. The commission's membership consists of experts, parents, \nteachers, technology professionals, researchers, and State officials--a \nbroad array of leaders capable of providing diverse perspectives on \nthese issues. Within 270 days, the commission is required to report to \nCongress on the current mechanisms for transparency, parental \ninvolvement, research usage, and third-party vendor usage as well as \nprovide recommendations on how to improve the law to better protect \nstudents. As we seek to identify the best ways of protecting student \ndata, this commission will serve to outline some commonsense and \neffective options for reform that we ought to consider.\n  This amendment has received support from a wide variety of \norganizations from Microsoft to the National PTA to the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, demonstrating how this is a commonsense, bipartisan idea that \nwe can all support. I urge my colleagues to support this important \ninnovation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the \nquestion now occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 2080, offered by the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for Mr. Hatch.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there has been some conversation on \nthe floor. We are working out the order of proceeding.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wicker and Senator Shaheen be \nrecognized first for a colloquy, followed by remarks by Senator Brown, \nfollowed by remarks by myself, followed by remarks by Senator Baldwin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Presiding \nOfficer, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are still on the bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nShaheen and I be allowed to enter into a colloquy concerning the 20th \nanniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              20th Anniversary of the Srebrenica Massacre\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from New \nHampshire today to speak about a moving and important commemoration \nthat she and I attended over the weekend. We were part of the U.S. \ndelegation led by former President Bill Clinton that traveled to Bosnia \nand Herzegovina to remember the victims of the Srebrenica massacre 20 \nyears ago. We were honored to be joined in this delegation by \nRepresentative Peter King from New York, and I think it is significant \nthat former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was part of that \ndelegation.\n  On July 11, 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were \nbrutalized and murdered by Serbian forces that overran a United Nations \nsafe haven during the Bosnian war. It was the worst massacre on \nEuropean soil since the horrors of World War II.\n  Today, Senator Shaheen and I wear green and white flowers on our \nlapels. These flowers were crocheted by Srebrenica mothers and widows \nin remembrance of the lives that were lost 20 years ago. The white is \nsaid to symbolize innocence, and the green represents hope. It is said \nto be significant that the center is green because hope remains central \nto the country's future and to the region's future.\n  Two decades provide us with a helpful benchmark for reflecting on the \nprogress that has been made and on the\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nprogress that needs to be made. The decades have certainly not erased \nthe deep scars left by the atrocities at Srebrenica, but the hurt \ncontinues to heal.\n  International courts have recognized the massacre as a genocide, and \na number of the perpetrators have been imprisoned. Peace is now present \nin the Western Balkans and we need to do what we can to help maintain \nthis peace. The Bosnian and Herzegovinian leadership is now applying \nfor membership in the European Union. We wish them well in making the \nprogress that will be necessary to attain this status.\n  Tough decisions still need to be made by the leadership, by the \nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to governance, \ncorruption, and combating extremes. There is still way too much \nrhetoric that centers on ethnicity and continues to divide Bosnians \nrather than unite them. But we can celebrate the fact that this region \nis no longer home to the suffering and violence that predated the \nhistoric Dayton Accords, and we can celebrate the contribution and \nachievement of the Americans in reaching the Dayton Accords and in \ngetting us to where we are now with two decades of peace.\n  I know that these views are shared by my colleague from New \nHampshire. At this point, perhaps she would like to join in this \ncolloquy.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Wicker from \nMississippi in talking about what we saw and heard when we were in \nBosnia.\n  Unfortunately, the story that came out about that inspiring \ncommemoration was about the attack by some of the Bosniaks who were \nattending on the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vucic, who had \nattended the ceremony.\n  But the larger story was one of reconciliation. The Bosniak mayor of \nSrebrenica, Camil Durakovic, condemned the attackers, and he was joined \nby the Tripartite Presidents in condemning the attackers. After the \nattack, the Serbian Prime Minister said that it should not distract \nattention from the innocent victims of Srebrenica. He said that his \n``arms of reconciliation remain stretched towards the Bosniaks.'' \nFortunately, we heard the same from the mayor of Srebrenica, who \nactually had invited the Prime Minister.\n  I am very proud of Mayor Durakovic because he is actually a Bosnian-\nAmerican whose family fled from Srebrenica in July of 1995, and they \nsettled in New Hampshire. He went to high school there, and he got a \ndegree from Southern New Hampshire University. He returned to \nSrebrenica in 2005 and was elected mayor in 2012.\n  Aside from that isolated, unfortunate incident with the Prime \nMinister, the ceremony was a solemn tribute and remembrance to the \nvictims of Srebrenica. There was a spirit of unity and harmony. The \ntheme again and again was of reconciliation.\n  As my colleague points out, it is particularly important for us to \ncontinue to support this reconciliation, for us to continue to support \nBosnia and Herzegovina and their efforts to continue to look west to \njoin the EU. Across many centuries, the Balkans has been a flashpoint \nfor conflicts that have spread to the rest of Europe and the entire \nworld. In fact, 101 years ago next month, World War I began with the \nassassination of Archduke Ferdinand right in Sarajevo. We walked by the \nblock where he was assassinated.\n  As we have seen most recently in Greece and as we are seeing in the \nBalkans and in other countries in Eastern Europe, the Russians are \nquick to exploit any trouble in the southeast corner of Europe in order \nto spread their influence and destabilize the West. Wouldn't my \ncolleague agree that it is important for us in the United States to \njoin the EU in supporting the Bosniaks, the Serbs, the Croatians, the \nMuslims, the Orthodox Christians, and the Roman Catholics so that they \ncan come together and show the world that we really can create a multi-\nethnic, multi-sectarian state that can serve as a model for the Middle \nEast and for countries around the world?\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I do agree. I would contrast the \nmagnanimous statements of the Tripresidency and the gesture of the \nSerbian President in attending with the disappointing actions of the \nRussian leadership, under the leadership of President Putin, in \nactually vetoing a Security Council resolution simply to commemorate \nthe 20th anniversary as a genocide. Russia refused to accept a well-\nestablished fact, confirmed by international courts such as the \nInternational Court of Justice, such as the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. They vetoed--they were the only \nvote against it, but it acted as a veto--thus keeping the United \nNations officially from going on record as saying this was a genocide \nand that these acts should be condemned. Such defiance is a disservice \nnot only to the victims at Srebrenica but also to relations in the area \ngoing forward. I would just contrast that with the very brave step on \nthe part of the Serbian President, coming to Srebrenica and being part \nof the commemorative ceremony.\n  I will tell my colleagues that former President Clinton spoke on \nbehalf of this Republican and spoke on behalf of Democrats alike, \nmaking a very instructive and constructive address at the occasion, \nspecifically commending the Serbian President.\n  I would say, with regard to the rock throwing incident and what the \nPresident of Serbia actually did, his glasses were broken, and he and \nmembers of his delegation were brought to their knees. I would say that \nif the 50 or so people who threw those rocks had heard the remarks \ninside the ceremony, perhaps they would not have felt so bitter as to \nthrow those rocks. I know there are wounds that need to be healed. But \nI think the conciliatory words inside, if they had been broadcast to \nthe entire crowd, would have perhaps caused that incident, which got \nall the publicity, not to happen.\n  This was about 50 people causing a disturbance in a crowd of, I would \nsay, about 5,000 people gathered outside. It was a very important \nceremony--actually, a funeral, you might say.\n  So I would have to just say that the Russian leadership really should \nbe ashamed of standing in the way of international recognition of this \ngenocide. They thought they were doing their Serbian neighbors a favor, \nbut, on the other hand, the Serbian President stepped forward in a very \nbrave way to create unity in this region, and I think my colleague \nwould agree with that.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely, and I know Senator Wicker shared my \ngratitude as we walked through the streets of Sarajevo and as we met \npeople in Srebrenica for the appreciation they showed the United States \nfor our actions in helping to end that awful war in Bosnia and for our \nactions in supporting Bosnia as they try to look westward and as they \ntry to keep their country moving forward, addressing the corruption and \nthe democracy issues they face. I think it is in our interest as \nAmericans to support those efforts to help them, as they continue to \nmove their country forward, in every way we can.\n  Mr. WICKER. The Senator from New Hampshire is exactly right. It is in \nthe United States' interest that we care about the Balkans, that we \ncare about Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe it to the U.S. troops who \nwere deployed there in 1995 and later, who kept the peace and made it \nwork. There is no country on the face of the Earth that could have done \nthat but the United States of America. We owe it to the memory of the \nleadership, not only of President Clinton, who basically hosted the \nDayton Accords in the United States of America, but also Republicans \nsuch as Speaker Gingrich. It was Gingrich and Clinton who joined \ntogether and convinced this government to support the Dayton Agreement \nand support the necessary deployment to make sure this worked.\n  As the Senator pointed out, we owe it to history going forward to \nremember that World War I broke out in Sarajevo, that the events \nleading up to World War II largely occurred in the Balkans, and to do \nwhat we can in the interest of U.S. citizens to say that this will not \nagain be a flashpoint for conflict in Europe and conflict \ninternationally.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I know the Senator shares my views that we owe it to \nthe victims of Srebrenica. I look forward to continuing to work with \nSenator Wicker to do everything we can to support the efforts in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\n  Mr. WICKER. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to make \nsure\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nthat this peace holds, to make sure that progress is made on the ethnic \nissues--that we give Bosnians and Herzegovinians every reason to \ncontinue to want to embrace Europe and to embrace the United States and \nto embrace fairness and anticorruption and all the work that it is \ngoing to take there.\n  I appreciate the delegation. I appreciate Secretary Albright. I \nappreciate President Clinton leading the delegation. And I appreciate \nthe indulgence of our fellow Senators in hearing this colloquy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                   American Workers and Overtime Pay\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, too many Americans are still struggling in \ntoday's economy. Despite comments by some candidates for President, \nAmericans work hard but still have trouble getting by. We know that \nAmericans on average are working longer hours than workers in almost \nevery other rich country in the world--significantly longer hours. \nSimply, they are not getting the pay they have earned and the \ncompensation and the lifestyle to which they aspire and have worked so \nhard toward.\n  For many workers, it feels as though the harder and longer they work, \nthe less they have to show for it. And they are not imagining things. \nSince the 1970s, middle class wages have been stagnant while the number \nof hours spent on the job has gone up. In short, Americans are working \nmore for less.\n  The middle class has shrunk in every State in this country. The Pew \nResearch Center studies show that the share of adults in middle-income \nhouseholds has fallen from 61 percent in 1970 to 51 percent in 2013. In \nOhio the share of families that are middle class is now below 50 \npercent. We need to do more to build on-ramps for middle-class hard-\nworking Americans instead of saying that Americans are not working hard \nenough, instead of asking workers to do more and more for less money.\n  It is not uncommon today for salaried workers--salaried workers, not \nmillionaire salaried workers but lower income and middle-income \nsalaried workers--to work 50-, 60-, 70-hour weeks without getting a \ncent in overtime. When workers put in extra time, it should be \nreflected in their paychecks. Right now a number of employers are \ngaming the system to avoid paying overtime, and American workers are \nlosing wages as a result.\n  It is past time for overtime hours to mean overtime pay again. That \nis why my colleagues and I sent a letter to the President earlier this \nyear urging the administration to restore the strength of overtime \npayrolls. Forty years ago, we as a nation decided that most workers, \nwhether they were paid hourly or a salary, should receive overtime pay \nwhen working more than 40 hours a week, but the teeth in that law have \nbeen eroded. The strength of that law, the power of that law, and the \neffectiveness of that law have been eroded over the past 40 years.\n  In 1975, 65 percent of all salaried workers were covered by overtime \npay rules. Currently, just 8 percent of salaried workers are covered. \nThat could be a night manager in a fast food restaurant making $30,000 \na year classified as management--classified because that person is \nsalaried--and asked to work more than 40 hours and still only making \n$30,000 a year. So 40 years ago, 65 percent of salaried workers would \nhave been paid time and a half for those extra hours beyond 40 for that \nnight manager, but today they don't get paid over time. They may work \n50 hours, they may work 60 hours, but they simply are not compensated \nfor it.\n  The salary threshold of $23,600 a year has remained static for \ndecades because it hasn't been indexed for inflation. So in 1975, \nsomebody making $23,000 a year was paid overtime for beyond 40 hours. \nToday someone making $23,000 a year isn't. If they are making $30,000 \nor $40,000, they aren't paid overtime. So we see what has happened. The \nsalary threshold was put in place to exempt highly paid executives, but \nbecause it hasn't increased in 40 years--they didn't build an inflation \nnumber into it or a cost of living adjustment--instead of hitting CEOs \nand lawyers who shouldn't get paid overtime in hours excess of 40, \nworkers earning as little as $455 a week now go without overtime pay \njust because they are salaried and just because they are called \nmanagement. It allows employers the opportunity to put somebody on \nsalary, work them many more hours, and then fail to compensate them.\n  The current threshold is now so low that it is below the poverty line \nfor a family of four. So a salaried worker making a few dollars below \nthe poverty line and working 50 or 60 hours doesn't get paid overtime. \nThat is actually what has happened. The American public is starting to \nunderstand this, and that is why so many people are calling on the \nPresident to do this.\n  Overtime pay should be available to everyone who puts in the extra \ntime--not just those earning a poverty level wage. That is why I \napplaud the Department of Labor's proposed rule that would strengthen \novertime standards and take them back--not quite even as good, but we \nare pretty satisfied with this--to the 1975 level. The new rule will \nmore than double the salary threshold for earning overtime pay from \n$23,000 annually to $50,000. That would mean that 40 percent of \nsalaried workers are now eligible for overtime. In my State, as a \nresult of this rule, 160,000 Ohioans would get a raise, as would 5 \nmillion Americans in States such as Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, \nand all over this country.\n  This means more money in the pockets of American workers. The rule \nproposes lengthening the threshold to the 40th percentile of income for \nfull-time salaried workers instead of setting a raw number. This means \nthat the strength of the rule is less likely to erode over time. Not \nonly will this rule help families make ends meet, it also boosts \nconsumer spending, creates jobs, and bolsters the American economy.\n  Just like raising the minimum wage, when more money is put in the \npocket of somebody making $8 an hour or $9 an hour or when you put more \nmoney in the pocket of a midlevel manager making $30,000 a year in a \nfast-food restaurant--if you put more money in their pocket--they are \ngoing to spend that money. They are not going to invest that money in a \nSwiss bank account. They are going to spend that money in the \ncommunity, buy more groceries, go into the hardware stores and do more \nto fix up their houses and do more to generate economic activity and \ncreate jobs for our economy.\n  But there is still more we need to do to support American workers. \nThis is an important step toward building our middle class. There is \nstill more we need to do to support American workers. We need to give \nhourly workers a raise by raising the minimum wage. The legislation a \nnumber of us on the floor have worked on, the Raise the Wage Act, would \nincrease the minimum wage incrementally to $12 an hour by 2020, giving \na raise to 1 million Ohioans, 28 million people across the country--1 \nmillion Ohioans.\n  Tipped workers shouldn't have to struggle to get by. They deserve to \nearn a living wage to help put food on the table. Lots of people in \nthis body are unaware, as some Americans are. People here should be \nmore aware of it, but people here tend not to know people that work in \ndiners. People who work in diners as waitresses and waiters in diners \ncan be paid as little as $2.13 an hour. The minimum wage for working in \na diner in a so-called tipped wage or for the people who push \nwheelchairs in airports or in some case for many other kinds of jobs is \n$2.13 an hour. It is not $7.25, which is the minimum wage for everyone \nelse. That is why we need to move on raising the minimum wage, on \nbringing the tipped wage up to at least 70 percent of the minimum wage.\n  Workers will be happier and they will be more productive when they \nare healthy, when they are making decent salaries, making a little bit \nbetter wages. Americans also deserve a day off when they get sick. \nForty-three million Americans--2 million in my State--have no paid sick \nleave at all. They are faced with impossible choices. Do they stay home \nto care for a sick child or go to work so they can put food on the \ntable?\n  Workers are happier and more productive when they are healthy. \nGuaranteeing paid sick leave would save precious health care resources, \nit would give employers safe and stable workplaces, and it would give \nfamilies peace of mind. It would mean that\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nworkers are not going to work when they are sick, infecting other \nworkers and affecting productivity and profits at that business. That \nis why we should pass the Healthy Family Act. Overtime is important. \nMinimum wage is important. The Healthy Family Act for sick leave days \nis important. All are steps that we need to support hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  We know what has happened in the economy the last 10 years. We know \nthe wealthiest 5 percent are doing better and better and better. \nProfits are up for companies. Executives are making bigger and bigger \nbonuses. But working class, lower-middle-class workers are simply not \ngetting ahead or even able to tread water to stay even, for that \nmatter. The minimum wage will help, paying overtime will help, and the \nHealthy Family Act will help.\n  The Toledo Blade put it well last week: ``America's widening income \ngap isn't an inescapable outcome of the free market, but a political \nchoice that can be mitigated with intelligent public policies.''\n  This is a political choice. We have seen this body and the body on \nthe other side of the Capitol continue to give more tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans. We won't invest in infrastructure, we won't \ninvest in working families, we won't help raise wages, we won't help \nwith overtime, and we won't help with workers who just need a few sick \ndays off, as people in bodies such as this typically have.\n  I urge the Department of Labor to finalize their strong overtime \nproposal as quickly as possible. It will make a huge difference in the \nlives of millions of Americans.\n  With that, I yield back.\n\n\n 20th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations Between \n                     the United States and Vietnam\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to recognize a historic \nmilestone: the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic \nrelations between the United States and Vietnam. This occasion has some \npersonal significance for me and my family. My father served as Deputy \nAmbassador to Vietnam; in effect, the chief operating officer of that \nconflict. I lived with him in that country for several months during \nthe Vietnam war. If he were alive today, he would be proud of the work \nboth countries have done to reconcile our past.\n  It took immense courage on both sides to look beyond the scars of \nthat war and envision a future in which our two countries could become \npartners and friends. No one embodies this courage more than our friend \nJohn McCain, who played a major role in establishing diplomatic \nrelations between our two countries, and Secretary of State John Kerry, \nthen a Senator, who was his Democratic partner.\n  Given Senator McCain's experience as a prisoner in Vietnam, his \nsubsequent efforts to strengthen the peace and forgiveness between our \ntwo Nations are an enduring inspiration, the power of which I was \nprivileged to see firsthand when I traveled with Senator McCain to \nHanoi in 2012 and 2014.\n  Senator McCain said 20 years ago, ``I believe it is my duty to \nencourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our \ntragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and the \nVietnamese people.''\n  Today, the American and the Vietnamese people can be proud of the \nprogress made to forge a lasting peace and friendship. Two years ago, \nPresident Obama and Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang launched the \nU.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership, opening a new phase of \nbilateral relations between our nations based on mutual respect and \ncommon interests. I met recently with Nguyen Phu Trong, the General \nSecretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to \ndiscuss our shared interests and opportunities for closer collaboration \non a range of issues, including regional stability, economic \ncooperation, and the lingering human and environmental consequences of \nthat war.\n  I had the honor of meeting with General Secretary Trong while \ntraveling to Vietnam with Senator McCain last summer. I am pleased he \nhas made this historic visit to the United States. I am hopeful Vietnam \nwill bring our interests and values into closer alignment, particularly \non human rights, the rights of civil society, transparency, and good \ngovernance issues.\n  To that end, I look forward to working together to achieve closer \nties. As the United States and Vietnam continue to deepen our \nrelationship, we should continue to address the legacies of that war, \nparticularly the health effects and environmental contamination \nassociated with Agent Orange and other herbicides. Here at home, we \ntake our commitment to caring for our veterans very seriously. Although \nthe war has ended, many American veterans and their families still \nbattle a range of health problems and serious diseases associated with \ntheir service in Vietnam.\n  We must ensure that veterans get the care they need to combat the \nlong-term health problems related to exposure to Agent Orange. Those \ncontamination and health problems are also serious in Vietnam. I am \ngrateful for Senator Leahy's leadership on the Appropriations \nCommittee, which has enabled the United States to pursue remediation \nprojects to clean up the dioxin contamination at Da Nang International \nAirport and other hot spots and to support related health and \ndisability programs.\n  I urge all of us that we continue to support these initiatives which \nstrengthen our bilateral relationship. Considerable work remains. \nAccording to initial assessments of Bien Hoa Air Base, the \ncontamination there is more severe and cleanup is expected to be more \ncomplex and costly than at Da Nang. In addition, health-related \nproblems and disabilities persist in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or \notherwise contaminated by dioxin.\n  In 2008, actor, advocate, and long-time friend Dick Hughes brought \nthis issue closely to my attention and he has shared with me compelling \nstories about Vietnamese families who have been affected by diseases \nand disabilities related to Agent Orange exposure. Some of the \nsuffering ascribed to Agent Orange has been harrowing and \nheartbreaking. Dick has years of experience working on humanitarian \nissues in Vietnam and is a compelling witness to that suffering.\n  We first met when I was a teenager in Saigon and Dick had established \na program called the Shoeshine Boys Project, to care for homeless \nchildren who had been orphaned or left alone during the war. He brought \nthem together and sent them on the streets with shoeshine boxes as a \nway of making a living and finding something they could do and provided \nthem care and a home when they came home at nightfall.\n  Over 8 years, that project helped thousands of children in cities all \nacross Vietnam. Dick attributes the success of that project to close \npartnerships forged with local communities and the project's management \nby Vietnamese citizens. When Dick returned to the United States, he \ncontinued to advocate for postwar humanitarian causes and he started a \nfoundation to raise awareness about the effects of Agent Orange on the \nVietnamese population. Dick remains a trusted friend and tireless \nadvocate to the Vietnamese people.\n  As our two countries work together on a new and more engaged future, \nwe should expand our efforts to improve the health and well-being of \nthe Vietnamese people. We can learn from Dick's experience about the \npower of partnership and the value of local leadership, and together we \ncan continue to repair the damage--physical, psychological, and \npolitical--of the path we share.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2093\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Student \nNon-Discrimination Act, which Senator Franken is offering as an \namendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. The Student Non-\nDiscrimination Act would help protect our students from bullying, \nharassment, and discrimination. I am a proud cosponsor of this \namendment and hopeful the Senate will agree to this amendment this \nweek.\n  As we consider the Every Child Achieves Act, as we did in committee \nback in April, and as we have discussed it on the floor over the last \nweek, I have been guided by a core principle: that this law should \nensure that every\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nchild, regardless of his or her background, regardless of his or her \nfamily's income, has access to the opportunities provided by a great \neducation, a high-quality education.\n  Now, part of providing that opportunity is ensuring that every \nstudent is able to come to school and succeed in an environment that is \nsafe, supportive, and free from discrimination. While the Every Child \nAchieves Act helps advance opportunity for students in numerous ways, \nit falls short in addressing a significant problem limiting the \nachievement of some of our most vulnerable students.\n  Unfortunately, there are still far too many stories of harassment, of \nbullying, and of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender students at the hands of their peers but also, sadly, \nsometimes at the hands of their teachers or administrators as well. \nThere remains no Federal law that explicitly protects these students \nand provides them and their families with recourse when they face \nbullying and harassment that limits their educational opportunities.\n  No student can achieve if he cannot feel safe at school. No student \nwill excel if she spends each day in fear of just being herself. I hear \nfrom so many students in my State about the need for us to stand up \nagainst bullying. For example, a young woman in Madison wrote to me, \nand I quote from her letter:\n\n       [A]s a student myself, I hear the words ``gay'', ``faggot, \n     ``queer'' and others get tossed around . . . daily, and I do \n     what I can to deter these words from being used in negative \n     ways by others, but one voice can't make much of a \n     difference. . . . I'm asking you to help raise awareness in \n     schools anyway that you can.\n\n  I would tell this young woman in Madison that her voice speaking out \non this matter can make a difference. Another young woman from \nKimberly, WI, contacted me about her friend who committed suicide after \nsuffering bullying. She wrote:\n\n       He made everyone else come alive and be the better people \n     that they were inside. But he killed himself because he \n     thought he had no way out of the pain, no way to make those \n     kids stop, other than to make sure he was not living anymore.\n\n  Across the country, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender or LGBT \nyouth experience bullying harassment at school more frequently than \ntheir non-LGBT peers. According to a national survey by the Gay, \nLesbian & Straight Education Network, in the past year, nearly three-\nquarters of students were verbally harassed and more than 16 percent \nwere physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation.\n  More than 60 percent of students who reported an incident of \nharassment said that school staff did nothing in response. It is \nunsurprising, then, that nearly one-third of students reported missing \nschool at least once in the last month because they did not feel safe. \nI believe we must fix this immediately. That is why I support including \nSenator Franken's Student Non-Discrimination Act as an amendment to the \nEvery Child Achieves Act currently being debated before the Senate. \nSenator Franken's amendment would provide real and strong protections \nfor LGBT students in public, elementary, and secondary schools. It \nwould also provide recourse through the Department of Education and, if \nnecessary, in the courts to help students vindicate their rights.\n  This amendment is closely modeled on existing Federal education \nprotections, which have helped ensure that students have remedies when \nthey face unfair treatment based on race, ethnicity, sex, and \ndisability. LGBT students are just as deserving of the opportunity to \nsucceed in the school environment that is supportive and nurturing \nrather than discriminatory and unwelcoming.\n  If we are truly to ensure through this legislation that every child \nachieves, we must act to address the bullying, harassment, and \ndiscrimination that limits educational opportunities of too many \nstudents. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims has been \nreferred to as the ``keeper of the Nation's conscience'' and ``the \npeople's court.'' This court was created by Congress approximately 160 \nyears ago and embodies the constitutional principle that individuals \nhave rights against their government. As President Lincoln has said, \n``It is as much the duty of Government to render prompt justice against \nitself, in favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same between \nprivate individuals.'' That is what this court does. It allows citizens \nto seek prompt justice against our government.\n  The court's jurisdiction is authorized by statute, and it primarily \nhears monetary claims against the U.S. Government deriving from the \nConstitution, Federal statutes, executive regulations, and civilian or \nmilitary contracts. The fact that the Court of Federal Claims is an \narticle I court, as opposed to an article III court, does not render \nany of the cases that it hears any less significant.\n  For example, the court has presided over such important cases as the \nsavings and loan crisis of the 1980s and the World War II internment of \nJapanese Americans. It also presides over civilian and military pay \nclaims and money claims under the Fifth Amendment's takings clause.\n  The takings clause under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution \nprovides: ``nor shall private property be taken for public use without \njust compensation.'' As a result of this court's jurisdiction over \ntakings' claims, it considers cases such as the auto bailout suits \nagainst General Motors and Chrysler--companies who were required to \nterminate agreements with franchisees as a condition of receiving \nFederal bailout money. The court also resolves disputes that critically \nimpact the environment and our economy, such as those involving the \ntaking of wetlands to create solid waste landfills and disputes over \nwater and drainage rights by agricultural landowners.\n  Last week, the chief judge of the court sent a letter informing the \nSenate that despite the court's shortage of\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\njudicial officers, its caseload continues unabated. She wrote that \n``[t]he statutory requirements dictating deadlines for certain types of \ncases unique to our court, including government contract disputes--some \nof which involve national defense and national security--remain in \neffect. The dollar amounts in dispute in our currently pending cases, \nwhich are often an indication of the complexity of the underlying \nissues, are in the billions of dollars. At least three different cases \non the court's pending docket reflect a demand for damages greater than \nforty billion dollars.''\n  This is no ordinary court. The Senate Republicans' insistence on \ndelaying the confirmation of qualified nominees to the Court of Federal \nClaims harms its ability to resolve issues of national importance in a \ntimely and just manner. Since February 2013, the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims has been operating with several vacancies. Only 11 of the 16 \nseats on the court are occupied by active judges.\n  We could have a court working at full strength if we confirm the five \npending on the Senate Executive Calendar. All five of them were all \nnominated more than a year ago and have twice been voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. I have heard no objections \nto any of the five nominees to this court. There is no good reason to \ndelay filling these vacancies.\n  This is especially the case because the nominees before us are \nsuperbly qualified. One of the nominees, Armando Bonilla, would be the \nfirst Hispanic judge to hold a seat on the court. He is strongly \nendorsed by the Hispanic National Bar Association. He has spent his \nentire career--now spanning over two decades--as an attorney for the \nDepartment of Justice. He was hired out of law school in the \nDepartment's prestigious Honors Program, and has risen to become the \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General in the Department.\n  Armando Bonilla's story is that of the American dream. The son of a \nCuban immigrant and Cuban-American father, Armando Bonilla has told the \nstory of his mother's flight from Havana with his aunt and his \ngrandmother. He has told the story of his ``Ti Mario,'' who eventually \ndisappeared trying to help other exiles. And he has told the story of \nhis father, who dropped out of high school but would subsequently serve \nthe country by joining the Marines and would ultimately take on several \njobs to support Armando and his sister. As Mr. Bonilla has beautifully \ndescribed, his father ``exemplified the most outstanding qualities of \nthe Hispanic culture and Hispanic people: the selfless sacrifice, the \nsteely resolve and unbridled optimism and the genuine pride in an \nhonest day's work--all toward the cause of improving the lives of the \nnext generation.'' Mr. Bonilla should be confirmed without further \ndelay.\n  Another nominee, Jeri Somers, retired with the rank of Lieutenant \nColonel in the U.S. Air Force. She spent over two decades serving first \nas a judge advocate general and then as a military judge in the U.S. \nAir Force and the District of Columbia's Air National Guard. In 2007, \nshe became a board judge with the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract \nAppeals and currently serves as its vice chair.\n  Armando Bonilla and Jeri Somers are just two of the five nominees \nthat Senate Republicans have been obstructing. These are two \nindividuals that have done right every step of the way in their careers \nand are willing to serve on this important court. They have dedicated \nthe majority of their careers in service to our Nation. They deserve \nbetter than the treatment they are receiving now.\n  During the Bush administration, the Senate confirmed nine judges to \nthe Court of Federal Claims--with the support of every Senate \nRepublican. So far during the Obama administration, only three CFC \njudges have received confirmation votes. That is nine CFC judges during \nthe Bush administration to only three so far in the Obama \nadministration.\n  Unfortunately, the disparity in treatment of these nominees by Senate \nRepublicans is not surprising. More than half a year into this new \nCongress, the Republican leadership has scheduled votes to confirm only \nfive district and circuit court judges. This is in stark contrast to \nthe 25 district and circuit court judges confirmed by July 13, 2007, \nwhen the shoe was on the other foot and Democrats had regained the \nSenate majority in the seventh year of the Bush administration. That is \n25 district and circuit court judges under a Democratic majority \ncompared to 5 under the Republican majority. That is five times as many \njudges confirmed under a Democratic majority with a President of the \nopposite party than today's Senate Republican majority.\n  It is up to the majority leader now to treat President Obama's \njudicial nominees fairly. I ask that he schedule votes this week on the \nfive Court of Federal Claims nominees pending on the Senate Executive \nCalendar.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent post to The Hill's Congress \nBlog by Professor Carl Tobias on the need to fill the vacancies on U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, July 9, 2015]\n\n            Fill the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Vacancies\n\n                            (By Carl Tobias)\n\n       The United States Court of Federal Claims was the most \n     important federal court that many Americans had never heard \n     of until last month. That is when Judge Thomas Wheeler of \n     this court ruled that Hank Greenberg and AIG shareholders had \n     proved that the federal government exceeded its authority by \n     demanding an eighty percent equity stake in AIG during the \n     great recession but that plaintiffs were not entitled to \n     damages because they suffered no economic loss.\n       More critical than this high profile case is the fact that \n     the court has experienced vacancies in five of its judgeships \n     for more than a year, while the well qualified, consensus \n     nominees whom President Barack Obama first tapped for those \n     openings in 2014 have languished awaiting confirmation. \n     Because the Court of Federal Claims needs its full complement \n     of judges to deliver justice and each nominee is highly \n     qualified and uncontroversial, the Senate must expeditiously \n     provide the nominees floor debates, if warranted, and up or \n     down votes.\n       This tribunal is the court in which citizens seek redress \n     against the federal government for monetary claims. These \n     include claims that the U.S. has taken private property \n     without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, claims \n     pursued by veterans who seek disability payments for injuries \n     received in combat and claims for compensation filed by \n     persons who allege vaccines injured them. The tribunal's \n     recent caseload has increasingly encompassed complex, high-\n     dollar cases and high profile disputes in fields, such as the \n     1980s savings and loan crisis and Second World War internment \n     of Japanese Americans by the United States.\n       On April 10, 2014, Obama nominated Judge Nancy Firestone \n     for reappointment and Thomas Halkowski to fifteen year terms, \n     while on May 21, the White House nominated Armando Bonilla, \n     Patricia McCarthy and Jeri Somers. Obama first nominated all \n     five of the candidates more than one year ago, and they \n     received Judiciary Committee hearings nearly a year ago. The \n     panel unanimously reported all five out of committee rather \n     soon after the hearings. Unfortunately, the Senate accorded \n     none of the nominees a final vote before the 114th Congress \n     adjourned.\n       Therefore, the White House renominated the five candidates \n     in early January 2015. The Judiciary Committee in turn \n     unanimously approved the nominees without substantive \n     discussion in February. The five nominees have since \n     languished on the floor over four months awaiting debates and \n     yes or no ballots. In a June 24 Congressional Record \n     statement, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary \n     Committee Ranking Member, urged swift votes: ``We have heard \n     no opposition to any of these nominees, yet they have been in \n     limbo for months and months because the Republican Leader has \n     refused to schedule a vote.''\n       Now that the Senate has returned from its July 4 recess, \n     one of the chamber's first items of business must be debates \n     and votes on the five Court of Federal Claims nominees. The \n     tribunal needs all of the judges whom Congress has authorized \n     to dispense justice for members of the public who seek \n     redress because they claim that the federal government has \n     injured them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S5003-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5003-S5004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n RECOGNIZING THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLORADO DRAGON BOAT FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. GARDNER.

SMILLIE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Col \nRhonda Smillie of the U.S. Army Reserve who retired in May 2015 with \nmore than 32 years of service and who, for the past 2 years, has served \nas a legislative liaison for the chief, Army Reserve. I am grateful for \nher life of service to the Army Reserve and wish her well as she \ntransitions into retirement.\n  A native of Fort Atkinson, WI, Rhonda was commissioned via the \nReserve Officer's Training Corps Program at the University of \nWisconsin-Whitewater, and went on to earn advanced degrees from \nLindenwood University in St. Charles, MO, and from the U.S. Army War \nCollege in Carlisle, PA.\n  Currently serving as the legislative liaison for the chief, Army \nReserve, with responsibility for 19 States, Colonel Smillie travels \nextensively throughout her territory. From Ohio to Washington, from \nNorth Dakota to Missouri, she conducts education and outreach events \nthat ensure community leaders understand the impact of the Army \nReserve. Her efforts highlight key aspects of the Army Reserve that \notherwise go unnoticed such as providing medical and dental assistance \nto underserved communities in northern Montana, providing cost \neffective training via Chinook helicopter simulators in Kansas, and \nworking to ensure returning soldiers receive necessary support via the \nYellow Ribbon Program in various States. She has helped to highlight \nthe Public Private Partnership and other programs unique to the Army \nReserve.\n  Prior to assignment as a legislative liaison, she served as the \ndeputy director, Military Personnel Management, Department of the Army \nHeadquarters, G-1.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take \n     such actions as are necessary to designate Grambling State \n     University as a United States Department of Agriculture 1890 \n     land-grant institution; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 141\n\n       Whereas, a land-grant college or university is a \n     postsecondary education institution that has been designated \n     to receive the benefits of the federal Morrill Acts of 1862 \n     or 1890; and\n       Whereas, there is at least one land-grant institution in \n     every state and territory of the United States, as well as \n     the District of Columbia, and over the years, land-grant \n     status has been associated with several types of federal \n     support; and\n       Whereas, two universities in this state, Louisiana State \n     University and Agricultural and Mechanical College (LSU) and \n     Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College \n     (SU), are designated as land-grant institutions; LSU received \n     this designation in 1862, and in 1890, what is known as the \n     Second Morrill Act conferred land-grant status to several \n     historically black colleges and universities, commonly \n     referred to as ``1890 land-grant institutions'', and SU is \n     among this group; and\n       Whereas, Grambling State University, located in Grambling, \n     Louisiana, is seeking designation as an 1890 land-grant \n     institution under the banner of the Second Morrill Act; and\n       Whereas, Grambling State University was founded in 1901 by \n     the North Louisiana Colored Agriculture Relief Association; \n     in 1905, it moved to its present location and was renamed the \n     North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School; in 1946, \n     it became Grambling College; and in 1949, it earned its first \n     accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and \n     Schools; and\n       Whereas, in 1974, the school began to offer graduate \n     programs in early childhood and elementary education and \n     acquired the name Grambling State University; over the years, \n     several new academic programs have been incorporated and new \n     facilities added to the 384-acre campus; and\n       Whereas, Grambling now offers more than eight hundred \n     courses and forty-seven degree programs in five colleges, \n     including an honors college, two professional schools, a \n     graduate school, and a Division of Continuing Education; and\n       Whereas, Grambling combines the academic strengths of a \n     major university with the benefits of a small college, and \n     its students grow and learn in a serene and positive \n     environment; and\n       Whereas, in addition to being one of the country's top \n     producers of African-American graduates, Grambling is home to \n     the internationally renowned Tiger Marching Band and remains \n     proud of the legacy of the late Eddie Robinson, Sr., a truly \n     legendary football coach; and\n       Whereas, Grambling places an emphasis on the value and \n     importance of each student, which is exemplified by its \n     motto, ``Where Everybody is Somebody''; and\n       Whereas, after more than a decade since its founding, \n     Grambling remains an important influence in the quality of \n     lives and communities of generations of North Louisiana \n     residents; and\n       Whereas, the designation of Ohio's Central State University \n     as an 1890 land-grant institution in the 2014 Farm Bill set a \n     very recent precedent for the addition of a university to the \n     land-grant system; and\n       Whereas, the nation's system of land-grant institutions \n     would be strengthened by the inclusion of Grambling State \n     University; and\n       Whereas, as a historically black university with a strong \n     record of academics, research, and service, Grambling, with \n     its rich history and traditions, would bring a unique \n     perspective to the land-grant system; and\n       Whereas, for one hundred twenty-five years, the 1890 land-\n     grant institutions have played a vital role in ensuring \n     access to higher education and opportunity for underserved \n     communities, and as such an institution, Grambling would have \n     access to increased resources that it could direct to serving \n     such communities and to providing research, extension, and \n     public services in North Louisiana, an area where these \n     services are not currently being provided sufficiently; and\n       Whereas, such designation would be consistent with \n     Grambling's agricultural origins and its mission and history \n     of service to African-American students and the people of \n     Louisiana and would strengthen Grambling's research and \n     teaching in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n     (STEM) programs and enhance existing programs and facilitate \n     the development of new programs in agricultural business, \n     biotechnology, economics, environment and natural resources, \n     family and consumer science, and engineering technology; and\n       Whereas, Grambling State University has made the same \n     extraordinary contributions to the education of African \n     Americans in the state of Louisiana as other 1890 land-grant \n     universities have made in their respective states; and\n       Whereas, as the only Historically Black College or \n     University (HBCU) in the University of Louisiana System, the \n     role that Grambling plays in the state is critical; and\n       Whereas, a land-grant designation would enhance greatly \n     Grambling's service to the people of Louisiana, and it is \n     appropriate that Congress take all necessary measures to \n     grant such designation to Grambling State University: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take \n     such actions as are necessary to designate Grambling State \n     University as a United States Department of Agriculture 1890 \n     land-grant institution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-46. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take action against illegal, unreported, and \n     unregulated fishing in Louisiana's sovereign waters by \n     passing H.R. 774, the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated \n     Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 66\n\n       Whereas, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a \n     global problem with serious economic, environmental, and \n     security implications; and\n       Whereas, illegal fishing accounts for economic losses of up \n     to billions of dollars per year nationally and such activity \n     is largely conducted by foreign fleets at the expense of \n     United States fishermen, coastal communities, and the \n     sustainability of global fish stocks; and\n       Whereas, illegal fishing is of particular consequence in \n     Louisiana, where the Gulf Coast waters supply seafood for the \n     citizens of the United States and support the hospitality \n     industry, tourism-related businesses, and the vibrant \n     recreational and commercial fishing industry; and\n       Whereas, not only does illegal fishing result in economic \n     losses to the Louisiana fishing industry and other coastal \n     businesses, but it also is a threat to the sustainability of \n     our fisheries and to the Louisiana Gulf Coast ecosystem; and\n       Whereas, the United States Coast Guard is to be commended \n     for apprehending and investigating foreign vessels engaged in \n     illegal activity along the U.S.-Mexico border, often \n     patrolling the Gulf of Mexico in a cat-and-mouse game \n     specifically with Mexican fishermen who are fishing \n     illegally; and\n       Whereas, illegal fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico compete \n     for local fish stock and disregard state and federal laws on \n     catch limits, or of marine species including marine mammals \n     and sea turtles that are indiscriminately killed by the use \n     of illegal long-line netting, and where some of the illegally \n     caught fish is exported back into the U.S. and flood the \n     market; and\n       Whereas, vessels involved with illegal fishing are also \n     associated with other crimes, including drug trafficking, \n     human trafficking, and illegal immigration, and the incursion \n     by these foreign fishing vessels into U.S. waters constitutes \n     a violation of our sovereignty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to take action against \n     illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in our sovereign \n     waters by passing H.R. 774, the Illegal, Unreported, and \n     Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     expresses its commitment to the elimination of illegal \n     fishing, to the long-term conservation of Louisiana marine \n     resources, and to the protection of the Louisiana Gulf Coast \n     fishing and coastal communities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-47. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana commending the United States Congress on the \n     passage of bipartisan legislation to permanently set the \n     payment amounts that Medicare pays for physician services, \n     known as the doc fix; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 109\n\n       Whereas, the term ``doc fix'' refers to the formula the \n     federal government uses to pay physicians who treat patients \n     covered by Medicare, who pay less than they would otherwise \n     to see a physician and the federal government makes up the \n     difference and pays the physician an amount determined by \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas, in 1997, Congress cut payments to physicians who \n     treat patients enrolled in\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\n     Medicare in order to help balance the federal budget; and\n       Whereas, while Congress had considered cutting the dollars \n     to physicians treating Medicare patients, but did not have \n     the collective will to carry it through, being concerned that \n     some physicians might not continue to treat Medicare patients \n     at a reduced rate, and the cut was postponed until a future \n     date; and\n       Whereas, over the last eighteen years Congress has \n     postponed the cut seventeen times and the cut has become a \n     possible twenty percent reduction in payments if the attempt \n     to postpone the cuts failed during this Congress; and\n       Whereas, with the current doc fix extension set to expire \n     on March 31, 2015, Congress may consider the need for \n     structural reforms to Medicare generally, not merely a \n     postponement of the cut for another year; and\n       Whereas, with the unconscionable cut of more than twenty \n     percent looming without the annual doc fix extension in \n     April, Congress agreed to begin broader structural changes to \n     Medicare, ending the doc fix shell game permanently;\n       Whereas, despite the reality that healthcare is expensive \n     and that the annual revisiting of the doc fix formula of \n     paying physicians was, at least, a bad way to govern, a \n     bipartisan solution proved attainable even in a time when \n     merely entertaining an idea from the other side of the aisle \n     is often unthinkable; and\n       Whereas, with the reality that one political party leads \n     both houses of Congress and the other holds the presidency, \n     true bipartisanship is the only path to successfully \n     attacking any of the country's issues, yet that \n     bipartisanship is noticeably absent in the discussion of most \n     of those issues; and\n       Whereas, while partisan differences have been more likely \n     to win the day, the ability to craft a bipartisan doc fix \n     solution requires the leadership of both political parties in \n     both houses to focus on solutions rather than differences, \n     and for that both the leadership and the members of Congress \n     as a whole should be heartily congratulated; and\n       Whereas, in reaching agreement on the end to the doc fix \n     extensions, Congress has begun the daunting task of reforming \n     and restructuring America's entitlement programs, a beginning \n     worthy of note and of acclaim: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby commend the United States Congress on the passage \n     of bipartisan legislation to permanently set the payment \n     amounts that Medicare pays for physician services, known as \n     the doc fix; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-48. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to restore trade relations between the United States \n     and Cuba in order to open the market to Louisiana rice; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas, in 2014, Louisiana produced over three billion \n     pounds of rice amounting to fifteen percent of the United \n     States' rice production; and\n       Whereas, the rice industry provides over nine thousand jobs \n     to the Louisiana economy; and\n       Whereas, increased rice exports to Cuba would lead to \n     greater export opportunities for Louisiana farmers and the \n     potential for increased acreage; and\n       Whereas, resumed rice exports to Cuba would also benefit \n     those affiliated with rice production, milling, and \n     exporting; and\n       Whereas, rice farming and milling has a large impact on \n     Louisiana's secondary economy in that for every dollar that \n     Louisiana rice produces, approximately thirty-five cents is \n     added indirectly to the economy through seed and fertilizer \n     sales, farm equipment, crop services, and transportation; and\n       Whereas, resuming the trade of rice with Cuba would be a \n     huge economic gain for Louisiana's port system; and\n       Whereas, prior to the creation of the trade embargo in \n     1962, the Port of New Orleans handled over sixty-five percent \n     of all traded goods to Cuba; and\n       Whereas, the fifty-plus-year trade embargo between the \n     United States and Cuba remains the longest-standing embargo \n     in modern history; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is the top state of origination for \n     Cuban-bound exports, representing nearly thirty percent of \n     the export market share; and\n       Whereas, it is time to end an outdated policy that \n     continues to deny valuable business opportunities to \n     Louisiana rice farmers, millers, and allied businesses, such \n     as transportation, storage, and shipping; and\n       Whereas, Cuba imports more than one billion dollars worth \n     of food every year, including approximately five hundred \n     thousand tons of rice; and\n       Whereas, the rice industry in Louisiana is positioned to \n     benefit from the market opportunities that normalized trade \n     with Cuba would provide due to our healthy supply, port \n     infrastructure, and proximity to Cuba; and\n       Whereas, the USA Rice Federation and its affiliate members \n     along with the Louisiana Rice Growers Association, the \n     Louisiana Rice Promotion Board, and the Louisiana Rice \n     Council are in support of restoring trade relations between \n     the United States and Cuba in order to open the market to \n     Louisiana rice: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to restore trade relations \n     between the United States and Cuba in order to open the \n     market to Louisiana rice; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-49. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Missouri urging the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to repeal the excise \n     tax on medical devices; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 29\n\n       Whereas, a new 2.3% federal excise tax on the sale of \n     taxable medical devices by manufacturers, producers, and \n     importers of such devices took effect on January 1, 2013; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress Joint Committee on \n     Taxation estimates that the tax will generate $29 billion in \n     revenue in its first ten years; and\n       Whereas, the United States is a net exporter in medical \n     devices, exporting $5.4 billion more than it imports, and \n     accounts for 40% of the global medical technology market; and\n       Whereas, a study completed by the Manhattan Institute found \n     that the medical device tax will almost double the medical \n     device industry's total tax bill and could result in the loss \n     of up to 43,000 jobs in the medical technology industry; and\n       Whereas, the medical device tax will harm the United \n     States' global competitiveness, stunt medical innovation, and \n     restrict the ability of patients to receive the life-saving \n     medical devices and care they need; and\n       Whereas, the medical device tax is imposed on United States \n     sales, rather than profits, of medical device manufacturers, \n     so it will be particularly damaging to innovative start-up \n     companies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the Missouri Senate, Ninety-\n     eighth General Assembly, First Regular Session, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein, hereby urge the President \n     of the United States and the Congress of the United States to \n     repeal the excise tax on medical devices; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Missouri Senate be \n     instructed to prepare properly inscribed copies of this \n     resolution for the President and Secretary of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives and the members of the Missouri \n     Congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S5008-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HEINRICH:\n       S. 1749.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nand permanently extend qualified zone academy bonds, and to treat such \nbonds as specified tax credit bonds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I call attention to our Nation's \neducation infrastructure. America's schools are in desperate need of \nrepair. A 2014 report by the National Center for Education Statistics \nfound that the U.S. needs to invest nearly $200 billion in school \nfacilities just to bring them up to date. This echoed the findings of \nthe American Society of Civil Engineers, who in 2013 gave American \npublic school buildings a D-plus rating.\n  Fortunately, there is a way for Congress to help facilitate these \nnecessary improvements. The Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) program \nhelps schools that serve low-income students pay for building \nrenovations, facility upgrades, equipment purchases, and other \nexpensive projects. QZABs provide tax credits to financial institutions \nwho provide bonds or other debt instruments to qualified schools. These \ntax credits decrease interest payments for schools that take on debt to \nrenovate their facilities.\n  Since creating QZABs in 1997, Congress has consistently extended the \nprogram, even expanding it for a brief period between 2008 and 2010. \nBut the program expired at the end of 2014.\n  It is time Congress enhanced and made permanent this important tax \ncredit. Today I will introduce the Rebuilding America's Schools Act. \nThis bill would extend permanently the QZAB program and increase the \nallotted funding for the program from $400 million per year to the \nlevels authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--\n$1.4 billion. Lastly, it would allow schools to use QZABs to finance \nconstruction of new buildings. Under current law, QZABs can only be \nused to finance renovations or upgrades to existing school buildings.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the Rebuilding \nAmerica's Schools Act.\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S5011-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 222--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION SHOULD IMMEDIATELY \n  ELIMINATE GENDER PAY INEQUITY AND TREAT ALL ATHLETES WITH THE SAME \n                          RESPECT AND DIGNITY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, last week more than 25 million Americans \nwatched the U.S. women's soccer team win for the third time soccer's \nmost coveted title--the Federation Internationale de Football \nAssociation (FIFA) World Cup. This thrilling victory was the most \nwidely viewed women's soccer game in our Nation's history. Americans \nare proud of this impressive victory, and we applaud these world-class \nathletes for their contributions to our Nation's legacy.\n  Anybody walking down the road by our farm house the night of the \nsoccer game--we had our windows open--would have heard Marcelle and I \nscreaming with joy at the victory.\n  But as the celebrations fade, we should all be troubled by the way \nFIFA discriminates against some of the teams that compete in the World \nCup. The U.S. women's team will receive $2 million for winning the \nWomen's World Cup. The 2014 men's World Cup winner was awarded $35 \nmillion. In fact, men's teams that lost in the first round of the 2014 \nmen's World Cup were awarded $8 million--four times more than the \nchampion U.S. women's team. The reason for this extreme disparity? \nGender.\n  So today, I am introducing a Senate resolution that calls on FIFA to \nimmediately eliminate this discriminatory prize award structure. \nOpponents of equal prize awards in sports point to revenue as the \nreason behind this disparity. But revenue should not be and cannot be \naccepted as a means for discrimination. In fact, they ought to ask \nthis: How many people watched the women's soccer team? Most teams would \ngive anything to have that viewership.\n  The 24 women's teams that took part in FIFA's tournament are role \nmodels--not just to women and girls but to men and boys across the \nglobe. The World Cup champions should be rewarded for their \nperformance, for their grit, and for their teamwork, rather than \ndevalued for their gender.\n  Nelson Mandela, a person I met often and admired, once said: ``Sport \nhas the power to change the world.'' Well, sports bring us together in \nour communities and on the global stage. They remind us what we have in \ncommon, they inspire us to dream, and they push beyond every boundary.\n  This weekend, millions of people watched American tennis star Serena \nWilliams win the women's final at Wimbledon, marking her sixth \nchampionship at the All England Club. The next day, Serbian tennis star \nNovak Djokovic won the men's final on the very same court. Both of \nthese athletes competed against the very best players in the world, and \nthey were awarded the very same amount of prize money for their \nimpressive victories. This is because Wimbledon chose to be on the \nright side of history in 2007 by ensuring pay equity for female and \nmale athletes. For years, tennis champions such as Billie Jean King and \nVenus Williams fought for equal treatment for the future champions of \ntheir sport.\n  I hope the story of the American Women's World Cup champions not \nreceiving fair treatment will inspire more people to join the fight for \nequal prize awards. With the resolution I introduce today, let the \nSenate be on record in support of fair treatment for all World Cup \nchampions as we urge FIFA to change its policy, just as the All England \nClub did years ago.\n  The fight for gender equality continues and is a fight worth winning. \nIn 2009, I proudly voted for passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct, which amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify the statute \nof limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay \ndiscrimination. And I supported Senator Mikulski's Paycheck Fairness \nAct, which would ensure that all Americans receive equal pay for equal \nwork.\n  We have had a lot of civil rights fights in our Nation's history. The \nbattle for true equality has persisted for too long. Let's join \ntogether. Let's send a powerful message of equality to those who aspire \nto one day become a champion. Equal pay for equal work should no longer \nbe an ideal, but instead the reality for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S5011-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5011-S5012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2215.

Mr. President, I see that the majority leader has \nfiled cloture on the bill, which I understand. We have had a chance to \nhave a good discussion and a good debate.\n  We are getting toward the end of the consideration of our bill to fix \nNo Child\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\nLeft Behind. We have a couple of issues that we need to resolve, but \nthere are only a couple, and for a bill this complicated, that is \npretty good. So it would be my hope that we could continue on through \nthe process, and the majority leader might even get to the point later \nin the week where he would be able to vitiate the cloture, and we could \nfinish without a cloture vote.\n  So far, so good. We have considered 58 amendments in committee and \nadopted 29. We have considered 25 on the floor, adopted 8 by rollcall, \n11 by voice, and we have dozens more that have been agreed to by \nSenator Murray and me and that we would recommend to the Senate that we \ncomplete.\n  So it is my hope that Senators will allow us to have a consensus \nabout this bill. As was said by Newsweek magazine last week, this is \nthe Education bill that everybody wants fixed, and we are the ones who \nare supposed to fix it. So while there are some issues toward the end \nthat are a little more difficult to resolve than others, I hope \nSenators will agree that people have had a chance to have their say on \neducation issues and that we can go on to the other important issues \nfacing the country.\n  I thank the Republican leader for giving us an opportunity to put \nthis on the floor. I thank the Democratic leader for allowing us to \nmove to the floor without delay. I hope we can continue over the next \ncouple of days and finish the bill this week and get on to other \nimportant issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S5019-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FILING CLOTURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is obvious that the Republican leader has \ncertainly changed his view on filing cloture.\n  There was a time on several occasions when the Republican leader \nbemoaned what he called ``a quick trigger on the cloture motion.'' That \nis a quote. There was a time--that was in 2012, 2013--when the \nRepublican leader called filing cloture ``heavy-handed behavior.''\n  Now, keep in mind the backdrop of all of this. For 4 years, the \nRepublicans simply wouldn't let us move to anything. We couldn't \noffer--they refused to allow bills to come up. We never even got on the \nbills. We would file a motion to get on a bill; they would object to \nthat.\n  We have a different world now in the 7 months that we have been under \nthe direction of the Republican leader, the senior Senator from \nKentucky. We have been working in good faith to try to get things to \nmove along--specifically this bill, the elementary and secondary \neducation bill. There is no sign of a filibuster that I am aware of, at \nleast on our side.\n  There are still a number of major amendments that need to be \naddressed. Senators Murphy, Booker, Warner, and others have an \namendment on accountability for the lowest performing schools. They \nhave worked hard on this. We have Senator Franken, who is very \npassionate, on an amendment to protect LGBT students from \ndiscrimination. Senator Markey has an amendment that provides grants to \nallow schools to teach climate science. Senator Casey has an amendment \nto expand and improve early education, particularly for 3- and 4-year-\nolds. These are important amendments dealing with education. There are \nothers, but these are a few that I mentioned.\n  So to have the Republican leader come to the floor and file cloture \nwhen we have just had a few amendments--he can come out and talk about \nall the votes we have had, but they have been on nothing amendments. \nThey could have been accepted really. We didn't even need votes on \nthem. We have had virtually no serious amendments, and now, all of a \nsudden, the Republican leader has changed totally, I guess, his \nphilosophy on how to legislate by filing cloture very early. I am very \ndisappointed in this, but it speaks volumes about how this Senate is \nbeing run by this Republican majority.\n  It is appropriate to file cloture when the shoe is on the other foot, \nI guess, except the difference is that we never had a chance to get on \nthe legislation. This is a perfect example of this. We didn't need to \nhave a vote on a motion to get on a bill. We just said: OK, go ahead \nand move to it.\n  So I am really surprised, quite frankly, but that is what has \nhappened. But it is not the first time I have been surprised about how \nthings have been going on around here the last 6 or 7 months.\n  I have nothing further.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/13/senate-section/article/S5019-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
