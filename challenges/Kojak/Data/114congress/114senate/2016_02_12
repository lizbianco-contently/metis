Mr. President, more than 100 years ago, Albert Einstein \nproposed the theory of relativity. He predicted that violent events in \nthe early universe shocked the cosmos, sending gravity waves rippling \nthrough the fabric of space time. By the time these waves reached \nEarth, they would be ``vanishingly small,'' and, with the technology \navailable in Einstein's day, impossible to detect. But after 100 more \nyears of science and innovation, scientists announced yesterday that, \nwith their new cosmic hearing aid, they have heard the first ripples \nfrom space.\n  I congratulate the men and women of the LIGO Scientific \nCollaboration, an international project of over 900 scientists led by \nMIT and Caltech, for their hard work and dedication. Using cutting-edge \nfacilities in Louisiana and Washington State, scientists detected a \nvibration in the space-time continuum, opening our ears, not just our \neyes, to space.\n  A billion years ago in a distant galaxy, two black holes spiraled \ninward on each other. Their eventual collapse released the energy of a \nbillion trillion suns in a fraction of a second and sent gravity waves \nrippling through space and time. Gravity waves compress space in one \ndirection and stretch it in the other. Since this push and pull weakens \nwith distance, scientists have long thought gravity waves would be too \nfaint to measure on Earth. But yesterday scientists proved such \nskepticism wrong. With their latest detector at the ready, scientists \nwere waiting and listening for any faint sign of these waves. And on \nSeptember 14, 2015, scientists heard a short chirp on their instruments \nthat turned out to be the billion-year echo of a faraway past.\n  For the first time, we can hear the Musica Universalis because of our \ninvestment in basic science research. Throughout the 40-year, $1.1 \nbillion project, the National Science Foundation withstood harsh \ncriticism about their funding to support the detection of gravitational \nwaves that were thought to be undetectable on Earth. But it was NSF's \ncommitment to basic science research and the dedication of Dr. Rainer \nWeiss of MIT, Dr. Kip Thorne of Caltech, Dr. Ronald Drever of the \nUniversity of Glasgow, and an international team of scientists that has \nmade yesterday's announcement possible.\n  This discovery is a triumph for science and a testament to the payoff \nof long-term public investment in basic science research. It further \nilluminates our understanding of the universe and opens the door for a \nwhole new way of peering into the cosmos. I congratulate all those \ninvolved in turning on the sound to the stars.\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/senate-section/article/S886-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n            SUBMISSION OF CONCURRENT AND SENATE RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following concurrent resolutions and Senate resolutions were \nread, and referred (or acted upon), as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. McCONNELL:\n       S.
