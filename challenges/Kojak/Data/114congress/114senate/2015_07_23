Mr. President, there are a lot of tired cliches about \nnot giving up after an initial setback. I won't subject our colleagues \nto any of those this morning, but I will say that last night's vote \nrepresents an important first step toward passing a multiyear, \nbipartisan highway bill. It is the first step on a much longer road \nbut, in my view, a worthwhile one.\n  This bipartisan bill will fund our roads, highways, and bridges for \nlonger than any transportation bill considered by Congress in a decade, \nand the highway proposal will do so without increasing taxes or adding \nto the deficit. That is no small achievement.\n  Just consider what the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget had \nto say about the bill we voted to move forward on last night. It is \n``refreshing,'' they said, to see Congress focusing ``on a multi-year \nsolution instead of just another short-term patch.'' In general, their \noverall view was that this is ``a fiscally responsible bill that relies \non some pretty solid offsets.'' That is from the Committee for a \nResponsible Federal Budget. They called it ``a fiscally responsible \nbill that relies on some pretty solid offsets.'' Positive comments such \nas those echo the kinds of things I continue to hear from Members of \nboth parties.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from California and the other \nMembers on her side who worked with us to help prepare this bill and \nthen voted with us to advance it last night. I hope we will continue to \nwork together to finally deliver a fiscally responsible, long-term \nhighway bill for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5477-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          OBLIGATIONS UNDER IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REVIEW ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday I joined Speaker Boehner, \nSenator Cotton, and Congressman Pompeo in sending a letter to the \nadministration with a simple request: that the administration meet its \nfull obligations to Congress under the terms of the bipartisan Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act--a law both parties supported \noverwhelmingly just this spring. The law gives Congress the right to \nreview all of the elements of an agreement struck between the White \nHouse and Iran and then take a vote on it.\n  The law is clear, but the administration has not submitted the side \nagreements between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran to \nthe Senate, withholding the text from both Democrats and Republicans in \nCongress. And since the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act was signed \ninto law prior to the completion of the negotiation in Vienna, \nSecretary Kerry was fully aware--fully aware--of the requirement in law \nto submit the side deal to Congress.\n  Congress cannot properly carry out its obligation to the American \npeople until the administration fulfills its legal obligation to the \nAmerican people and to Congress, so we are calling on the \nadministration to do that immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5477-8", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5477-S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we can tell a lot about how a Senator feels \nabout our veterans by seeing how they vote on issues dealing with \nveterans. We can tell a lot about a Senator by how he or she treats our \nNation's veterans. Are they committed to giving our veterans the care \nand help they deserve and need or do they see American servicemembers \nas political footballs to be used for partisan fights?\n  I was disappointed yesterday to see my Republican colleagues try to \nactually manipulate a good veterans bill, a noble bill, and it was done \nfor political purposes.\n  The senior Senator from Washington, who has worked so hard on \nveterans issues for years now in the Senate, crafted a bipartisan piece \nof legislation to help veterans to do a number of things--basically, to \nhelp with their families. It is a tragic reality that thousands of \nveterans and servicemembers struggle with issues related to \nreproductive health, including fertility, some as a result of injuries \nsustained in combat. Senator Murray's bill would give the Veterans' \nAdministration the resources it needs to attend to our veterans' \nreproductive health. The legislation would also help facilitate \nadoptive services for wounded veterans who want a family of their own.\n  Senator Murray's bill was to be marked up. That means it would be \nfinalized in committee before it was reported from that committee to \nthe floor. That is one of the opportunities we have to get legislation \non the floor. But in a cynical, duplicitous move, a handful of \nRepublicans on that committee were determined to manipulate the \nlegislation. Instead of working with Senator Murray and others on the \ncommittee to pass a good bill as is, the junior Senator from North \nCarolina and other Republicans tried to attach so-called poison pill \namendments to the bill. Senator Murray, to her credit, saw immediately \nwhat this charade was all about as a political stunt and requested that \nthe chairman pull her bill from consideration, which did happen. The \nSenator from Washington didn't want a good, bipartisan bill hijacked by \na few Republicans looking to get their names on FOX television.\n  This episode says a lot about today's Republican Party. This is an \nattack on families, it is an attack on the health of women, and it is \nan attack on our veterans.\n  Every servicemember who puts on the uniform of the United States \narmed services deserves everything we can give them because they take \nan oath to defend our Nation. It is not a pledge taken lightly by these \nmen and women who serve. They understand what is being asked of them. \nThey know that at any given time they may have to sacrifice everything \nfor this country.\n  We here in the Senate take a similar oath when we are sworn in to \noffice, but we also make an unspoken, yet equally solemn, vow--to do \neverything in our power to support these veterans. We aren't called \nupon to make the ultimate sacrifices they are, but we have to recognize \nthat they need our help. That means we do anything we can to give them \nthe care they deserve. That means we always put their well-being above \npartisan politics.\n  The Republicans in this ploy yesterday put FOX News ahead of the \nwelfare of the veterans community. This is, in fact, a reality. It is \ntoo bad for the veterans community.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first let me say it is important that we \nfund the highway trust fund and that we have a long-term commitment to \nthe infrastructure of our country--the jobs, the economy, the \nneighborhoods.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma coming to the floor. He \nleads the committee that oversees transportation. He and my friend from \nCalifornia have put forward a 6-year authorization on policy that I \nthink we should commend them for. I am proud to be a part of the group. \nCertainly Democrats have been united in saying we need a sense of \nurgency, we need to get beyond month-to-month highway trust fund \nrenewals, and we need to make a commitment to a long-term approach, \njust as every other country has done in a global economy, so that we \ncan continue to compete and win as it relates to our roads, bridges, \nports, rails, and all of the other parts of our infrastructure.\n  What concerns me about the bill in front of us, though, is that, \nwhile we are on the one hand wanting to make sure we have good \ninfrastructure for our communities, including safe roads, safe bridges, \nand other investments, one of the ways it is funded in this bill--and I \nbelieve strongly that we need to fix this before it moves forward, and \nI will do whatever I can to make sure we do, along with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who care about this--is a small provision that \nactually takes money away from communities and neighborhoods working \nvery hard to come back from blight.\n  We have communities all across Michigan--this is called the Hardest \nHit Fund. There are communities all across Michigan. I don't have the \nfull list in front of me right now, but I will do this off the top of \nmy head. We have Detroit, Pontiac, Flint, Saginaw, Lansing, and Grand \nRapids. Here is the list: Highland Park, Jackson, Inkster, Ecorse, \nMuskegon Heights, River Rouge, Port Huron, Hamtramck, Ironwood, and \nAdrian. These are all communities that are working very hard, through \npublic sector and private sector efforts, to rebuild neighborhoods, to \ntake down drug houses on a block where children are walking by on the \nway to school, and to rebuild with a new park or new housing.\n  This is a program that has worked. In one of America's great cities \nthat have gone through a lot of challenges called the city of Detroit, \nthere is a huge effort going on right now, including public sector and \nprivate sector foundations. We have CEOs running towards the city of \nDetroit. It is really an amazing thing to see, what the private sector \nis doing. They are engaged in an effort to save and rebuild \nneighborhoods that can be saved by going into neighborhoods where the \nmajority of houses are where senior citizens have lived for \ngenerations. Young couples have bought a house, but maybe there are two \nor three houses on a block that are empty and that are places where \ncrime is occurring, such as drug houses. We take those down. What is \nhappening in the city of Detroit is that home values are going up and \nthings are beginning to turn around because of this strategy.\n  Unfortunately, in this bill, monies that have been allocated to \ncities across the country in States across the country--I believe we \nhave a list of States. States across the country have been allocated \nfunds to fix issues, to fix houses, to rebuild neighborhoods. In this \nbill, money we are counting on, money that has been allocated for this \npurpose will be taken back. Can my colleagues imagine that?\n  Here is the way this works. We have construction going on. Let's say \nthey are removing asbestos from a home or taking houses down. The \ncontractor does the work, and the city pays the contractor and then \nturns the bill in to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. They are \ncounting on the fact that\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nthey will be paid because we, the Federal Government, have given them \nin writing our word that they have a certain amount of dollars \nallocated.\n  This bill, unfortunately--and I am hopeful that this was not done on \npurpose and that we will be able to fix this--actually says that you \nincur that bill from the private contractor, but we are not going to \npay it anymore. It is one thing if we want to debate whether this \nprogram makes sense going forward, but for allocations that have \nalready been made for South Carolina, Illinois, and Ohio--and my good \nfriend, Rob Portman----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been listening. I say to my good friend that I am \nconcerned about that.\n  As the Senator from Michigan knows, there are several titles in this \nbill. I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee, which is \nabout 90 percent of the bill. But what the Senator is referring to here \nis in the banking title of the bill.\n  I understand--and I can't say this for certain--that there are a \ncouple of amendments that address this. One amendment may be that of \nthe Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I say to the chairman that Senator \nPortman and I will have an amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK, it was my understanding that was the case. I have \nchecked with the leaders of the banking committee, and I think they are \nanticipating that could happen. So I appreciate it, and I just wanted \nthat clarification as to where that problem that you point out does \nexist in the bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for that \nclarification.\n  I do want to indicate very clearly that for communities around this \ncountry, this is a big deal. This is certainly a big deal for Michigan, \nand I can't in any way support any effort going forward unless this is \nfixed. It is a small amount of dollars in the larger scheme of funding \nthis bill, and if it means that we fund the highway bill one less month \nrather than devastating communities such as Cleveland, Detroit, Flint, \nand cities in Illinois and South Carolina, Nevada, California, \nKentucky, and across the country, then so be it. But I can't be any \npart of something that takes a huge effort and stops it in its tracks \nwhen it is so important to rebuild.\n  I just want to share one example of why this is so important. I know \nthe chairman is waiting to speak, so I won't be long. But I do want to \nshow that in every rebuild community--let me just give you one story.\n  In Detroit in October of 2009--this was in the paper--a 14-year-old \ngirl on her way to high school was pulled behind a garage in a blighted \nneighborhood. In 2012, Detroit neighbors organized to try to protect \nschoolgirls from being assaulted on their way to school. One volunteer \ntold the Detroit Free Press of rescuing a 13-year-old girl who was \nattacked in an abandoned garage. In 2012, a man who lived near Detroit \nlooks for girls who are walking alone--girls walking to school, doing \nthe right thing. We want them to go to school. We want them to get an \neducation. The man abducted them at gunpoint and took them to vacant \nbuildings and assaulted them. One man was accused of assaulting seven \nwomen. In 2012, a young woman was pulled into an abandoned house just \ntwo blocks from Denby High School and sexually assaulted--two blocks \nfrom school. She was trying to go to school when she was sexually \nassaulted. The Detroit Free Press interviewed an 18-year-old young \nwoman who walked every day to school. She said she passed 88 vacant \nhomes, and she knew other girls her age had been attacked in the \nneighborhood. This is getting fixed. This is getting fixed. Those \nbuildings are coming down and in some cases what we have are landlords \nfixing them up. They are going in and taking back the house and \nrebuilding the house. People are buying homes. They are coming back \ninto the neighborhoods. In some cases small businesses are buying these \nhomes.\n  We have rejuvenation going on like I have never seen before. It is \ndependent on the blight funds that we, through the Department of \nTreasury, have made available. I am not debating whether we should add \nmore. I would love to add more. We need more funds. We need a more \nrobust program. What I am saying is that it is outrageous if we are in \na situation where there is money that cities are already counting on \nand spending with the private sector, with neighborhoods, with church \ngroups--everybody is involved in this--and they are in the middle of a \nproject and they are told: You know what; the good news is we are going \nto fix the road in front of your house. The bad news is your \nneighborhood is going to fall apart because we are not keeping our \ncommitments as it relates to blight.\n  I will be speaking more as we go. I want to certainly yield to our \ndistinguished chairman. I appreciate the work of EPW, as I said \nearlier, in the policy. But this is critical to get done. This \nabsolutely has to be out of this bill, and I hope it will be. I hope it \nwill be.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Indiana, Mr. Coats, is going to want some time to speak, and I am \nvery flexible today. I just want to visit about the bill. We have so \nmany parts of this, and I think that people have not really had a \nchance, and a lot of Members have not really gotten into the bill to \nsee how far it goes and what it does.\n  This is the sixth one of these that I have had since I have been here \nin the House and the Senate. We had one in the House first. This bill, \nI think, is really good.\n  People forget that the last big bill we had was in 2005. It was a 5-\nyear bill and it is very similar to the bill before us today. There \nwere projects that took place that were in that bill that are now \ncomplete. In my State of Oklahoma, we had a bridge in terrible \ncondition in Oklahoma City. In fact, we had a terrible accident. A lady \nwith her three small children was driving under the bridge and concrete \ndropped and killed her. This has happened. I spoke yesterday about all \nthe bridges and the problems that exist around this country with all of \nour deficient bridges. So it is serious.\n  Since 2009 we have not had a long-term bill. This is it. We have been \noperating on short-term extensions. There have been a total of 33 \nshort-term extensions. On short-term extensions you can't get anything \ndone. You cannot have any major reforms.\n  In this bill we have reforms in the NEPA system, the environmental \nsystem. We are giving latitude for road construction in terms of \nendangered species. There might be some little critter 6 feet down that \nsome people don't want to disturb. Anyway, we are making exceptions. So \nwe are really going to be able to get these projects going, and this is \nthe first time since 2009 that we are doing it the right way.\n  Yesterday there were some provisions about which what we have tried \nto do is take them one at a time to show how much daylight is in this \nbill so that people know how their money is being spent. Every project \nthat is out there can now be monitored.\n  What I would like to do is talk about the background of this. People \ndon't realize that this was started in 1956 by the great General Dwight \nD. Eisenhower, who became the President of the United States. This \nSenator can say, as one of the most conservative Members of the Senate, \nI believe the Federal Government has grown larger and more invasive \nthan our Founding Fathers ever envisioned, and our country could \nbenefit from a smaller and more efficient government. I have observed \nthat in government, if there is a problem out there, the government \ncomes along and starts some kind of agency to deal with the problem and \nthen the problem goes away, but the agency continues. In fact, they \nbecome part of the problem. Right now I am having a problem with one of \nthe big bureaucracies, the FAA, on legislation that I proposed and that \nwe passed 2 years ago, and now we have an extension of that.\n  When looking at the budgets of the various bureaucracies--and in that \ncase I don't have the exact figures--it has almost doubled what it was \nin 1986, yet the workload is less. We have to keep in mind this is \ngoing on. This is what people are complaining about.\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nWhat they are not complaining about is what the Constitution says we \nare supposed to be doing.\n  The Constitution is very clear. It says in article I, section 8 what \nwe are supposed to be doing as Members of the Senate and the House--No. \n1, defending America, and No. 2, building and maintaining roads and \nbridges. Sometimes we need to get out that old worn out document and \nreread it and find out that this is what this bill is all about. No one \nelse is doing it for us.\n  There are a lot of ideas that people have, and there are a lot of \nconservative groups, for example, that are saying we need devolution.\n  I will tell the Presiding Officer something that in all his infinite \nwisdom he doesn't know, and that is that 20 years ago I was the father \nof devolution. It is more fun to stand on the steps and say all we have \nto do is do away with all the Federal gas taxes and move them to the \nStates and let the States take care of these. I would suggest that some \npeople are in States such as South Dakota where there is a lot of land \nand not a whole lot of people, and that just wouldn't work. Here is the \nproblem with that issue. In order to make devolution work--and, again, \nthis Senator was the guy that as beautiful as it was on the stump, it \nwas fun to talk about until I found out it was wrong. First of all, it \nis easy to repeal all the Federal taxes, but then you have to assume \nthat all 48 States will agree to pass a tax increase, and that isn't \ngoing to happen. I think we all know that.\n  I want to mention something that is important, and that is to give \nthe history of this. There are two areas where I believe the Federal \nGovernment has to be involved, as I mentioned, and that are consistent \nwith the Constitution. This is both a conservative and constitutional \nunderstanding of the role of the Federal Government. President \nEisenhower's Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 authorized construction of \na 41,000-mile national system of interstate and defense highways. This \nchart I have in the Chamber shows the blue lines as the original \nhighways, and the red came along later, which is the National Highway \nSystem. So you have the Interstate Highway System and the National \nHighway System. The blue is the Interstate Highway System, consisting \nof 41,000 miles of highways. This is actually a map of Eisenhower's \nInterstate Highway System back in 1956.\n  In order to finance this massive undertaking and to fund the \nremainder of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, the Highway Revenue Act \nof 1956 created the highway trust fund. That is what we have been \ntalking about for a long period of time now. It provided that revenues \nfrom certain highway user groups be credited to the highway trust fund.\n  Interestingly, I can remember when the biggest problem with the \nhighway trust fund was that it had too big a surplus. It was huge. I \nremember the Clinton administration tried to take $12 billion out of \nthe highway trust fund for another program, and they were successful. \nIt took me 3 years to get it back. That is because it was a target that \nhad a lot of money in it. Well, the dedicated funding mechanism \nprovided certainty for the Federal highway program. The 13-year \nauthorization of the Highway Revenue Act gave the States the necessary \ncertainty to plan and construct highway projects.\n  Since 1956, Congress has regularly reauthorized the Federal-Aid \nHighway Program. Eisenhower's highway act of 1956 was implemented to \nsolve many problems we are experiencing now as our infrastructure \ndeteriorates.\n  Keep in mind that it was all built on a 50-year basis and that it \nwould last 50 years. Well, that was about 70 years ago. It is beyond \nits maintenance period now, and that is why it is so critical today.\n  The act originally in 1956 was implemented to solve the problems that \nwe are experiencing now as our infrastructure deteriorates. Most \nnotably, billions of dollars have been wasted on detours, traffic jams, \nand inefficiency in the transport of goods.\n  Not only did Eisenhower understand the constitutional order as \nintended by the Framers, but he demonstrated the terms and conditions \nof the Constitution in the implemented Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. \nThe original principles of the Constitution and the Federal-State \nrelationship exist to ensure liberty while maintaining security. \nEisenhower was the President, but he was also a general. He was a star. \nHe knew about the military. His original concern was not with the \neconomy as much as it was with the military. This was following World \nWar II, and he was anticipating that something else could happen. He \nwanted to make sure that we could move our goods and services around \nfor military defense purposes. The principles were made operational via \nthe interstate highway act of 1956, and this chart has the stated \npurpose of the act by the President. He said: ``The obsolescence of the \nNation's highways presents an appalling problem of waste, danger and \ndeath.''\n\n  This is a statement he made at that time. Unfortunately, Congress has \nforgotten that passing fully funded, long-term transportation \nlegislation is one of the unique responsibilities and has instead \nfallen into a pattern of passing short-term extensions. Now, I have \nalready talked about how many extensions have been passed since 2009--\n33 of them. In those extensions, you don't get any of the reforms, you \ndon't have any of the opportunities to build roads cheaper and repair \nthe bridges much cheaper. Now we can do that.\n  So he said: ``Adequate financing there must be, but contention over \nthe method should not be permitted to deny our people these critically \nneeded roads.'' The need for a Federal investment is dire. Just look at \nthe current condition of our roads and bridges. What was once the best \ntransportation system in the world is now rapidly deteriorating as we \nstruggle to maintain the existing condition of our infrastructure. Our \nglobal competitors are outpacing us in their infrastructure investment. \nI think we have another chart on that.\n  The interstate system is just as much about defense as it is \ninterstate commerce: ``The obsolescence of the nation's highways \npresents an appalling problem of waste, danger and death.''\n  This was what the President said at that time. He is right. The \ncondition of our roads currently has impacted the quality of life for \nall Americans. Fifty-four percent of America's major roads are rated \npoor or mediocre, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n  This has become a matter of life and death: 32,700 Americans died in \ntraffic crashes in 2013, with 1 of 3 fatalities related to poor road \nconditions, according to the Federal Highway Administration. We all \nremember back in 2007, up in Minnesota--it got a lot of attention up \nthere at that time when they had the bridge collapse, the people who \ndied, the people who were injured. It is something that could have been \navoided if we had kept up-to-date on all of our bridges.\n  As I said yesterday, I talked about all of the bridges we have--not \nall of them, just some of the ones that are used more than any others. \nThis shows the structurally deficient bridges. The darker the color the \nworse the bridges. There is my State of Oklahoma. You can see the \nentire northeast quarter of the State has a lot of the deficient \nbridges.\n  I was talking to the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Blunt, yesterday. He \ntalked about in Missouri--the problems we have in Missouri and \nOklahoma. There are a lot of structurally deficient bridges in both \nstates. The DRIVE Act is addressing that but also the very large \nbridges that are causing unnecessary deaths. Our national interstate \nsystem needs to be completely reconstructed. Right now, the 47,000--\nthis is critical here. The 47,000-mile interstate system is about 60 \nyears old. Many of the first segments, including segments in Oklahoma \nand Missouri and Kentucky, are now well beyond their 50-year design \nlife.\n  When Eisenhower successfully passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act in \n1956, both the House and the Senate were controlled by Democrats, while \nhe was a Republican. The measure was met with widespread bipartisan \nsupport. There is no such thing as a Republican bridge or a Democratic \nroad. This is something that should be blind to partisan politics, but \nnonetheless he was very active and he considered that one of his top \npriorities.\n  In fact, during the debates in Congress in 1955 and 1956, there had \nbeen no\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nopposition to the interstate system. The DRIVE Act,that is what we are \ngoing to be voting on--we have already voted on a motion to proceed to \nit, so we have crossed that bridge. We are now going to be considering \namendments. The DRIVE Act is a long-term investment vision with new \nreforms that will provide States with certainty and flexibility needed \nto revamp our National Highway System.\n\n  We are going to--this is the only opportunity we are going to have to \nget this done. We are going to try to finish this bill by the end of \nnext week. So that will be quite an undertaking. I would invite and \nhope that all of our Members will bring their amendments down. We will \nbe considering amendments. We can't consider them unless they come \ndown. What I don't want to happen is to be standing here begging for \namendments to come down, and then 2 weeks from now, right before it \ncomes time, find that we have to pass a procedure not to allow \namendments.\n  We don't want that to happen. So we are saying get your amendments \ndown here early. We know there are some of them--there has been a lot \nof publicity on this--that are not germane. Yet we are going to go \nahead and consider them. We are going to open the amendment process. \nThat is one thing I think the Republicans do better than Democrats \nbecause during the years the Democrats controlled this Chamber, we just \nhad a handful of amendments at that time. We passed that 8-year record \nin the first month by encouraging people to bring down amendments. So I \nam asking the Democratic and Republican Senators to do that.\n  This is going to be the most significant bill--now that we have \npassed the Defense authorization bill. That is not all behind us yet. \nWe are still meeting on that. In fact, we had a meeting this morning, \nbut nonetheless it was passed from the committee and from the floor. \nNow the most important legislation that is left for the rest of the \nyear is this bill we are talking about now. There is going to be a lot \nof legislation that is going to be introduced.\n  In my committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, a lot of \npeople think of that, and I know the Presiding Officer is an active \nmember of that committee. It is not just public works. It is not just \nroads and highways and bridges. The other part of it, the environment \nand public works, includes all of the overregulation.\n  Right now, if you go back to your States--I don't care what State it \nis--and you talk to people on the streets who are in business, they \nwill tell you the greatest problem we are having right now is \noverregulation by the EPA. The Environmental Protection Agency is \npassing regulations right now. I mean, look at the cap-and-trade \nlegislation. That would constitute the greatest tax increase in \nhistory. Yet they tried to pass it as legislation. Now they are trying \nto do it as regulations.\n  The waters of the United States. That is an issue that if you talk to \nyour farmers--I don't care if it is in South Dakota, Oklahoma, Missouri \nor any of the rest of the country--and you ask what is the biggest \nproblem you are facing right now, it is nothing that is found in the \nfarm bill. It is the overregulation by the EPA. They will single out \nthe waters of the United States bill or rule that they are trying to \nput through. I recall so vividly, just a few years ago, when two \nMembers authored bills to take the word ``navigable'' out. I am sure \nthere are some who have forgotten the fact that the regulation of water \nin the United States has always been left to the States, except for \nnavigable waters. I understand that. Even being a conservative, I \nunderstand the Federal Government needs to be regulating those.\n  What the liberals tried to do is take the word ``navigable'' out so \nthe States would have no say in the regulation that is out there. So \nnot only did we defeat the legislation, but both Senator Feingold and \nCongressman Oberstar, who were the sponsors of the bill, were defeated \nin the next election too. We have all these things. We have endangered \nspecies. These are all part of this committee. So it is overregulation \nthat is consuming most of our time.\n  Repairing our roads and bridges is an area where everyone agrees. You \nhave to keep in mind, this bill passed--our bipartisan bill--\nunanimously out of committee, not one vote against.\n  I am prepared to yield the floor because I understand the Senator \nfrom Indiana is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Oklahoma \nfor his recent statement. I also understand he is willing to help \nrelieve me a little bit, as I am the next Presiding Officer. I \nappreciate that. I will relieve him of that responsibility as soon as I \nfinish my remarks.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  As many know, I have, since February, been coming to the Senate \nfloor--now 18 different times--to highlight waste, fraud, and abuse \nwithin the Federal Government. The Senator from Oklahoma was talking \nabout his committee, which he runs in such an efficient and effective \nway--I am particularly taken with the overregulation under this \nadministration. It resonates with me. It is killing our farmers. It is \nkilling our small businesses.\n  We are all for safe, sound, cost-effective regulations that address \nsafety and health. No one is trying to undo those, but we have an \nagency that is running amuck with ideological determinations on the \nbasis of what ``they think is best'' for the country, regardless of \nwhat numbers come up, what impact they have--what negative impacts. No \none has better led this effort than the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nInhofe. I thank him for that.\n  But today I have come to talk about waste, abuse, and fraud. I have \nbeen down here 18 times since February, once a week. I could be down \nhere every day. I could be down here every hour. It is astounding the \namount of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars that has to pay for what has \nbeen categorized by neutral agencies--not on a partisan basis at all--\nas total waste, total fraud, and total abuse.\n  So here I am again, trying to do the best we can to make this \ngovernment more effective, more efficient, and more focused on the \nessential things it needs to do--wiping out, eliminating the abusive \nuse, the wasteful use, and the fraudulent use of hard-earned tax \ndollars.\n  Today, what I would like to speak about relates to the so-called \nAffordable Care Act. I think we found that a better title would have \nbeen the ``Unaffordable Care Act.'' But last week in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, we had the Director from GAO--a member from GAO, Mr. \nBagdoyan. He is the Director of Audit Services at the Government \nAccountability Office.\n  It was a fascinating hearing, but he came to report to us about \nabuses that are taking place or could take place with the Affordable \nCare Act enrollment. It is amazing. I would like to go over that. His \naudit team--this is his job. His job is to audit the spending of \ntaxpayer dollars. In this case, they looked at the Affordable Care Act \nenrollment process. They wanted to see whether the procedures that had \nbeen agreed to, to prevent people from abusing this in a fraudulent \nway--if they had been implemented at the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid, CMS.\n  So what they did is run an undercover so-called secret shopper \ninvestigation to test the internal controls of healthcare.gov to review \nhow the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services handle this new \nprogram. Particularly, this investigation was designed to determine how \neffective the administration's Federal health insurance exchange is \nprotecting against fraudulent applications. So it is a very narrowly \nfocused test and a very legitimate test to see if the agreed-upon \nmeasures and criteria for qualifying to enroll in health care, the \nObamaCare bill, have been put in place.\n  There are millions of people who have selected ObamaCare plans \nthrough healthcare.gov. Eight million Americans in 34 States have \nselected plans, and 87 percent of those have qualified for premium \nsubsidies. That alone adds up to tens of billions in subsidies each \nyear, all coming through healthcare.gov. That is an issue in and of \nitself. I am not here necessarily to address that. We can address that \nat another time.\n  But the key question was, if applicants misrepresent themselves with \nfake facts in order to receive those subsidies, would the folks at \nhealthcare.gov find those, catch them, and keep them from qualifying. \nUnfortunately, the answer is a resounding\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nno. The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, found that 11 out of \n12 fake applications received approval. For this investigation, GAO \ncreated false identities and used them to apply for premium tax \nsubsidies through the Federal health insurance exchange. They used fake \ndocuments or, in several cases, no documents at all. It was just a \ntest. So they would learn that either those applications would be \nturned down or that those restrictions which were designated--that \nthose running healthcare.gov knew what they needed to do and did what \nthey needed to do.\n\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services accepted 11 out of the \n12, accepted the fake documents, for some didn't even attempt to verify \ntheir authenticity, and as a result they enrolled those applicants. \nThey granted them thousands of dollars in premium tax subsidies. \nSpecifically, CMS awarded $30,000 in advanced premium tax credits to 11 \nof those 12 fraudulent applicants in 2014 alone.\n  As 2015 began, CMS then terminated coverage for 6 of those 11 fake \nindividuals, noting that they had not properly registered or provided \nnecessary documents. So it seemed then that, OK, the program turned out \nto work and CMS finally caught on to the fact that they were issuing \nsubsidies for fraudulent applications. Well, that optimism was very \nshort-lived because GAO then called CMS pretending to be those \nindividuals who had been turned down, and in five of the six cases, \nthey were able to get their coverage and subsidies restored without \nsubmitting any paperwork.\n  The system handles millions of applications with billions of dollars \nof subsidies, and they did not design a mechanism to identify fraud \neven though they had been told they were not identifying the fraud and \nnot putting the measures in place to do so.\n  Part of the problem is that the law is so gargantuan, it is nearly \nunworkable. But there is no excuse for these compliance numbers when \nbillions of taxpayer dollars are at stake.\n  Unfortunately, the administration continues to measure success by the \nnumber of people who have signed up for ObamaCare. Last year, the \nadministration rejoiced when reaching its enrollment goal and lauded it \nas proof the exchanges were working just fine. However, given the \nresults of this investigation, I wonder what percentage of those \nenrollees were real people providing real information and how many were \npeople providing no information or false information.\n  When the test revealed that 11 out of 12--that is a pretty high \npercentage. You can multiply that out over what you think might be \nhappening in the enrollment process, and there could be very \nsubstantial amounts of taxpayer money being paid in subsidies to people \nwho do not qualify.\n  Careful oversight of these programs for Federal benefits is of utmost \nimportance, whether it is CMS on ObamaCare or whether it is any other \nagency in government that is providing benefits to individuals. I have \nlisted many of those in my ``Waste of the Week'' speeches.\n  This government needs to--must and Congress must do better in terms \nof oversight to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent effectively and \nefficiently, and if not, returned to the taxpayers so they don't have \nto send them here to be wasted in the first place.\n  Clearly GAO used only a small number of claims, but imagine what \nhasn't been looked at or identified and what those numbers would be. \nThis is a canary in a coal mine. If this isn't an alarm bell of \ndysfunction, I don't know what it is.\n  Today I am not going to speculate on how much money has been wasted \nbecause of the acceptance of false applications, but I will put $30,000 \nof documented abuse of subsidies that were paid for under the GAO \ninvestigation. So it is just a little bump on our gauge as we head \ntoward $100 billion, and I have been told that next week's waste of the \nweek will take us to our goal of $100 billion. We had hoped to reach \nthat goal by the end of this year. We are way ahead of time. And, as I \nsaid, I could come down here every day or maybe every hour, given the \nwaste we are finding in this misuse of taxpayer money.\n  I thank the Chair again for helping me out on the time situation. I \nlook forward to relieving the Presiding Officer in the chair.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have so many elements of the bill that \nis under consideration now, the DRIVE Act. It is enjoyable to talk \nabout it. Yesterday we talked about the transparency, the fact that we \nhave a way that the public can know every dime.\n  I was watching as the Presiding Officer was giving a presentation on \nwaste in government. That is not the case here. If all government \nagencies had the transparency we are going to have with the DRIVE Act, \nwhere everyone is going to know on a day-to-day basis the progress of \nevery bridge, every highway that is being done, the renovations, then \nwe wouldn't be having that problem. We are doing it right.\n  You know, I look at these different parts of the bill. It is so big, \nyou can talk about it for a long period of time. Yesterday we went over \nnot all of the deficient bridges in the country but quite a few of \nthem, and when people stop and realize that people die unnecessarily \nbecause of deficiencies in our bridges--it is a serious thing.\n  But one of the parts of this bill that people are not aware of as \nmuch as they should be is the freight section of the bill, transporting \nfreight around. We talked about the history. We talked about the fact \nthat the first bill that came along for a transportation \nreauthorization bill back in 1956 was primarily for military purposes. \nNow we realize the deficiency--we are compared to China, compared to \nother countries in not keeping up our highway system.\n  Today the National Highway System carries more than 55 percent of the \nNation's highway traffic and 97 percent of the truck freight traffic. \nOf the 4 million miles of public roads, the National Highway System \nrepresents 5.5 percent of the Nation's most heavily traveled miles of \nroad. That 5.5 percent carries 97 percent of the freight.\n  Americans depend on a well-maintained National Highway System that \nprovides critical connections between urban and rural communities. \nAmerican businesses pay an estimated $27 billion a year in extra \nfreight transportation costs due to the poor condition of public roads, \nwhich increases shipping delays and raises prices on everyday \nproducts. Recognizing that it is the foundation of the Nation's economy \nand the key to the Nation's ability to compete in the global economy, \nit is essential that we focus efforts to improve freight movement on \nthe National Highway System.\n\n  You know, in all the bills--and I have been involved in six of these \nover the years--we have never really singled out freight to be \naddressed. Yet there is no one in here who hasn't gone down our roads \nand highways and seen the congestion and the traffic and trucks idling \nhere and there and everyone being late, and there is a tremendous cost \nto that.\n  The DRIVE Act includes two new programs to help States deliver \nprojects that promote the safe, efficient, and reliable transportation \nof consumer goods and products. The first new program is the National \nFreight Program. The National Freight Program is distributed by a \nformula that will provide funds to all States to enhance the movement \nof goods, reduce costs, and improve the performance for businesses.\n  It is kind of interesting because one of the good features about a \ntransportation system and the way we have been doing it with our \nTransportation reauthorization bill is that we rely on the States to \ndecide what their priorities are. This infinite wisdom in Washington \nwhere they think they know more than we know in the States is not true \nat all. So this is one of the rare areas where we go to States and say: \nLook, you guys, you decide what you think your priorities are in \nIndiana or in Oklahoma. So we have a formula to address that.\n  The problem with that is when you get to moving freight, they do not \nhave\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nthat as a high priority because most freight moves through a State and \nthey do not consider that to be a local problem. They are more \nconcerned about passenger cars. So it doesn't appear in their \npriorities. Well, it does appear now.\n  So we have the first new program, the National Freight Program, which \nis a different type of formula, and it addresses the movement of \nfreight through States. The program will expand flexibility for both \nrural and urban areas to designate key freight corridors that match the \nregional movement of goods on roads. It will improve the efforts to \nidentify projects with a high return on investment through State \nfreight plans and State advisory committees.\n  The second program is the Assistance for Major Projects Program. It \ncreates a competitive grant program to provide funds to major projects \nof high importance to the community, to the region, and to the Nation. \nThe program includes a set-aside for rural areas and ensures an \nequitable geographic distribution of funds.\n  These new freight programs will only exist if the DRIVE Act is \nenacted. That is what we are talking about now--the DRIVE Act. And it \nwill be enacted by Congress, I am very confident.\n  I can't imagine, by the way, Members not listening to the people back \nhome. Right now, if you go back to any of the States--I don't care what \nState it is--and you talk to the State departments of transportation, \nthey will be listening to not just the road builders and suppliers but \nthe people who are driving on the roads. It is the most popular thing \nin America. So I can't imagine having the opportunity to have a 6-year \nprogram and getting justification for voting against it.\n  I think it is time to be innovative and forward-thinking in how the \nFederal programs use tax dollars to responsibly partner with the States \nto improve the National Highway System, and the DRIVE Act is the \nanswer.\n  Let's talk about Fort Lee, NJ. Here is the George Washington Bridge, \nwhich connects Fort Lee, NJ, to New York City. It is the second worst \nfreight bottleneck by congestion index in the Nation. Average speed \nslows to 29 miles an hour. Rush hour speeds in the morning and evenings \nslow to below 15 miles an hour. The nearby I-95 Cross Bronx Expressway \nis the most congested corridor in the country. The morning southbound \ncommute is considered the worst of the worst in the country. The George \nWashington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge. That is \nwhat we are looking at.\n  Yesterday we were talking about the Brooklyn Bridge. Some of us here \nare old enough to remember the old Tarzan movies. Do you guys remember \nthat? Do you watch the reruns? Johnny Weissmuller was his name. He had \na lot of muscles and was a very strong guy. One of his movies was \n``Tarzan's New York Adventure.'' In that movie he was being chased \naround the Brooklyn Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge was built in 1883 and \nhere we are today and we still have the Brooklyn Bridge. Anyway, Johnny \nWeissmuller crawled up on the top as the cops were chasing him with \nguns and all that and he dived off. Every time I drive over that \nbridge, I think I am going to be diving off there if it collapses.\n  Houston, TX, is home to 5 of the top 20 freight bottlenecks in the \nNation. Texas is home to 9 of the top 25 freight bottlenecks. Freight \nbottlenecks cost the freight industry in Texas some $671 million a \nyear--that is just in Texas, the bottlenecks--and 8.8 million hours of \ndelay.\n  I-45 at U.S. 59 is ranked third by the congestion index. I-45 at U.S. \n610 North is ranked 15. Average speed slows to 39 miles an hour. \nMorning and evening rush hour speeds drop way below that.\n  Look at this. You can see that is a problem. That is why this is a \nvery important part of the bill that is before us now.\n  I think we have an opportunity here. We have to sometimes remind \npeople of what doesn't work. What doesn't work are short-term fixes or \nshort-term extensions of previous bills that were passed. The last one \nwe passed was in 2005. It was a 5-year bill. It expired at the end of \n2009. At that time we should have started another transportation \nreauthorization bill, but we didn't do it. So we have had short-term \nextensions.\n  There is a guy named Gary Ridley out in Oklahoma who is recognized \nnationally. He has been here testifying several times before us as a \nnationally recognized scholar. He really understands transportation. If \nwe look at the 33 short-term extensions we have operated under here in \nAmerica after 2009 and before this bill, it wastes more dollars than a \nlong-term reauthorization.\n  I think it is important for a lot of people to hear this because \nsometimes there are rating organizations that say: Well, we are going \nto oppose a bill because it is a big spending bill. Sure it is a big \nspending bill. You know, that old, worn-out document called the \nConstitution says what we are supposed to be doing here is defending \nAmerica and building bridges and roads. So that is what this is all \nabout, and we are going to do it. But for conservative groups to say \nthey don't want to support this bill--they have dropped short of \nunderstanding the fact that the alternative is to have short-term \nextensions, which is an irresponsible use of dollars. The conservative \nposition is to pass a funded highway reauthorization bill.\n  I know a lot of people will be talking about devolution. I can talk \nabout this because going back 25 years ago, at that time a guy named \nConnie Mack, who was a House Member and later a Senator from Florida--\nhe and I were the fathers of devolution. You didn't know that, did you? \nWe are the ones who introduced the devolution bill. The idea sounded \ngood on the stump because you could say: Well, we will just repeal all \nthe Federal taxes and make State taxes out of them.\n  Well, it didn't quite work that way because you can't do that. If you \nrepeal a Federal tax, then you have to pass a State tax. And how many \npeople here are naive enough to believe that all 48 contiguous States \nwould be willing to pass a sizable State tax increase? It is not going \nto happen. So that is why the National Highway System is so important. \nThat is why Eisenhower started this back in 1956.\n  I have friends up in Wyoming. There are very few people in Wyoming, \nbut there are a lot of roads that are part of our National Highway \nSystem. If devolution occurred in Wyoming, they would have to pass a \n31-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase in Wyoming. It is not going to \nhappen. We know it is not going to happen. So we are not going to have \na uniform system unless we do it this way.\n  The opportunity we have now is the DRIVE Act. I know the House has \nmade some statements that they want to do a 5-month extension. See, \nthere we go again, another short-term extension. Their reasoning, I \nguess, is they want to get to the year's end and then couple that--\nbecause of the popularity of the highway bill--with some of the tax \nchanges that are set to take place at the first of this coming year.\n  So I know some of my friends--because I have talked to them over in \nthe House--have said: Well, we want a short-term bill because we don't \nthink you are going to pass a long-term bill in the Senate.\n  Well, when they find out we are going to pass a long-term bill--we \nare going to pass this bill--that will change things. So I look forward \nto that, to the opportunity to get this passed and get it passed in a \ntimely fashion.\n  By the way, we have to keep in mind that we are on a deadline. The \ndeadline is the end of this month. The highway trust fund runs out of \nmoney at that time, so that is why it is important that we get this \npassed.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from \n12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. and that the time during the recess count \npostcloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 22.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about critical \nlegislation before the Senate regarding our Nation's transportation \nregulatory framework and infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\n  As an active member of the Senate commerce committee and the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I am proud of the work my \ncolleagues and I have done to develop a strong, comprehensive bill that \nkeeps our Nation moving by making our transportation system safer and \nmore efficient, while also increasing our global competitiveness. As \nmany may know, my father was the director of the Nebraska Department of \nRoads. Through his service--and by osmosis--I gained a deep \nappreciation for infrastructure projects and enabling them to move \nforward in Nebraska and elsewhere.\n  I have spoken with families, consumers, workers, and business owners \nall across the State of Nebraska. The message is loud and clear. \nNebraskans want a long-term highway bill. Nebraskans want to bring \ncertainty to local projects and increase safety on the roads and \nhighways.\n  In the coming days, the Senate has the opportunity to provide our \nconstituents with just that--a 6-year transportation bill that will \nhelp vital projects get up and running.\n  The bill enhances safety, makes much-needed regulatory reforms, and \nincreases investment in our Nation's infrastructure.\n  I appreciate the work that Chairmen Thune and Inhofe and Senator \nBoxer and their committee staff members have accomplished with the \nDRIVE Act.\n  The DRIVE Act will reauthorize surface transportation programs for 6 \nyears--something I have long advocated--to provide certainty for \nStates, businesses, families, and the traveling public. Most \nimportantly, the bill advances key provisions to ensure that local \ninfrastructure projects in my State will move forward with a better and \nmore defined process from the onset.\n  Throughout the process of developing this bill, I worked with local \nstakeholders in Nebraska, including our State department of roads, \nhighway builders, consultants, and transportation leaders. The \nmeaningful changes I championed will provide better coordination \nbetween the Federal Highway Administration and States on streamlining \nenvironmental permitting and review and programmatic agreement \ntemplates when initiating new infrastructure projects.\n  More specifically, the bill will establish procedures, based on a \ntemplate developed by the Transportation Secretary, allowing States, in \naddition to the Federal Government, to determine which State or Federal \nagencies must be consulted prior to beginning an infrastructure \nproject.\n  In addition, the bill provides technical assistance to States that \nwant to assume responsibility for reviews of categorical exclusion \nprojects, which are a category of projects that don't have a \nsignificant impact on the environment, triggering a less arduous level \nof environmental review.\n  My provision would help States provide their own certification \nregarding the appropriate level of environmental review of certain \nprojects, rather than wasting time and taxpayer dollars waiting for the \nFederal Government to provide the assessments.\n  Given Nebraska's challenges with starting and completing \ninfrastructure projects, these elements of the DRIVE Act offer a major \nstep forward for transportation projects in my State. I appreciate all \nof the input my office received from Nebraska's transportation \nstakeholders on these crucial issues.\n  The bill also includes major components of a bill I introduced \nearlier this summer called the TRUCK Safety Reform Act. The legislation \noffers important regulatory reforms to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration, or FMCSA, and encourages stronger regulatory analysis, \nmore transparency, and wider public participation in this regulatory \nprocess.\n  The bill also provides regulatory relief to agricultural producers in \nNebraska, reforms research at the Department of Transportation to \nreduce duplication across the modal administrations, and it addresses \nthe challenges of the CSA truck scoring program.\n  I am also pleased that the bill establishes a new freight program to \nprioritize, increase efficiency, and lower the cost of the movement of \nfreight imports and exports throughout our Nation.\n  The freight program will help America's transportation system \ncontinue to facilitate expanding U.S. trade flows.\n  The DRIVE Act further incorporates performance-based regulations into \nour Nation's transportation system. Performance-based measures will \noffer States more flexibility in meeting the goals of infrastructure-\nrelated regulations.\n  Furthermore, the reforms to our transportation system will increase \nU.S. global competitiveness and strengthen safety on our Nation's \nroads. They will also provide certainty to States and local \ngovernments, businesses, consumers, workers, and families.\n  Although this bill does not include every single provision for which \nI initially advocated, I was willing to compromise. I was willing to \ncompromise for the greater good of our country's transportation \nnetwork. I truly appreciate Senator Boxer's willingness to negotiate in \ngood faith.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this essential \nlegislation. It is time for us to address our Nation's transportation \nchallenges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I repeatedly have come down to the Senate \nfloor to talk about our budget issues. Earlier this morning I talked \nabout my 18th waste of the week--looking at waste, fraud, and abuse in \nterms of government spending and a waste of taxpayers' dollars.\n  The first 4 years of this 6-year term that I am enjoying and \nparticipating in, I have been consumed with the issue of our continuing \ndeficit spending and increasing national debt.\n  I was part of a group working directly with the President in an \neffort for many months with his top people to reach an agreement on how \nto address our long-term budget situation. It is no secret that under \nthis administration the national debt has almost doubled. It is \nstaggering to think that over the 230 or 240 years of the life of this \ncountry we have gone from $10.6 trillion to now $18.8 trillion of debt. \nIt is going to have consequences.\n  As chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, we recently released \nsome information entitled ``Ten Things to know about CBO's Long-Term \nBudget Outlook.'' This is something we spent a great deal of time \ndebating years ago, but it has fallen under the radar. We are obviously \ndealing with issues that are important. This Iran deal that has just \nbeen signed by the administration deserves intense concentration and \nconsideration in terms of how we address it. We also have the \ncontinuing economic malaise and slow recovery from the recession.\n\n  We have a number of issues we need to address, such as highway \nfunding, health care, and so forth. These are all important issues. But \nunderlying all of this is a fundamental issue that has not been \naddressed, and if it is not addressed, it will have significant and \nadverse consequences for the American people, not just for future \ngenerations but even for our own generation.\n  I keep trying to bring us back to this gorilla in the room that we \nignore and keep thinking we will deal with it later. It has been passed \non, and the so-called can has been kicked down the road election after \nelection, through different Presidents and resulting in more and more \nnegative consequences for the American people.\n  Our Joint Economic Committee just recently released ten things we \nneed to know about the Congressional Budget Office's long-term budget \noutlook.\n  No. 1, the United States cannot rely on borrowing forever. This is \nnot a complex issue. If you continue to borrow more money and don't pay \nyour bills, eventually the tax collector is at the door. With the tax \ncollector being at the door, this means eventually investors will \ndemand higher and higher interest rates because we don't have the \nconfidence the United States is going to be able to pay its bills.\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\n  No. 2, mandatory spending skyrockets. We all have known the spending \nfor Medicare and Medicaid and entitlements is running amok and it needs \nto be addressed on a long-term fix.\n  No. 3, according to CBO, ``The large amount of debt could also \ncompromise national security by constraining defense spending in times \nof international crisis or by limiting the country's ability to prepare \nfor such a crisis.'' Look at the world today. It is aflame. Yet we are \ncutting our defense at historically low rates of readiness in terms of \ndealing with this. So while the threat increases daily and is right \nthere before us, we are slashing our spending on defense and national \nsecurity because we cannot afford it due to the entitlements eating all \nof this up.\n  No. 4, bankruptcy looms for Social Security. We stand here and \npretend like everything is fine and everybody is going to continue to \nreceive their Social Security checks, no problem. CBO projects that \nbankruptcy looms for Social Security. The report that just came out \nfrom the trustees has basically said that within a relatively short \nperiod of time Social Security is going to hit bankruptcy. What does \nthat mean? That means dramatic cuts in Social Security benefits to \npeople who have counted on using Social Security to help for their \nretirement or dramatic tax increases to cover the deficit.\n  There is a portion of Social Security--the Social Security disability \nbenefits--that the trustees said is going broke next year. We are more \nthan halfway through 2015, and CBO projects that by the end of 2016 the \nSocial Security disability fund will be going bankrupt. That is what \nhas been said here. If you don't trust my words, read the--not my \nfavorite newspaper but one that usually gets its facts right--the New \nYork Times. Today's New York Times has a major article: ``Social \nSecurity Disability Benefits Face Cuts in 2016, Trustees Say.'' I will \nquote a couple of items which are written in this issue:\n\n       Eleven million people face a deep, abrupt cut in disability \n     insurance benefits in late 2016 if Congress fails to \n     replenish Social Security's disability trust fund, which is \n     running out of money.\n\n  That statement was issued by the administration.\n\n       Officials expressed concern about the program as they \n     issued their annual report on the financial condition of \n     Medicare and Social Security, which together account for 40 \n     percent of all federal spending.\n       The trustees of Social Security . . . said the disability \n     trust fund would be depleted in the last quarter of 2016. \n     After that, they said, benefits would automatically be cut by \n     19 percent because revenues, largely from payroll taxes, \n     would be sufficient to cover only 81 percent of scheduled \n     benefit payments.\n\n  Folks, we have been warning about this for years, not doing anything \nabout it, and we now have this report from the trustees who oversee \nthese funds, and the report, as published by the New York Times today, \nsays this thing is going broke next year and cuts will be 19 percent \nbecause we don't have the money to pay for it. You would think the \nalarm bells would be sounding. You would think we would finally \nunderstand we are hitting the wall on spending and that we would \nfinally step up and do something about runaway entitlement mandatory \nspending or everybody will end up paying the price.\n  I will add one more point from the New York Times:\n\n       The trustees, in their report, said that the squeeze on the \n     disability program was ``but the first manifestation of \n     larger financial imbalances facing Social Security as a \n     whole, as well as Medicare.''\n\n  Where is AARP? Where are the people in retirement who say don't touch \na penny of my Social Security or Medicare benefits, when the trustees \nsay don't worry, we will not have to touch a penny of it; the program \nis going broke on its own.\n  For all of us who have been pleading to do something to address this \nissue, it is not even being talked about. Yet anybody who comes to the \nfloor and says this kind of stuff is immediately pilloried by AARP: Oh, \nthey are going to go off and cut our Social Security. No. It is going \nto automatically happen because we haven't addressed the issue. So \ndon't criticize us for trying to address an issue that will cut your \nbenefits by 19 percent or cause the program to go broke. Support those \nwho have had the courage to stand and say: Folks, we have to do \nsomething about this. If you want to continue and guarantee Social \nSecurity benefits when people retire or give them Medicare coverage \nwhen they retire and need it, something has to be done now or there \nwill be massive cuts. That is not just a Republican or conservative \nstanding and saying that we are spending too much money and we have to \ncut back on that; the trustees who oversee the programs are warning us \nand saying you have to do something or everybody is going to take not \njust a haircut but a major cut.\n  A couple of other things came out on the budget term outlook. The \nFederal debt has nearly doubled since President Obama was elected. It \nnow stands at 74 percent of the economy. The Federal debt has nearly \ndoubled since the President was elected. What a legacy. Why in the \nworld would a President of the United States with a responsibility to \noversee the fiscal basis of what makes this country work and to commit \nto people that he will address problems as they occur--if this was a \nprivate business, it would be in bankruptcy. Nobody would buy the stock \nof this business. Nobody would buy bonds of this business. Nobody would \ninvest in this business because it is totally dysfunctional and it is \ntotally going broke. Yet the Federal Government has printing presses \ndown in the basement and they keep printing out dollars. That decreases \ntheir value to cover our debts, and they continue to tell people to go \nahead and loan money to the States. We are also going to keep taking \nyour taxes, but buy our bonds and don't worry because we are going to \npay them back--not at this rate. We are heading toward the wall, we are \nin the crisis, and we are not doing anything about it.\n  No. 6, and the last point. Hopefully, CBO, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, made correct assumptions. Their warnings are based on \nassumptions and hopefully we will make some efforts and prevent some of \nthis, but if they are off by just three-quarters of 1 percentage point, \nit will result in a dramatic change of raising the Federal debt from \n111 percent of the economy by 2039 to 159 percent of the economy. You \nknow who has those numbers? Greece. Japan is careening toward that \ncatastrophe.\n  If you want to see a model or example of what happens to a country \nthat allows its debt to run unchecked and to hit the 100-percent mark \nof its total economy, just take a look at what is happening in Greece. \nNone of us wants to see that happen, but we have far too few alarm \nbells sounding in this country because it is happening. This isn't just \nRepublican or conservative propaganda. This is the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It is not Republican, it is not Democratic, it is totally \nneutral. It is math. It is numbers. It has nothing to do with ideology. \nIt has everything to do with numbers that ought to be driving us \nto deal with this issue, standing up to our constituents and saying, \nregardless of the political consequences, folks, just do the math. It \nis pretty simple math. If we don't do something, everyone is going to \npay the price.\n\n  For those organizations--and I call out AARP--that scare people with \nmail and phone calls and everything else saying that they are going to \ncut your Social Security and take some money away from your disability \nbenefits, that is not what we want to do. We want to guarantee what we \nhave promised to people, but if we don't take these actions, it will \nautomatically happen. So we need the support of everybody who has \nconcern not just about my generation, who are retiring in record \nnumbers, but about the future for our children and grandchildren. What \nis this country going to be if we can't take these steps?\n  I get exercised about this, and it is why I came back. It is one of \nthe two main reasons I decided to run for the Senate again. I was \nworried about terrorist attacks and the nightmare of a marriage between \nweapons of mass destruction and terrorist groups impacting our country \nand the world. But while we seem to be struggling to address the terror \nissue and having some success--at least we are aware of it on a daily \nbasis--we are letting this fiscal crisis go by without even talking \nabout it. I think everybody is exhausted. We have had exhausting \nexchanges. We\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\nhave had bipartisan Democrats and Republicans working together and \npleading with the President and the White House, starting with Simpson-\nBowles, which was a bipartisan effort. The Gang of 6, the Committee of \n12, the supercommittee were all bipartisan efforts.\n  I was part of the dinner group, which was an effort to plead with the \nPresident to do something together to address this problem and being \nturned down time after time after time. Now we are sailing toward the \nend of this Presidency, and obviously nothing is going to be done even \nthough the Social Security trust fund is going to expire on the \nPresident's watch. They will come up with some gimmick and shift some \nmoney around and so forth, thereby just putting us further in debt and \nkicking the can down the road. They have to cover this because \npolitically they will not allow this to happen, but they will do it in \na way that makes our situation even worse.\n  As the President careens toward retirement and his legacy, one of \nthose legacies will be questioned by people for years and years into \nthe future: Why didn't we do something when we had the chance on a \nbipartisan basis with support from both parties? Why was the President \nso adamant about not doing anything to address this problem?\n  Time is running out. Social Security disability will collapse under \nthe President's leadership before he escapes at the end of 2016. You \ncan tell how frustrated I am, but I will keep coming down here and \ntalking about this stuff and hopefully--well, we don't want it to \nhappen under a crisis. We don't want to be days away from bankruptcy, \nso we move some money around in the Federal budget and so forth and so \non, take it from Peter to pay Paul, put us further in debt, and then \nkick the can down the road.\n\n  I feel for the next President, whoever that might be. They are going \nto get a can of worms because we didn't do anything about this during \nthis tenure.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermonters--like many Americans--are \nfrustrated. They are frustrated when they see short-term patches that \ndo not make investments in our crumbling infrastructure. They are \nfrustrated with seeing meaningful policy advance, while Congress \nbickers over how to pay for it--and at what expense to other critical \nprograms.\n  Passing a long-term authorization to make needed improvements to our \naging roads and bridges is a matter of common sense. It is a matter of \nsafety. And quite frankly, for us in Congress, it's our job.\n  After 11 short-term extensions over the course of 3 years, Congress \nfinally approved MAP-21 in 2012. Now, two short-term extensions later \nand faced with another expiration deadline, we have a choice: another \npatch, or pass a meaningful, long-term transportation authorization \nthat will give our States the ability to build and repair roads, \nbridges, and byways, to promote rail safety and transit, and to invest \nin the critical infrastructure that supports our cities and towns, \nenables interstate and intrastate commerce, and creates jobs for \nAmerican workers. The time to pass a plan for long-term transportation \nfunding is now.\n  Vermonters take great pride in our historic downtowns and small \ncommunities. In our cities and towns, we have a culture of getting \nthings done. We find a way to accomplish our shared goals. But, when \nthose shared goals rely largely on a Federal funding stream that is \nunreliable at best, and uncertain at worst, it makes it impossible to \ndouble down on the investments needed to keep the cars, buses, and \ntrucks moving on our roads. We can invest in bridges and roads \noverseas. We do it all the time. We decided to spend a couple of \ntrillion dollars in Iraq. We didn't use any offsets; we just put it on \nthe credit card. As one Vermonter said to me back home: We spend \nbillions upon billions of dollars to build roads and bridges over \nthere, and then they blow them up. Why don't we spend a little bit of \nthat money here at home, and we will take care of those roads and \nbridges?\n  As much as we invest in bridges and roads overseas, we must do so \nright here at home. Look at this bridge show in this picture I have in \nthe Chamber. It is located in East Montpelier, just about 5 miles from \nwhere I was born. It was built in 1936--the year my parents were \nmarried. It is in dire need of repair. Weather, the sometimes very \nharsh Vermont climate, age, and traffic volume--more than 4,400 \nvehicles cross it per day, 10 percent of which are trucks--have led to \nthe deterioration of the bridge. It is one of nearly 300 long and short \nbridges in Vermont that have been deemed structurally deficient. The \nEast Montpelier Bridge remains open--at least for now. It will be \nreplaced in 2018, with a price tag of $7.3 million, about 2 minutes' \nworth of the money we wasted in Iraq. It is an issue of safety. It is \nan issue of economic certainty. It is a commonsense investment that has \nbeen delayed for too long because resources are far too scarce. I am \nwilling to bet the same could be said of all 50 States represented in \nthis body.\n  We all agree that a long-term transportation bill means safe bridges, \npaved roads, and completed railways. But it also encourages innovative \nprojects that incorporate public health, environmental, and social \nincentives. Look no further than Burlington, VT. A picturesque town \nnestled on the shores of Lake Champlain, it is home to a variety of \ninnovative entrepreneurs and businesses, from high-tech hubs to \nspecialty food producers. As our businesses and communities grow, \nVermonters depend on safe and reliable modes of transportation to keep \nthem connected.\n  Church Street is a pedestrian-only street that welcomes locals and \nvisitors to enjoy the many vibrant shops and restaurants. As businesses \nbegin to sprawl beyond the limits of Church Street and settle into new \nhomes along Pine Street, the city has invested in safe modes of travel \nto ensure accessibility. The Bike Path Rehabilitation Project and the \nSafe Streets Collaborative are projects that consider the needs of the \ncommunity as a whole--either in a vehicle, on foot, or pedaling.\n  Main Street--the heart of any Vermont downtown--is home to small \nbusinesses and services such as post offices, grocery stores, medical \noffices, and banks. In a rural State such as Vermont, investing in our \ninfrastructure extends beyond bridges and roads. It is sidewalk repair. \nIt is establishing crosswalks. It is widening roads to provide for \nparking, and it is installing such basic things as street lighting, \nrefuse receptacles and landscaping.\n  After many years of economic decline in downtown Barre--one of our \nlarger cities--the city's Main Street was left with empty storefronts \nand lonely streets. The community introduced the Big Dig--a multiyear \neffort to revitalize Main Street and City Hall Park. With funding \nsourced from Downtown Transportation Grants and Federal funding sourced \nthrough the Agency of Transportation, 200 State employees were able to \nrelocate into a new office building in the heart of downtown.\n  Look at the before and after pictures. The differences are stark. \nThese are the kinds of Federal investments, coupled with investments \nfrom States and towns, that can revitalize communities across the \ncountry. This project brought life back into Main Street. Businesses \nfilled vacant office spaces, restaurants opened their doors, and the \nsidewalks welcomed locals and visitors alike. The transportation \nfunding went beyond just improving the physical infrastructure; it was \nan investment in\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\nthe health and economy of the community.\n  The highway trust fund is not just about infrastructure; it is about \njobs--jobs that cannot be shipped overseas.\n  Earlier this year, I met with Jeff Tucker, the president of Dubois & \nKing. D is a Vermont owned and based consulting engineering firm \nwhich employs 100 people, including about 80 Vermonters. Jeff's \nfrustration was clear: short-term highway trust fund extensions \nparalyze the ability of States and municipalities to plan. Jeff's \ncompany provides high quality engineering jobs with an average annual \nsalary of over $71,000. These jobs come with full benefits--health \ncare, paid vacation, sick and holiday paid time off and retirement \npackages.\n  A significant portion of his business includes transportation-related \nengineering projects that originate from the Vermont Agency of \nTransportation. The Vermont Agency of Transportation creates a \nstatewide plan based on the State's known Federal transportation \nfunding share--something the agency has not been able to count on in a \nlong time. There are thousands more examples of businesses around the \ncountry hampered in the same way. In a State like Vermont, a short-term \nconstruction season paired with a short-term funding stream is a \nterrible combination, for both the State and the companies that provide \nthese services.\n  Now the Senate is debating how to move forward with a long-term \ninvestment in our roads and bridges and railways. It is an important \ndebate. There is a lot about this policy proposal that I support. I \nshare the concerns, however, of many that it will undermine the safety \nof riders, bikers, and pedestrians.\n  The policy is not perfect, but how we pay for it should also be \nconsidered. The highway trust fund has been supported for the most part \nby a user-fee driven system. Our roads and byways need our attention, \nbut a long-term extension of this authorization, paid for by robbing \nfrom other critical programs, is as unsustainable as a network of \nshort-term patches.\n  America is starving for real, certain infrastructure investment. The \nhighway trust fund cannot limp forward on a continued series of short-\nterm extensions. Our country's progress is being stalled, and it is \ntime we start building for our future.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, last week the junior Senator from Arkansas objected to \na request to vote on any of the five nominations to the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims. They have been waiting for 10 months for a vote. He did \nnot want to debate the merits of any of these eminently qualified \nnominees. I think the junior Senator is dusting off the Republican \nplaybook from the last Congress to try to do to the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims what he could not do to the DC Circuit.\n  The caseload statistics of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims--as in \nother courts--have increased and decreased at various times. This does \nnot mean that one Republican should be permitted to put up a wholesale \nblockade of nominees to a specific court preventing every single one of \nthem from being considered on their merit by the full Senate. \nFurthermore, in contrast to the assertions made by the junior Senator \nfor Arkansas, the number of new cases filed with the court since 2007 \nhas actually increased by 13.4 percent.\n  Early in the last Republican administration, there was discussion \nabout the caseload of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, but no Senate \nRepublican voiced concern then. In fact, during the Bush \nadministration, the Senate confirmed nine judges to the CFC--with the \nsupport of every Senate Republican. Only three CFC judges nominated by \nPresident Obama have received confirmation votes. This is the same \ndouble standard that Senate Republicans tried to apply to President \nObama's D.C. Circuit nominees, when they filibustered and refused to \npermit any of President Obama's three pending D.C. Circuit nominees \nfrom receiving a vote last Congress.\n  Not a single Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee raised a \nconcern about the CFC's caseload either during the committee hearings \non these nominations last year or during the committee debate last year \nor this year. In blocking these five nominees, the junior Senator from \nArkansas ignores the Senate Judiciary Committee's unanimous votes on \nthese nominations in 2014 and again this year. He also disregards the \nchief judge who speaks on behalf of the entire court and the five past \npresidents of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Bar Association who have \nurged the Senate to fill these vacancies.\n  In 2003, the now-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee engaged \nin a debate on the caseload of this court. He said then: ``I feel it is \nunfair to these Court of Federal Claims nominees to deny them a seat by \nbringing up this point at this late date.'' I hope that the junior \nSenator from Arkansas will heed these words and remove his objection to \nan up or down vote on these nominees. If he personally does not believe \nthese judges need to be confirmed, he can certainly vote against them.\n  The fact is that all five of these nominees are impeccably qualified. \nOne of the nominees, Armando Bonilla, would be the first Hispanic judge \nto hold a seat on the court, but the junior Senator from Arkansas \nobjected. The nominee is strongly endorsed by the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation and has spent his entire career--now spanning over two \ndecades--as an attorney for the Department of Justice. He was hired out \nof law school in the Department's prestigious Honors Program, and has \nrisen to become the Associate Deputy Attorney General in the \nDepartment.\n  Another nominee, Jeri Somers, retired with the rank of lieutenant \ncolonel in the U.S. Air Force, but the junior senator from Arkansas \nobjected. The nominee spent over two decades serving first as a Judge \nAdvocate General and then as a Military Judge in the U.S. Air Force and \nthe District of Columbia's Air National Guard. In 2007, she became a \nBoard judge with the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals and \ncurrently serves as its vice chair.\n  Mr. Bonilla and Ms. Somers are just two of the five nominees being \nblocked from consideration by one Senator. Both of them have dedicated \nthe majority of their careers in service to our Nation. They deserve \nbetter than the treatment they are receiving from this Senate. I urge \nthe Senate majority leader to move to confirmation votes on these well \nqualified nominees without further delay.\n  Since President Obama was sworn in as President of the United States, \nI am afraid Republicans have made it their priority to obstruct \nnominations put forward.\n  More than half a year into this new Congress, the Republican \nleadership has scheduled votes to confirm only five judicial nominees. \nLet me contrast that with the last 2 years of President George W. \nBush's tenure. Democrats had taken over the Senate majority. If we \ntreated Republican President Bush that way the new Republican Senate \nmajority is treating Democratic President Obama only five judges would \nhave been confirmed by today in 2007. Instead, we confirmed 25 district \nand circuit court judges by July 23, 2007.\n  Let me say that again because I want to make it clear that we would \nnot play politics with judges because they are supposed to be outside \nof politics. By this time in the last 2 years of President Bush's term, \nwhen I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we had moved 25 judges \nthrough the process to confirmation. Today's Republican leadership has \nallowed only five of President Obama's judicial nominees to be \nconfirmed.\n  In the last 2 years of President Bush's tenure the Democratic \nmajority moved 68 district and circuit judges through the process to \nconfirmation. And today, we find Republicans objecting to even \nconsidering highly qualified men and women to these judgeships. In the \nlast 2 years of the Reagan term a Democratic majority confirmed 85 \njudges.\n  Twenty-five by this time in 2007, 68 in all during the last 2 years \nof President Bush's term. Only five for President Obama. Seventeen by \nthis time in the last 2 years of President Reagan's term, 85 in all. \nOnly five for President Obama.\n  You know all this does is politicize the Federal judiciary. They are \nan independent branch of government. The Senate ought to be confirming \nthem. Let's not have a double standard. We made it clear we would not \ndo\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nthat with President Reagan and President Bush. We shouldn't do it with \nPresident Obama.\n  It is up to the majority leader and the Senate Republicans to \ndemonstrate that they are not applying a double standard that is solely \ndriven by who occupies the White House. The Senate should be confirming \nthese long delayed U.S. Court of Federal Claims nominees and then \nproceeding to nine other judicial nominees pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar.\n  I see my good friend on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a very important \namendment that Senator Feinstein and I will be offering to the \ntransportation bill when we move to consideration. That vote may be \naround 2 a.m., and then the clock will tick. But then at some point on \nSunday, I am hoping that we will begin the process of considering \namendments and, chief among them, should be the Feinstein-Wicker \namendment to the bill regarding truck-length increases. Our amendment \nwould authorize the Secretary of Transportation to require a truck \nsize-and-weight study before promulgating a rule to increase the \nminimum length limitation for trucks.\n  Now I show to my colleagues and I show to the Presiding Officer a \nposter. What I am showing is a picture, a drawing of what we call twin \n33's. This is the tractor trailer. Here is a 33-foot trailer, and here \nis another 33-foot trailer tacked on to the back of that. So twin 33's \nare long trucks--longer than is allowed in 39 States.\n  So far we have let the States make the decision about whether to \naccept these, and some 39 of our Federal States have decided: No, we \ndon't want trucks this long with the twin 33 trailers on them in our \nStates.\n  Our amendment would accept that decision on the part of the States. \nOur decision would allow those 39 States to continue to make that \ndecision. Of course, the States that want trucks that long can make \nthat decision themselves.\n  Why are we having to offer such an amendment on this highway and \ntransportation bill? Because the Appropriations Committee, by a very \nclose margin of some 16 yeses and 14 noes, has decided otherwise. \nUnless we act as a Senate, that legislation on the appropriations side \nof things will go forward and will become the law of the land, telling \n39 States that they cannot make their own decisions on twin 33's.\n  So we would allow the States to continue to make this decision while \nthe Secretary of Transportation promulgates a full rule to increase the \nminimum length limitation.\n  I will tell you that preliminary information from the U.S. Department \nof Transportation indicates that we don't need to go to mandatory twin \n33's. The U.S. Department of Transportation has concluded there should \nbe no change to the current maximum truck length limit allowed on \nFederal highways.\n  Their preliminary report goes on to say: ``The Department finds that \nthe current data limitations are so profound that no changes in the \nrelevant laws and regulations should be considered until these data \nlimitations are overcome.'' So that is the counsel of the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  I will say that I am not always bound by what the Federal departments \nsay. As a matter of fact, I would stress that decisions are better made \nby the States and State legislators, Governors, and transportation \ncommissions, but I do think it is instructive that even these people at \nthe Federal level are counseling against this idea of a Federal mandate \nto all 50 States that they must move to the twin 33's. So that is the \nU.S. Department of Transportation.\n  Why is Roger Wicker from Mississippi on the floor advocating for \nfederalism and advocating for States making their own decisions, \nbasically advocating against a Federal mandate for these long trucks?\n  I will tell you. I started hearing from folks. When this issue came \nbefore the Appropriations Committee, a group of people rose up and \nsaid: What are you doing? What are you thinking, mandating this to all \n50 States without their consent?\n  So who is for the Feinstein-Wicker amendment and opposed to mandatory \ntwin 33 trucks in all of our States? I will tell you who is opposed to \nit--advocates for highway and auto safety. AAA knows a little something \nabout getting around the United States of America. AAA is for the \nFeinstein-Wicker amendment. The National Troopers Coalition knows a \nlittle something about safety on the highways. They are opposed to \nmandatory twin 33's.\n  I will also tell you it is very interesting that as for the \nMississippi Trucking Association, you would think every trucker would \nwant to be for this, make more money, and get to haul more stuff. The \nMississippi Trucking Association contacted our office and said: We \ndon't want this. Senator Wicker, other Members of the Senate and the \nHouse, oppose this Federal mandate that is about to come out of the \nAppropriations Committee and pass the Feinstein-Wicker amendment. The \nMississippi Trucking Association is for our amendment and against twin \n33's, along with a host of other trucking associations from east to \nwest and from north to south.\n  I will tell you who else is opposed to mandatory twin 33's: the \nMississippi Sheriffs' Association and a host of other States' sheriffs \nassociations and the Mississippi Association of Chiefs of Police and a \nhost of other State associations of chiefs of police.\n  Did I mention that the Illinois State Senate unanimously passed a \nresolution in support of what the Feinstein-Wicker amendment would do \nand opposed mandatory twin 33's. The Illinois State Senate unanimously \npassed this resolution saying to the Congress: Leave it up to the State \nof Illinois. We know what is best for our State when it comes to \ninfrastructure. We know what is best for our State when it comes to the \nsafety of our citizens.\n  So it is people such as them. The Mississippi Transportation \nCommission, or MDOT, has passed a unanimous resolution asking us to \noppose twin 33's on a mandatory basis.\n  Why are people so opposed to these? They haul a whole lot more. \nObviously, some people would make a lot more money if they could have \nthis much area in their trailers to haul things. So why are people \nopposed to it?\n  Well, they are concerned about--for one thing--wear and tear on our \nNation's infrastructure. We are going to pass a bill, I hope, in a few \ndays and send it over to the House. We hope we get it sent to the \nPresident on a bipartisan basis, and we want to build some more \nhighways. We want to strengthen our bridges. Everyone within the sound \nof my voice knows we need to do that. It is a question of how to come \nup with the money, but the last thing we need to do is to authorize--\nnot authorize, mandate--something that is going to cause more wear and \ntear and that 39 States don't want because of the wear and tear.\n  Also, estimates are that this forced mandate, if it comes from \nWashington, DC--if the Feinstein-Wicker amendment or something like it \ndoesn't pass--will cost about $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion per year in \nadditional funding because of the pavement damage. It just doesn't \nstand to reason that you can mandate this sort of additional truck \nlength on the highways without more damage to the highways. It makes \nsense, and we have statistics to prove it.\n  Also, it is a matter of public safety. I will tell you that not every \ninterstate in my State of Mississippi is exactly straight and narrow. \nWe have some hills, and we have places where the curves are less \ndesirable than I would like them to be. We are told that stopping \ndistances are going to increase if we mandate this sort of thing on the \n50 States. There are longer stopping distances for double 33's than the \ntruck configuration we currently have on the roads in the United States \nof America. The double 33 trailers in some studies took 22 feet longer \nto stop than the current double 28's with normal operating brakes.\n  I have four grandchildren in Mississippi. I have two daughters with \nsmall children, two sons-in-law in Mississippi, and they are driving up \nand down these highways. I would just as soon they not have to compete \non the roads, on those curves.\n  On Waterworks Curve in Jackson, MS, I would rather my three \ngrandchildren not be in a van with a twin 33\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\ntrying to pass them. I just don't think it is safe for my children and \nmy grandchildren, and the State governments in 39 States apparently \nagree. If they decide they disagree, they have that right.\n  Also, I think that Senator Feinstein and I, with our amendment, are \nstanding up for small business. Do you know who can afford a twin 33 \ntractor-trailer rig, double 33's? The big guys. The big companies. You \nknow their names. They can afford to do this. And certainly one can \nunderstand why they would think it would be better for their business.\n\n  But I will tell you there is a reason why the Mississippi Trucking \nAssociation is opposed to this. They do not have the money to convert \nto a bunch of twin 33 double trailers. They would rather not do this. \nAs a matter of fact, this Federal mandate--if Congress decides to do \nthis, and I certainly hope we don't; I hope we don't think we are so \nsmart we can mandate this on 50 States--is going to put some small \ntruckers out of business. That is why the Mississippi Truckers \nAssociation passed a resolution. That is why they have contacted me.\n  And I will tell you this, Mr. President. While the American Trucking \nAssociation says they are for these twin 33's, the individual members \nof the ATA--the American Trucking Association--have come to me and \nsaid: Thank you, Senator Wicker, for standing up for our interests \nbecause we are small businesses and we can't afford to get in this \ncompetition. It will run us out of business to have to go out and make \na capital investment.\n  I would also make an argument just in the name of federalism. There \nis a reason we have 50 States. And, you know, my Republican Party won \nan election in November and we won control of this body. One of the \nthings we have said as Republicans is that we don't think all the \nwisdom resides here in Washington, DC. We don't like a lot of Federal \nmandates; we like States making decisions.\n  We made a bold statement last week that States should make their own \ndecisions and school boards locally should make their own decisions \nwith regard to education. I voted for that. I applaud that. It didn't \ngo as far as many on this side would have perhaps wanted, but we made a \nstrong statement that we wouldn't have a national education school \nboard policy; we would move more of the decisionmaking back to the \nStates. So why on Earth, a week and a half or 2 weeks later, would we \nmake a decision here in Washington, DC, that we know more about how to \ntake care of infrastructure; that we know more about truck lengths and \nmore about safety for our children and grandchildren here in \nWashington, DC, than State legislatures do? I just don't think we will \ndo that.\n  I urge my colleagues, while we have some time to debate, to get down \nto the floor. Let's talk about this issue. We will be standing in \nquorum calls and recesses subject to the call of the Chair for perhaps \nmost of this weekend. We have time to debate this issue now and for the \nfew moments it takes Sunday or Monday or Tuesday or whenever we \nactually vote on this. We are entitled to a vote, Mr. President, on \nthis germane amendment. And this is germane. It is not something \nextraneous, dealing with social issues or Planned Parenthood or any \nnumber of nongermane issues that I am sympathetic with. This is a \ntransportation issue. It is germane to the bill. The Senate needs to \nwork its will on this issue. It needs to go over to the House and they \nneed to work their will.\n  I think that once we think about this, I would say to the Presiding \nOfficer and to the rest of my colleagues, we will make the decision \nthat we ought to leave this issue up to the States. There is a reason \n39 States don't want to do this, in their considered opinion. We ought \nto respect that decision. We ought to do it in the name of federalism, \nin the name of the States having the right to do things a little \ndifferently in each State if they want to, in the name of safety, in \nthe name of infrastructure, and in the name of fairness.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for joining with me on this bipartisan \namendment, and I urge my colleagues, when the time comes--after the \nbrief debate on the floor on this issue has occurred--to vote yes in \nfavor of the Feinstein-Wicker amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 1858 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I call up the Roberts amendment for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on a motion to proceed. \nAmendments are not in order.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, when it is in order and I call up the \nRoberts amendment for consideration, I will thank my colleagues \nSenators Alexander, Burr, Cornyn, Cotton, Gardner, Risch, Sasse, \nBoozman, and Tillis for joining me on this amendment.\n  Today we ask our fellow colleagues to stand with us to protect the \nU.S. economy from $3.2 billion in retaliatory tariffs being applied to \nour exports to Canada and Mexico every year--every year.\n  A recent ruling from the World Trade Organization found, for the \nfourth and final time, that our Country of Origin Labeling Program for \nmeat--or what the acronym says is COOL, to which it is often referred--\nthat this labeling program violates our trade agreements with our two \nclosest trading partners.\n  This debate isn't about the merits of a particular labeling program \nor our opinions about how our beef or pork or chicken should be sold. \nNo, this debate is about a simple fact, and facts are stubborn things.\n  Whether you support COOL or whether you oppose COOL, the fact is that \nretaliation is coming unless the Senate acts to stop this program that \nthe WTO has found to be discriminatory.\n  Over the years, this body has attempted many times to craft a \nworkable COOL Program for all stakeholders while still living up to our \ninternational trade obligations. Congress, through directives in the \n2002 farm bill and the 2008 farm bill, required the establishment of \nCOOL for meat. Through regulations issued in 2009 and revised in 2013, \nthe Department of Agriculture made several attempts to implement a \nworkable and WTO-compliant COOL Program. However, as I mentioned \nearlier, again and again the WTO ruled in favor of Canada and Mexico. \nOn four occasions--four--our trade regulator ruled that the U.S. policy \ndid not live up to our international trade obligations and \ndisadvantaged our best trading partners, Canada and Mexico.\n  Some have suggested we should salvage this labeling program by once \nagain making more changes. However, simply changing certain aspects of \nthe program will not prevent the $3.2 billion in retaliation from \ndamaging our economy. Don't take my word for it. Here is a statement, \nissued just today, from the Canadian Government, which will determine \nwhether retaliation on U.S. products will take effect in the near \nfuture: ``The only acceptable outcome remains for the United States to \nrepeal COOL or face $3 billion in annual retaliation.''\n  I have worked with many of my colleagues over the years and over the \nlast few weeks to craft a solution that meets the needs of all \nstakeholders. However, after all of our work, it is clear that to \nprotect our economy--to ensure Canada and Mexico drop their pursuit of \nretaliation on U.S. exports--we must first take up the House-passed \nbill repealing COOL, a bipartisan bill that received 300 votes in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The damages Canada and Mexico are seeking are immense--over $3.2 \nbillion in sanctions on U.S. products is probable if we do not repeal \nCOOL--and these are not just agriculture products in the crosshairs. \nProducts including beef, pork, cherries, and ethanol--repeat, and \nethanol--wine, orange juice, jewelry, even mattresses, furniture, and \nparts for heating appliances are just some of the targets of Canadian \nretaliation. Mexico has yet to finalize their list, but we expect it to \nbe just as damaging.\n  California alone has $4 billion in exports to Canada at risk. \nFlorida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nJersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin each \nhave roughly $1 billion in exports from their State at risk from the \nCanadian retaliation alone.\n  I remind my colleagues that again today Canada released a statement \nin response to legislation authored by others that reaffirmed their \nposition: ``The U.S. Senate must follow the lead of the House of \nRepresentatives and put forward legislation that repeals COOL once and \nfor all.''\n  Now, I must emphasize to my colleagues that retaliation is fast \napproaching and the responsibility sits squarely on our shoulders to \navoid it. Regardless of what farm groups, the Department of \nAgriculture, or the USTR say or regardless of what some Members would \nlike, Canada and Mexico--and only Canada and Mexico--have the ability \nto halt retaliation.\n  So this takes me back to the beginning of my statement: It doesn't \nmatter if you support COOL or if you oppose COOL, you cannot ignore the \nfact that retaliation is imminent and that we must avoid it.\n  Repeal of mandatory COOL is necessary to protect the U.S. economy \nfrom damaging sanctions, and our amendment will accomplish just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \n``Statement from Ministers Ritz and Fast on Senator Stabenow's Proposed \nBill to amend U.S. Country of Origin Labelling (COOL)'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         (From Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, July 23, 2015]\n\n Statement From Ministers Ritz and Fast on Senator Stabenow's Proposed \n          Bill To Amend U.S. Country of Origin Labeling (COOL)\n\n(By Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz and International Trade Minister Ed \n                                 Fast)\n\n       Senator Stabenow's (COOL) 2.0 fails to address Canada's \n     concerns and would continue to undermine our integrated North \n     American supply chains. By continuing the segregation of and \n     discrimination against Canadian cattle and hogs, Senator \n     Stabenow's measure will harm farmers, ranchers, packers, \n     retailers and consumers on both sides of the border. This is \n     contrary to successive World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     decisions that have clearly ruled in Canada's favor.\n       The U.S. Senate must follow the lead of the House of \n     Representatives and put forward legislation that repeals COOL \n     once and for all.\n       The only acceptable outcome remains for the United States \n     to repeal COOL or face $3B in annual retaliation.\n       Canada will continue to stand up for the rights of our \n     cattle and hog producers to ensure this harm is ended and to \n     restore the value of our highly integrated North American \n     livestock market.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the DRIVE \nAct. I commend Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Boxer for their \nbipartisan work on this bill that passed out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee with a unanimous vote.\n  A long-term highway solution such as the DRIVE Act will provide our \nStates with the certainty they need to advance major road and bridge \nprojects. Passing a 6-year bill would be a great achievement for this \nCongress, especially in the context of our recent history, and I am \nhopeful we will seize this opportunity.\n  Several years ago, as a member of the House Transportation Committee, \nI strongly supported the last long-term highway bill that helped \nsupport major roads in West Virginia and around the country.\n  The 2005 highway bill was extended 10 separate times--10 times--\nbetween 2009 and 2012. During that period, States were only assured \nFederal funding for a period of weeks or months, making lasting \nimprovements to our highway infrastructure difficult, and it shows.\n  As we saw between 2009 and 2012, several short-term extensions \nresulted in fewer and more costly fixes. In 2012, we passed MAP-21 to \nreauthorize the highway program for 2 years. I served as a conferee on \nthat legislation.\n  MAP-21 was a strong bipartisan achievement that included a number of \nimportant reforms to streamline project delivery and help States \ncomplete their projects more efficiently and economically, but \nultimately MAP-21 was a 2-year bill.\n  Since MAP-21, we have had more of the same: short-term extension \nafter short-term extension. The recent history shows how significant \nthis opportunity we have is. We have before us a bipartisan, fiscally \nresponsible bill that will provide the certainty our States need to \nimprove the Nation's highway system for several years.\n  I am encouraged by the bipartisan vote we saw last night to move to \ndebate, and I hope my colleagues will continue to work together to \ndrive that DRIVE Act into law.\n  West Virginians rely heavily, as do most people around the country, \non roads, bridges, and highways to fuel our economy, to access hard-to-\nreach places in our State, to get to and from work, and to transport \ngoods and services. West Virginians understand the need for a long-term \nhighway bill. Nearly one-third of our State's major roads are currently \nin poor condition.\n  The Federal Highway Administration has listed 960 West Virginia \nbridges as structurally deficient. We have quite a few bridges in our \nState because of our beautiful mountains.\n  The DRIVE Act will increase funding for maintaining and repairing \nthese bridges. The bill prioritizes maintenance of our major roads, \nhelping to address the current state of disrepair on highways across \nthis country.\n  This is a statistic of which, quite frankly, I was jarred by the \nnumber. Each West Virginia motorist pays an average of $575 a year in \nextra maintenance costs due to the poor road conditions. The DRIVE Act \nwill help our States address maintenance and repair, meaning safer and \nless costly trips for our drivers, but the biggest thing is the \ncertainty that comes from a long-term highway bill. It is important for \nnot only the maintenance aspect, but it is most important to advance \nnew projects. Large highway projects are expensive multiyear endeavors.\n  States can't plan for the future based on funding commitments for a \nweek or a month. Whether the issue is relieving congestion and \nimproving access to rural communities to fuel economic development or \nmoving freight across the country, the DRIVE Act will help the most \nimportant projects move forward.\n  In West Virginia, U.S. Route 35 in Putnam and Mason Counties is one \nof our most critical projects. It is an important freight link for the \ngoods moving from the Southeast to the Midwest, but it has been two \nlanes for a very long time. It was one of the most dangerous roads that \ninterstate truck traffic shared.\n  Thanks in part to the 2005 bill I talked about, the majority of Route \n35 is now a four-lane highway, and our State efforts to complete the \nremaining 14 miles are well underway, but the DRIVE Act will aid \nefforts to get that project across the finish line. It will also help \nus build Corridor H for residents in Central and Eastern West Virginia, \nan important part of the Appalachian Development Highway System. When \nthis road is completed, it will link counties in Central West Virginia \nwith the Interstate 81 corridor, improving safety and providing \neconomic development opportunities for our communities.\n  Whether it is Route 35, Corridor H, the King Coal Highway, Coal \nFields Expressway or other high-priority projects across our State, \nStates need that certainty that is going to come from a dedicated \nFederal investment to move forward. That is what a long-term highway \nbill does while creating jobs for our construction workers.\n  According to the Contractors Association of West Virginia, \nconstruction and employment in my State fell by 11.3 percent between \nNovember of 2013 and November of 2014. That is 1 year.\n\n[[Page S5491]]\n\nPassing a highway bill that supports investment in our roads and \nbridges will put these men and women back to work.\n  Reauthorizing our highway program for 6 years would be reason enough, \nin my opinion, to strongly support the DRIVE Act. I want to highlight \nanother part of this bill that is important to my State. It \nreauthorizes the Appalachian Regional Commission through 2021. West \nVirginia is the only State whose boundaries fall entirely within the \ncommission's boundaries.\n  Earlier this year, the commission marked its 50th anniversary of \nleading efforts to fight poverty and improve the quality of life in the \nAppalachian region. Over that period, poverty in the Appalachian region \nhas been cut in half, and the percentage of residents over 25 with \ncollege degrees has nearly tripled, but there is much more work to be \ndone.\n  The DRIVE Act authorizes a broadband deployment initiative through \nthe ARC to help increase access to high-speed internet--a problem in \nrural America--in support of distance learning, telemedicine, and \nbusiness development.\n  Reauthorizing the ARC and bringing broadband to small, economically \ndistressed communities will help bring jobs to West Virginia. The ARC \nprovides important support for health care, education, and \ninfrastructure programs, and I am pleased the DRIVE Act will allow the \ncommission to continue its efforts for the next 6 years.\n  Now is the time to move our transportation system forward and meet \nthe needs of our growing population, ensure safety for travelers, and \npromote growth in areas that struggle economically. The Senate has the \nopportunity to make a real and positive difference for all Americans by \npassing the DRIVE Act.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, as we have been talking about fixing our \nNation's infrastructure, I want to raise a concern I had with one of \nthe potential ways in which we are talking about paying for it. That is \nby using funds out of what is called the Hardest Hit Fund.\n  Over the years, I have worked in my State of Ohio and around the \ncountry to help deal with this issue of abandoned homes. We are all \nconcerned about communities that have blighted properties because they \ntend to be magnets for crime, for drugs, and for other illegal \nactivity. It turns out that one of the best ways to increase home \nvalues in some of the blighted neighborhoods around our country and in \nmy home State of Ohio is to actually take these abandoned homes, tear \nthem down, and have that property be used for other purposes, whether \nit is new development, a community garden or whether it is simply \nrazing the property to ensure that homes in the neighborhood are not \naffected negatively by those home values going down.\n  There is a lot of information out there about this now because many \nStates have become active in doing it, and it appears it is working. In \nother words, home values are increasing, sometimes dramatically, by \ntaking down these blighted properties. I think, perhaps inadvertently, \nMembers of this body who are looking at ways to pay for the highway \ntrust fund extension decided that the Hardest Hit Fund was the place to \nlook. There is no question there has been a GAO report about some \naspects of this fund and how it has been used, where there might be \nneed for reform, maybe significant reform, but this one area of dealing \nwith blighted properties is one we need to be very careful with.\n  Main Streets across our country are looking to us right now in the \nU.S. Senate to ensure that we don't overreach, and trying to find \nfunding for infrastructure, in effect, creates more problems in those \nneighborhoods. In my home State of Ohio, we have nearly 80,000 \ndangerous abandoned homes. One of the best things that you can do to \naddress public safety in tumbling home values in those neighborhoods is \nto demolish these structures. By the way, some of the data that we have \nfrom cities in my home State of Ohio says they cost neighbors up to 80 \npercent of their value.\n  We have also seen that first responders sometimes are at risk when \nthese homes are subject to arson and other crimes. Sadly, we lost a \nfirefighter in one of these homes in Ohio because of arson.\n  I remember touring some of these abandoned homes in Toledo, OH, where \nI got to witness one of the homes being torn down. I have done the same \nthing in Warren, OH, and I have done the same thing in other \ncommunities around our State. I have done the same thing in Toledo with \nthe mayor. As we were talking to neighbors, I asked the neighbor who \nwas right next to one of the homes being torn down, how do you feel \nabout this? She said what other neighbors have told me on other \nopportunities that I have had to go into these communities and talk \nabout abandoned homes. She said: Well, it will be better because there \nis less blight and there is less crime. We have a concern because this \nabandoned home is being used by drug dealers. But she also said: You \nknow, Rob, I live right next to this home. There are only a few feet \nthat separated these two homes. She said: I have three kids at home. \nEvery night when I went to bed, I was worried about what might happen, \nthat an arsonist would light this home on fire, as has been done \nthroughout the city of Toledo and other cities with abandoned homes, \nand that my kids would be at risk.\n\n  This is something that is working. I am concerned that if we do not \ntake this into account as we look at how to pay for this infrastructure \nbill, we will make the situation worse rather than better.\n  One way we are getting at this in my home State of Ohio and around \nthe country is land banks. In some of the hardest hit States, \nmanufacturing States like Ohio and Michigan got to work attacking this \nissue. The resources they need to demolish these properties in order to \nhelp struggling neighborhoods recover come in part from the Hardest Hit \nFund.\n  In Ohio we now have 24 land banks. I think there are six more in \nformation. By the end of the year, we expect to have at least 30 county \nland banks in Ohio.\n  After visiting some of these neighborhoods that are impacted by these \nhomes and walking the streets with local officials in 2013, I authored \na bill called the Neighborhood Safety Act. It was a companion bill to a \nbipartisan House effort that was led by some Ohio Members of Congress, \nincluding Dave Joyce, Marcy Kaptur, and Marcia Fudge. Our legislation \ncalled for the Hardest Hit Fund to be used for demolition purposes.\n  After we pushed for this and pushed aggressively, this important \nchange was made. It provided nearly $66 million to my State of Ohio to \ndeal with these thousands of abandoned homes we talked about. I know \nthe State of Michigan also received a significant part of the Hardest \nHit Fund for these purposes, as did other States. Again, I am concerned \nabout this potential pay-for in the legislation that could take away \nsome of these funds, which are critical for doing this important work. \nI have been in touch with the land banks in Ohio. I am talking to the \nOhio Housing Finance Agency to determine what is the best path forward \nto protect these funds. We are working right now with the committee \nleadership to see if we can modify the language in the underlying bill. \nI know it is something that is a concern to Senator Stabenow because I \nspoke to her about it earlier today, as well as my colleague from Ohio \nSenator Brown.\n  I don't know what we are going to do going forward. We may need to \noffer an amendment to change the language. I am hopeful we can have \nthis be part of a managers' amendment. Again, dealing with these \nabandoned, blighted homes is a public safety concern. It is a huge \nconcern for local officials, local officials in my home State whom I \nhave talked to, been on the streets with, but also local officials \nacross our country. We have to protect these funds for the communities \nthat so desperately need them.\n\n  I wish to particularly thank a friend back home, Jim Rokakis, \ndirector of the Thriving Communities Initiative at the Western Reserve \nLand Conservancy. He has done excellent work highlighting issues in \nOhio and has helped to bring people together.\n  I hope we will be able to resolve this issue in a managers' \namendment, but if\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nnot, I do intend to offer an amendment, and I hope that amendment can \nbe supported on a bipartisan basis to ensure that we are not, perhaps \ninadvertently, taking away this tool that we are using every day to \nmake our neighborhoods safer and to improve home values for the people \nwe represent.\n  The final point I wish to make about the underlying legislation is \nthat it also includes very important language that reforms our \nregulatory system--specifically, our permitting system. For years now, \npeople have been talking about the fact that America is a place where \nit is hard to building something. In fact, it has gotten to the point \nthat one international survey that is widely respected has said that \nAmerica has fallen to No. 41 in the world in terms of the ease of doing \nbusiness as it relates to green-lighting a project. Think of a \ncommercial building, road or bridge being built or an energy project, \nwhether it is solar, wind or oil and gas.\n  What we are finding out is that it is so hard to build something in \nAmerica, that some of these funds are going somewhere else. Sometimes \nin foreign capitals, as we visit as congressional delegations, we see a \nlot of cranes and a lot of activity. Part of that is because these \nfunds are not coming to this country because it takes so long to build \nsomething and to get the permits, and there is so much uncertainty and \nthe capital is not patient enough. There is more legal liability here \nthan in so many other countries. So being No. 41 in the world has led \nto our having fewer good-paying construction jobs here in this country.\n  As a result of this concern, over the last 3 years, I worked with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to draft commonsense legislation \nto speed up the permitting process, while still ensuring that we go \nthrough a regulatory process that includes an environmental review and \nother reviews. This legislation streamlines the process and requires \none Federal agency to be accountable, which is not the case now. It \ndeals with some of the issues that we have now. For instance, you may \nhave as many as 35 different Federal permits on an energy project just \nto get the project going.\n  It also helps with regard to legal liability. With regard to the \nstatute of limitations, instead of having it run 6 years after the \nfinal environmental review, we limited that to 2 years, which is plenty \nof time to bring a lawsuit. Some have found that the 6-year statute of \nlimitations makes it very difficult to find investors.\n  This is an important part of the legislation that we are dealing with \nas part of the highway trust fund. It is part of this infrastructure \nbill and will not only provide more funding for our highways and roads \nbut will also ensure that we can move forward with more of these \nprojects more quickly and use the money for efficiently.\n  This legislation has been supported broadly across the aisle. It was \nreported out of our committee--the governmental affairs committee--\nearlier this year with a strong bipartisan vote. I believe the vote was \n12 to 1. It is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and also by \nthe AFL-CIO Building Trades Council. They feel strongly about it for \nall the right reasons. They want to bring back some jobs. A lot of \nconstruction jobs that were lost during the financial crisis have yet \nto come back. This will help.\n  I commend the authors of the underlying legislation for including my \nbill as part of the underlying bill. I sure hope it stays in the bill \nbecause it is the right thing to do for taxpayers, it is the right \nthing to do to get projects moving, and, of course, it is the right \nthing to do to create more jobs at a time when all of us continue to be \ndisappointed by the recovery, which is one of the weakest recoveries we \nhave ever seen in the history of our country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to talk about an issue \nthat is of concern; that is, that the Hardest Hit Fund does an \nexcellent job in our communities with regard to abandoned homes. We \nhave to be careful that we not pull the rug out from under these \norganizations that are doing a terrific job helping to make our \ncommunities safer and helping to increase home values.\n  Again, I wish to commend those who have included in this legislation \nour permitting bill. Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri and I have \nworked on this for 3 years. It is good bipartisan legislation. It makes \nsense in order to get America back to work and building things again. \nIt will help in terms of the highway funding by making sure that \nfunding goes further, and it will also help in terms of all sorts of \nconstruction of other projects, such as energy projects, commercial \nbuildings, and other infrastructure.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Overtime Pay\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Department \nof Labor's proposal to provide overtime pay to more Americans, a step \nthat could affect as many as 90,000 middle-class workers in Minnesota \nand nearly 5 million around the country.\n  Right now, if someone makes more than $450 a week, or about $24,000 a \nyear, there is a very good chance they don't qualify for overtime pay, \nand that is below the current poverty line for a family of four. The \nnewly proposed regulations would raise that level to $970 a week, or \nabout $50,000 annually. That means that a salaried worker earning less \nthan that amount will be able to benefit from overtime pay regardless \nof the duties that he or she performs. This change would benefit an \nenormous number of Americans whose wages have remained virtually \nunchanged while the cost of education, childcare, and retirement have \nrisen steadily over the past decade.\n  Last month, we saw the 64th straight month of private sector job \ngrowth since the Great Depression. Our economy overall is getting \nstronger, but too much of that prosperity is going to people at the \ntop. Middle-class families and those aspiring to be in the middle class \nsimply are not reaping the benefits. In fact, America's wealth gap \nbetween middle-income and upper-income families is at its highest \nlevel--the gap--since 1983. The gap between the highest and lowest \nearners is at its greatest since before the Great Depression. This kind \nof inequality is not just bad for those workers. It is bad for our \neconomy as a whole, which is strongest when we have a thriving middle \nclass.\n  Overtime protections were first passed as part of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938 in the midst of the Great Depression, when the \neconomy was far worse off than it is now. It was passed as a way to \nprotect workers from abusive employers and lay the groundwork to \nrebuild the middle class. While overtime protections have been a staple \nof the American economy, they no longer reach many of the workers they \nwere intended to help.\n  Just look at the trends. In 1975, overtime covered 62 percent of \nfull-time salaried workers, including a majority of people with college \ndegrees. Today only 8 percent of workers are eligible for overtime, \nwhich is an especially alarming statistic since hourly wages for the \naverage worker have remained flat in real dollars since 1979. That is \nwhy in January of this year I joined several of my colleagues in \npushing President Obama to update these outdated overtime rules. We \nasked the President to allow more working people to qualify for \novertime and to index those earnings, that threshold, to keep up with \ninflation so that future generations of American workers could reap the \nbenefits of their hard work. I am glad the administration agreed. These \nproposed rules will help put more money in the pockets of those who \nwork longer hours or provide incentive to employers to hire more \nworkers or increase the hours of part-time workers and help strengthen \nthe economy. These rules will allow workers to spend their new-found \nearnings and spur further economic growth. They will help grow our \nshrinking middle class, which is the backbone of our economy, and help \ncreate a pathway for those who want to become a part of the middle \nclass. It is vital that we support this proposal to guarantee overtime \npay to millions of more Americans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN.

I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as I watch this great deliberative \nbody move toward a transportation bill, I sometimes feel as though I am \nwatching an impending train wreck or a car crash because on the issue \nof safety this bill reflects a tragic, unfortunate, unforgivable missed \nopportunity. If we authorize this transportation measure, which is \nvitally important to the future of our Nation and will help drive \neconomic growth and create jobs, we will miss the opportunity to make \nour roads and rails safer, more reliable, and more resilient for our \neconomy and quality of life. We are missing an opportunity to, in \neffect, save lives.\n  Anyone who has opened the morning newspaper and read about a \nderailment--whether in Bridgeport, Rikers Island, the Bronx, NY, or \nPhiladelphia--causing injuries, deaths, loss of both life and property, \ncan ask, understandably, why can't they do something? Anybody who \ndiscovers a used car bought by a friend or a relative or oneself rife \nwith recalls and the need for repairs can justifiably ask, why can't \nthey do something? Anybody who has had a near miss on the highway with \nan 80,000-pound truck going 75 miles an hour because there is a tired \ntruckdriver under pressure from an owner or because there are two 33-\nlength rigs can justifiably ask, why haven't they done something? The \nanswer is because the Senate is missing an opportunity now, this year, \non this bill.\n  I spend a lot of time driving Connecticut's roads and seeing \nfirsthand how all of these vital forms of transportation--railroad, \nbridges, ports, and airports--are in need of investment.\n  The latest example and evidence is from a report released today--it \nis called the ``TRIP report''--in New Haven finding that 45 percent of \nroads there are in poor condition and that the cost to drivers is $707 \na year in repairs. That is real money. The roads are in very bad \ncondition--45 percent of them--in the New Haven area alone. And the \n``TRIP report'' ought to be a powerful reminder of the need for robust \nand enduring investment.\n  I wrote to the writers and drafters of the bill before us asking for \na good bill that makes the kind of investment we need to respond to the \nneeds that are reflected in the ``TRIP report,'' which is in the range \nof billions of dollars a year, but this measure provides to Connecticut \nonly about $500 million a year--a pittance compared to what the need is \nin Connecticut.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Federal \nHighway Administration, keeping roads and rail reliable and safe means \ninvestment. Creating jobs means investment. Driving the economy forward \nmeans investment. All of those goals can be served by a robust and \nadequate investment.\n  I urged that the bill cover the full 6 years. Instead, this bill \nreally is a mirage of what is necessary. The bill before us fails to \nprovide a long-term and robust plan to meet the priorities for our \nNation's transportation infrastructure. Major construction projects, \nsuch as building the I-84/Route 8 highway interchange in Waterbury, \nknown as the Mixmaster, and replacing the Aetna Viaduct portions of I-\n84 in Hartford, will take years to complete. This bill provides only \nthe illusion of a long-term authorization, backed only by 3 years of \ndedicated funding for highways and no--let me repeat--no dedicated \nfunding for critical infrastructure investment in our Nation's commuter \nrailroads.\n  When the American people discover what is in this bill, they are \ngoing to again say: Why can't they do something? Why can't they do \nsomething better than this train wreck and car collision of a bill?\n  I voted against the motion to proceed to this bill because of its \nfailure to provide a path forward and this bill's failure to provide a \nreliable funding source for the commuter rail systems millions of \nAmericans depend on every day and its failure to address our country's \nongoing crisis in transportation safety.\n  We have seen the evidence of safety failure in a variety of tragic \ninstances--in Philadelphia, in Westchester County, where a collision at \na grade crossing killed six people; a derailment in the Bronx that \nkilled four; a train on the wrong track that struck and killed a worker \nin West Haven; and, of course, the derailment in Bridgeport that \ninjured more than 70 people.\n  Positive train control would help prevent these kinds of tragedies. \nIt is a technology similar to GPS--not much more complicated--that \nmonitors track conditions and speeds and helps trains slow or stop \nbefore there is a collision or derailment. It is not a new or novel or \noriginal, untested technology; it has been around for years. This bill \nfails to bring our railroads into the latest 20th-century technology, \nnot to mention the 21st-century technology that positive train control \noffers.\n  The Northeast Corridor is in urgent need of at least $570 million per \nyear to enable a decent and adequate state of repair, to give railroads \na realistic chance of implementing lifesaving positive train control \ntechnology, and to improve safety at rail grade crossings. That is \nmoney which can't be created by a mirage or an illusion in a bill like \nthis one. The national infrastructure safety and investment grants \nprogram was designed to provide this level of support. If Congress were \nto dedicate the necessary funding from the highway trust fund, it could \nbe done, but Congress is ignoring this fundamental need.\n  On our roads, American bus and truck drivers perform an essential \nservice and they work hard at it, but their industry also has well-\ndocumented safety issues. Unfortunately, this legislation creates \nadditional hurdles for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration \nto promulgate rules and to address safety issues. Rather than making \nthe world safer, it actually enables more danger.\n  The bill before us allows 18-year-olds to sit behind the wheel of an \n80,000-pound truck going 75 miles an hour--with no requirement to get \nrest--to drive 75 miles an hour not only within the State but across \nState lines.\n  The bill allows giant twin 33's--new to our roads--to be driven \nacross State lines, putting drivers at risk and further degrading our \nhighway system.\n  The bill eviscerates rules on how much rest truckdrivers must take. \nThat rest is essential to safety.\n  I sought to strike and modify these damaging provisions in committee, \nand I urged my colleagues to support essential safety reforms, but \nunfortunately those calls went unheeded.\n  Over the last 2 years, the commerce committee has had a tragic front-\nrow seat--a unique insight into the tragedies that pile up when safety \nis ignored. Our national safety regulators all too commonly look the \nother way when auto companies, for example, conceal information to \nprotect profits over human life.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Boxer, who has stripped the most \noffensive provisions out of the title governing the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration. That title no longer limits grants for \nthe prevention of drunk driving, for example. Unfortunately, it still \ncontains unacceptable loopholes.\n  Due to the GM ignition coverup and the Takata airbag crisis, there \nare currently an unprecedented 64 million cars on the road today that \nare under safety recall. Let me repeat that number. There are 64 \nmillion cars on the road today that are under safety recall.\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\nThat is 25 percent of the total 250 million cars in America. To say \nthis number is unprecedented fails to do it justice.\n  Along with a number of my colleagues, particularly Senator Markey, I \nadvocated numerous policy changes to ensure accountability for these \nproblems and make them less likely in the future--not just to punish \nbut to protect. I would like to focus on two that are particularly \nurgent.\n\n  First, many of the cars that have been recalled are 10 or more years \nold and in the hands of their second or third owners. There needs to be \na provision that says to these car dealers that when a car is in a \nrecall, they have an obligation to notify a new owner and, in fact, to \nrepair the car.\n  Second, as we learned in the case of GM, Federal prosecutors simply \nlack legal tools to file criminal charges against companies for \nknowingly concealing information about defects that can kill. \nDeliberate coverup and concealment of deadly defects should be \npunishable criminally, as it is in other industries where the stakes \nare similar. We know that employees at GM were aware of dangerous \nsafety defects but chose to remain silent or, in fact, mislead \nauthorities, leading to hundreds of injuries and deaths.\n  This measure and the DRIVE Act do nothing to hold manufacturers or \ntheir corporate officers criminally responsible when they knowingly \nfail to disclose those risks. Even after the defects are discovered, \nthis bill lacks the teeth to ensure that wrongdoing is not repeated. \nTheir civil penalty authority for safety violations is currently capped \nat $35 million. The DRIVE Act leaves these fines at just a pittance \ncompared to the revenue of GM--less than the cost of doing business. \nSafety fines need to be meaningful rather than a pittance, less than \nthe cost of doing business. Congress must remove this cap and ensure \nthat safety penalties provide a meaningful deterrent to wrongdoing. \nEven at $70 million, it is a pittance compared to GM, which made $156 \nbillion in 2014.\n  Americans deserve better than another 6 years of crashes, bridge \ncollapses, accidents that are preventable, and they need protection to \nstop it. I hope my colleagues will join me to implement reforms now and \ntake strong steps to build and maintain a transportation system worthy \nof the greatest, strongest country in the history of the world.\n  For our economy, we can create jobs. For our quality of life, we can \nensure quality and convenience. For our safety, we can prevent tragedy. \nWe can do better with a transportation system that keeps people safe.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement with Iran\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very \nimportant topic for our country, the future of our kids, and the future \nof our kids' kids.\n  This morning I was in a Foreign Relations hearing about Iran. It is \npretty obvious that the administration has decided once again that our \ndemocratic values and procedures are just too high of a hurdle to \nclear. Instead of keeping its promise to the American people and \nfollowing the pledge it made to Congress just a few months ago to give \neveryone time to review the terms of this deal, the administration has \ninstead undercut all of us again. This administration has effectively \nignored 98 Senators--myself included--and 400 Representatives who voted \nfor the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act earlier this year. By \nadvancing this vote at the U.N. Security Council, this administration \nhas violated the very balance of power between our three branches of \ngovernment.\n  I am outraged that this administration continues to circumvent \nCongress at every turn, from regulations, to mandates, to foreign \npolicy. This is an absolute failure of the administration to do what is \nbest for the American people, our security, and indeed the security of \nthe world.\n  The precept for this deal with Iran simply doesn't make sense. This \ndeal started off by ceding the right to enrich to Iran immediately, \nreversing decades of U.S. nonproliferation policy. In fact, Secretary \nKerry said in 2013 that ``we do not recognize the right to enrich.''\n  This deal reverses six United Nations Security Council resolutions \nand turns a pariah proliferator into a legitimate nuclear state.\n  This agreement allows Iran to leapfrog over the 18 countries who have \npeaceful nuclear programs but no enrichment and to be treated like \ncountries like Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Netherlands, and Japan who \nhave peaceful energy programs and domestic enrichment but who do not \nhave a nuclear weapon. These five nations are upstanding members of the \ninternational community.\n  This deal takes Iran--the largest state sponsor of terrorism and a \nviolator of human rights as well as an international pariah--and treats \nIran's nuclear program like Japan's.\n  Secretary Kerry said at a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee \nin March that ``our negotiation is calculated to make sure that [Iran] \ncan never have a nuclear weapon.'' But President Obama has said that \n``in year 13, 14, or 15 . . . the breakout times would have shrunk down \nto almost zero.''\n  So this deal will not protect Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons \nstate; it just delays it. As I have said all along, I cannot support \nany deal that allows Iran to become a nuclear weapons state--not now, \nnot in 10 years, not ever.\n  What is more, this deal provides Iran with billions of dollars of \nsanctions relief upfront, before the IAEA completes its assessment on \nwhether Iran's nuclear program is indeed peaceful. It took the IAEA 19 \nyears to make this determination for South Africa's program. And this \ndeal starts lifting United Nations and European Union sanctions this \nyear, the arms embargo in 5 years, and the ballistic missile ban in 8 \nshort years. This deal will provide Iran with a windfall of sanctions \nrelief of up to over $100 billion--funds that President Obama's \nNational Security Advisor Susan Rice just recently conceded will go to \nterrorism, the Iranian military, the Houthis, and Assad.\n  President Obama said that ``this deal is not built on trust, it is \nbuilt on verification.'' But this deal doesn't require ``anytime, \nanywhere'' inspections of all nuclear and military sites. Instead, it \nempowers Iran to create lengthy delays when IAEA inspectors request \naccess to suspicious nuclear sites that are indeed not declared by \nIran. From what I understand, the IAEA will have two teams traveling a \ncountry twice the size of Texas. And let's not forget that Iran \ndeveloped the Fordow facility and it operated for years despite having \nIAEA teams on the ground.\n  And if we do find Iran to be in violation of this deal, our \nenforcement mechanism has no teeth. Snapback sanctions in fact are a \nfantasy. Paragraph 37 of the Iran deal states that Iran will cease \nperforming all of its commitments to the deal in the event of a full or \npartial snapback. Iran will walk away if we try to hold it to the very \ndeal it just signed off on.\n  With this all-or-nothing nature of the snapback, will anyone try to \npunish Iran's cheating? History tells us that when Iran cheats, it does \nso incrementally, in small steps, so no single action in and of itself \ncan be punished, but when you look at it over time, their cheating is \negregious.\n  Will any nation be willing to stake sinking the entire deal over \nminor cheating? Even if sanctions are indeed snapped back, Iran's \nsanctions relief is front-loaded. They will be able to so quickly pad \ntheir economy to make themselves more resistant to future sanctions. \nMost dangerously, this deal is predicated on the idea that the regime \nwill change its dangerous behavior, when we have only seen proof that \nwe will see more of the same--sponsorship of rogue regimes and \nterrorism worldwide.\n  So I am curious, given what we know now about this deal, how the \nUnited States not only voted for this deal at\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nthe United Nations Security Council but actually sponsored the \nresolution. Secretary Kerry claims that should Congress disapprove of \nthis deal, we would be in noncompliance with all of the other countries \nin the world. He claims that there will be no nation standing with us \non our sanctions or opposition to Iran.\n  Well, I say we let the nations of the world decide for themselves. \nLet's give the world the option. We have stood alone before. Do you \nwant to do business with Iran or the United States? We have stood alone \nmany times in history when it meant doing the right thing.\n  The American people and the fine people of Georgia who are calling \nand writing into my office every day are uncomfortable with this \nnuclear deal for Iran, and they are uncomfortable with our future under \nits provisions. So I say to this administration that you cannot \ncircumvent the American people with this nuclear deal. Congress will \nhave its say. We worked hard for this 60-day review period and I will \ndo my part to muster the 67 votes required to disapprove a deal that \nleaves Iran as a nuclear threshold state in a little more than a \ndecade.\n  This 60-day oversight period is the result of a bipartisan effort in \nthe House and Senate, protecting the balance of the three branches of \ngovernment. Now we must act together to protect our country and our \nworld from a very bad actor like Iran from ever becoming a nuclear \nweapons state.\n  Mr. President, I rise also in the time remaining to speak very \nbriefly of a current issue that we are going to vote on, possibly this \nweekend; that is, the highway trust fund. Georgia sent me to Washington \nto help solve our fiscal crisis, not make it worse. As a member of the \nSenate Budget Committee, I am working every day to find smarter ways to \nprioritize our spending. That way we can support critical functions of \nthe Federal Government such as funding our National Highway System.\n  Make no mistake--I support funding infrastructure, but we must do it \nresponsibly. Transportation is a top priority as it supports a robust \neconomy and is one of the responsibilities the Federal Government is \ncharged with in executing under the Constitution. As we continue to \ndebate the highway bill in the Senate, I am committed to finding the \nright funding and enough funding for our critical infrastructure needs.\n  As proposed, the highway bill authorizes spending for the next 6 \nyears yet only funds these programs for the next 3 years. Passing \nresponsibility over to the next Congress to find additional funding \nmechanisms for the remaining 3 years is unacceptable. It is what has \ngotten us in this debt crisis in the first place. Some of my colleagues \nhave suggested this is simply the way the Senate has acted in the past. \nYes, I got that. Again, it is what got us here. That may be true, but \nit does not make it right. I was not sent to Washington to accept this \nstatus quo.\n  A serious long-term solution needs to be fully funded, not filled \nwith half-empty promises that cannot be kept or could add to our \nnational debt. I am working to find a responsible way forward in order \nto provide Georgia and other States with more certainty through a \nlonger term solution, instead of settling for just another short-term \nfix. Today, I am introducing an amendment to simply match the \nauthorization period with the available funding. That sounds basic; it \nsounds simple. It is what I have to do at home in my home budget. It is \nwhat most Americans have to do. If they don't have the money, they \ndon't spend it. This amendment ensures that Congress is not authorizing \nspending programs beyond a point where there is no money to pay for \nthem in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in breaking Washington of its chronic \noverspending problem. I urge my colleagues to support a fiscally \nresponsible highway bill that matches the length of the authorization \nwith the funding mechanism. That way we can continue to fund our \ncritical infrastructure projects without compromising our conservative \nbudget principles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity to pass a \nmultiyear transportation bill that ensures critical transportation \nprojects move forward without disruption. As part of this \nbipartisanship bill, the DRIVE Act, we also have an opportunity to pass \nnecessary policy changes that enhance safety and make our \ntransportation system work better.\n  Part of the DRIVE Act includes important work on transportation \npolicy we have undertaken at the Senate Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee. We will lose an opportunity to pass \nbipartisan reforms if we do not approve this critical legislation.\n  The last time we passed a multiyear transportation bill into law was \n2012. However, since 2009, we have passed 33 short-term extensions to \navoid a funding gap that would stop much-needed transportation \nprojects. Highway and transportation infrastructure projects--and in \nmany urban areas, public transit projects--are important to our \nconstituents and our Nation's economy.\n  If we continue to do short-term extensions--again 33, literally 33 \nshort-term extensions since 2009--that is a terrible way to run a \nhighway program. It does not allow State departments of transportation \nto plan. It does not allow those who are involved in the construction, \nthe contractors who build our roads and bridges, an opportunity to \nplan. It creates all kinds of uncertainty out there.\n  We need the certainty that comes with a long-term highway program \ninstead of having these 33 short-term extensions. So this is a unique \nopportunity that we have to actually put in place policies that would \nguide us at least for the next 3 years and hopefully beyond. Our \ntransportation system is one of our government's visible assets. Our \nconstituents who sent us here notice when there is a problem with it.\n  The Federal infrastructure investment that Senator Inhofe and Senator \nBoxer have taken the lead on in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and the transit projects for which the banking committee is \nresponsible are not the only critical parts of our transportation \nsystem. There are policy decisions and advanced safety initiatives. We \nhave rules governing how and when and where we build critical projects, \nas well as oversight of various regulations at the U.S. Department of \nTransportation regarding trucking, freight rail, passenger rail, and \nautomobile safety requirements.\n  These areas are the exclusive jurisdiction of the Senate commerce \ncommittee. I have the honor of chairing the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee. I was pleased to see my friend from Florida, \nSenator Nelson, who is the ranking member of our committee, return last \nnight following his surgery last week to help advance consideration of \nthe DRIVE Act.\n  Let's talk about some of the policies that I have worked on with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle that will not become law if we \nfail to move forward with this bill. Keep in mind that Senators Wicker \nand Booker are the authors of the rail safety bill that the commerce \ncommittee passed by voice vote last month, and their bill is included \nin this legislation.\n  Let's also recognize that commuter rail systems, including New Jersey \nTransit and Virginia Railway Express, have stated that they will not \nmeet Federal deadlines for implementing positive train control \ntechnology. This legislation currently before the Senate would \nauthorize grants and prioritize loan applications to help commuter \nrailroads deploy this new technology to help address safety issues and \nto get positive train control up and running as soon as possible.\n  The bill also includes numerous additional rail safety requirements, \nincluding the implementation of necessary automatic train control \nmodifications and crew communication improvements, to improve \noperations while\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\npositive train control is being implemented.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board recommended requiring \ninward-facing cameras in all passenger railroads to create more \naccountability. This bill requires all passenger railroads to install \nsuch equipment in their locomotives. In fact, I have a letter here from \nthe National Transportation Safety Board, in which Chairman Christopher \nHart says:\n\n       I applaud the recent passage of the passenger rail safety \n     bill. I was pleased to see the inclusion of our \n     recommendations regarding inward and outward audio and image \n     recorders.\n       Thank you for your ongoing support of the NTSB.\n\n  That is from the National Transportation Safety Board Chairman, Mr. \nChristopher Hart. So having these necessary improvements will make our \npassenger rail systems much safer as they travel across the country.\n  The bill also streamlines the permitting process for improvements to \nexisting railroad track and infrastructure and improves multimodal \nplanning and permitting. The Secretary of Transportation will have new \nauthority to speed up projects and to reduce paperwork burdens. Outside \nof improving rail safety, we include a proposal offered as an amendment \nduring committee markup by Senator McCaskill to ban rental car \ncompanies from renting vehicles needing recall repair work.\n  We also include several provisions to increase consumer awareness of \nrecalls, increased corporate responsibility, and improved highway \nsafety efforts in all the States. Following a harsh inspector general \nreport criticizing the Federal Government's auto safety regulator, this \nbill requires the full implementation of reforms outlined in that \nreport. Once these reforms are implemented, the agency's funding \nauthorization will substantially increase to meet the GROW AMERICA \nrequests for vehicle safety efforts. These are important safety \nprovisions in this bill. They make our roads and our transportation \nsystem safer, and they deserve our support.\n  At the committee level, some provisions of our title were the subject \nof constructive discussions that helped us improve this bill before it \nmade its way to the floor. Here are a few things we did to broaden \nsupport for this proposal after our committee passed the bill last \nweek.\n  Senator Manchin raised concerns about a provision I authored that \nrequires additional testing for a new train braking requirement known \nas ECP that will be required under law by 2021 and 2023. I worked with \nSenator Manchin. We came to an agreement that if new real-world tests \nshow that the requirement isn't effective, it cannot proceed. If it is \neffective, there will be no delay in its implementation, and there will \nbe no need for new rulemaking.\n  We worked with Mothers Against Drunk Driving on another important \nissue to combat drunk driving. When we heard they had concerns with our \n24/7 sobriety program grant language, we worked with them to address \nthose concerns and to assure that the dedicated grant program with \nignition interlock laws continues.\n  A pilot program our bill proposed that would allow licensed \ntruckdrivers between the ages of 18 to 21 to cross short distances \noutside the borders of their home State now requires not only the \napproval of participating States but also the approval of the Secretary \nof Transportation. At the Commerce Committee we have worked on a \nbipartisan basis to change, drop or add provisions since we marked up \nthe bill to earn the support of colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  There are still some differences. I expect amendments where this body \nwill have the opportunity to decide important issues that we have \ndebated throughout the committee process. One such issue, which I heard \na variety of opinions about, concerns the current $35 million cap on \nfines that the Department of Transportation can assess on manufacturers \nfor auto safety violations. This bill would double the cap to $70 \nmillion, provided that the Department first finishes a still undone \nrulemaking process on penalty assessment factors that was required in \nour last highway bill.\n  I have heard arguments that this cap on fines for auto safety failure \nshould be raised more or even set at an unlimited amount, but we are \ndoubling this cap to $70 million and conditioning an additional \nincreased authorization for vehicle safety on implementing needed \nreforms.\n  This bill enhances safety. If we do not pass this bill, auto safety \nregulators don't get more funding, as called for by Secretary Foxx and \nvarious safety groups following the record 64 million auto safety \nrecalls we have witnessed over the past 2 years. Penalties for auto \nsafety violations will not go up if this bill doesn't pass, commuter \nrailroads don't get new assistance to implement positive train control \nor the other critically important safety improvements that the NTSB, \nAmtrak, the FRA, and others have called for. None of that happens if \nthis bill doesn't pass. Rental car companies don't face a Federal ban \non renting vehicles that are subject to open recalls if this bill \ndoesn't pass.\n  Not passing the safety reforms in the DRIVE Act would be an \nincredible missed opportunity for addressing a host of key safety \nimprovements. Some in this building believe it would be easier if we \njust passed another short-term extension. They are right. It would be \nmuch easier, but keeping highway and related transportation \ninfrastructure projects funded for a few more months doesn't address \nsafety and regulatory issues that we cannot afford to keep ignoring.\n  Five months from now, if tax reform leaves us with new options, we \ncan always decide to infuse additional funding into the bill before the \nSenate, but delaying action on transportation for 5 months could also \ncompound our difficulties. Remember, there have already been 33 short-\nterm extensions passed by Congress since 2009.\n  A silent part of every argument for a short-term extension is let's \nnot address safety and other critical transportation needs. The right \ndecision for the American people is to seize the opportunity to pass a \nbipartisan, multiyear transportation bill without delay.\n  I wish to share with you some of the letters of support we have \nreceived from various organizations that have looked at the body of \nwork that is included in these particular provisions that I have \nmentioned.\n  The Governors Highway Safety Association says:\n\n       GHSA congratulates the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on \n     releasing S. 1732. This six-year reauthorization bill will \n     provide needed stability and consistency for state highway \n     safety agencies to reduce the number of crashes, injuries and \n     fatalities on America's roads.\n\n  This is from the American Public Transportation Association. It says:\n\n       On behalf of the American Public Transportation Association \n     (APTA), our 1,500 member agencies, and the millions of \n     Americans that depend on public transportation, I write to \n     commend the Committee's hard work to advance comprehensive \n     rail legislation that attempts to address safety, funding \n     needs, Amtrak enhancements, improved project delivery, and \n     other important rail policy issues.\n       We fully support the inclusion of a rail title within any \n     broader surface transportation authorization package \n     considered in the Senate.\n\n  That was from the president and CEO of the American Public \nTransportation Association.\n  The National Association of Railroad Passengers states that they are \nwriting ``to endorse the inclusion of the Railroad Reform, Enhancement, \nand Efficiency Act (S. 1626) into the Comprehensive Transportation and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2015 (S. 1732).\n  ``The move to include passenger rail authorizing language in a \nbroader highway and transit bill is an important step in recognizing \nthe critical role intercity trains play in a national transportation \nsystem.''\n  This letter is from the States for Passenger Rail Coalition:\n\n       On behalf of the States for Passenger Rail Coalition, Inc., \n     (SPRC) I write in support of the actions taken by the \n     Commerce Committee to introduce sections of the highway bill. \n     I am particularly pleased that the Railroad Reform, \n     Enhancement, and Efficiency Act (R2E2)--as approved by the \n     Commerce Committee--was included as a title of the bill.\n\n  These are just a few of the examples of letters we have received. The \nfinal one I will mention is from Transportation for America, and there \nagain they say they appreciate the fact that we are authorizing ``the \nfederal passenger rail program with the transportation safety and \nfreight provisions\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nunder the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee through 2021,'' and \nthat ``this proposal moves the federal transportation program in the \nright direction in addressing the nation's freight needs.''\n  The point I wish to make is there have been some of our colleagues on \nthe floor who have been finding fault with various provisions in the \nbill, and obviously there are going to be a lot of people who aren't \ngoing to support this in the end anyway, but we ought to at least be \ntalking about the facts. We ought to be talking about what is actually \nin the bill, and we ought to be talking about the important reforms \nthat were made in this legislation that addressed safety issues, safety \non the highway, safety on our rail system, improvements and reforms in \nour passenger rail systems, and the commuter railroads we have \ntraveling across this country. There are a number of needed safety \nimprovements and reforms that will be lost if we fail to act.\n  The letters I have mentioned are just a few examples of the \norganizations that rely upon those forms of transportation, that \nrecognize this is an opportunity we should not miss.\n  I hope we will take advantage of the opportunity and not do another \nshort-term extension, which would be the 34th now since 2009, and not \nput in place the types of changes, reforms, and improvements that are \nneeded in our transportation system across this country. If we fail to \nact now--the window that people think we have now for a short-term \nextension--the 34th short-term extension--we will be looking at this \nsometime later this year, and we will be right back where we are right \nnow.\n  We shouldn't miss this opportunity. We should take advantage of it \nand try, and as best we can as we move this across the Senate floor and \ndebate some of these issues--if there are ideas about improving it, \nmaking it better, making it stronger, I think that is what this debate \nis all about. But I want to make sure that as we talk about these \nissues we are accurately characterizing and reflecting what is actually \nin the bill and all the work that has been done on both sides of the \naisle by both Democrats and Republicans and Members who are interested \nin these issues.\n  There are a number of committees that have jurisdiction over \ntransportation issues. As I mentioned, the Commerce Committee is just \none. The Environment and Public Works Committee has had the lead on \nwriting the bill. The Finance Committee, on which I also serve, is \nresponsible for--at least largely responsible for--trying to come up \nwith the pay-fors the way that we are going to fund this, and the \nbanking committee deals with many of the transit provisions of the \nbill.\n  So there are multiple jurisdictional issues involved here. All the \ncommittees have been active. All the Members on those committees have \nbeen active. I can certainly say that on our committee, the commerce \ncommittee, we had great participation from both Republicans and \nDemocrats on the committee. We had a lot of good input, which didn't \nend when we reported the bill out of the committee but continued on \nthrough the weekend and into this week. So we continue to look at ways \nwe can make this bill stronger.\n  But I have to say, all the things that are included in here, all the \nthings I mentioned along with the components and features of this bill \nthat have been worked on by other committees, are important changes. \nProbably, most important of all, is that we get something that puts in \nplace a multiyear bill that creates the kinds of conditions that are \nconducive to jobs and to economic growth. We all know how important \ntransportation infrastructure is to our economy.\n  I come from a part of the country where we rely heavily--we drive \nlong distances, we have a lot of geography that we have to cover. Our \neconomy, because we are agriculturally based, relies very heavily upon \ngetting our products to the marketplace. So we have to have good roads \nand bridges, we have to have a railroad system that works, and we \nbelieve that many of the things that are done in this bill contribute \nto, enhance, make stronger, better, and more efficient our \ntransportation system. That is good for jobs, that is good for the \neconomy in this country, and that is why it is so important that we \nmove forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after last night's cloture vote, we are one \nstep closer to providing a long-term solution for the shortfalls in the \nhighway trust fund. Soon we will begin debate on legislation that will \nprovide more clarity and certainty to our States and to highway \nbuilders and workers throughout the country.\n  Earlier this week, I was pleased to learn that our distinguished \nmajority leader and the ranking member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee were able to reach a bipartisan agreement to authorize \nand fund a long-term highway extension. I want to commend both of them \nand everyone who was involved in putting this bill together for their \nhard work and willingness to put partisanship aside in order to help \nthe American people.\n  Now the rest of us need to follow their example. I want to express my \nsupport for this bipartisan highway bill and urge all of my Senate \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The legislation that we will soon be debating would authorize \nexpenditures from the highway trust fund for 6 years and provide 3 \nyears of funding. It would do so without adding a dime to the deficit \nand without raising taxes.\n  Over the last few months, we have all heard from the naysayers who \nclaimed that such a feat was impossible, that there was no path forward \nto provide long-term highway funding without a massive tax increase. I \nam pleased to see our colleagues have provided us with such a path. All \nwe have to do is be willing to walk down that path.\n  This bipartisan bill provides us with a historic opportunity when it \ncomes to highway funding. It would provide the longest extension of \nhighway funding we have seen in over a decade.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--including some \nwho will likely come out against this bill--like to point to the 2012 \nMAP-21 legislation as a paragon for how Congress should consider and \npass a long-term highway bill. Of course, MAP-21 extended highway \nfunding for only 2 years. This legislation we will be debating this \nweek will go for a significantly longer period of time.\n  In short, passage of this bill would be a significant victory for \ngood government, and, of course, it would provide a great example of \nwhat is possible when Members of both parties work together.\n  Of course, we have seen a number of these types of examples in the \nSenate this year. For example, earlier this year we passed legislation \nto permanently repeal and replace the Medicare sustainable growth rate \nsystem, a problem that had plagued Congress and our health care system \nfor years. Shortly thereafter, we passed a bipartisan bill to combat \nhuman trafficking. And, of course, after that, Members from both \nparties in both Chambers came together to renew trade promotion \nauthority and update our trade laws for the 21st century.\n  The Senate is working again, and I don't think it is going to stop \nany time soon. I think the highway bill will be the next item we add to \nthe long list of bipartisan victories we have achieved in the Senate \nunder the current leadership. We just need to keep moving this bill \nforward.\n  Of course, this bill isn't perfect either. Anyone who is desperate to \nfind a reason to vote against this legislation could likely scour \nthrough the text and find some frivolous reason.\n  The pay-fors in the bill--at least as far as I am concerned--don't \nall represent ideal policy choices. But we shouldn't hold a good bill \nhostage while we search for perfection. Indeed, as I said a number of \ntimes here on the floor in recent months, I have been here in the \nSenate for 39 years, and in that time I don't remember voting on very \nmany bills I thought were perfect.\n  This is a good bill. It is not meant to be a partisan wish list or a \npolitical messaging vehicle. It provides a serious\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\nand workable solution to a legitimate problem, and it was designed to \nget support from Members of both parties.\n  Once again, I want to commend my colleagues for getting us this close \nto a solution on highways.\n  As we all know, the House has taken a different path with regard to \nhighway funding. They have sent over a 6-month patch with the intention \nof using that time to work on a solution that would both fix problems \nin our Tax Code and provide for long-term highway funding.\n  The idea of linking highways to tax reform has a lot of support here \nin Washington. Like I said, that is the path the House has opted to go \ndown, and I know leaders in the Obama administration have a similar \nvision.\n  I want to make one thing clear. I support tax reform. I have been and \nwill continue to be the most outspoken Member of the Senate in favor of \nrobust, bipartisan tax reform. I agree with many of my colleagues that \nlinking that effort to the highway funding could make a lot of sense.\n  Luckily, the Senate's highway bill will allow us to continue to \npursue that path. Keep in mind, that under this bill, we will have 3 \nyears of additional authorized highway expenditures to pay for when all \nis said and done. This means that whenever we can agree on a tax reform \npackage, whether it is 6 months from now or later, it will still be \npossible--and likely just as sensible--to tie the two efforts together.\n  My colleagues also need to keep in mind that while this legislation \naddresses the immediate need for highway funding, the fundamental \nissues that fuel the need for tax reform will remain in place. We will \nstill face an increasing number of corporate incursions and foreign \ntakeovers. Our tax rates will still be too high, and our Tax Code will \nstill be altogether too complicated and burdensome.\n  In other words, if Congress passes this bipartisan, long-term highway \nbill, we will still be under enormous pressure to fix our Nation's \nbroken Tax Code and to provide relief to struggling job creators and \ntaxpayers throughout the country. No one should question that.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this bipartisan highway package. It provides a realistic path \nforward to a solution that all of us want to see. Traditionally, \nMembers of both parties have been able to come together to deal with \nour Nation's infrastructure. For the sake of our citizens who need \nbetter roads and highways; for our builders, engineers, and job \ncreators, who want to grow and expand; and for our workers who need \ngood jobs, I hope we can do so with this important legislation.\n  Now, having said that and having found good in what both the House \nand Senate are trying to do, I think it is important to point out that \ndelaying this for 6 months is not going to work. I can see the same \nroadblocks thrown up every step of the way, and then you get to the end \nof that particular time and the leverage is going to be with those who \nwant to stall this fight to begin with.\n  So I am concerned about doing that, especially when we have what \nreally is a very good highway bill here in the Senate and could solve \nat least these problems for a while, and we can still work on tax \nreform in the process.\n  I have no illusions. I have been around here for a long time, and I \nknow how difficult tax reform is going to be. I also know it takes \nPresidential leadership, which I hope will be there when the time \ncomes. But we have no guarantee it is going to be there.\n  I can remember many months ago that I said to the President: If you \nwant tax reform, send us a well-thought-out bill, and we will see what \nwe can do to put it through. I am still waiting, and I can say that to \nput all our apples in that particular basket may not be the smartest \nthing we can do, especially since we are going to be in an election \nyear next year. That could make it very, very difficult by the end of \nthis year to really do what we all know we should do.\n  This bill answers that problem. It gets rid of one very important big \nproblem, and that is our highway funding. It is no secret that we on \nthe Finance Committee provided--and they didn't think we could do \nthis--really around $82 billion, which we found in the code. We did not \nexpect all $82 billion to be used, but they were there, and it would \nhave given us approximately a 6-year highway bill.\n  That is not going to happen now. But to have a 3-year highway bill, \nwith some of the things we were able to come up with--even though some \nare difficult and controversial--is nothing short of a miracle. So I \nthink we have to get this done. We need to show the House that the \nSenate is moving ahead, and we also need to cooperate with our friends \nin the House when it comes to tax reform.\n  I hope we can bring both Houses together and do tax reform before the \nend of the year. It would be wonderful if we could. I don't have any \nillusions about it, however. But I think we ought to do what we should \ndo, what we have to do, and what needs to be done at this particular \ntime.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from \nUtah. Before Senator Hatch leaves the floor, I just want to say that we \nhave worked very hard to put this bill together. It has been difficult. \nIf I were writing it, I would have written it differently. If the \nSenator from Utah were writing it alone, he would have written it \ndifferently. But we have worked together long enough to know that we \nhave to meet each other halfway.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to thank her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Oh, that is nice. Thank you.\n  Mr. HATCH. This has not been an easy thing to do, and she has taken \nsome unnecessary and unjust criticism for trying to do the art of the \ndoable here in the Senate.\n  I just want to tell her it has been a privilege to work with her, and \nI want to make sure that together--and with the help of others--we get \nthis bill through for the benefit of this country and for the benefit \nof our highways.\n  I know how hard the Senator from California and the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma have worked on the highway bill. So I just want \nto say I have tremendous respect for the Senator and appreciate her \nefforts in this regard and want to give kudos to her. Keep it up. We \nhave to get this done.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to Senator Hatch, that means a lot to me. I so \nremember that the Senator from Utah set the pace for bipartisan \ncooperation when he worked with the late great Senator Ted Kennedy. \nPeople looked at the two of you and said: This is impossible. But my \ncolleague was able to find the common ground and build on it, and I \nwatched that.\n  Senator Inhofe and I have been able to do our best to also find the \nsweet spot where we could come together and work together. I just \nwanted my colleague to know that the teamwork I watched between himself \nand Senator Kennedy from time to time on very important issues made an \nimpression on me and certainly on the Senate and on the whole country.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield again--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course.\n  Mr. HATCH. I remember when we finally got together. It was way back \nin 1980-1981.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. From that point on we found ways of coming together and \ngetting things done that are monumental and landmark pieces of \nlegislation. There is no reason why we can't do that today.\n  Let me just mention that on the Committee on Finance we have put out \nof the committee almost 40 bills that are bipartisan--not just one \nDemocrat or one Republican, but bipartisan in nature--not the least of \nwhich is the highway bill--the funding, rather. And I just have to say \nthat we are doing what we should do here.\n  I think people feel good about it. I have had people come up and say \nit is wonderful we are having amendments again and working together and \nwe are getting things done. And I certainly attribute some of that to \nthe distinguished Senator from California and the work she is doing \nhere in the Senate. I do personally appreciate working with her.\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\n  Let's get this done. I will do everything in my power to help the \nSenator from California, and I thank her so much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I say to Senator Hatch, we are going to have some \ntough votes coming up, and some people aren't going to like this \namendment or that amendment, but all I want to say is this: Let's keep \nour eye on what the prize is.\n  Before the Senator leaves the floor, I want to share with him a \nphoto. Last week, on the California-Arizona border, a bridge collapsed. \nNow, this bridge had been rated as structurally obsolete because so \nmuch traffic was going between California and Arizona--so much more \ntraffic than was anticipated. We are so fortunate there were no deaths \ninvolved.\n  To me this is the reason why we are doing what we are doing. We just \ncan't sit back and wait for some great, wonderful future promise to \ncome down from the sky and say: We have solved the funding problems.\n  We want to find that solution. It is not at hand. So what the Senator \ndid, which was so important--working with all the members of the \nCommittee on Finance and across party lines with leadership and \neverybody else--was to put together sources of funding that he felt the \nSenate could live with.\n  As it turned out, there were a couple of things that were a bridge \ntoo far--talking about bridges--for a couple of Members, and we are \nfixing those. We are fixing those, and it is good. But none of these \npay-fors are delightful. They are all hard. But this is what we are \ntrying to turn around.\n  So I say to my colleagues on both sides--and I have said it to my own \ncaucus over and over--nobody is going to love every page of this bill \nbecause that is the nature of legislating. If we each could write our \nown bill, we would love every page. We would be thrilled. We would blow \nkisses at every page. But we don't write it ourselves. We have to step \nback, and we have to allow the process to work.\n  Yesterday, that process worked. It was tough, but we got more than 60 \nvotes to begin work on a long-term surface transportation bill. That \nbill is going to give certainty to our States--3 years of certain \nfunding and a 6-year authorization, with the hope that in the coming \nmonths we can figure out a good way to look at international tax reform \nand other ways to pay for the final 3 years.\n  But let me be clear. It has been more than 10 years since we have had \nmore than a 2-year extension. This is a 3-year bill, and it makes great \nimprovements in the Environment and Public Works title.\n  We really did compromise, Senator Inhofe and I, and he and I really \nworked well together in this area. This cloture vote was so key and so \nimportant to business and labor and all the people who know they don't \nwant this to happen to them in their State, in their commute. How many \nmore bridges have to fail before we recognize that we can't be patching \nup this highway trust fund little by little? It is just not working.\n  I often say this--and I hope it doesn't bore people because I have \nsaid it a lot--if you wanted to buy a house and you found a house and \nyou went to a good banker and he or she looked at you and said ``I have \ngreat news for you, Mr. or Mrs. America--we have checked your credit \nrating, your credit rating is great, and we are going to give you a \nmortgage'' and you said ``That is wonderful news'' and then they said \n``But it is only for 6 months or 5 months or 1 year,'' you are not \ngoing to buy that house. That is what we have been doing to our States \nand local entities. They can't build anything new. They can't make \ninvestments that are important because they don't have a guarantee that \nthe funding will be there.\n  The beautiful thing about our funding system is it is Federal, State, \nand local, and there is even sometimes some private money that comes \nin. So the Federal Government is the spark. I don't know what the \nPresiding Officer's ratio is in Louisiana, whether it is 50/50 or 60/\n40. In my State, it is about 50/50. We have 50 percent local State \ndollars to 50 percent Federal dollars. Some of our States rely on the \nFederal Government for 90 percent of their transportation dollars, and \none State, 100 percent. So this isn't a question of having the States \ndo this by themselves; they really can't do it by themselves.\n  It was President Eisenhower--a Republican President--so many years \nago who said if we are going to have a strong country, if we are going \nto protect our national security, we have to be able to move people and \nmove goods. He took a tour across this great Nation, and he came up \nwith the notion of a highway trust fund and a national transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Well, the EPW Committee--which I am the ranking member of and Senator \nInhofe chairs--provides about 70 percent of the spending in this \nTransportation bill. We came together in a 20-to-0 vote and voted in \nfavor of the DRIVE Act. This is going to support millions of jobs--not \nhundreds, not thousands, but millions of jobs across our great Nation--\nand it will provide economic security. If we don't do this and we wind \nup with a patch, believe me when I tell you that our States will shut \ndown their programs because they just can't move forward.\n  It is imperative that we act now--I agree with Senator Hatch--because \nwe have come so far. If we don't do this, we will be looking at another \nextension. Somebody told me it was the 34th extension--the 34th \nextension. That is not right. We need to do our work. The committees \nhave done their work.\n  I was happy to hear that Senator Brown now says that the transit \nfunding is good. It is very good, as well as the highway funding.\n  So I want people to keep in mind the picture of this bridge. It means \nthat when there are goods moving through from Arizona to California or \nCalifornia to Arizona, the cars and trucks have to go 400 miles out of \ntheir way--the cost of that to our Nation's business, the difficulty of \nthat to those who drive the trucks and the vans.\n  I will say that this link is closed indefinitely. That is a terrible \nthing to say. They don't have a plan to fix this because it is so \ncomplex, and we need the funding so that they can. We have emergency \nfunding in this bill--$100 million per year--to look at situations like \nthis and come in and help.\n  How many more bridges have to collapse before we do our job? We \ncannot be economically competitive when truckers delivering goods have \nto drive 400 miles out of the way to get goods from one State to \nanother.\n  Here are the facts: There are 61,300 bridges that are structurally \ndeficient in America. Fifty 50 percent of our roads are in less than \ngood condition. We have no excuses. We need to move forward.\n  I will show a list of supporters of our work. I just implore those 38 \nor so Members who voted no on going to this bill--I ask you to take a \nlook at these groups and tell me in your heart of hearts how you can \nsay no to them. These are hard-working people. They are Republicans. \nThey are Democrats. They are Independents. They are people of every \npolitical stripe--the American Highway Users Alliance, the American \nPublic Transportation Association, the American Road and Transportation \nBuilders Association, American Society of Civil Engineers, American \nTrucking Associations, equipment distributors, general contractors, \nequipment manufacturers, metropolitan planning organizations, the \nNational Asphalt Pavement Association.\n  I have four of these charts. These are the people who want us to vote \nyes: The National Association of Counties--I started off as a county \nsupervisor--they know the bridges and roads are in disrepair; the \nNational Association of Manufacturers; the National Association of \nTruck Stop Operators; the National Governors Association; the League of \nCities; the ready mixed concrete people; the sand, stone, and gravel \npeople; the independent drivers; the Portland Cement Association; the \nRetail Industry Leaders Association.\n  Here is another one, the last one: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Now, \nI ask you, when do we see the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborers' International \nUnion of North America, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters--when do \nwe see all these on the same side? The answer: When we write a highway \nbill.\n  America is coming together around our efforts. We should be unanimous \neven though there are parts of the bill I don't like and you don't \nlike. Colleagues, we cannot have a perfect bill.\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\nIt is an imperfect bill in an imperfect world. But unless we wrote it \nourselves, we would never be thrilled with every provision.\n  I will finish. The AAA--remember those people we call when we break \ndown? The AAA said: Pass a bill. They are tired of coming out to start \nup cars that aren't running well because they get caught in some kind \nof sinkhole.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors; the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials; Mothers Against Drunk Driving--\nand I want to say that at first Mothers Against Drunk Driving opposed \nthis bill. Now they support it. There is also the American Council of \nEngineering Companies.\n  This is a list of people who are begging us to pass this bill.\n  Democrats stood here, and we called on the Republicans to please come \nup with a bill, and they did. There were reasons to say we didn't love \nit, and we sat down and we worked hard. I have to say that Senator \nMcConnell and his staff, my staff, Senator Inhofe's staff, Senator \nDurbin and his staff--we have been working hard. We are still working \nto get more votes. We need more votes. We need this to happen.\n  Today my plea is that the clock is ticking. We have 8 days, \ncolleagues, until the highway trust fund goes bust. Guess what. We can \nsolve this problem, get a strong bill that increases funding in the \nfirst year by 6 percent and after that a couple percent a year for 3 \nyears. It scores well. It doesn't add a penny to the deficit. I am so \nglad we are moving forward, but we need more support.\n  Here is my last plea to everybody who might possibly be listening--\nmaybe my relatives, but in addition to that, anyone who might be \nlistening: There are going to be amendments that I don't like and that \nyou don't like. Could we try to keep our eye on the prize? This is the \nprize. We don't want this happening anyplace in this country. It brings \ndevastation.\n  We have a good bill before us. Is it perfect? No. Are the pay-fors \nperfect? No. Are we continuing to improve it? Yes. Can we always do \nmore later? Yes.\n  Let's say yes together, Republicans Democrats. Let's deliver this for \nthe American people.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n Honoring Vietnam Veterans and North Dakota's Soldiers Who Lost Their \n                            Lives in Vietnam\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, as I do on many Thursdays, I rise again \ntoday to share about the lives of the men from my State, the North \nDakotans who died during the Vietnam war. I have been talking about the \n189 men who didn't make it home, but that is not a complete accounting \nof the people we lost as a result of Vietnam.\n  Many of our Vietnam veterans continue to feel the effects of their \nservice long after they return home. Some developed medical conditions \nthat, quite frankly, are hard to explain. I have worked with a number \nof these men, many of whom became my friends and one who is very \nspecial to me, a veteran by the name of Bill Broer, who was former \ndirector of the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation.\n\n\n                         William ``Bill'' Broer\n\n  William ``Bill'' Broer started his work in law enforcement as a \nsecurity policeman in the U.S. Air Force. During the Vietnam war, Bill \nwas stationed at a base that supported aircraft that was used in Agent \nOrange campaigns. Bill died in 2002, at the age of 53, from non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma.\n  In 1989, Bill was appointed Director of the Bureau of Criminal \nInvestigation and was an outstanding law enforcement official. He was \nawarded the Attorney General's Meritorious Service Award in 1991 and \nthe North Dakota peace officers highest award, the Lone Eagle Award, in \n1996.\n  Bill worked hard for North Dakota law enforcement both at his desk in \nour office and during his free time. He started a bowling tournament to \nbring together people involved in law enforcement from across our State \nso they could get to know each other and work together in an \nenvironment that took them away from their official duties. That \ntournament is now in its 30th year.\n  Bill also was instrumental in creating the Peace Officers Memorial \nthat stands on the capitol grounds today, recognizing that those who \nserve in law enforcement also take that risk every day that so many of \nour servicemen do in protection of our people.\n  But I want to say something more than that about Bill. I am quite \ncertain I probably would not have been attorney general without Bill's \nhelp, and I certainly don't believe I would have been a United States \nSenator without the lessons I learned from Bill Broer. He was a great \nfriend and a trusted adviser to me.\n  Quite honestly, I don't know anyone in law enforcement who didn't \nabsolutely love him. His staff was devastated when Bill was taken ill. \nWe were devastated when we lost Bill way too early--I know not as \ndevastated as his wonderful wife and his two great daughters. I \nremember when he used to rush home so he could be at a basketball game, \nof course in his suit and tie, always cheering them on. His only fault \nprobably was being an Atlanta Braves fan.\n\n\n                             John Schneider\n\n  Another friend of mine, John Schneider, died in 2001 from a brain \ntumor. He also was a Vietnam-era veteran and a true friend and public \nservant of the highest caliber.\n  John served in the Peace Corps in Afghanistan in the 1960s and was \ntops in his language class, which was learning Pashto. He worked with \nfarmers to introduce a hardier, more productive wheat variety to the \nregion.\n  While in law school, John was drafted. He entered the Marine Corps in \n1970 and was deployed to bases in Japan and the Philippines during the \nVietnam war. John finished his law studies after he was discharged and \njoined a firm in Fargo, ND. He was elected to the North Dakota House of \nRepresentatives in 1982 and was known for his brilliant command of the \nlegislative process. He was appointed U.S. attorney for North Dakota in \n1993. In fact, he served in that capacity because I begged him to join \nme. He served as our U.S. attorney during those same years that I \nserved as attorney general, and we spent a lot of time together, \nespecially in Indian Country, working on the law enforcement issues of \nthe day.\n\n  John was devoted to his wife Lois and their sons Jasper and Rocky. He \nloved cooking--cooking with way too much salt for them--and visiting \nwith them for endless hours, even taking longer routes to school so he \nand his sons could talk.\n  John organized the Schneider baseball games, family tennis matches, \nand other competitions. The boys have a love of baseball to this day \nbecause of John. He loved to sing, knew thousands of songs, had a \nbeautiful voice, and wrote and produced original family Christmas plays \nfor 15 years.\n  John was thoughtful and kind. He loved life and he loved North Dakota \nand its people.\n  Now I have the privilege of sharing about the lives and deaths of \nother North Dakotans, those men who did not come home from the war.\n\n\n                        James ``Jimmy'' Levings\n\n  James Levings was commonly called Jimmy. He was from New Town. He was \nborn on October 18, 1948. He served in the Army's 503rd Infantry, 173rd \nAirborne Brigade. Jimmy was 19 years old when he was killed May 23, \n1968.\n  His father James Conklin, Jr., served our country in the Army during \nthe Korean war, and his grandfather Martin Levings also served in the \nArmy in Europe during World War I.\n  Jimmy grew up close to his grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. \nThey said Jimmy thought the world of hunting, hiking, and riding \nhorses.\n  His family appreciates the letters he mailed them when he was serving \nin Vietnam. They remember the pictures he mailed them and how proud he \nlooked to be serving his country.\n  Jimmy's cousin Rex Mayer said he enjoyed when Jimmy stayed with his \nfamily when they were young because Jimmy was like an older brother who \nplayed with him and took him to the movies at the nearby theater. Rex \nsaid Jimmy was 17 years old when he enlisted in the Army and \nvolunteered to return to Vietnam for his second tour. Rex remembers \nseeing Jimmy when he was home on leave between his tours and that Jimmy \nhad a different look about him, that he was changed by what he \nexperienced in Vietnam.\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\n  Jimmy was shot and killed in Vietnam when he approached his base \nperimeter and was accidentally mistaken as a hostile force.\n  Jimmy is buried in Snowbird Chapel Cemetery and his name is \nmemorialized on the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Fallen Soldiers Memorial \nnear New Town.\n\n\n                              Ward Walter\n\n  Ward Walter was born October 13, 1917. Prior to serving in Vietnam, \nWard had lived in McKenzie County and in Minot. He served in the Army's \n720th Military Police Battalion. Ward was 50 years old when he died on \nNovember 29, 1967.\n  Ward spent most of his adult life working in law enforcement and \nserving in the Army. Based on Ward's time in the Army and experience in \nfour countries, his fellow soldiers became like family to him. His \ncamaraderie and guidance earned him the nickname of Pop.\n  One month after arriving in Vietnam, Ward's team was tasked with \nsetting up an ambush. Once in their ambush position, a U.S. Army jeep \ndrove by and spotted movement. Thinking Ward's team members were \nopposing forces, the jeep opened fire, shooting Ward in the chest and \nkilling him.\n  To commemorate Ward, members of his battalion named the movie theater \nat their post in Vietnam the Sergeant Ward ``Pop'' Memorial Theater.\n  The Army recognized Ward's service by issuing him the Bronze Star \nMedal for Valor, the Purple Heart, and the Good Conduct Medal.\n\n\n                             Leon Lochthowe\n\n  Leon Lochthowe was from Minot. He was born March 23, 1945. He served \nin the Marine Corps' Mike Company, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. \nLeon died on September 22, 1967. He was 22 years old.\n  Leon was the oldest of four children born to Don and Donna Lochthowe. \nHis mother Donna said that growing up on the family farm, Leon was a \nfree spirit and enjoyed riding his dirt bike in off-road races. He \nmarried Betty Berg, and they had a son Rickie and daughter Kimberly.\n  On September 10, 1965, Leon, his wife, and two children were driving \nnorth of Minot and were hit head-on by a drunk driver. Leon's wife and \nboth children were killed.\n  After his wife and kids' deaths, Leon's draft number was changed to \nthat of a single man. He chose to enlist in the Marines. A year after \nhis family's death, he arrived in Vietnam.\n  Leon's fellow marine Gerald Loretta credits Leon with saving his life \nby pulling him to safety after he was wounded so badly he could not \nmove. Other fellow marines have also written about Leon's heroism \nduring his service.\n  On September 22, 1967, Leon received a letter from his mother stating \nthat his parents were in California with his brother Gary, who was \ncritically ill with spinal meningitis. Gary recently had enlisted in \nthe Marines and was in his first days of basic training when he was \nhospitalized. That same afternoon, rockets and artillery began shelling \nthe area that Leon was defending. Shrapnel struck him in the chest, and \nhe was killed instantly.\n  Leon's parents left California, where their son Gary was in a coma, \nto return to Minot to receive Leon's body and hold a funeral. Just \nhours after arriving home, Donna learned that her father had died in \nhis home. The day after his funeral, they held Leon's funeral. During \nLeon's funeral reception, the family learned their son Gary had just \ndied in California. This is a family who had held three funerals for \nthe men they love in just 1 week.\n\n\n                        Robert ``Bobby'' Storey\n\n  Robert ``Bobby'' Storey was from Grand Forks, and he was born July \n22, 1946. He served in the Army Reserve's 17th Aviation Group, 1st \nAviation Brigade as a helicopter pilot. Bobby was 22 years old when he \ndied on November 21, 1968.\n  He was the oldest of four children. His father Henry served in the \nAir Force and the family moved to different bases while the kids were \nyoung.\n  Bobby's sister Debbie said that Bobby was kind and had a smile that \nwould light up a room. She remembers that in high school he played \nquarterback for the high school football team and was nicknamed Bunny \nbecause of how fast he could run. Bobby's friends came to their house \noften, which meant a house full of boys and a refrigerator stocked with \nmilk.\n  Bobby attended college at the University of North Dakota. He joined \nthe Sigma Nu Fraternity, and he and several of his fraternity brothers \nenlisted in the Army.\n  Bobby became a Warrant Officer helicopter pilot, and about a month \nafter arriving in Vietnam his helicopter was shot down and Bobby was \nkilled. After his death, Bobby's father also went to Vietnam, serving \nour country in 1970 and 1971.\n  After Bobby's death, both of Bobby's brothers chose to wear the \nnumber 22 on their sports jerseys, just like Bobby had in high school. \nIn memory of Bobby, his youngest brother named their son Robert.\n\n\n                        Deland ``Dennis'' Zubke\n\n  Deland ``Dennis'' Zubke was from Grassy Butte, and he was born \nOctober 28, 1951. He served in the Army's 15th Artillery Regiment. \nDeland was just 19 years old when he went missing on March 1, 1971.\n  He was one of five children born to Drusilla and Gerald Zubke.\n  One of Deland's fellow soldiers, Ralph, wrote a remembrance \ndescribing how Deland volunteered to take Ralph's place on a dangerous \nmission the day Deland was last seen. His actions that day under \nintense enemy and friendly fire made Deland a hero. In Ralph's eyes, \nDeland should have been awarded a Silver Star for his courage under the \nmost difficult combat conditions imaginable. Deland had arrived in \nVietnam about 2 months earlier.\n  In 1978, the Army changed Deland's status from Missing in Action to \nDied While Missing. Deland has never been found.\n\n\n                              David Kline\n\n  David Kline was born July 31, 1948, and was from Hurdsfield. He was \nin the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. David died July 2, 1967. He was 18 \nyears old.\n  David's sister Faye remembers that David was liked by everyone in \nHurdsfield. David was the envy of many because he owned a pink and \nwhite 1957 Chevy convertible.\n  He played basketball for the high school team and liked playing his \nguitar for fun. ``Dancing in the Streets'' by Martha and the Vandellas \nwas one of his favorite songs. He was senior class president and hoped \nto teach history someday.\n  He had a younger brother Curtis, who was just 11 months younger than \nDavid. They were so close, folks around town told them they were like \ntwins.\n  Faye said that when she, David, and Curtis were young, they always \nparticipated in Memorial Day events, placing flags next to the \nheadstones of our country's veterans. Faye recalls clearly that one \ntime David noted that ``someday, I will have a flag just like that.''\n  She remembers the words he said to her, his little sister, the last \ntime he left for Vietnam: ``Don't grow up too fast.''\n\n\n                         Robert ``Bob'' Fullmer\n\n  Robert ``Bob'' Fullmer was from Grand Forks. He was born April 2, \n1948. He served in the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Bob died on June \n6, 1969. He was 21 years old.\n  Bob had two brothers, Bud and Bill. They both served our country. Bud \nserved in the Navy and Bill served in the Army Reserve.\n  Bill said Bob was very social and enjoyed always having friends over. \nWhen Bob was killed in Vietnam, his parents donated his death gratuity \nto the Grand Forks Central High School to be used as a scholarship for \nstudents with average grades who wished to attend the University of \nNorth Dakota.\n  Bob's high school friend Barb Colby wrote a poem about Bob shortly \nafter he died, and the poem was published in 1987 in the first issue of \na magazine entitled ``Reflecting on the Memories of War.'' This was her \npoem:\n\n     Why didn't you say goodbye\n     The January day,\n     When that damn warring airplane\n     Took you so far away?\n     Maybe you knew before you left\n     That you were going to die\n     So your heart just wouldn't let you\n     Come and say goodbye.\n     Please try and understand\n     I can't come to where you lie.\n     I guess I feel like you did then.\n     I just can't say goodbye.\n\n  After learning that Bob's mother had read her poem, Barb visited his \nmother\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\non Memorial Day. After their visit, Barb wrote a letter to the editor \nof the magazine describing how she and Bob's mother reminisced about \nBob's life and the people who have contacted his mother since his death \ndescribing the ways they have touched his mother's heart.\n  Talking with Bob's mother and seeing her laughter, strength, and \nwarmth made Barb realize, 17 years later, that her poem was not \nfinished. Barb wrote this ending to her poem and dedicated it to Bob \nand his mother.\n\n     Seventeen years have come and gone\n     Again it's the month of May.\n     I went back home and met your mom\n     On this Memorial Day.\n     She talked of you as a child and son\n     I told her stories of our youth.\n     And as we shared our memories and loss\n     She taught me a simple truth.\n     She showed me that your memory is alive\n     So you'll never really die.\n     She made me laugh--she let me cry\n     She helped me to say goodbye.\n\n  These are just some of the stories I am privileged to share, \nhopefully with the rest of the country, as we continue this 50-year \nremembrance of the Vietnam war and the people who took part. I think it \nis so critical and so important, especially in this time when we call \non people to make sacrifices, that so many of the young people here, \nwho would be the age of the grandchildren of many of the people who \nserved, appreciate and understand the extent of the sacrifice and the \ndisruption of family but the love of country that is an inherent part \nof each one of these stories.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nvery brief remarks Senator Sullivan be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Montana Wildfires\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want to bring attention to the serious \nwildfires going on in Montana as I speak. There are currently two large \nactive fires burning in Montana, including 4,000 acres called the \nReynolds Creek fire right in Glacier National Park, as well as the \nCabin Gulch fire, 2,500 acres, near Townsend.\n  Our fire crews are putting themselves in harm's way to protect our \nlands, our forests, and our communities. With lower-than-average \nsnowpack, we have had less-than-average rains. It has created a \nsituation. We have very low water levels in our rivers and our streams, \nand our firefighting teams are facing ripe conditions for wildfire.\n  They are also being driven by high winds and dry fuels. So far this \nyear, we are experiencing the second worst fire season in terms of \nimpacted areas in a decade. The situation could only get more serious \nin the coming weeks and months.\n  Our communities, our watersheds, our wildlife habitat, our access to \nrecreation--all of these critical Montana treasures--are at risk for \nwildfire. Please join me in praying for the safety of our firefighters, \nand please thank them for a job and service well done for the State of \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to begin my remarks this \nafternoon by commending my colleague from North Dakota for her weekly \ntributes to our Vietnam veterans. I have watched her do that week after \nweek. It is very moving. It speaks volumes to her character as well as \nthe character of the veterans from North Dakota.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak about one \nof the important issues facing the Senate today, for weeks, months, and \nmaybe even years, and that is the debate we are having over the Iran \nnuclear agreement.\n  Many of my colleagues have already spoken very eloquently and very \npatiently about this agreement. I want to give one example. My \ncolleague from Maine, Senator King, was on the floor the other day when \nI was presiding. He was imploring us to fully debate the issue. He \nstated: ``The truth emerges from the fire of an argument on an issue of \nthis importance.'' I couldn't agree more. We should debate this issue. \nWe should fully vet this issue. We should bring all of the voices of \nthe people we represent into this body to debate this issue.\n  Where to begin? There is so much here, so many issues. We have seen \nsome of them: centrifuges, enrichment, inspections, sanctions, and \nanywhere, anytime inspections. We have to examine all of that.\n  I thought it was important today to step back and take a look at some \nof the big issues. There are three issues that I believe are \nparticularly important as we start this debate: first, the role of the \nAmerican people and this body and the Congress with regard to this \nagreement; second, the basic underlying premise of this agreement--the \ndriving force that in many ways is behind this agreement; and third, \nthe main goal as has been agreed to by the President and by Members of \nthis body on what we should be trying to achieve with regard to this \nagreement.\n  First, the role of the American people in this body. There is \nconfusion, which has been perpetuated by this administration, that \nthose of us who are asking questions and are skeptical of the agreement \nare somehow being partisan. The President said that Republicans, no \nmatter the deal, will disagree with him and not vote with him. In some \nways he seems to be making this about his personal agenda. But with all \ndue respect to the President, the Iranian nuclear agreement is much \nbigger than President Obama--much bigger. The President will be gone in \n18 months, and the American people will have to live with the \nconsequences of this agreement for decades. That is why it is so \nimportant that the Congress debate and approve or disapprove this \nagreement. Yet, had the Obama administration had its way, we would not \nbe doing this today--what we are doing right now--debating this \nagreement.\n  In fact, throughout this process, from the very beginning, they have \nbeen dismissive of the role of the American people through their \nrepresentatives in Congress to weigh in and bring clarity and wisdom to \nwhat this agreement is all about. Just a few months ago, the President \nsaid that he did not want the Congress to be involved at all. We \nstarted debating an act on this floor to provide this body with an \nopportunity to review and approve. He said he would veto it--no \ninvolvement from the American people. The administration only backed \noff when a bipartisan group of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, \nstood firm--a veto-proof majority--and said: No, the American people \nneed to be read into this agreement. That was when we passed the Iran \nNuclear Review Act. I personally would have preferred that this be \nviewed as a treaty by the administration, but we are reviewing it now \nunder that law.\n  The President and Secretary Kerry have taken the deal to the U.N. \nSecurity Council--again, before Congress and the American people even \nstarted to debate the issue. The Russians and Chinese were voting on \nthis agreement before we had the opportunity to do so. Members of this \nbody, Democrats and Republicans, implored the Secretary by saying: \nDon't do this; it is an affront to the American people. They didn't \nlisten. Finally, the President is saying--even before we debate--if we \nare not in agreement with him, he is going to veto whatever we do in \nthis body.\n  This is not how the Federal Government is supposed to conduct foreign \npolicy. Throughout the history of this great body, weighing in and \nvoting on international agreements and international treaties of this \nmagnitude have been the Senate's most important job, the heart and soul \nof what we do in this body. Sadly, two former Members of this body--the \nPresident and the Secretary of State--have actively fought against our \ninvolvement.\n  But Alexander Hamilton knew better. In the Federalist Papers, he \nspoke about the critical role of the Senate in foreign affairs. He \nwarned against the President having sole authority over issues of such \na ``delicate and momentous kind.'' He argued vigorously for the Senate \nto have a say on critical foreign policy and national security issues. \nOur history and the Constitution reflect this, and that is where we \ncome in, and that is why we are debating this.\n  In examining the agreement, I think it is important to understand and \nlook at the bigger picture. What is the driving force? What is the \nunderlying premise? What is the philosophy that is\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nmotivating this agreement? It is not hard to discern. From the \nbeginning of the Obama administration, the President and his team have \nbeen focused on transforming our relationship with Iran to bring it \ninto the community of respected nations, thereby transforming the \nMiddle East. The President has talked about this a number of times. He \nhighlighted this in a speech to the United Nations in 2013, and it is \nhere again in the text of this agreement.\n  The text of the agreement states that the P5+1 expresses its desire \nto build a new relationship with Iran. That is in the agreement. This \nis a bold and ambitious goal, no doubt, but it is also dangerously \nnaive. Interestingly, there is no reciprocal statement in the agreement \nby Iran about Iran wanting to have a new relationship with the United \nStates or the West. We want it; they don't seem to want it. In fact, \nwith its leaders regularly still chanting ``death to America; death to \nIsrael'' even after the signing of this agreement, it seems very clear \nthat Iran does not want a new relationship, and this is the biggest \nflaw of the agreement. It amounts to a high-stakes bet--the highest of \nstakes: the security of the United States--that Iran will change its \nbehavior.\n  What I fear the most is if they don't change--and there is no sign \nthat they are going to--within 10 years, by its own terms, this \nagreement will enable Iran to have a much stronger economy, a \nsignificant ballistic missile capability, to be on the verge of a \nnuclear bomb and still be the world's largest sponsor of state \nterrorism. This is a huge risk for the security of our country and our \nallies in the Middle East.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. This agreement could have mitigated \nthese risks. We do this all the time in diplomacy. We tell countries \nthat we negotiate with: If you improve your behavior, you will get \nrewarded incrementally, step by step--step by difficult step. For \nexample, during the debate we had on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct, I offered an amendment that was simple, but it was based on this \nissue: Sanctions would be lifted on Iran once Iran came off the list of \ncountries that sponsored state terrorism. Simple. If you improve your \nbehavior, you will get rewarded. This agreement does not do that. \nInstead, when you look at the structure of this agreement, it allows \nIran to get almost all of the benefits up front.\n  Almost half of this agreement is about our obligations to lift \nsanctions in very minute detail--our obligations to lift sanctions on \nIran within the next several months. Think about that. We had the \nleverage. The countries that negotiated this are among the most \npowerful in the world. We had Iran on the ropes with strong, American-\nled sanctions. We had the leverage, and we lost it with this agreement \non the hope that Iran will change its behavior.\n  So far, it is clear that their leaders did not get the memo on the \nchange of behavior or on the new relationship. Iran is still \ndestabilizing the Middle East, holding Americans hostage, threatening \nIsrael, and supporting terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah and others, \nthroughout the world. In fact, Iran, which is a nation that has had \nimperial ambitions throughout the Middle East for centuries, could very \nwell accelerate its destabilizing activities as a result of the power \nand prestige this agreement provides them.\n  Supporters of this agreement, including the President, are arguing: \nLook, United States, we have done this before. We have negotiated with \nour enemies to a positive end. President Reagan did it with the Soviet \nUnion. He got a constructive deal. But this is a flawed analogy both \nstrategically and tactically. When we negotiated with the Soviet Union, \nit was a negotiation between the world's two superpowers that were \narmed with nuclear weapons, similar military strength--thousands of \nmilitary weapons. Here, however, we are bringing a nuclear pariah into \nthe club of nuclear powers. This is very different.\n  Tactically, Team Obama has never demonstrated the desire to walk away \nfrom this deal. This wasn't the case with President Reagan. He famously \nwalked away from the Soviets in Reykjavik, Iceland, over a verification \nissue on the INF agreement. ``This meeting is over,'' President Reagan \nsaid to George Shultz, his Secretary of State, when he thought we were \ngiving away too much. ``Let's go, George. We're leaving,'' said the \nPresident. And they did. They left. A year later, Mikhail Gorbachev \ncame back to the table and agreed to onsite inspections of their \nnuclear facilities. America and the USSR signed the INF treaty, and \nSoviet power began to unravel. Contrast that to the experience we have \nheard about in the last few months of these negotiations on the issue \nof conventional weapons and ballistic missiles.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Martin Dempsey, \ntestified in front of the Armed Services Committee very recently. He \nsaid: ``Under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran \nrelative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.'' That \nwas said by the No. 1 military adviser to the President of the United \nStates. But we did. Within 7 days of that statement, we did. The \nembargo on conventional weapons and ballistic missiles is going to be \nlifted as part of this agreement. When the Russians and the Chinese \npushed this position at the very end of these negotiations, Secretary \nKerry should have listened to General Dempsey's military advice and he \nshould have done what Secretary Shultz did. He should have walked. He \nshould have walked away to get a better deal.\n\n  Finally, I wish to conclude by underscoring what everybody, from the \nPresident to Members of this body, has agreed should be the principal \nnegotiation objective of this agreement, which has always been to keep \nIran from developing a nuclear weapon and to dismantle its nuclear \ncapability.\n  In fact, this body weighed in last year--March of 2014--in a letter \nwritten by 81 U.S. Senators to the President of the United States about \nthese negotiations. The letter had a number of benchmarks for the \nnegotiators. One stated that sanctions ``must continue until Iran \nabandons its efforts to build a nuclear weapon.''\n  The letter then goes on to cite another critical basic goal of the \nagreement. It states: ``We believe any agreement must dismantle Iran's \nnuclear weapons program and prevent it from ever having a uranium or \nplutonium path to a nuclear bomb.'' Last year, 81 Senators stated that. \nLet me repeat that: ``We believe any agreement must dismantle Iran's \nnuclear weapons program and prevent it from ever having a uranium or \nplutonium path to a nuclear bomb.'' I agree with the 81 Senators. Mr. \nPresident, 40 Democrats, 40 Republicans, and 1 Independent signed that \nletter, and 72 of those Senators are still Members of this body. But \nthey need to ask themselves: Are they sure this goal has been achieved?\n  I have read this entire agreement. I believe this goal has not been \nachieved, and that should deeply concern all Members of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Let me conclude by quoting someone I normally do not quote on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate--Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, \nwho just this past Saturday stated the following: ``Even after this \ndeal our policy towards the arrogant United States will not change,'' \nand then he led the crowd he was before into chanting ``Death to \nAmerica.'' That is the country that we are hoping and risking our \nfuture on that will change, that we will have a ``new relationship'' \nwith, as the agreement states.\n  To the American people: We will continue to debate this critical \nissue.\n  In the words of my colleague from Maine, we will bring the fire to \nthe debate and a truth will emerge. Unfortunately, here is one truth \nthat I find self-evident: Iran is not changing anytime soon. That is \nbecause this agreement didn't force it to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n\n                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if we ask most people in America what is \nthe most heavily subsidized industry in America, which industry, which \nsector of our economy receives the highest level of Federal subsidy in \nAmerica, I guess they would get it wrong, because it turns out the \nsector that gets the highest degree of Federal subsidy is for-profit \ncolleges and universities--for-profit colleges and universities.\n  I wish to say a word or two about the current status of the largest \nof these\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\nfor-profit colleges and universities and the tactics they are using to \nbecome even fatter at the expense of the American taxpayers.\n  I will read a quote about the for-profit college industry:\n\n       They are not educators and they're looking to manipulate \n     this model to make money. There is nothing wrong with making \n     money, but I think anyone making money in an educational \n     activity has a higher standard of accountability.\n\n  Some might think that was a quote from some speech I gave here. They \nwould be wrong. That was a quote from John Murphy, a cofounder of the \nUniversity of Phoenix, during a recent interview he gave to Deseret \nNews National. As the article rightly observes, the University of \nPhoenix is the ``grand-daddy'' of the for-profit industry, but the \nenterprise has experienced a dramatic shift in priorities since it \nbecame a publicly traded company, according to Mr. Murphy, one of the \ncofounders. The reason for the change, according to Murphy, is the \ncombination of the new corporate entity--for-profit University of \nPhoenix--chasing stock prices with the temptation of the open spigot of \nFederal funds. Mr. Murphy calls the Federal student loan money ``the \njuice'' of the for-profit college industry. And for its part, the \nUniversity of Phoenix is swimming in the juice. They received 84 \npercent of their revenue from Federal title IV funding in 2012 and \n2013. How much? It was $3.5 billion.\n  According to law, for-profit colleges are prohibited--we don't want \nthem to become too dependent on the Federal Government, so we prohibit \nthem from receiving any more than 90 percent of their revenue from \ntitle IV Federal funding--90 percent.\n  When I think of the outrage I hear from those in Washington who track \nFederal money, I can't believe they are overlooking this industry. A \nmajor loophole, however, allows the University of Phoenix to not \ninclude veterans' GI Bill benefits or Department of Defense tuition \nassistance programs in their Federal revenue calculation. So I joined \nwith Senator Tom Carper of Delaware and others to fix this, to close \nthis loophole, to hold the for-profit colleges to no more than 90 \npercent of the revenue coming directly from the Federal Government.\n  A recent article by Aaron Glantz published by the Center for \nInvestigative Reporting provides a troubling look into the world of \nfor-profit college recruitment of America's veterans and members of our \nmilitary. The article details how the University of Phoenix has become \na major sponsor of military events. In one instance, they paid $25,000 \nto sponsor a concert for military members and their families. The \ncompany gave away Galaxy computer tablets and wrapped the stage in a \ngiant University of Phoenix banner. In other instances, the Center for \nInvestigative Reporting found that the University of Phoenix sponsored \n``resume workshops'' which essentially amounted to recruitment drives \nfor their university. According to the article, the company sponsored \nhundreds of events on military bases, including rock concerts, Super \nBowl parties, father-daughter dances, Easter egg hunts, chocolate \nfestivals, fashion shows, and even brunch with Santa.\n  University of Phoenix paid $250,000--a quarter of a million dollars--\nto sponsor events over the last 3 years at Fort Campbell, KY. Private \nsponsorship of military events is not unusual, but it has to raise some \neyebrows when the company whose profits depend on recruiting \nservicemembers are paying for these programs. Let's face it. That is \nwhat these events are for--recruitment events for the company.\n  In the name of corporate sponsorship, the University of Phoenix could \ngain direct access to military bases with a nod and a wink to \nservicemembers: Come to Phoenix. We care about the military.\n  Boy, has it paid off for Phoenix and what Mr. Murphy called ``the \njuice'' of Federal funds.\n  The University of Phoenix is the fourth largest recipient of \nDepartment of Defense tuition assistance funds which help \nservicemembers continue their education. In fiscal year 2014, the \nUniversity of Phoenix received more than $20 million of these benefits. \nBut hold on tight. Here is where the juice gets deep. When it comes to \nveterans' GI Bill funding, the University of Phoenix is a top recipient \nin America of these funds--$272 million. In return, the company offers \nservicemembers and veterans degrees of questionable value, below-\naverage graduation rates, and--get this--a student loan default rate \nalmost 40 percent higher than the national average. That is what we are \noffering to members of our military and veterans through the University \nof Phoenix and their programs.\n  I don't think this type of behavior by the University of Phoenix is \nwhat the President had in mind when he signed Executive Order 13607, \nintended to prevent for-profit colleges from gaining preferential \naccess to our military.\n  I have written to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter about the outrage. \nIf it is a matter of University of Phoenix not following DOD rules, I \nwant the Department to take action. If the University of Phoenix's \nactions outlined in this report are within the rules, the rules need to \nbe changed.\n  I want to say a word about another story by the Center for \nInvestigative Reporting last week. This is almost incredible. It is \ndifficult for me--I can't--to recount the details of the story I am \nabout to relate, and my colleagues will understand why in a moment.\n  According to the Center for Investigative Reporting, nearly 2,000 \nunaccredited institutions received more than $260 million in GI Bill \nbenefits between 2009 and 2014. Some of them are for profit; all are \ntotally unaccredited. When someone serves in our military, we offer \nthem GI Bill benefits--once-in-a-lifetime benefits--for the betterment \nof themselves and their family. Once they have used the benefits, they \nare gone.\n  One example of one of these unaccredited institutions that is \nreceiving these benefits for our military--GI Bill benefits--is a \nsexual therapy school in San Francisco. The name of it is the Institute \nFor Advanced Study of Human Sexuality--unaccredited. The activities \nthat are described in the article about this school I cannot say on the \nfloor of the Senate. The institute openly brags--this unaccredited \ninstitute receiving GI Bill benefits openly brags about its massive \ncollection of pornography, and we sent this institution GI Bill \nfunding. That is outrageous.\n  Seven other Senators joined me in writing to Secretary McDonald of \nthe VA last week asking him to investigate and explain. I also expect \nto speak with him by next week, and I hope to hear that the VA is \ntaking action. The GI Bill is too important for our veterans to have \nthese benefits ever questioned because of a scandal such as this.\n  Stories such as these abuses by the for-profit college industry and \nthese unaccredited so-called schools are appearing more frequently. In \nnewspapers and other media outlets across America, this issue has never \nreceived so much attention. Unfortunately, here in the Halls of \nCongress, you can still hear the crickets when it comes to this issue. \nI hope this changes. If we are serious about really caring about our \nmilitary and their families and our veterans, if we are serious about \ncaring about taxpayers' dollars, if we are honest about this industry \nthat is fleecing the American taxpayers and members of our military, \nthis Congress should act on a bipartisan basis. But some of these \nschools have friends in high places. Every time I have tried to call \nthem out, someone has stepped in to their defense, usually in a private \nmanner so the public doesn't know.\n  The day of reckoning is coming for these for-profit schools. The \nstock market is catching up with them. Stockholders are catching up \nwith them. Students and their families are catching up with the fact \nthat they are a waste of time and money. Now we have to make sure the \ntaxpayers have their day and their attention directed toward this \noutrageous exploitation.\n\n\n                     5th Anniversary of Dodd-Frank\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, July 21 marks the fifth anniversary of the \nenactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct.\n  Let's remember what was happening when the law was created. In 2008, \nwe were staring in the face of the greatest economic meltdown since the \nGreat Depression. Wall Street banks and financial companies had built a \nmulti-trillion dollar house of cards. They built it out of subprime and \npredatory mortgage lending, mortgage-backed securities with inflated \ncredit ratings,\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nand unregulated derivatives based on these mortgages. It was enormously \ncomplex and risky, and our financial regulatory system was ill-equipped \nto oversee it. It all started coming apart when several mortgage \nlenders went under, and Bear Stearns began wobbling.\n  Then in March 2008 Bear Stearns went down. By September 2008 one \ngiant financial company after another started collapsing: Lehman \nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG, Washington Mutual, Wachovia. It was a \ntime of panic. Credit markets froze. The stock market swung wildly. \nCongress had to take dramatic steps to stop the economy from going into \nfree fall. Who suffered the most from Wall Street's misbehavior? Main \nStreet Americans.\n  As a result of the financial crisis, unemployment went up over 10 \npercent. Nearly nine million Americans lost their jobs. Millions of \nfamilies faced foreclosure on their homes. More than $19 trillion in \nhousehold and retirement wealth was wiped away.\n  It was clear we had to act to get out of this ``great recession,'' \nand we did. We saved the auto industry, passed the Recovery Act to \nboost the economy, and stabilized the economy. We have now had 64 \nconsecutive months of job growth, and the unemployment rate is down to \n5.3 percent. But it was clear to all of us who lived through that \nfinancial crisis that we needed to reform our financial regulatory \nsystem and curb risky and predatory financial practices.\n  Five years ago, we did just that by enacting the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act. It took months of \nlegislating--dozens of hearings, extended debate and amendments in \ncommittees and on the floor, and a robust conference committee process. \nThe result was a landmark reform law that reined in the worst abuses of \nWall Street and provided critical new protections for consumers and \nMain Street businesses.\n  One of those was the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, or CFPB. I remember back in 2007 when a law professor named \nElizabeth Warren told me about all the tricks and traps that banks and \nmortgage companies were using on consumers. She said we need an agency \nthat is focused like a laser on making sure that there is transparency \nand fairness in consumer financial products. I agreed. So in 2008 I \nintroduced the first bill that sought to create this consumer financial \nprotection agency.\n  I could not have been prouder when this agency was established by the \nDodd-Frank Act. This was a landmark win not only for consumers but for \nour overall economy.\n  When consumers have transparent and accurate information about \nfinancial products, they are empowered to make better choices. Senator \nWarren did an admirable job of getting the CFPB up and running. And \nnow, under the leadership of Richard Cordray, the CFPB has achieved \ngreat success in protecting consumers, especially those most often \ntargeted by wrongdoers--students; older Americans; servicemembers, \nveterans and their families; and the economically disadvantaged. To \ndate, the CFPB has obtained over $10 billion in relief to consumers \nthrough its enforcement actions.\n  The CFPB went after several of the Nation's largest credit card \ncompanies for targeting their customers with deceptive and fraudulent \nactivities. This resulted in nearly $2 billion being paid back to more \nthan 12 million customers nationwide. To further protect students and \ntheir families, the CFPB has brought action against for-profit colleges \nfor their predatory lending practices.\n  In November 2013, the CFPB announced its first enforcement action in \nthe predatory payday lending industry. This led to $14 million in \nrestitution from Cash America for targeting servicemembers and their \nfamilies and violating the Military Lending Act in the process. Since \nthen, the CFPB has continued to limit the ability of payday lenders to \nprey on vulnerable families across America.\n  The CFPB is a tremendous success story. But the successes of Dodd-\nFrank don't stop there.\n  When the Dodd-Frank bill was on the Senate floor, I offered an \namendment that dealt with the issue of debit card swipe fees. This \namendment was adopted by the Senate with 64 votes--47 Democrats and 17 \nRepublicans--and it was enacted into law. My amendment marked the first \ntime that Congress acted to rein in excessive swipe fees, which were \nlining the pockets of big banks and costing billions for merchants and \ntheir consumers. I am pleased to report this reform has achieved \nsignificant success.\n  For those who don't remember, swipe fees are fees fixed by Visa and \nMasterCard, and are paid by merchants to card-issuing banks whenever a \npurchase is made with a card. Because Visa and MasterCard set the fees \non behalf of all banks, there is no competition between banks on the \nfee rates--so the rates always went up. By 2009, the banks were \ncollecting about $16 billion per year in debit swipe fees from \nmerchants. And merchants had to pass that cost on to their customers in \nthe form of higher prices. Of course, the banks didn't need all of this \nswipe fee money to conduct debit transactions. The actual cost to \nprocess a debit transaction is just a few cents. But the banks and card \ncompanies exploited the swipe fee system so they would receive far more \nthan they would ever need--an average of 44 cents per transaction.\n  It didn't have to be this way. Many other countries have thriving \ndebit card systems with swipe fees strictly regulated or prohibited \naltogether. But in the U.S., swipe fees were spinning out of control. \nThere were no market forces working to keep fees at a reasonable level. \nSo I offered my amendment to bring some reasonable regulation to this \nsystem.\n  My amendment said that if the Nation's biggest banks are going to let \nVisa and MasterCard fix swipe fee rates for them, then the rates must \nbe reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing a transaction. \nAnd my amendment also said there needs to be a real choice of card \nnetworks available for each debit transaction. This reform cut the \naverage debit swipe fee in half, from about 44 cents to about 24 cents.\n  This is actually pretty modest reform. Most other countries have gone \nmuch further in regulating swipe fees. But boy, did the big banks \nscream about it. They said swipe fee regulation would be the end of the \nworld. They claimed it would kill the debit card system, devastate \nsmall banks and credit unions, and cause banks to jack up other fees on \nconsumers. Well, the law took effect in 2011, so we have had some time \nto see how it has worked. And as it turns out, the horror stories that \nthe banks predicted turned out to be pure fiction.\n  Let us look at the facts. First, swipe fee reform hasn't hurt the \ngrowth of the debit system. Debit card use continues to grow each year, \naccording to the Federal Reserve. And it hasn't hurt small banks and \ncredit unions, either. My amendment exempted all but the biggest one \npercent of card-issuing banks from fee regulation. The Fed announced in \nMay 2013 that this small issuer exemption ``is working as intended.''\n  Credit unions and small banks have thrived since the amendment took \neffect, because the amendment has enabled them to receive higher fees \nthan their big bank competitors. It has helped level the playing field \nbetween the big banks and the little guys.\n  Don't take it from me. Here is what press releases from the Credit \nUnion National Association have said since my amendment took effect in \n2011:\n\n       November 2012: ``Credit Unions Growing at Sustained, \n     Increasingly Strong Pace.''\n       March 2013: ``The credit union movement is healthy, vibrant \n     and on the rise.''\n       Last February: ``Credit unions experience fast growth on \n     all fronts in 2014 . . . 2015 expected to surpass banner \n     year.''\n\n  I know the small banks and credit unions will never thank me for this \nreform. But the reality is they have gained a competitive advantage \nthrough this reform. It has helped them.\n  And how about consumers? Well, the banks said my amendment would \ncause consumer checking fees to go through the roof--and they still try \nto pretend that is the case. But the facts say otherwise.\n  Last September the Wall St. Journal reported that ``After peaking in \n2009, the annual account fees collected at U.S. commercial banks have \ndeclined markedly, even as the volume of bank deposits has swelled.'' \nTransparency\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\nand competition is helping keep fees down.\n  The American Bankers Association reported last year that 62 percent \nof Americans pay nothing at all for bank services. And this year \nBankrate.com found that 72 percent of credit union checking accounts \ncame with no maintenance fees.\n  And what about savings to consumers? Well, noted economist Robert \nShapiro did a study in 2013 and estimated that swipe fees overall were \nreduced by about $8.5 billion in 2012. He estimated that about $6 \nbillion of these reductions were passed along from merchants to \nconsumers in the form of lower prices.\n  While it may be hard to see those price reductions when you spread \nthe savings across the entire economy, the fact is that the savings are \nreal. Unfortunately, the savings should have been even greater. When \nthe Federal Reserve drafted a proposed rule for my amendment, they \nplanned for a fee cap of 7 to 12 cents--far closer to the actual cost \nof processing a debit transaction. But the banks lobbied the Fed hard \nto double the proposed cap, and the Fed gave in to the bank lobbyists. \nOf course, the banks and card companies promptly took advantage of the \nwatered-down regulation and turned the fee cap into a fee floor. As a \nresult, there are still excessive swipe fees begin charged in the debit \nsystem--not to mention credit card swipe fees, which have not been \nreformed at all.\n  There is no doubt that swipe fees continue to distort the incentives \nin our payments system. Banks and card companies continue to shape the \nsystem to maximize fees instead of efficiency and security. Just look \nat the issue of card security technology. The banks ignored this for \nyears--until my amendment made part of the debit swipe fee contingent \non having effective fraud prevention technology in place.\n  Just a few weeks after my amendment took effect in 2011, Visa finally \nannounced a roadmap to promote adoption of smart-chip cards in the \nUnited States. MasterCard soon followed. That is good news, but \nunfortunately the banks and card networks are still steering away from \nusing PINs on cards--even though the rest of the world uses a chip-and-\nPIN system and PINs mean lower fraud. Why avoid PINs? Because several \nother card companies compete with Visa and MasterCard on PIN \ntransactions, and the competition means the fees are lower. Further \nreform is needed to correct these skewed incentives.\n  We have more work to do to make sure our credit and debit card \nsystems are competitive, transparent and fair. I hope the Federal \nReserve and my colleagues in both parties will work with me in this \neffort.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to Dodd-Frank, Republicans in Congress \nhave spent the past 5 years trying to undermine this legislation. We \nmust not forget the lessons we learned from the financial crisis. We \ncan't go back to the system we had before Dodd-Frank. Instead let's \nwork together to protect what works, make constructive improvements, \nand expand Dodd-Frank's reforms where needed.\n  Remember, Wall Street used to get its way all the time around here, \nand they led us down a path that almost took our economy off a cliff. \nLet's not go back there. Let's promise the American people that never \nagain will Congress allow financial tricks and traps to bring our \neconomy to near-ruin.\n  I see one of my colleagues on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                              Troop Safety\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the dangers our troops face extend beyond \nwar zones and unfortunately to within our Nation's borders, and it is \ntime our policies reflect their risks no matter where they are \nstationed.\n  Just like the attack at the Little Rock Army recruiting station and \nthe tragedy at Fort Hood, the recent senseless shootings in Chattanooga \nhappened when our troops were unarmed, leaving them no way to defend \nthemselves.\n  I fully support the actions of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to do \nwhat is necessary to protect the Arkansas National Guard by allowing \nmembers to be armed at guard installations. However, the Governor only \nhas authority over the Arkansas National Guard. While Governors of \nother States have issued similar directives, I urge Secretary of \nDefense Ashton Carter and President Obama to order protective measures \nat Department of Defense installations.\n\n\nHonoring Marine Staff Sergeant David Wyatt and the other Servicemembers \n            Who Lost Their Lives in the Chattanooga Tragedy\n\n  Mr. President, the vicious attack in Chattanooga changed the lives of \nthe families of GySgt Thomas Sullivan, LCpl Squire Wells, Sgt Carson \nHolmquist, SSgt David Wyatt, and PO2 Randall Smith.\n  The attack hit especially close to home for Arkansas, where SSgt \nDavid Wyatt grew up. While he no longer called Arkansas home, the State \nalways had a fond place in Staff Sergeant Wyatt's heart. He often \nvisited his family who still live in the Natural State and taught his \nchildren how to call the hogs.\n  He was a 1998 graduate of Russellville High School. Staff Sergeant \nWyatt was active in athletics and played in the school band. He also \nearned the Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts. His \nScoutmasters, classmates, and teachers fondly recalled David as a young \nman who was a natural leader with a lot of enthusiasm and a unique \nsense of humor.\n  A career in the military was a natural fit for Staff Sergeant Wyatt, \nwho came from a long line of military service. He enlisted in the \nMarines following the events of 9/11. During his 11 years in the \nmilitary, Staff Sergeant Wyatt served in locations all over the world. \nHe was well aware of the dangers of wearing the Nation's uniform, \nhaving served deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. His mom, Deborah \nWyatt Boen, told the Russellville Courier that her son was proud to be \na U.S. marine and called his fellow marines ``brothers.''\n  No one could have predicted the violence that targeted his life while \nhe was working to protect and defend our Nation with his band of \nbrothers. But with the nature of the current threats we face and with \nincreased calls from groups such as ISIS to attack U.S. servicemembers \nat home, it is vital that we reevaluate our security practices for all \nour military installations and fix any vulnerabilities that put our \npersonnel at risk.\n  On Thursday, July 16, 2015, SSgt David Wyatt made the ultimate \nsacrifice for his selfless service to our Nation. SSgt David Wyatt is a \ntrue American hero.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep his wife Lorri, daughter Rebecca, son \nHeith, and the rest of his family and friends in their thoughts and \nprayers.\n  On behalf of our grateful Nation, I humbly offer my appreciation and \ngratitude for his selfless service and sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today the Senate has begun work on \nlegislation that would provide our States and communities across this \ngreat land the resources and reliability they need to soundly invest in \nour transportation infrastructure. After a full stumble start when our \nfriends across the aisle decided to block our ability to proceed, they \nreconsidered, thankfully, and I am glad to see them join us to move \nforward on this sensible, bipartisan bill.\n  To this Senator, the most important part of the bill is that it \ndoesn't kick the can down the road--at least not in the way we have \ndone more than 30 different times. We have had more than 30 short-term \ntransportation patches, which is a terrible way to do business, and \nfrankly it should be embarrassing to us that we haven't been able to \ncome up with a better solution.\n  While a 3-year transportation bill is no panacea, it represents \nprogress and avoids a lot of the unpredictability and wait-and-see \nproblems our States have had when it comes to planning longer term \nprojects. Fortunately, this multiyear bill restores some sanity by \nproviding resources over a consistent and dependable period of time. It \nis actually a 6-year bill. We have come up with a bipartisan group of \npay-fors to take us 3 years out, but then hopefully we will continue to \nwork on trying to find a way to pay for the last 3 years without adding \nto the deficit and debt, as has happened in the past.\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\n  This bill is really forward-looking, and this legislation provides \nthe foundation for more commerce, more efficient travel, and more \npublic safety by enhancing our transportation networks. In doing so, it \nprovides for a more stable economic climate for the next generation, as \nour States plan to meet the needs of a continually growing population.\n  I am thankful in Texas that with strong economic growth and a lot of \npeople moving there--voting with their feet, as I like to say--from \nother parts of the country, we know the value of good infrastructure. \nAnd when the highway fights in Washington, DC, froze to a standstill, \nTexas stepped up to the plate and refused to wait.\n  One example of that action that I mentioned earlier this week came \nlast fall when Texans voted last November to overwhelmingly approve a \nmeasure that would provide an additional $1.7 billion to upgrade and \nmaintain our vast transportation infrastructure. This came from a \nsurplus in our rainy day fund. That proposal was approved with more \nthan 80 percent of the vote, and in so doing, Texans clearly \nprioritized improved infrastructure and understood that by making our \nroads more efficient, we can decrease the 44 hours of car time that \nTexans spend stuck in traffic annually.\n  The vote also showed that Texans realized that our State is poised to \ngrow significantly. In fact, our economy, which grew 5.2 percent last \nyear compared to 2.2 percent nationwide--one reason our economy is \ngrowing is because people are coming to Texas to pursue their dreams. \nWe are going to need better roadways to absorb the estimated 18 million \nvehicles expected to be added to our roads by the year 2040. This bill \nwill help Texas manage the influx of people and vehicles so that we \nwill have the transportation infrastructure to support the millions of \nnew people who will call Texas home in the not too distant future.\n  Texas has long known that good transportation infrastructure is part \nof what has made us the economic powerhouse we are today. Take, for \nexample, the farm-to-market roads that opened more than 70 years ago, \nwith the idea that our farmers and ranchers needed a reliable \ntransportation network to get their livestock and crops to town. So \nbasically our farm-to-market roads gave our rural areas more access to \nthe towns and cities that purchased those goods. This helped Texas \nagriculture--a substantial part of our economy--and made it even more \ncompetitive by providing a reliable method to transport our grown and \nraised goods to market--first around the local community, then around \nthe State, and now around the country.\n  Of course, I was pleased, along with a lot of folks in the \nagriculture sector in Texas, that we passed trade promotion authority \nwith the promise of opening up even more markets around the world.\n  Many generations have benefited from the investments we made in \ninfrastructure to help them get efficiently from point A to point B.\n  Just as the farm-to-market roads provided a more reliable \ntransportation network throughout rural Texas, this legislation \nincludes vital resources that will upgrade rural routes and freight \ncorridors in addition to improving the overall safety and efficiency of \nnearly 20,000 miles of major roadways in Texas.\n  While it is not perfect, as the Presiding Officer knows, this bill \nrepresents some progress. I wish I could say we have solved our \ntransportation problems in perpetuity, but I don't think that is \npossible. But doing it for 3 years beats the dickens out of another \nshort-term patch, as I mentioned a moment ago, and kicking this can \ndown the road does nothing to support the next chapter of population \nand economic growth.\n  As we continue to discuss and review this legislation, I am going to \ncontinue to encourage our colleagues to consider just how much our \nentire country needs to strengthen the infrastructure projects that \nwill hopefully help that 2.2 percent growth which we experienced in \n2014 nationwide go upward and upward because that will create more jobs \nand more opportunity.\n  We have also seen that under new leadership, starting this last \nJanuary, we have been able to make incremental progress in a number of \nareas on a bipartisan basis. Frankly, given the response I heard from \nmany of my constituents last year when they complained to me about the \ndysfunction here in Washington, DC--even though, again, they are not \nnecessarily saying we have met the mark, they are seeing that we are \ntrying to work hard on a bipartisan basis to meet their needs, and I \nthink this bill represents that kind of progress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           VA Accountability\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate, I am proud to be joined by other members \nof the committee for a colloquy and a report to the American people on \nthe progress we are making to hold the VA accountable for our veterans \nand our taxpayers.\n  As all will remember, there was a terrible tragedy at the VA hospital \nin Phoenix last year. Because of missed appointments, erased records, \nconsults that were removed, veterans waiting for services never got \nthem, and in three cases they died. That was malfeasance in office and \nbrought a great scandal to the VA.\n  In January, when our committee took hold, we decided to go to the \nJustice Department and the inspector general and say: Go into the VA, \ninvestigate these incidents that took place, and if we find criminal \nwrongdoing or civil wrongdoing, we should prosecute these people to \nmake sure it doesn't happen again.\n  I am never happy when anybody is indicted, but I was satisfied that \nlast Friday the first indictment came down from the Justice Department \nagainst a VA hospital employee--unfortunately, in my State of Georgia \nat the VA hospital in Augusta--for 50 counts of falsifying medical \nrecords, the results of which ended up benefiting the employees and \nhurting veterans.\n  I promise the American people and Members of the Senate that this is \nnot going to be the last indictment. We are going to see to it that \npeople are held accountable for their actions and that they do what is \nright morally and what is right legally. We owe nothing less and we owe \nnothing more to our veterans than that type of treatment.\n  Yesterday the VA committee met, and we approved two great bills in \nour effort to bring about greater accountability. One of those bills \nwas the Rubio-Johnson bill, which allows the firing and holding of \naccountability of VA employees for malfeasance and misconduct in office \nfor cause.\n  As many people know, the VA oftentimes in disciplining people just \nmoved them to another job at the same pay because they can't move them \nout of the system. So the accountability never takes place, there is no \nsense of accountability, and veterans are not well served. Thanks to \nthe Rubio-Johnson bill, people who for cause are terminated will have a \nbrief hearing and a chance to justify their case, and if their case is \nnot justified, they will be removed from the Veterans' Administration \nhealth services agency and they will be fired. That is the type of \naccountability every American who is employed at their job has, and we \nthink that is the same accountability every employee ought to have at \nthe VA.\n  After that, we then passed the Cassidy-Ayotte bill, a bill that I was \nvery proud of because Senator Cassidy and Senator Ayotte said the \nfollowing: It is just not right for somebody who is not doing their job \nto get a bonus.\n  As many people know, bonuses were paid in the VA last year to \nemployees who were being reprimanded for misconduct and bad behavior. \nYou cannot take a benefit away retroactively, and this bill does not do \nthat, but it says to the VA prospectively that rewards and bonuses \ncannot be earned by those who are not conducting their job in the way \nthey should.\n  These are the types of accountability measures that people in the \nUnited States expect.\n  As chairman of the committee, I always want to brag about the good \nthings VA employees do, and they do a lot of good things. For every one \nscandal you hear about, there are hundreds of thousands of benefits \nveterans are receiving because of good, loyal employees. But the best \nemployees in the world are brought down a notch when\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nthose who are not good are allowed to continue to stay on the job even \nif they are not performing or get bonuses when they are not performing.\n  I am so proud of the Cassidy-Ayotte bill and Johnson-Rubio bill, \nwhich say to the American people that we are going to have \naccountability; we are going to pay bonuses for good behavior, not bad \nbehavior; and if somebody doesn't do their job, they will lose that job \nif that cause is justified. That is what the American people expect of \nthe Senate, that is what they expect of our committee, and I am proud \nto report to the Senate today that started.\n  I am also proud to yield to the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Cassidy, \na physician, a doctor who understands health services and who brought \none of these accountability issues to the committee yesterday.\n  Senator Cassidy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  This week, the VA committee passed out of committee S. 627, which \nestablishes guidelines for the Secretary to deny bonuses to employees \nwho have violated VA policy or law. It also ensures information on \nreprimands will be kept in the employee's permanent record. Our \nveterans deserve this bill.\n  When the VA scandal erupted in Phoenix last year, then-VA Secretary \nEric Shinseki rescinded the performance award given in 2013 to the \ncareer senior executive who ran this Phoenix VA health care hospital--a \nbonus that the Department said was awarded because of an administrative \nerror. The employee appealed and a Federal judge directed the VA to \nrepay the bonus despite the fact that the employee had improperly \naccepted more than $13,000 in gifts from a lobbyist and failed to \nreport them and manipulated data to conceal excessive wait times for \nveterans seeking health care.\n  The judge determined, however, that the VA did not have the authority \nto rescind her bonus. This is why many veterans do not trust the VA. \nHere is an administrator who, again, took $13,000 in gifts from a \nlobbyist, did not report them, manipulated data and, nonetheless, gets \na bonus. This is, by the way, while veterans were allegedly dying \nprematurely because of the care not given at this facility.\n  If we want to improve the VA system, we need to focus on the quality \nof the workforce. Workforce morale was seriously affected by those who \nabused their authority and nonetheless received bonuses or those who do \nnot have information on reprimands retained in their permanent record, \nmeaning it is that much harder to dismiss those employees who are not \ngood.\n  How does this incentivize honest workers to do a better job if we \nreward those who do not do good jobs? This is a commonsense solution \nthat the American people will view as a signal that Congress is serious \nabout improving veterans health care. In addition, S. 1082, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act, a bill introduced by \nSenators Rubio and Johnson, would give the VA Secretary more \nflexibility to remove corrupt or poor-performing employees, not just \ntop officials. The bill would expand the authority of the 2014 Veterans \nAccess, Choice, and Accountability Act to the entire workforce of the \nVA, which has made it easier to remove senior executives for \nwrongdoing.\n  This bill would also extend the probationary period for new VA \nemployees. A veteran once told me that his perception was that the VA \nsystem was run for the benefit of employees, not for the benefit of the \nveteran who is the patient. This is incredibly unfair to the dedicated \nVA employees. But on the other hand, giving bonuses to those such as \nthis Phoenix VA supervisor makes it understandable why he has this \nperception.\n  The legislation I have spoken of today helps restore accountability \nto the VA system so that all will know that the VA is run first, \nforemost, and always for the veterans seen there as patients.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague Senator Rounds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise today also to speak with regard to \nthe work of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. The Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee yesterday passed some very critical legislation. It \nis great to see the chairman and the ranking member and how they worked \ntogether side by side--Republican and Democratic colleagues working \ntogether to improve the lives of our veterans and truly to begin the \nprocess of reforming a broken VA system.\n  More than a year ago, the VA wait list scandal was made public. One \nof the biggest reasons the problem grew so large was the lack of \naccountability within the VA. Yesterday, with bipartisan support, we \nreported out five bills. Among those were two bills focused on bringing \naccountability to the VA. I would like to talk about that process and \nabout what I learned as a freshman Senator, stepping in and watching--\nafter listening to all of the stories about how the Senate was \ndysfunctional and things were not working right; Republicans would not \nwork with Democrats, and Democrats would not work with Republicans--how \nChairman Isakson and Ranking Member Blumenthal worked their way through \nthese bills and unanimously passed them out of committee.\n  I also watched as some members offered amendments. The chairman \nsuggested, strongly, that perhaps they should withdraw them because we \ndid not have what we call pay-fors with them, where there might have \nbeen an expense, or we did not have a report saying whether it would \nadd cost to a VA system that was also already short on funding in those \nparticular areas.\n  Rather than simply having votes and having acrimony, what those \nMembers said was this: Would you work with us to see that our goals \nwould be accomplished? I watched as our chairman, along with Ranking \nMember Blumenthal, work to get the job done to make things better for \nveterans. It was not acrimonious. It was a matter of members of this \ncommittee working side by side committing to help each other make the \nVA perform better than what they have in the past.\n  That is the type of work that we need in the Senate. It is what our \npeople want us to do. It is what veterans want to have happen. So I am \nhere to say this can be done and it can be done correctly. I will also \ntell you that in talking with members of that committee afterwards, \nthere was real interest. Republicans and Democrats side by side were \nsaying: Look, there were some good ideas offered in that committee, and \nthey would make good amendments to the bill, but we had to know what \nthe costs were. The commitment on both sides of the aisle was to find a \nway to work together. I commend the chairman, and I commend the ranking \nmember for their work and the way that they worked through some very \nserious issues.\n  The first one of those bills that I wanted to talk about was S. 1082, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act. It was \nintroduced by Senators Marco Rubio and Ron Johnson. Senator Johnson I \nam sure will be here to speak because he understands exactly from his \nconstituents what the need is to reform the system.\n  This bill would allow for the removal or the demotion of employees of \nthe VA based on performance or misconduct. It also gives the employee \nample time to appeal the removal or demotion. Finally, it extended the \nprobationary period for Senior Executive Service employees to make sure \nthe high-ups are doing their jobs correctly.\n  The second one is S. 627, the Ayotte-Cassidy accountability bill. You \nhave heard a little bit about it already. This bill would force VA \nemployees who purposefully manipulated wait lists for veterans' health \ncare to repay their bonus. It seems like only common sense--the kind of \ncommon sense we have in South Dakota and that we like to have. I know \nthe Presiding Officer's home State in Nebraska has that kind of common \nsense. It says: If you are doing something wrong, you should not get \npaid a bonus and be allowed to continue on.\n  This behavior of any VA employee should not be tolerated--let alone \nrewarded. I am happy to see that this passed the committee, and it \nsends a message to the other hard-working employees of the VA \nadministration that their hard work is not going to be tainted by \nindividuals who are not doing their job correctly. Let me just share \nthis. I just have to share this\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\nstory. Some things you think you would not see, and yet, in South \nDakota, I have a good friend who is 83 years old. He is a veteran.\n  All he wanted to do was to get a new set of glasses. He has diabetes. \nHe wanted to get it through the VA. He had gone to his own optometrist \nbecause in our part we don't have contracts yet in the central part of \nSouth Dakota through the VA for optometrists. So he had gone in and had \nseparately paid for the work of the optometrist. The optometrist had \nwritten a prescription.\n  This veteran only wanted the VA to take care of the cost of the \nglasses. They expected him to travel over 150 miles to get to a VA \nfacility to go get glasses. We sure don't want him driving. Yet that \nwas the expectation--to come up.\n  Look, this is the kind of stuff that makes people irritated with the \nsystem that should be helping veterans. Our office got involved with \nit. In fact, I offered to go on out and meet with the VA in Sturgis, \nSD, to find out what the problem was and why they would not deliver \nthis. My staff suggested that I should simply stop by if they could not \ntake care of the problem.\n  The VA indicated at that point they would get it taken care of. But \nlater they came back and suggested: Well, you know, we don't know why \nthis guy should get new glasses more than every 2 years. That is \nbecause their contract would not allow for it. That is not the type of \nattitude we want among VA officials. That is not the way we should be \ntreating our veterans.\n  This is the reason that we want accountability within the VA system. \nWe found Republicans and Democrat side by side saying: We are going to \nfix it. Now, we have a long way to go. We have a man at the head of the \nVA right now that truly wants to fix it. He walked into the middle of a \nswamp, and he is up to his butt in alligators. But he is there to fix a \nproblem. We want to do everything we can to give him the tools to get \nthe job done right.\n  Hopefully, next week we will start with fixing a budget problem they \nhave by simply allowing them the flexibility to take the resources that \nare already there within the Department and move them into locations \nwhere they are more appropriate. That is what this is all about--using \na little bit of common sense in Washington, DC, to fix a problem for \nveterans that has gone on way too long.\n  Today I wish to say thank you to our veterans, to those men and women \nthat wear the uniform of the United States of America. We cannot say \nenough about what they have done for the rest of us here. But we can \ncontinue to tell them thank you time and again and to send a message \nthat we are not going to allow them to go without the services that \nthey are entitled to, the services that we want to render to them in an \nappropriate fashion, and that we will work until we get it done and get \nit done correctly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise also to join my colleagues in \nsupport of a couple of bills that are supporting the finest among us. I \ncertainly want to underscore the thanks that the Senator from South \nDakota expressed to the men and women of our military, people to whom \nwe owe a huge debt of gratitude for defending this Nation and fighting \nfor our freedoms.\n  I also really want to thank the good Senator from Georgia, the \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, for in a very expeditious \nfashion taking up some very good pieces of legislation that will hold \naccountable those individuals who are caring for the finest among us in \nour veterans health care centers.\n  But before I address those bills, let me make a couple of points \nabout the vast majority of men and women who are working in those VA \nhealth care centers. They are dedicated individuals, and they are doing \na great job providing health care to the men and women of our Armed \nForces. Upon becoming a Senator for Wisconsin, I started visiting the \nVA medical facilities within our State and also in Minneapolis, a \ncenter that also serves veterans from Wisconsin.\n  What I found did not surprise me at all. I found those dedicated \nindividuals, and they are providing excellent health care. The veterans \nI spoke to in the halls and throughout the State were very satisfied \nwith the health care they were getting. They were more than satisfied. \nThey heaped praise upon their care providers.\n  The wait times were pretty long. The parking lots were pretty full. \nBut again, they underscored certainly what I saw--that the vast \nmajority of those men and women--the nurses, the doctors, the \nadministrators--in our VA health care facilities are really dedicated \nto the task, and they are doing a great job for our veterans. But the \nfact of the matter is that they are not all doing a good job. It is not \na perfect system--not by a long shot. I give the press corps a great \ndeal of credit for breaking stories, first in Arizona, where we saw \nthose long wait times actually resulting in the deaths of some \nveterans.\n  Then, in early January, I first became aware, because of a news \nreport, of a real problem in the Tomah, WI, VA health care facility. I \nthink maybe the best way to approach this is to provide a timeline that \nI provided in a field hearing that we held. It was a joint field \nhearing between my committee, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs, and the Veterans' Affairs Committee in the \nHouse raising the issue in the community.\n  It was an excellent hearing. It afforded the surviving family members \nof some of the veterans who had died in the care of the Tomah VA center \nthe ability to tell their stories, to make an impression, and to get \nthe attention of the administrators of the VA to start correcting the \nproblems. But in my opening statement, I laid out a timeline that I \nwould like to repeat here.\n  In April of 2003, Dr. David Houlihan was disciplined by the Iowa \nBoard of Medicine for having an inappropriate relationship with a \npsychiatric patient. According to the executive director of the Iowa \nBoard of Medicine, the sanctions should have been a serious concern for \nfuture employers.\n  That was April of 2003. In 2004, Dr. Houlihan was hired as a \npsychiatrist by the Tomah VA Medical Center. In August of 2005, Dr. \nHoulihan became chief of staff of the Tomah Medical Center. In November \n2007, Kraig Ferrington, a veteran who sought treatment for medication \nmanagement, died from a lethal mixture of drugs. Autopsy results showed \nMr. Ferrington had seven drugs in his system. In April 2009, it was \nknown and documented by employees of Tomah VA that many patients had \ncalled him the Candy Man and that veterans were ``prescribed large \nquantities of narcotics.'' Again, that was April of 2009.\n\n  In June of 2009, Dr. Noelle Johnson was fired from Tomah for refusing \nto fill prescriptions she believed to be unsafe. Dr. Johnson had raised \nconcerns to her superiors, had sought guidance from the Iowa medical \nlicensing board, and later spoke with the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration about Dr. Houlihan.\n  In July of 2009, Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was fired from Tomah. Dr. \nKirkpatrick had raised concerns to his union about overmedication at \nTomah. Tragically, later that day, on the day of his termination, Dr. \nKirkpatrick committed suicide.\n  In August of 2011, the VA Office of Inspector General received an \nanonymous complaint about overprescription and retaliation by Dr. \nHoulihan at Tomah.\n  In March of 2012, a second anonymous complaint was filed with the IG \nagainst Dr. Houlihan. The OIG examined 32 separate examinations during \nhis 2\\1/2\\-year-long inspection.\n  In March of last year, 2014, the Office of Inspector General finished \nits inspection of Tomah and administratively closed the case without \nmaking it public.\n  On August 30 of 2014, Jason Simcakoski died in the Tomah mental \nhealth wing as a result of a mixed drug toxicity. Simcakoski was a \npatient of Dr. Houlihan. His autopsy revealed he had over a dozen \ndifferent medications in his system.\n  In September 2014, Ryan Honl began lodging whistleblower complaints \nabout patient safety and quality of care at Tomah.\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\n  On January 8, 2015, the Center for Investigative Reporting published \nan article detailing overprescription and retaliation at Tomah. The \narticle revealed that veterans and employees referred to the Tomah VA \nMedical Center as ``Candy Land.''\n  On January 12, 2015, Candace Delis brought her father, Thomas Baer, \nto the Tomah VA Medical Center with stroke-like symptoms. Mr. Baer \nwaited over 2 hours for attention. That day the facility's CT scanner \nwas down for ``routine preventive maintenance.'' Mr. Baer passed away 2 \ndays later.\n  On February 26, 2015, the Office of Inspector General finally posted \nits Tomah health care inspection report on its Web site.\n  I called Candace Delis, the daughter of Thomas Baer, shortly after I \nheard of the tragic death of her father. I will never forget what she \ntold me. She said: Ron, had I known the problems at the Tomah VA \nMedical Center, I never would have taken my father to the facility, and \nmy father would be alive today.\n  I believe that to be a true statement. Accountability is something \nthat is crucial in any organization. I ran a manufacturing plant for 31 \nyears. I can't tell you how corrosive it is to an organization if \nindividuals within that organization are not doing their job, not \npulling their full weight, undermining the shared goals of the \norganization. It is corrosive.\n  I was surprised when I offered a piece of legislation and the \nchairman of the VA committee allowed me to present that piece of \nlegislation to the committee, the Ensuring Veterans Safety Through \nAccountability Act, and the VA representatives at that hearing were \nopposed to holding medical professionals accountable.\n  Fortunately, the chairman, the Senator from Georgia, agreed with me \nthat the only way we are going to reform this system, the only way we \ncan make sure we honor promises through our VA health centers to the \nfinest among us--the men and women of the military--is by holding \nindividuals accountable, which is exactly how the bill was reported \nout, sponsored by the Senator from Florida.\n  I truly thank him for his leadership on this issue, and I am pleased \nto join him as the lead sponsor of that bill. The Department of \nVeterans Affairs Accountability Act of 2015 will hold every employee \nwithin the VA accountable. That is crucial.\n  Again, I thank our veterans, I thank the Senator from Florida, the \nSenator from Georgia, and I urge my colleagues to support this piece of \nlegislation. Let's get it passed. Let's start holding those few bad \napples--and I truly believe that. I think it is just a few people who \nneed to be held accountable.\n  A little postscript to my timeline, and I think one of the reasons \nthis piece of legislation is so important is even with that record \ndating back to 2004--and by the way, our own committee's investigation \nshows there are employees of the Tomah VA who were referring to the \nTomah VA back then as ``Candy Land.'' It is crucial we hold those \npeople accountable. But to date, nobody--after multiple deaths caused \nby the overprescription of opiates, after the death of Thomas Baer, a \nveteran who basically died of neglect--has been held accountable by \nbeing fired, by being terminated.\n  Again, there is not, from my perspective, any joy in terminating an \nemployee, but for the good of the organization or to honor the promise \nof the finest among us, that type of accountability is absolutely \nnecessary.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the west coast port \nslowdown and comments that were made by the administration as they \nrelate to that slowdown, along with legislation I have introduced \ncalled the PORTS Act, legislation I hope to pursue during the \ntransportation debate we are going to commence with over the next \nseveral days and also as it relates to that west coast port slowdown, \nthe economic impact that slowdown had on our economy.\n  On June 30 of last year, the labor contract that covered nearly \n20,000 workers at 29 west coast ports expired. Port management and the \nILWU began negotiations a year before, but in September of 2014 those \ntalks ground to a standstill. Instead of remaining at the table and \ntrying to find a solution and negotiating in good faith, both parties \ndecided to begin jockeying for leverage.\n  The longshoremen purposefully slowed down their work and drastically \ndecreased productivity while still taking home a full day's pay. In the \nreal world, employees can't show up at work and not do their work or \nslow it down dramatically, not have the productivity they are expected \nto, and still get everything they want, but in the back worlds of labor \nunion politics at the ports, that is business as usual. And business \nhas been good at the ports.\n  According to employer data, a full-time longshoreman earns about \n$130,000 a year, full-time employment $130,000 a year, while foremen \nearn about $210,000. That is a pretty good paycheck, and the contract \nraises these wages even higher.\n  Workers pay nothing for health coverage that includes no premiums and \n$1 prescriptions. Providing this health care costs employers about \n$35,000 per employee per year. They are also eligible for a maximum \npension of over $80,000 per year upon retirement, so $130,000 salary \nfor a longshoreman, $210,000 if you are a foreman, $35,000 for health \nbenefits, and $80,000 per year worth of pension upon retirement.\n\n  But what happened for the rest of us this past year when the slowdown \noccurred on the 29 west coast ports, the effect of the slowdowns \nweren't just limited to the port owners. When the longshoremen decided \nto slow down their work, the goods flowing through these ports backed \nup and international trade ground to a halt.\n  This has had devastating economic impacts in States far beyond the \nwest coast and around the Nation as a whole. Nine excruciating months \nafter the labor contract expired, the parties finally reached a deal \nbut not before costing U.S. businesses and consumers billions upon \nbillions of dollars and ruining the credibility of our exporters \nabroad.\n  When it comes to the administration, though, the response was pretty \nalarming as well. Labor Secretary Perez was just asked about this \neconomic disaster of the west coast ports slowdown when visiting the \nports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. His response: ``The collective \nbargaining process worked.''\n  As a result of the west coast port slowdown, the administration's \nresponse was: ``The collective bargaining process worked.''\n  The Labor Secretary made these comments while visiting Los Angeles, \nLong Beach, the two busiest ports of the country. So let's take a look \nat what the collective bargaining process did at those ports. This is a \nship finder map of Los Angeles and Long Beach showing ships anchored \noffshore this week. This is recent data. These are ships that are \nanchored off the shore of Los Angeles and Long Beach just this past \nweek. This is what it looks like when the ports are operating and \nfunctioning normally.\n  You will notice there is a lot of blue ocean and not many ships \nanchored offshore. Ships can quickly unload imported products and load \nAmerican-made exports for distribution around the world. There is no \nbackup, no congestion, and no disruption to our country's economy.\n  But this is what Los Angeles and Long Beach--the ports of Los Angeles \nand Long Beach--looked like during the slowdown during the crisis. \nDozens upon dozens of ships anchored and idled waiting for ships in \nport to be unloaded.\n  You can see all the ships that are backed up compared to the previous \nchart. The Journal of Commerce reported that there were 32 ships \nanchored off the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach at one point \nduring the slowdown. There has been a lot of discussion recently about \nthe need for a long-term surface transportation bill that invests in \n21st century infrastructure, but just take a look at the kind of \ndysfunction antiquated labor laws can cause.\n  This is an aerial shot. You can see this is off the wing of an \nairplane where you can see all of the ships that are backed up waiting \nat these ports to be unloaded, ships that carry the goods for our \neconomy, the goods that make our economy run. Congestion like this is a \nnightmare for American farmers, businesses, and consumers.\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\n  Farm exporters were charged exorbitant fees for warehouse space to \nstore their agricultural goods as they rotted and spoiled. Meat and \npoultry companies alone faced port charges in excess of $30 million per \nweek. So if people were earning $130,000 a year and not doing their \nwork unloading ships, American farmers, poultry, and meat producers \nwere charged $30 million per week. Businesses further up the supply \nchain were also affected.\n  One large U.S. base manufacturer has calculated the cost of lost \nsales, warehouse space, additional inventory, and transportation at \n$100 million in total as a result of the delays at the west coast \nports. Those are just the direct costs.\n  American businesses also lost credibility and future customers as the \nforeign buyers turned to other nations for more stable supplies.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the west coast port \ndelays forced layoffs and downsizing in the U.S. leather \nindustry. Chinese tanners are now turning to European and Brazilian \nproducers to fill their orders. This is a $3 billion industry that had \nto lay off workers because of the dispute of the west coast ports.\n\n  Apparently, the administration again thinks the process worked just \nas it was supposed to work. Efficient trade through U.S. ports is \ncritical to maintaining and growing economic opportunity in States \nacross this country. According to the American Association of Port \nAuthorities, U.S. ports support 23 million jobs, and the value of \nrelated economic activity accounts for 26 percent of our national GDP. \nTwenty-six percent of our national GDP comes from our ports system. \nContract negotiations related to labor disputes at our ports clog up \nthese vital arteries and cause problems throughout our national supply \nchain.\n  If you need further proof of whether this impacted our economy--that \npicture we just saw of all the ships stacked up at L.A. and the ports \nin California--according to Federal Reserve economists, the disruptions \non the west coast were great enough to affect the entire economic \noutput of the country.\n  This chart shows the quarterly change in national GDP. Once \nnegotiations stalled, you will notice GDP growth started to decline. So \nhere we are in the third quarter of 2014. Remember, we started talking \nabout September of 2014, when the slowdowns really started. By the time \nwe get to the last quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, you \ncan see the labor dispute contributing to the decline of our national \nGDP. Our economy shrank as a result of port slowdown.\n  In the first quarter of this year, when the slowdowns were in full \nswing, the economy actually shrank by 0.2 percent. You can see it, in \nthe third quarter--this is the last quarter--to the first quarter of \nthis year. Twenty-six percent of our GDP depends on these ports.\n  The Fed economists also found that disruptions disproportionately \naffected exporters sending American-made goods abroad for sale \noverseas. Exporters didn't have access to imported raw materials and \nparts they needed to build their products. This caused supply chains to \nback up and eventually reduced output and employment.\n  So the Fed is telling us that the collective bargaining process at \nthe ports measurably reduced economic growth and American jobs across \nthe country by crippling American businesses, but only in the backward \nworlds of labor union politics could this economic disaster be \nconsidered everything is working just fine. Only in a union-dominated \nindustry could this catastrophe be considered a success.\n  That is why I have introduced the PORTS Act. Our legislation would \ndiscourage disruptions at U.S. ports and incentivize speedy resolution \nof disputes by strengthening and expanding the well-known Taft-Hartley \nprocess.\n  Over 100 national agricultural, manufacturing, and retail \norganizations support the PORTS Act because they are fed up with the \nstatus quo. They disagree with the administration, which thinks \nshrinking our economy is everything working just fine.\n  There are some who oppose the PORTS Act, and those are the labor \nunions. In fact, earlier this month, the AFL-CIO put out a statement \nsaying legislation like the PORTS Act was not needed. You can see what \nhas happened without the PORTS Act is economic decline, people being \nlaid off, farmers losing millions of dollars, products rotting in \nwarehouses because of the backups.\n  In just 5 years--5 years from now--the labor contracts on both the \neast coast and the west coast will expire. Imagine what would happen if \nwe had labor disputes occurring on the west coast and the east coast at \nthe same time, people who were willing to threaten that 26 percent of \nour national GDP over a dispute, while the administration says \neverything is working just fine. It is critical we have the necessary \ntools in place to prevent another debilitating crisis.\n  If we learned anything from this past dispute, it is that Labor \nSecretary Perez is wrong--the current process does not work. And the \nAFL-CIO is wrong--legislation like the PORTS Act is desperately needed.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation. Let us not pinch our economy in an economic vice \nfrom the east and the west. Let's find economic opportunity to grow our \nNation together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nregular order would have produced a vote on the motion to proceed at 2 \na.m. tonight. For the information of all Senators, that vote will \nactually occur at 9 a.m. tomorrow. So there will be no further votes \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Senator Murkowski and I released a \nbipartisan energy bill. We hope to mark up that bill next week, but \ncritical to that Energy bill is the modernization of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  Forty years ago, we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \nprevent economic distress caused by oil disruption. People remember \nexactly what happened with the Arab oil embargo in 1973. The law that \ncreated the SPRO--the Energy Policy Conservation Act--was enacted in \n1975 specifically to help protect the U.S. economy from energy \ndisruptions.\n  The core policy reason for having the reserve really hasn't changed, \nnor should it. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an important asset to \nour energy security. We need it as much today as we did then. Perhaps \neven more so now that we have so much volatility.\n  Clearly, we have seen dramatic changes in our energy policy \nlandscape. Instead of importing a lot of oil, we have become a bigger \nproducer in the United States, and our oil infrastructure and refining \ncapacity has reduced our ability to make sure SPR is available in case \nof an emergency.\n  In fact, the Department of Energy did a test sale in 2014 and \nidentified a series of challenges associated with the way the SPR \ndistribution works today. That is why I think it is so important. These \nvery supplies that make us more secure in one respect are also \nstressing our national infrastructure and may actually lessen our \nability to respond in an emergency. That is why it is so important to \nmodernize the SPRO, to use the resources we have there, to make sure we \nmake investments.\n  Some may have seen the Quadrennial Energy Review recently produced \nand released. Its key findings--I am now reading from the report--show \nthat multiple factors affect U.S. energy security. These include U.S. \noil demand, the level of oil imports, the adequacy of emergency \nresponse systems, fuel inventory levels, fuel substitution capacity, \nenergy system resilience, and the flexibility, transparency, and \ncompetitiveness of the global energy marketplace.\n  The report goes on to say the United States is the world's largest \nproducer of petroleum and natural gas. Combined with new clean energy \ntechnologies and improved fuel efficiency, U.S. energy security is \nstronger than it has been in over half a century.\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\n  But the report goes on to say: Nonetheless, challenges remain in \nmaximizing that energy security benefits of our resources in a way that \nenhances our competitiveness and minimizes our environmental impacts of \ntheir use. The network of the oil distribution has changed \nsignificantly.\n  So the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's ability to offset future energy \nsupply disruption has been adversely affected by global domestic and \nglobal market development, and so there is a need for an upgrade.\n  I think people can all agree it needs an upgrade. So that is why we \nraise a question about a transportation bill on the floor that takes \nmoney out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve not to upgrade that energy \nsecurity need but to put it into highways, which will do nothing to \nsecure us if there is an energy supply disruption.\n  The report goes on to say the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve to protect the U.S. economy from severe economic harm in the \nevent of a supply emergency associated with spikes has been diminished. \nIt has been diminished.\n  Changes in U.S. energy production are stressing and transforming the \nway energy commodities are transported in the United States. Some of \nthese commodities, the report goes on to say, such as coal and ethanol \nhave traditionally relied on rail and barge transport to move these \nproducts. These transportation modes, such as rail, barge, and truck \ntransport, are also shared by agriculture and other major commodities \nand are being joined by significant growth in the use of transport of \noil and refined petroleum products.\n\n  So it creates a limited infrastructure capacity among these \ncommodities. The report goes on to say that those costs are being \nincreased in shipping and then being passed on to the consumer. So \nliterally, by taking money out of the SPR and not investing it in the \nmodernization of our energy infrastructure and security--we are taking \nmoney and building highways--we are making it more expensive for \nconsumers to get products and to secure our economy.\n  The Department of Agriculture has indicated that disruptions to \nagricultural shipments--that is, agricultural products that can't get \non the rails because we have so much oil, natural gas, coal, and all \nthese other things or just sand for drilling--are basically causing a \ndisruption so big that it is bigger than the disruption to agriculture \ncaused by Katrina.\n  So we have supply. But the economic challenge of having other \nproducts displaced or having the cost to consumers go up is what is \nthreatening us. Even the ability to maintain adequate coal stockpiles \nat some electric powerplants has been affected by rail congestion. That \ncomes directly from the report. Why is that so important? Because all \nthese energy commodities are important to us. These agricultural \ncommodities are important for us.\n  The quadrennial review calls for an update to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. The Department of Energy should make infrastructure \ninvestments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and its distribution \nsystems to optimize the SPR's ability to protect the U.S. economy in an \nenergy emergency. That is right from the report. The report calls for \ncreating a multimodal freight program to make sure we improve \ninvestment in freight and to make sure there is Federal action on \nshared transportation infrastructure that makes sure we can move our \nenergy products.\n  It says we have to work on our waterways as well because the \nwaterways are critical to moving our energy products around.\n  The report goes on to say that the Federal facility that consists of \na network of 62 salt caverns at four geographically dispersed storage \nsites need upgrading. A lot of this is happening in the south of our \ncountry, in Louisiana and Texas. We need to make sure our economy does \nnot see another disruption or price spike without our ability to update \nthe SPR and actually get the product out.\n  The report called on DOE to make a $2 billion investment to increase \nthe incremental distribution of SPR by adding a dedicated marine \nloading-dock capacity at a gulf coast terminus--my guess, again, is \nprobably in Texas or Louisiana--and that Congress should update the SPR \nto be more effective in preventing serious economic hardships to the \nU.S. energy supply and making sure we optimize our capacity for \ninfrastructure distribution. The report also calls for an additional \n$2.5 billion over 10 years to make sure we are making these connectors.\n  So not only are we required to do this as a country--to make sure \nthat our country is safe and secure and that we take advantage of the \nproduct we have--but we are also a member of the International Energy \nProgram. As to members, they make sure every country is doing what they \nshould to make sure there is an increase in supply and that we can \nwithstand anything--a world event, a natural disaster, a hurricane or \ncritical infrastructure destruction by some cyber event or by an actual \nattack. So the SPR is like a rainy day fund, an account that makes that \ninfrastructure work.\n  There are two things in particular we should consider when we are \nthinking about the drawdown of this product that is not specifically \ntied to an emergency.\n  First, we should make sure this investment is an upgrade to the SPR's \ninfrastructure and for its emergency capabilities. That is, if we are \ngoing to take money out, it should go to infrastructure in responding \nto emergencies and not just to the highway bill for highways. We need \nto make sure the SPR's critical systems and equipment, which are \nnearing their life-end operational capacity--that in fact there is the \n$2 billion that is needed to repair that. I am not even sure you can \nsell money out of the SPR now onto the marketplace because all of the \napparatuses and the functioning capabilities for it don't work \ncorrectly now. I know we want to mark up a transportation bill that has \nthis money in here, but we may not even be able to collect on it. Let's \nmake sure we do our repairs.\n\n  Secondly, let's make sure the receipts from the SPR sale should be \nused to improve the critical urgency and energy infrastructure \ninvestments that we need.\n  Now, some of my colleagues talk about how expensive this oil was when \nwe bought it and now what we are selling it for. I could say taxpayers \nare definitely not getting their fair share. But one way to make sure \nthey get their fair share on this investment is to make sure it is \ninvested in the energy security infrastructure that our Nation needs. \nNow would not be the time to damage our Nation's emergency preparedness \nby giving this money away in a transportation deal that is only about \nhighways.\n  I hope, my colleagues, if we are really serious about this effort, if \nwe are going to sell SPR at any price and affect the American \ntaxpayers, that we will follow the recommendations of the Department of \nEnergy's Quadrennial Energy Review that found that many different areas \nof our energy infrastructure need investing. We could make investments \nin resiliency, reliability, and security, and focusing on hardening our \ninfrastructure, particularly our transportation systems, which are \ngoing to be critical for how we move this product around in the future, \nand, also so that we have port connectors, which are challenged by the \nmovement of critical freight in critical freight corridors.\n  We want our country to continue to be self-reliant and to have the \ngreat products we are exporting through our ports, but they too need \nthe infrastructure investment. Multiple commodities are competing, and \nthey can't even get on the tracks or through our port corridors without \nmaking further investment.\n  I believe the Secretary of Energy needs the flexibility to manage the \nSPR and the SPR assets. I believe, if the Secretary of Energy or the \nPresident of the United States thought it was such a great idea to sell \nmoney out of the SPR for highways only, we would hear them saying so. \nWe don't.\n  I think we need to provide the Secretary with the dependability to \nmake these decisions about our energy security and make the right \ninvestments for our future. I hope we can get this right before this \nbill is done here in the Senate. Otherwise, we will not be doing \nourselves any favor when it comes to energy or energy security.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, July 26, 2015, marks the 25th anniversary \nof the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I would like \nto take a moment to discuss the importance of this landmark legislation \nand to highlight the strides we have made in making our communities \nmore inclusive.\n  It is estimated that nearly one in five Americans have a disability. \nUpon its passage, the ADA was hailed as the world's first comprehensive \ndeclaration of equality for people with disabilities. It established a \nclear national mandate that we as a nation have a moral responsibility \nto ensure that all Americans have access to the programs and the \nsupport needed to contribute to society, live with dignity, and achieve \na high quality of life. Over the past 25 years, the ADA has expanded \nopportunities for Americans with disabilities by reducing barriers and \nchanging perceptions and increasing full participation in all areas of \npublic life, including the workforce, education, and transportation. \nBecause of this legislation, we have made tremendous progress in \neliminating barriers to everyday life for Americans living with \ndisabilities.\n  Unfortunately, even after 25 years, we still live in a world where \npeople with disabilities have fewer work opportunities and higher rates \nof unemployment than people without disabilities. We still have more \nwork to do to ensure that the basic civil rights of persons with \ndisabilities are fully protected and respected, but the ADA was an \nimportant step forward in achieving these goals.\n  Through passage of the ADA, we have made more progress on this issue \nthan anyone ever dreamed of 25 years ago. We should be proud of these \nefforts to make our communities more inclusive, and we should honor \nthis important anniversary by continuing our efforts to ensure that no \nperson with a disability experiences prejudice, discrimination, or \nbarriers to living full and productive lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5513-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING TROY ELAM\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Samuel \nShapiro & Company, a Baltimore-based customs broker and freight \nforwarder, on the occasion of the firm's 100th anniversary. Founded by \nSamuel Shapiro in 1915, Shapiro & Co. has since become one of our \ncountry's leaders in domestic and international shipping, with \nlocations across the eastern seaboard.\n  From navigating the intricacies of international cargo management to \nproviding client consultation on import and export compliance, Shapiro \n& Co. has distinguished itself as a center of innovation, extensive \nbusiness acumen, and creativity. Strong family and community ties lie \nat the real heart of the company, which has been family-owned since its \nfounding.\n  Samuel Shapiro, a son of Russian immigrants, founded Samuel Shapiro & \nCompany at age 20 just as our Nation was beginning to emerge onto the \nglobal stage, economically, politically, and socially. Our European \nallies were in the midst of war, driving the need for American-made \ngoods ever higher. Designated by the U.S. Government as the Port of \nBaltimore's distribution broker for grain exports, Shapiro & Co., \nthough small, began to build a reputation for effectiveness and \nreliability among European businesses during the postwar reconstruction \nperiod. Throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Shapiro & Co. continued \nto expand, helping to cement the city of Baltimore as one of the \nNation's premier commercial ports.\n  In the 1950s, Shapiro & Co., driven by the strong leadership of \nSamuel and his son Sigmund, emerged as an influential force in lobbying \nfor the establishment of the Maryland Port Authority in 1956 and in \nadvocating for the growth of the port, supporting the construction of \nthe Dundalk Marine Terminal in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Shapiro \n& Co. continued to serve as an economic force through some of \nBaltimore's most difficult times, throughout the eras of upheaval and \nrelocation in the 1960s and 1970s.\n  After a lifetime of devotion to the city of Baltimore, Samuel Shapiro \npassed away at the age of 92 in the mid-1980s. Today, the company is \nheaded by president and CEO Marjorie Shapiro, Samuel's granddaughter. \nShapiro, as the company is known today, has evolved from a one-room \noffice with a $5 roll-top desk to a well-respected and highly regarded \nindustry leader and Baltimore institution. The Port of Baltimore is \nmore vibrant than ever, due in part to the stewardship of Shapiro & Co. \nIn 2014, the Port brought in 29.5 million tons of foreign exports at a \nvalue of $52.5 billion. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating \nthe legacy of this outstanding company, which embodies the values that \nwe honor most as Americans: hard work, a commitment to family, and \ntireless dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5513-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5513-S5514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LESLEY ROBINSON\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, small businesses are often able to \nprovide specialized customer service in their industries, with the \nability to attract talented employees who are motivated to work hard \nand focus on innovation. This week, I am proud to recognize Six C \nFabrication of Winnfield, LA, as Small Business of the Week.\n  Robin Cummings founded Six C Fabrication in 1990 as a small shop in \nWinnfield, LA, with the name originating from the ``C'' of the family \nname and ``six'' counting for the members of the Cummings family, \nincluding Robin, his wife, and their four children. Robin's intent with \nSix C Fabrication was to provide Louisiana with the best available and \nmost efficient service for fabrication. The Louisiana-based business \nwas originally focused on lumber, but later expanded to other \ndivisions--leading to exponential growth in revenue and employees. \nToday, Six C has 425 employees between its headquarters in North \nLouisiana and two facilities in Ohio. Cummings and his team now \nspecialize in fabrication of compressor stations, power piping, process \npiping, petrochemical operations, pressure valves, and pulp and paper \nindustries, in addition to their original lumber services. \nAdditionally, Six C Fabrication offers a full range of welding services \nusing state of the art equipment--all aimed at meeting the spectrum of \ntheir customers' needs.\n  In recent years, the company has made tremendous strides toward \nsuccess, from once having a gross income of $300,000 to now averaging a \ngross income of $46 million. Six C's central location provides optimal \ntransportation options, resulting in timely turn-around and an \nadditional extension of their unrivaled customer service. Six C has \nreceived numerous awards and recognitions, including the 2008 Business \nof the Year for Winnfield, LA, Louisiana Workers' Compensation \nCorporation 70 Safest Companies of 2010 award, and 2011 Kisatchie-Delta \nEntrepreneur of the Year, among others.\n  Congratulations again to Six C Fabrication for being selected as \nSmall Business of the Week. We appreciate and recognize your success \nand contribution to Louisiana's manufacturing industry and local \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5516-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5516-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5516-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1734.

and\n       Whereas, the designation of Ohio's Central State University \n     as an 1890 land-grant institution in the 2014 Farm Bill set a \n     very recent precedent for the addition of a university to the \n     land-grant system; and\n       Whereas, the nation's system of land-grant institutions \n     would be strengthened by the inclusion of Grambling State \n     University; and\n       Whereas, as a historically black university with a strong \n     record of academics, research, and service, Grambling, with \n     its rich history and traditions, would bring a unique \n     perspective to the land-grant system; and\n       Whereas, for one hundred twenty-five years, the 1890 land-\n     grant institutions have played a vital role in ensuring \n     access to higher education and opportunity for underserved \n     communities, and as such an institution, Grambling would have \n     access to increased resources that it could direct to serving \n     such communities and to providing research, extension, and \n     public services in North Louisiana, an area where these \n     services are not currently being provided sufficiently; and\n       Whereas, such designation would be consistent with \n     Grambling's agricultural origins and its mission and history \n     of service to African American students and the people of \n     Louisiana and would strengthen Grambling's\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\n     research and teaching in science, technology, engineering, \n     and mathematics (STEM) programs and enhance existing programs \n     and facilitate the development of new programs in \n     agricultural business, biotechnology, economics, environment \n     and natural resources, family and consumer science, and \n     engineering technology; and\n       Whereas, Grambling State University has made the same \n     extraordinary contributions to the education of African \n     Americans in the state of Louisiana as other 1890 land-grant \n     universities have made in their respective states; and\n       Whereas, as the only Historically Black College or \n     University (HBCU) in the University of Louisiana System, the \n     role that Grambling plays in the state is critical; and\n       Whereas, a land-grant designation would enhance greatly \n     Grambling's service to the people of Louisiana, and it is \n     appropriate that Congress take all necessary measures to \n     grant such designation to Grambling State University: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United \n     States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to \n     designate Grambling State University as a United States \n     Department of Agriculture 1890 land-grant institution; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California memorializing the President of the \n     United States and the United States Congress to recognize the \n     unique military value of California's defense installations \n     and the disproportionate sacrifices California has endured in \n     previous base realignment and closure (BRAC) rounds; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, The federal Department of Defense conducted base \n     realignment and closure (BRAC) rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, \n     1995, and 2005. The previous BRAC rounds resulted in the \n     closure of 25 major bases in California and the realignment \n     of eight other facilities; and\n       Whereas, A sixth BRAC round for 2017 has been proposed in \n     the fiscal year 2016 federal budget; and\n       Whereas, California has been the state hardest hit by the \n     Department of Defense's previous BRAC rounds. In the first \n     four BRAC rounds, for example, the state absorbed 25 percent \n     of the total base closures nationally and 11 percent of the \n     base realignments; and\n       Whereas, California absorbed 54 percent of personnel cuts \n     in the first four BRAC rounds, losing more federal military \n     jobs from the closure of its military bases than the combined \n     losses in all other states. Additionally, 300,000 private \n     sector defense industry jobs in California were eliminated as \n     a result of those base closures; and\n       Whereas, These base closures had a severe impact on local \n     governments and communities, some of which continue to \n     struggle with the transition and reuse of these closed bases; \n     and\n       Whereas, There are currently more than 30 major federal \n     military installations and commands remaining in California \n     that could be closed or realigned as a result of another BRAC \n     process; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Defense and the defense industry \n     represent a major industry in California today, totaling more \n     than $71 billion in direct spending and employing more than \n     350,000 Californians. Total effects on the economy far exceed \n     these numbers; and\n       Whereas, For over half of a century, California's workers, \n     businesses, industries, and universities have contributed to \n     our national security, utilizing their talents, capital, and \n     skills to develop and manufacture new technologies, aircraft, \n     satellites, missiles, and advanced weapons systems; and\n       Whereas, Military installations provide the foundation for \n     United States defense efforts. Maintaining these \n     installations is, therefore, critical to supporting America's \n     national security. California is vital to the mission and \n     might of our United States military. Our seaports and \n     airports, bases and equipment, research labs and testing \n     grounds support the finest fighting force in the world; and\n       Whereas, As our nation faces new security threats in the \n     21st century, California remains ready to confront these \n     dangers. In space, cyberspace, over land, at sea, and in the \n     air, California is helping the military meet the challenges \n     of today and tomorrow. From troop deployment to systems \n     development and cybersecurity, training to logistics, the \n     future of our military is here in California; and\n       Whereas, Having been the leader in the nation's defense \n     effort, California state government must lead by articulating \n     the national security imperative of maintaining military \n     installations within its borders; and\n       Whereas, In an effort to be proactive in retaining military \n     facilities within California that are essential to national \n     security, and to provide for a single, focused strategy to \n     defend these installations, in March 2013 Governor Edmund G. \n     Brown Jr. established the Governor's Military Council, in an \n     effort to protect and expand the military's vital role in \n     national security and California's economy. The council has \n     met regularly throughout the state since its creation, and is \n     continuing to work to protect California's military \n     installations and operations and to assist in recruiting new \n     defense missions and operations to the state: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That California's military installations \n     possess critical military value and that California is ready \n     to help the Department of Defense meet its goals now and in \n     the future; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     respectfully memorializes the President and the Congress of \n     the United States, to not only recognize the unique military \n     value of California's defense installations, but also \n     continue to take into consideration all of the following:\n       (a) California's unparalleled land, air, and sea ranges \n     that provide the ability to train all types of forces, year \n     round, in every type of warfare effectively, efficiently, and \n     economically.\n       (b) California's strategic location in the Pacific Theater \n     is a critical factor in executing the National Defense \n     Strategy strategic shift to the Pacific region by allowing \n     for rapid deployment to trouble spots in Asia.\n       (c) California's ability to recruit and train highly \n     skilled and educated personnel.\n       (d) The existing synergies between military installations \n     and the private sector.\n       (e) The economic impact on existing communities in the \n     vicinity of military installations.\n       (f) Our incomparable quality of life, which enhances \n     personnel retention.\n       (g) The vast intellectual capital that has been developed \n     in California since World War II.\n       (h) The disproportionate sacrifices California has endured \n     in previous BRAC rounds; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the author for \n     appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to enact legislation to \n     establish guarantees by the federal government to support the \n     responsible sale of postearthquake bonds by financially sound \n     residential-earthquake-insurance programs operated by any of \n     the several states on an actuarially sound basis; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, Over the last 30 years, California has experienced \n     1,451 earthquakes of magnitude 4.0 or greater, ranging from \n     16 to 168 per year; and\n       Whereas, Most Californians live within 20 miles of a major \n     earthquake fault capable of producing damaging earthquakes; \n     and\n       Whereas, On the morning of August 24, 2014, many residents \n     of Napa discovered they lived closer to such a fault than \n     they believed. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck American \n     Canyon, south of Napa, at 3:20 a.m., leading to one death and \n     many injuries. The earthquake seriously damaged nearly 100 \n     homes, as well as many historic downtown buildings. It cost \n     local wineries millions of dollars in spilled wine and \n     damaged equipment, and numerous people were injured. The \n     overall damage and effects of the earthquake demonstrated how \n     even a moderate-sized earthquake can have a large impact on a \n     community; and\n       Whereas, In June 2014, the Los Angeles Times reported that \n     the first five months of the year were marked by five \n     earthquakes larger than magnitude 4.0, after what had been a \n     relatively quiet period of seismic activity for the Los \n     Angeles area. That number of earthquakes at that magnitude \n     had not occurred in a year since 1994, the year of the \n     Northridge earthquake; and\n       Whereas, Faced with the certainty of its peril from \n     earthquakes, over the last three decades California has \n     repeatedly shown that smart public policy choices can help \n     Californians prepare for a catastrophic earthquake. Milestone \n     innovations across this era include the following:\n       (a) In the year following the 1983 Coalinga earthquake, \n     California passed the Earthquake Insurance Act, requiring \n     residential property insurers to offer homeowners earthquake \n     coverage, to ensure homeowners considered the possibility of \n     protecting their home from earthquake damage.\n       (b) In the year after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, \n     California began examining how a state-based financial pool \n     might be constructed to improve protection for homeowners. \n     This effort, the California Residential Earthquake Recovery \n     Fund (CRERF), was intended to cover the cost of earthquake \n     insurance deductibles. While this plan was repealed in 1992 \n     as potentially actuarially unsound, it pointed the way to \n     further innovations.\n       (c) Since 1996, the multipart funding mechanism of the \n     California Earthquake Authority (CEA), a public \n     instrumentality of the State of California, has succeeded as \n     the primary source of earthquake insurance for California \n     homeowners seeking to protect their homes from earthquakes; \n     and\n       Whereas, Despite the growing successes of the CEA since its \n     1996 formation, how it can\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n     be improved has become clear. Almost every news story about \n     California earthquake insurance and the CEA notes that \n     residential earthquake insurance is costly for homeowners and \n     the deductibles are high. The high cost and high deductibles \n     are seen as a key factor behind why only 12 percent of \n     Californians who buy homeowners' insurance also buy \n     earthquake insurance; and\n       Whereas, There is no better way to prepare California for \n     the inevitability of disastrous earthquakes than to make \n     earthquake insurance work better for its residents. The \n     limitations of the existing system are well-known. Now is the \n     time for the next key step in policy innovation to make the \n     state's earthquake insurance system work better for renters \n     and homeowners; and\n       Whereas, As the CEA approaches two decades of operation, it \n     has become clear that the CEA has pushed the envelope on how \n     a single state-based pool can materially assist in \n     catastrophe readiness. But by law, the CEA's rates must be \n     actuarially sound and based on the best available scientific \n     information for assessing earthquake frequency, severity, and \n     loss; these sensible conditions also temper the CEA's ability \n     to cut the cost of earthquake insurance; and\n       Whereas, As a public instrumentality of the state, the CEA \n     must cover all its risks, including the possibility that at \n     any time, a truly catastrophic earthquake might hit the \n     state; and\n       Whereas, The CEA's need, as a stand-alone, risk-bearing \n     public instrumentality of the state, to always have a plan to \n     cover the chance of a catastrophic earthquake is what, under \n     the current system, keeps the price of earthquake insurance \n     high. For the level of total exposure the policies represent, \n     the rates yield sufficient premiums to pay for a backstop of \n     reinsurance sufficient to offset expected CEA losses in all \n     but the most catastrophic earthquake; and\n       Whereas, A federal policy of certain access to federal debt \n     guarantees for postevent financing would strengthen the risk-\n     bearing capacity of actuarially sound state-based disaster \n     programs like the CEA and reduce the preevent expense of \n     providing that insurance. In recent sessions of the United \n     States Congress, a proposed federal partnership limited to \n     prequalified, actuarially sound state earthquake insurance \n     programs has been estimated to expose the federal government \n     to a 10-year cost of only $25 million; and\n       Whereas, A state and federal partnership to enhance the \n     ability of prequalified, actuarially sound state earthquake \n     funds to access postdisaster borrowing would enable \n     California and other states using actuarially sound programs \n     to manage risk with a dramatically better tool; and\n       Whereas, The CEA's certain access to a federal guarantee of \n     its postearthquake borrowing would ensure access to the \n     private capital markets at reasonable rates, enhancing the \n     claims-paying capacity for a catastrophic earthquake. That \n     lower-cost capacity, in turn, would permit the CEA to adjust \n     its annual purchase of earthquake reinsurance and lower \n     expenses, thus speeding long-term capital accumulation to \n     help CEA modulate its cost of providing basic earthquake \n     insurance across the state: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to enact legislation to \n     establish guarantees by the federal government to support the \n     responsible sale of postearthquake bonds by financially sound \n     residential-earthquake-insurance programs operated by any of \n     the several states on an actuarially sound basis; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from the State of California \n     in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-55. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the United States Congress to \n     support legislation reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, The Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im \n     Bank) is the official export credit agency of the United \n     States and exists for the purposes of financing and insuring \n     foreign purchases of United States goods; and\n       Whereas, The mission of the Ex-Im Bank is to create and \n     sustain United States jobs by financing sales of United \n     States exports to international buyers; and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im Bank is the principal government agency \n     responsible for aiding the export of American goods and \n     services, and thereby creating and sustaining United States \n     jobs, through a variety of loan, guarantee, and insurance \n     programs for small and large businesses; and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im Bank has supported more than $400 \n     billion in United States exports in the past 70 years and \n     helps to cover critical trade finance gaps by providing loan \n     guaranties, export credit insurance, and direct loans for \n     United States exports in developing markets where commercial \n     bank financing is unavailable or insufficient. For fiscal \n     year 2014, the Ex-Im Bank provided $20.5 billion in loan \n     guarantees which leveraged $27.5 billion in exports while \n     supporting 164,000 United States jobs. Since fiscal year \n     2009, the bank has supported more than 1.3 million American \n     jobs in all 50 states; and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im Bank is a self-sustaining agency, which \n     operates at no cost to the taxpayer and over the last three \n     fiscal years has generated more than $3 billion in fees from \n     its foreign customers which were deposited in the United \n     States Treasury to reduce the United States deficit and \n     indebtedness; and\n       Whereas, The Ex-Im Bank enables United States companies \n     large and small to turn export opportunities into sales that \n     help to create and maintain jobs in the United States that \n     contribute to a stronger national economy. On average nearly \n     90 percent of the Ex-Im Bank's transactions support United \n     States small businesses; and\n       Whereas, Exports are particularly important to the \n     California economy as California is currently ranked second \n     in exports among all states. If California's manufacturing \n     base is to grow, we must continue to expand our ability to \n     export goods from California facilities. Given the key role \n     the Ex-Im Bank plays in facilitating export sales, failure to \n     reauthorize it would be devastating to existing industry and \n     to those that we hope to create in the future; and\n       Whereas, Over the past five years, the Ex-Im Bank has \n     assisted more than 67 California companies to export their \n     products. Nearly 200 of those companies are owned by women or \n     minorities and over 700 are small businesses. These companies \n     export their products and services around the globe totaling \n     more than $21 billion in sales. Fifty-two of the 53 \n     congressional districts in California had companies benefit \n     from the Ex-Im Bank loans; and\n       Whereas, A reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank is critical to \n     the ability of many United States exporters to compete on a \n     level playing field in a commercial market where current and \n     future competitors continue to enjoy aggressive support from \n     their countries' export credit agencies; and\n       Whereas, A failure to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank would \n     amount to unilateral disarmament in the face of other \n     nations' aggressive trade finance programs that favor their \n     domestic companies over American companies; and\n       Whereas, Economic growth depends on increasing exports from \n     both small and large manufacturers and service providers in \n     California and reauthorization means support for California \n     exports and California jobs; and\n       Whereas, in the 114th United States Congress, 1st Session, \n     legislation is pending that would continue the Ex-Im Bank's \n     capacity for creating jobs while also making its practices \n     more accountable and transparent, as well as making the bank \n     more solvent and self-sufficient: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges Congress to \n     support Export-Import Bank of the United States; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-56. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Government to \n     immediately dispose of the public lands within Arizona's \n     borders directly to the State of Arizona; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2005\n\n       Whereas, at the time of Arizona's Enabling Act, the course \n     and practice of the United States Congress with all prior \n     states admitted to the Union had been to fully dispose, \n     within a reasonable time, of all lands within the boundaries \n     of such states, except for those Indian lands, or lands \n     otherwise expressly reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, the State of Arizona did not contemplate, and \n     could not have contemplated, the United States failing or \n     refusing to dispose of all lands within its defined \n     boundaries within a reasonable time such that the State of \n     Arizona and its permanent fund for its public schools could \n     never realize the anticipated benefit of the deployment, \n     taxation and economic benefit of all the lands within its \n     defined boundaries; and\n       Whereas, Arizona's Enabling Act contemplates that Arizona's \n     temporary suspension of its sovereign right to tax the public \n     lands within its borders for the benefit of its public \n     schools and the common good of the state ends the very moment \n     that the national government discharges of its trust \n     obligation to immediately dispose of Arizona's public lands \n     within its borders; and\n       Whereas, under Article I, section 8, clause 17 of the \n     United States Constitution, the national government is \n     constitutionally authorized to exercise right, title and \n     jurisdiction only over lands that are ``purchased by the \n     Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same \n     shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, \n     dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings''; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress never purchased land \n     designated as national parks nor did it ever seek or obtain \n     the consent of the Arizona Legislature as required under \n     Article I, section 8, clause 17 of the United States \n     Constitution; and\n       Whereas, because of the failure of the national government \n     to immediately dispose of\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\n     land within the borders of Arizona, this state bears the \n     burden of the inestimable entanglements and expectations over \n     the multiple use of these public lands that were required to \n     be disposed of that have accumulated for more than one \n     hundred years; and\n       Whereas, Arizona should have had total control over its \n     public lands from 1912, plus a reasonable time for \n     disposition of the lands; and\n       Whereas, Arizona has been substantially damaged in its \n     ability to provide funding for education because the national \n     government has unduly retained control of much of the land \n     lying within Arizona's borders; and\n       Whereas, had the national government sold the land in or \n     about 1912, much of the net proceeds should have been applied \n     to paying down the national public debt, and some should have \n     gone to the state of Arizona's permanent fund for the support \n     of the public schools; and\n       Whereas, Arizona consistently ranks high among all states \n     in class size and low in per pupil funding for education; and\n       Whereas, had the national government disposed of the land \n     in or about 1912, Arizona would have generated, from that \n     point forward, substantial tax revenues to the benefit of its \n     public schools and to the common good of the state; and\n       Whereas, the national government gives Arizona less than \n     half of the proceeds of mineral lease revenues and severance \n     taxes generated from the lands within this state's borders; \n     and\n       Whereas, Arizona has been substantially damaged in mineral \n     lease revenues and severance taxes in that, had the national \n     government disposed of land in or about 1912, Arizona would \n     realize 100% of the mineral lease revenues and severance \n     taxes from the lands; and\n       Whereas, Arizona has been damaged by the inordinate cost \n     and substantial uncertainty regarding the national \n     government's infringement on Arizona's sovereign control of \n     public lands within its borders; and\n       Whereas, County of Shoshone v.

Holder, \n     which clarified that ``the fundamental principle of equal \n     sovereignty remains highly pertinent in assessing [post-\n     admission] disparate treatment of states'' and People for the \n     Ethical Treatment of Property Owners v. United States Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, which confirmed the federal \n     government's abuse of the Commerce Clause authority, all lend \n     support to the notion that the public lands within Arizona's \n     borders should be transferred to Arizona: and\n       Whereas, because of the breach of Arizona's Enabling Act, \n     and the damages resulting from it, the United States Congress \n     should immediately dispose of the public lands lying within \n     the State of Arizona directly to the State of Arizona; and\n       Whereas, the national government has an obligation to \n     present and future generations to pay the public debt, yet it \n     has demonstrated a reckless disregard for the growing \n     national debt even as it continues to worsen at an \n     exponential rate.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States government immediately and not \n     later than December 31, 2019 dispose of the public lands \n     within Arizona's borders directly to the State of Arizona.\n       2. That the United States Congress engage in good faith \n     communication, cooperation, coordination and consultation \n     with the State of Arizona regarding the immediate disposal of \n     the public lands directly to this state.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Secretary of the United States \n     Department of the Interior, the Chief of the United States \n     Forest Service, the Chairperson of the United States House \n     Committee on Natural Resources, the Chairperson of the United \n     States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and \n     each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-57. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     vote to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1006\n\n       Whereas, the United States relies, and will continue to \n     rely for many years, on gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for \n     sources of energy; and\n       Whereas. in order to fuel our economy, the United States \n     will need more oil and natural gas in addition to alternative \n     energy sources; and\n       Whereas, the United States currently depends on foreign \n     imports for more than half of its petroleum usage and is the \n     largest consumer of petroleum in the world; and\n       Whereas, United States dependence on overseas oil has \n     created difficult geopolitical relationships with potentially \n     damaging consequences for our national security; and\n       Whereas, oil deposits in the Bakken Reserves of Montana, \n     North Dakota and South Dakota are an increasingly important \n     crude oil resource; and\n       Whereas, there is not enough pipeline capacity to deliver \n     crude oil supplies from Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, \n     Oklahoma and Texas to American refineries; and\n       Whereas, Canadian oil reserves total 174 billion barrels, \n     of which 169 billion barrels can be recovered from the oil \n     sands using today's technology; and\n       Whereas, Canada is the single largest supplier of crude oil \n     to the United States at 3.05 million barrels per day and has \n     the capacity to significantly increase that rate; and\n       Whereas, the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline ties \n     into the existing Keystone pipeline that already runs to \n     Canada, bringing up to 700,000 barrels of oil a day to \n     refineries in Texas. At peak capacity, the pipeline will \n     deliver 830,000 barrels of oil per day; and\n       Whereas, according to the United States State Department's \n     fifth Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement \n     (Final SEIS), which was issued on January 31, 2014, the \n     Keystone XL pipeline will be the safest pipeline ever \n     constructed on American soil, will have minimal impact on the \n     environment, will create thousands of much-needed jobs and \n     bolster the United States' energy security; and\n       Whereas, according to the Final SEIS, the Keystone XL \n     pipeline will support approximately 42,100 direct, indirect \n     and induced jobs and result in approximately $2 billion in \n     earnings throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Final SEIS predicts that the Keystone XL \n     pipeline will contribute approximately $3.4 billion to the \n     United States gross domestic product and provide a \n     substantial increase in tax revenues for local counties along \n     the pipeline route, with 17 to 27 counties expected to see \n     tax revenues increase by 10% or more; and\n       Whereas, the Oklahoma-Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline \n     system, also referred to as the Gulf Coast segment, went into \n     service in late January 2014; and\n       Whereas, according to a recent economic analysis report \n     conducted by noted economist Bud Weinstein at Southern \n     Methodist University Cox School of Business, the Gulf Coast \n     segment injected $2.14 billion into the Oklahoma economy and \n     more than $3.6 billion into the Texas economy; and\n       Whereas, a recent study by the United States Department of \n     Energy found that increasing delivery of crude oil from \n     Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Alberta, as well as \n     Texas and Oklahoma, to American refineries has the potential \n     to substantially reduce our country's dependency on sources \n     outside of North America: and\n       Whereas, Canada sends more than 99% of its oil exports to \n     the United States, the bulk of which goes to Midwestern \n     refineries: and\n       Whereas, oil companies are investing huge sums to expand \n     and upgrade refineries in the Midwest and elsewhere to make \n     gasoline and other refined products from Canadian oil derived \n     from oil sands, and the expansion and upgrade projects will \n     create many new construction jobs over the next five years; \n     and\n       Whereas, 90% of the money used to buy Canadian oil will \n     likely later be spent directly on United States goods and \n     services; and\n       Whereas, since 2011, nearly 30 public opinion polls have \n     repeatedly confirmed that building the Keystone XL pipeline \n     is in the best interest of the vast majority of Americans: \n     and\n       Whereas, supporting the continued shift towards reliable \n     and secure sources of North American oil is of vital interest \n     to the United States and the State of Arizona.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Congress vote to approve the \n     Keystone XL oil pipeline.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-58. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     oppose the designation of the Grand Canyon Watershed National \n     Monument in northern Arizona; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1001\n\n       Whereas, Arizonans value the Grand Canyon as a national and \n     world treasure and as an economic engine; and\n       Whereas, there is no threat to the Grand Canyon National \n     Park and its surrounding lands; and\n       Whereas, existing laws and regulations, including the \n     National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act, the Archaeological Resources Protection \n     Act and many others, ensure the protection and responsible \n     use of the Grand Canyon National Park and its surrounding \n     lands; and\n       Whereas, as of 2012, Arizona had the third highest total \n     designated wilderness acreage in the United States with 4.5 \n     million acres. Additionally, another 5.8 million acres were \n     affected by special land use designations, including national \n     monuments; and\n       Whereas, only three members of the eleven-member Arizona \n     congressional delegation and others have requested that the \n     President of the United States use his authority under the \n     Antiquities Act to designate an estimated 1.7 million acres \n     in northern Arizona as the Grand Canyon Watershed National \n     Monument; and\n       Whereas, this proposed designation would almost double the \n     amount of acreage designated as national monuments in Arizona\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\n     and would be the nation's second largest national monument \n     after the neighboring Grand Staircase-Escalante National \n     Monument in southern Utah, which is over 1.8 million acres; \n     and\n       Whereas, the federal government granted lands at statehood \n     to the State of Arizona to be held in trust to provide a \n     source of income for schools and other beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, the proposed monument designation would severely \n     impact thousands of acres of state trust lands locked up \n     within its boundaries and deny their beneficial use to the \n     trust; and\n       Whereas, this taking of state trust lands within the \n     proposed national monument without just compensation would be \n     a breach of the sacred trust between the State of Arizona and \n     the federal government that was agreed on in this state's \n     enabling act and harms Arizona's school children; and\n       Whereas, withdrawal of this vast amount of lands from \n     multiple-use management eliminates or restricts reasonable \n     and thoughtful use of these natural resources for multiple \n     purposes, such as recreation, grazing, mining, energy \n     development and forestry; and\n       Whereas, multiple-use management of these lands by the \n     United States Bureau of Land Management and the United States \n     Forest Service is based on resource management plans that \n     were developed with public input and have framed the use of \n     these lands since the passage of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act in 1976; and\n       Whereas, responsible use of natural resources provides a \n     substantial economic benefit to northern Arizona and there is \n     no reason to eliminate this benefit for a nonexistent threat; \n     and\n       Whereas, the conservation of wildlife resources across \n     Arizona is the trust responsibility of the Arizona Game and \n     Fish Commission; and\n       Whereas, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission voted to \n     oppose the proposed Grand Canyon Watershed National Monument \n     on May 11, 2012 and its analysis found that monument \n     designation can lead to restrictions on proactive wildlife \n     management, including hunting and fishing access; and\n       Whereas, national monument designation requires a very \n     narrow management regime and could severely restrict forest \n     management activities, such as scientifically established \n     fire management, erosion control and invasive species \n     treatments; and\n       Whereas, in addition, Arizona's proper management of state \n     forest lands, which includes selective logging, has made for \n     a healthy and prolific environment for naturally occurring \n     habitat and has proven effective in preventing habitat loss, \n     as has occurred on federally managed forest lands, through \n     wildfire; and\n       Whereas, consideration of the effects on the customs, \n     cultures and economic well-being of our local communities as \n     well as important historic and cultural aspects of our local \n     heritage; and\n       Whereas, the cost benefit of this proposal must be \n     considered; and\n       Whereas, while a minority caucus of three of the eleven-\n     member Arizona congressional delegation and a small, yet \n     vocal, group of others advocate to transfer state resources \n     to the federal government, the State of Arizona desires to \n     uphold the congressional designation of the multiple-use \n     policy as per the Federal Land Management Policy Act as being \n     best for our citizens and Arizona's economy.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the President of the United States does not \n     designate the Grand Canyon Watershed National Monument in \n     northern Arizona.\n       2. That the United States Congress oppose the designation \n     of the Grand Canyon Watershed National Monument in northern \n     Arizona.\n       3. That any new monuments, including the proposed Grand \n     Canyon Watershed National Monument, have express state and \n     congressional approval before they are so designated by the \n     President.\n       4. That the Governor and the Attorney General of the State \n     of Arizona take appropriate actions to implement this \n     Memorial.\n       5.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     pass H.R. 594; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1004\n\n       Whereas, on April 21, 2014, the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency and the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers published a proposed rule in the Federal Register \n     that defines ``Waters of the United States'' under the Clean \n     Water Act; and\n       Whereas, the final rule is projected to be published in the \n     Federal Register by August 31, 2015; and\n       Whereas, the rule purports to clarify issues raised in two \n     United States Supreme Court decisions, Solid Waste Agency of \n     Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and \n     Rapanos v. United States, that created uncertainty over the \n     Clean Water Act's scope and application; and\n       Whereas, the rule will expand the scope of the Clean Water \n     Act, resulting in greater impacts to this state, as well as \n     on local governments, their citizens and their businesses; \n     and\n       Whereas, the rule will subject almost all physical areas \n     with a connection, or a ``significant nexus,'' to downstream \n     navigable waters, including features such as ditches, natural \n     or manmade ponds and floodplains, to the jurisdiction of the \n     Clean Water Act; and\n       Whereas, the rule will apply to all programs under the \n     Clean Water Act; and\n       Whereas, the rule change will cause significant harm to \n     local farmers, stall the development of businesses and strip \n     local providers of their control of land use for sustainable \n     food production; and\n       Whereas, the cost to our municipalities and taxpayers will \n     be enormous; and\n       Whereas, the rule is contrary to the ruling of the United \n     States Supreme Court in Rapanos as it appears to rely heavily \n     on the minority opinion's concept of ``significant nexus,'' \n     which was rejected by the Court's prevailing opinion; and\n       Whereas, the term ``significant nexus'' does not appear in \n     the Clean Water Act: and\n       Whereas, under the rule, groundwater may be used in making \n     determinations of a ``significant nexus,'' which is an \n     overreach of the federal agencies as groundwater systems are \n     under the jurisdiction of the states and should not be \n     broadly used in justifying a determination of jurisdictional \n     water of the United States; and\n       Whereas, in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, the \n     United States Supreme Court stated that the use of ``case by \n     case'' determinations should be the exception, not the rule, \n     and the rule allows for broad use of case by case \n     determinations, which inserts needless uncertainty into the \n     development process; and\n       Whereas, the rule grants the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency and the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers authorities not specifically granted to them by the \n     Clean Water Act; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rule, should it become effective, \n     will hamper beneficial development, increase costs of \n     infrastructure construction and maintenance and result in an \n     unacceptable level of uncertainty in the permitting process; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States was meant to \n     reserve to the states exclusive jurisdiction over their \n     respective nonnavigable, intrastate waters and waterways \n     within their boundaries except as expressly delegated to the \n     federal government by the Constitution or prohibited by it to \n     the states. and the federal government's power to regulate \n     navigable waters cannot constitutionally reach nonnavigable, \n     intrastate waters and waterways that have no significant \n     connection to navigable waters; and\n       Whereas, it is impractical for the federal government to \n     regulate every ditch, pond and rain puddle that may have some \n     tenuous connection, miles away, to a body of water that is \n     currently defined as ``navigable.''\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency to refrain from reducing the ozone \n     concentration standard; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1014\n\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) is proposing to reduce the national ambient air quality \n     standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 65 to 70 \n     parts per billion, while taking comment on a level as low as \n     60 parts per billion; and\n       Whereas, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review the \n     ozone concentration standard every five years, and the EPA \n     last updated this standard in 2008, setting it at 75 parts \n     per billion; and\n       Whereas, if the EPA reduced the standard to 70 parts per \n     billion, nine out of 11 counties monitored for ozone levels \n     in Arizona would be out of compliance; and\n       Whereas, if the EPA reduced the standard to 65 parts per \n     billion, all 11 counties monitored for ozone levels in \n     Arizona would be out of compliance, and the four rural \n     counties that are not currently monitored might also be out \n     of compliance; and\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\n       Whereas, a revised ozone standard of 65 to 70 parts per \n     billion would result in widespread nonattainment designations \n     in areas of the nation that already meet the current ozone \n     standards; and\n       Whereas, based on 2011 through 2013 monitoring data, the \n     EPA reports that 358 counties in the nation would violate a \n     standard of 70 parts per billion and that an additional 200 \n     counties would violate a standard of 65 parts per billion; \n     and\n       Whereas, nonattainment area designations would limit \n     economic and job growth by restricting new and expanded \n     industrial and manufacturing facilities, imposing emission \n     ``offset'' requirements on new sources of nitrogen oxides and \n     volatile organic compounds emissions, constraining oil and \n     gas extraction and raising electricity prices for industries \n     and consumers; and\n       Whereas, low-income and fixed-income citizens would bear \n     the brunt of higher energy costs and utility bills; and\n       Whereas, according to the National Association of \n     manufacturers, the EPA's proposal could be the most expensive \n     regulation ever issued on the American public, costing the \n     nation $270 billion to $360 billion annually; and\n       Whereas, according to the National Association of \n     Manufacturers, the proposed ozone regulations could cost \n     Arizona $28 billion in gross state product loss from 2017 to \n     2040, 19,982 lost jobs or job equivalents per year, $639 \n     million in total compliance costs and a $520 drop in average \n     household consumption per year; and\n       Whereas, the National Association of Manufacturers predicts \n     that the EPA's proposed standards could result in a 15% \n     increase in residential electricity prices, a 32% increase in \n     residential natural gas prices and an 8% reduction in \n     Arizona's coal-fired generating capacity; and\n       Whereas, the EPA has identified only 46% of the controls \n     needed to meet the proposed standards, and the remaining 54% \n     would have to be met with unknown controls that the EPA has \n     not yet identified but that would likely have to include \n     early shutdowns and scrappage of existing facilities, \n     equipment and vehicles; and\n       Whereas, early retirement and scrappage of power plants, \n     industrial facilities, heavy-duty trucks and equipment and \n     automobiles would be much more costly ways to remove each \n     additional ton of emissions than the controls the EPA has \n     identified; and\n       Whereas, air quality continues to improve, and nitrogen \n     oxide emissions are already down to 60% nationwide since \n     1980, which, after adjusting for economic growth, implies a \n     90% reduction in emission rates from the relatively \n     uncontrolled 1990 rates for nitrogen oxide-emitting sources; \n     and\n       Whereas, average ozone concentrations have decreased \n     significantly in both urban and rural areas over the past two \n     decades in response to state and federal emission control \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, states are on track to be fully in attainment with \n     the current standards, but some have not yet reached full \n     attainment; and\n       Whereas, instead of giving states enough time to meet the \n     current standards through ongoing emission reduction \n     programs, the EPA now wants to move the goalpost by imposing \n     a lower standard; and\n       Whereas, retaining the current ozone standards would \n     provide for continued air quality improvement throughout the \n     nation as emission reduction programs under existing EPA \n     regulations are implemented.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the EPA refrain from reducing the ozone \n     concentration standard from 75 parts per billion to 65 to 70 \n     parts per billion.\n       2.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to focus future Mexican wolf introduction \n     efforts on remote areas within the northern Sierra Madre \n     Occidental mountain range, to halt additional introductions \n     of Mexican wolves in Arizona, and to shift the responsibility \n     for the Mexican wolf introduction to the Arizona Game and \n     Fish Department; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1003\n\n       Whereas, on January 16, 2015, United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued a revised experimental \n     population rule under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species \n     Act (ESA) that provides for a population objective of 300 to \n     325 wolves in Arizona and New Mexico and expands the areas \n     within which Mexican wolves can occupy and disperse with the \n     goal of phasing the releases westward over a period of twelve \n     years; and\n       Whereas, the revised experimental population rule raises \n     concerns regarding the creation of an unmanageable Mexican \n     wolf population, fails to consider state and local interests \n     and remains silent on Mexican wolf recovery; and\n       Whereas, Congress enacted section 10(j) of the ESA to \n     mitigate fears that reestablishing populations of endangered \n     species would negatively impact landowners and other private \n     parties, recognizing that flexible rules, developed in \n     consultation with local governments and private citizens, \n     could encourage recovery partners to actively assist in the \n     establishment and hosting of endangered populations on their \n     lands; and\n       Whereas, to the maximum extent practicable, section 10(j) \n     rules are intended to represent an agreement between the \n     USFWS, affected state and federal agencies and persons \n     holding any interest in land that may be affected by the \n     establishment of an experimental population; and\n       Whereas, the objective of 1982 Mexican Wolf Recovery Plan \n     is the establishment of a viable, self-sustaining population \n     of at least 100 Mexican wolves in the wild; and\n       Whereas, at the end of 2014, there were a minimum of 109 \n     wolves in the wild in Arizona and New Mexico, all of which \n     were conceived and born in the wild as a direct result of \n     previous wolf introduction efforts; and\n       Whereas, the costs to date of this program have exceeded \n     $7.3 million; and\n       Whereas, the implementation of the revised experimental \n     population rule will allow additional wolves to be introduced \n     within Arizona and New Mexico; and\n       Whereas, the introduction of wolves into Arizona and New \n     Mexico has resulted in significant adverse impacts on private \n     landowners and resource users, as well as hunting and other \n     recreational activities, which are vital to our local and \n     regional economy; and\n       Whereas, under its regulations, the USFWS must consult with \n     appropriate state fish and wildlife agencies, local \n     governmental entities, affected federal agencies and affected \n     private landowners in developing and implementing \n     experimental population rules; and\n       Whereas, in developing its experimental population rules \n     for the Mexican wolf, the USFWS has failed to meaningfully \n     consult with local governmental entities, whose citizens will \n     be adversely affected by the introduction of wolves, and with \n     private land and resource users who will be adversely \n     impacted by the introduction of wolves; and\n       Whereas, the adopted experimental population rule for the \n     Mexican wolf will create even greater conflicts with private \n     landowners and resource users; and\n       Whereas, the Arizona Game and Fish Department provided the \n     USFWS and the United States Department of the Interior with a \n     notice of intent to bring a civil action pursuant to section \n     11(g)(1)(C) of the ESA for the Secretary of the Interior's \n     failure to develop a recovery plan for the Mexican gray wolf \n     that meets the legal requirements in section 4(f) of the ESA; \n     and\n       Whereas, the federal government has failed to take into \n     consideration the customs, cultures, historic heritage and \n     local and state economic well-being of areas that have been \n     identified as habitats for this species; and\n       Whereas, the Secretary of the Interior has a \n     nondiscretionary duty under section 4(f) to develop a \n     recovery plan that incorporates ``objective. measurable \n     criteria which when met, would result in a determination, in \n     accordance with the provisions of this section, that the \n     species be removed from the list.''\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the USFWS focus future Mexican wolf introduction \n     efforts on remote areas within the northern Sierra Madre \n     Occidental mountain range, which contains substantial habitat \n     suitable for Mexican wolves and, in many places, is largely \n     uninhabited.\n       2. That the USFWS halt additional introductions of Mexican \n     wolves in Arizona.\n       3. That the USFWS shift the primary responsibility for the \n     administration of the Mexican wolf introduction program in \n     Arizona to the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n       4. That the Secretary of the Interior comply with the \n     Secretary of the Interior's duty under section 4(f) of the \n     ESA to develop a recovery plan that incorporates ``objective, \n     measureable criteria which when met, would result in a \n     determination, in accordance with the provisions of this \n     section, that the species be removed from the list.''\n       5. That the Governor and the Attorney General of the State \n     of Arizona take appropriate actions to uphold this state's \n     responsibilities with respect to the recovery plan and defend \n     this state against overreaching federal regulations.\n       6.

That the Members of the Legislature commend Israel for \n     its cordial and mutually beneficial relationship with the \n     United States and with the State of Arizona and support \n     Israel as a Jewish state in its legal, historical, moral and \n     God-given right of self-governance and self-defense on the \n     entirety of its own lands, recognizing that Israel is not an \n     occupier of the lands of others and that peace can be \n     afforded in the region only through a whole and united \n     Israel.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Georgia encouraging the representation of diverse populations \n     of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in clinical \n     research and the dedication of additional community resources \n     to increase awareness on the importance of participating in \n     clinical trials, to provide support for patient \n     participation, and to promote effective partnerships with the \n     community to achieve solutions; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                         Senate Resolution 590\n\n       Whereas, developing new medicines and other treatment \n     options is a complex process that involves clinical trials to \n     explore whether a medical strategy, treatment, or device is \n     safe and effective for humans; and\n       Whereas, volunteer participation is necessary to evaluate \n     potential therapies for safety and effectiveness in clinical \n     studies; and\n       Whereas, often the enrolled patient population is not \n     representative of United States demographics or \n     subpopulations impacted by the particular disease; and\n       Whereas, groups such as African Americans and Hispanics are \n     significantly underrepresented in clinical trials; according \n     to the Food and Drug Administration, African Americans \n     represent 12 percent of the United States population but only \n     5 percent of clinical trial participants, and Hispanics \n     comprise 16 percent of the population but only 1 percent of \n     clinical trial participants; and\n       Whereas, despite a congressional mandate that research \n     financed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) include \n     minorities, non-whites comprise fewer than 5 percent of \n     participants in NIH-supported studies; and\n       Whereas, certain medical conditions have been known to \n     affect particular demographic groups more than others, \n     including Type 2 diabetes for which African Americans and \n     Hispanics are twice as likely to be diagnosed on average; and\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, sickle cell trait is common among African \n     Americans and occurs in about one in 12, and sickle cell \n     disease occurs in about one out of every 500 African American \n     births, compared to about one out of every 36,000 Hispanic \n     American births; and\n       Whereas, race and ethnicity have also been demonstrated to \n     affect the efficacy of and response to certain drugs, such as \n     antihypertensive therapies in the treatment of hypertension \n     in African Americans and antidepressants in Hispanics; and\n       Whereas, many barriers exist that account for the low rate \n     of participation among diverse communities, including patient \n     fear of experimentation and lack of understanding or \n     education with regard to the importance of clinical trials in \n     creating new treatments and cures: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this body \n     encourage the representation of diverse populations of \n     different racial and ethnic backgrounds in clinical research \n     and the dedication of additional community resources to \n     increase awareness on the importance of participating in \n     clinical trials, to provide support for patient \n     participation, and to promote effective partnerships with the \n     community to achieve solutions; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate is authorized \n     and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution \n     available for distribution to the President of the United \n     States, the Vice President of the United States, the Georgia \n     delegation to the United States Congress, and other federal \n     and state government officials as appropriate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-64.

No. 111-211, authorized Indian tribes to expand the \n     prosecution and punishment of criminal offenders if certain \n     due process requirements were followed; and\n       Whereas, Indian tribes have recently achieved more \n     authority to prosecute criminal offenses committed on tribal \n     lands as evidenced by the enactment of the federal Violence \n     Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, Pub. L. No. 113-4, \n     which for the first time allowed tribal enforcement over non-\n     natives who commit domestic violence on tribal lands; and\n       Whereas, the State of Iowa was the first in the nation to \n     pass Native American grave protection legislation, commonly \n     known as the Iowa Graves Protection Act, 1976 Iowa Acts, ch. \n     1158, Sec. 7, that came into law before the federal version \n     and before the more recent passage of Iowa's Recognition and \n     Enforcement of Tribal Civil Judgments Act, 2007 Iowa Acts, \n     ch. 192, which followed the development of the Meskwaki \n     Tribal Court System in 2005, with its first case being tried\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\n     in 2006, and 2003 state legislation, 2003 Iowa Acts, ch. 87, \n     recognizing the Meskwaki Tribal Police and allowing them to \n     participate in the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy and to become \n     state certified; and\n       Whereas, the Meskwaki has greatly enhanced at its own \n     expense the tribe's criminal justice system and now provides \n     a fully functioning court system through the establishment of \n     a state certified police force, legally trained and licensed \n     public defenders, prosecutors and judges, and a full-time \n     probation officer, and provides for the publication of its \n     tribal laws; and\n       Whereas, the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the \n     Iowa Coalition against Domestic Violence have noted that the \n     victims of domestic violence on the Meskwaki Settlement \n     prefer that prosecution and other court services be handled \n     by the tribal court of the Meskwaki Settlement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That the Iowa General Assembly urges the members \n     of the United States Senate and the United States House of \n     Representatives to repeal the Act of June 30, 1948, Pub.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona urging the Congress of the United States \n     and Department of Veterans Affairs to review the disability \n     rating process; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1008\n\n       Whereas, military veterans with similar disabilities are \n     receiving disparate disability ratings because of different \n     standards, policies and procedures used by the physical \n     evaluation boards operated by the military departments; and\n       Whereas, achieving consistent disability ratings regardless \n     of service is an important objective that will ensure service \n     members are treated equitably; and\n       Whereas, disability significantly increases the veteran \n     poverty rate; the rate of increase is nearly twice that of \n     the nonveteran disabled population; and\n       Whereas, even those veterans who receive Social Security \n     Disability or Supplemental Security Income benefits have \n     incomes under $9,000 per year; and\n       Whereas, 60% of hiring organizations polled in a June 2010 \n     Society for Human Resource Management survey said that \n     translating military skills to a civilian job experience \n     could pose a challenge in hiring veterans and 46% said the \n     same about hiring those who suffer from posttraumatic stress \n     disorder and other mental health issues; and\n       Whereas, while service members are often promised saleable \n     skills and job opportunities they would not have access to \n     otherwise, the reality is that veterans often feel \n     discriminated against and overlooked in the workplace; and\n       Whereas, veterans who are granted a Total Disability Rating \n     Based on Individual Unemployability are subject to earning \n     restrictions.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     review the disability rating process to ensure that similar \n     disabilities are rated similarly.\n       2. That the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     review the limitations on employment of veterans with \n     disabilities and the ways in which veteran benefits are \n     impacted if a veteran with a disability becomes employed to \n     ensure that veterans with disabilities are not hindered from \n     joining the workforce.\n       3. That the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     remove the earning restriction associated with the Total \n     Disability Rating Based on Individual Unemployability.\n       4. That the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     develop programs and incentives to encourage employers to \n     hire veterans with disabilities.\n       5. That the United States Congress enact legislation that \n     codifies into the United States Code the text of 38 Code of \n     Federal Regulations section 4.16, which provides that \n     employment in a protected environment is not considered \n     substantially gainful employment for the purposes of a Total \n     Disability Rating Based on Individual Unemployability.\n       6. That the United States Congress define ``protected \n     environment'' to include businesses that make special \n     accommodations for veterans with disabilities.\n       7. That the United States Congress enact legislation that \n     prevents the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     from decreasing a Total Disability Rating Based on Individual \n     Unemployability if the veteran is marginally employed in a \n     protected environment.\n       8. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit a copy of this Memorial to the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the President \n     of the United States, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of \n     Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-67.

According to Veterans Administration records, Maine \n     has had 11,531 military members serve since the tragic events \n     of 9/11; and\n       Whereas, members of the Maine National Guard and Reservists \n     have been deployed many times over and many have returned \n     from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan needing assistance and \n     medical care; and\n       Whereas, 55 of Maine's services members have been killed in \n     action in Iraq and Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas, more than 320 have received the Purple Heart for \n     wounds received in combat; and\n       Whereas, many have returned home with post-traumatic stress \n     disorder, traumatic brain injury, hearing problems and other \n     physical and mental disabilities; and\n       Whereas, many communities in Maine need someone who can \n     meet with veterans and survivors to explain benefits and to \n     get the word out to veterans and theirfamilies concerning \n     frequently changing Veterans Administration benefits and \n     eligibility; and\n       Whereas, major issues for returning veterans concerning \n     increasing suicide rates, homelessness, unemployment and \n     education were brought before the 113th Congress with little \n     or no substantive results; and\n       Whereas, as the 114th Congress begins, veterans and their \n     families in Maine and across the Nation hope that the new \n     Congress will be responsive and helpful and aggressively \n     address the many issues facing the veterans of the wars in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas, the men and women who serve our State and Nation \n     so faithfully deserve to have access to care, housing, \n     medical treatment and mental and physical therapy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, on behalf of the \n     people we represent, take this opportunity to urge the United \n     States Congress to take the lead in passing necessary \n     legislation that will help all our veterans, from all our \n     wars and conflicts, from World War II to present-day Iraq and \n     Afghanistan to the extent necessary; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each Member \n     of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-68.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nprovide for voluntary country of origin labeling for beef, pork, and \nchicken; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, today I filed, along with a bipartisan \ngroup of cosponsors, the Voluntary Country of Origin Labeling and Trade \nEnhancement Act of 2015. I wish to thank the cosponsors on the \nlegislation. The lead cosponsor on the Democratic side is Senator \nDebbie Stabenow, ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee. \nAlso joining us in this bipartisan group are Senator John Thune from \nSouth Dakota, another member of the agriculture committee, Senator Amy \nKlobuchar, Senator Chuck Grassley, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Senator Mike \nEnzi, and Senator Sherrod Brown. With the exception of Senator Enzi, \nall of the cosponsors are members of our agriculture committee.\n  What we are trying to do is come up with a solution to the country-\nof-origin labeling issue. This is an issue that has been in a WTO court \nfor some time and involves the United States, Canada, and Mexico, our \nvery good trading partners. Essentially what we are working to do is to \nfind a solution that addresses the WTO issues as far as country-of-\norigin labeling in a way that makes sure that we are WTO compliant so \nthat there are no duties or tariffs that can be levied against any of \nour agricultural exports or any other exports. At the same time, for \nthose who want to use country-of-origin labeling on a voluntary basis, \nthey are able to do so. That would preserve what is known as the \n``Grade A'' label, which simply means born, raised, and slaughtered or \nprocessed in the United States. So for beef, pork, and chicken, if it \nis born and raised and processed in the United States, one can still \nuse that ``Grade A'' label, but it is a voluntary program, it is not a \nmandatory program. We do that purposely so that we meet the WTO \nrequirements. I have spoken with the U.S. Trade Representative's office \nabout that issue, which I will go into in just a minute.\n\n  What we have done is we have simply taken the House legislation--\nsponsored by the Agriculture Committee chairman in the House, \nRepresentative Mike Conaway, which passed in the House--essentially, we \ntake the same bill, the same language as far as repealing mandatory \nCOOL. So we repeal mandatory COOL, which puts us in compliance with \nwhat the WTO is asking for, then we simply add some language that \nallows for a voluntary program, so that for processors, marketers, and \nproducers that want to participate in a voluntary program, they can. If \nthey believe consumers want to know, then they have that opportunity to \nprovide their product with the ``Grade A'' label on a voluntary basis. \nThat is reasonable because that is what Canada does. Canada has a \nvoluntary program. It is called their ``Product of Canada'' label. So \nall we are doing is what Canada does. We repeal the mandatory program \nand we put in place a voluntary program just as our good friends and \nneighbors do in Canada.\n  When I spoke with the U.S. Trade Representative about this issue, \nessentially what they said is whether we repeal mandatory COOL by \nitself or repeal mandatory COOL and have a voluntary program, \nessentially we are in the same position vis-a-vis meeting the WTO \nrequirements.\n  So this is really an effort to build bipartisan support for a \nsolution to the COOL issue, which has been a challenging issue. This is \nan issue we worked on on the farm bill. I was one of the conferees on \nthe conference committee, and COOL and some of the other issues were \nsome of the last--dairy, for example--issues we were able to resolve in \nfinally getting an agreement on a farm bill.\n  Again, this is an effort in a practical way to bring people together \non both sides of the issue to solve the problem. We make sure we are \nWTO compliant. Then, on a voluntary basis, there is the option for \npeople to label as they want to. We work to create enough bipartisan \nsupport in this body so we can deal with the issue now, so we can \nresolve the issue now and pass this legislation and then get it to \nconference with the House and have a resolution before the end of this \nmonth and before the August recess so that this issue is taken care of.\n  I look forward to working with everybody involved on both sides of \nthe aisle, including our esteemed chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Roberts. I appreciate all the time we have spent \nworking together on this issue. I look forward to working with Members \non both sides of the aisle, both on the Agriculture Committee and \neveryone else, to craft a solution, advance it through this body, and \nget it to conference with the House.\n  As I said, I have spoken with Chairman Conaway, the Agriculture \nCommittee chairman in the House. We have a good relationship, and we \nhad a good dialogue about the sooner we get to work together to resolve \nthis, the better, and we look forward to that.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to join with us, our bipartisan group, in \na bipartisan way. Let's get this done and make sure we not only have \naddressed the issue with the World Trade Organization court so there \nare no duties but also make sure we have put forward a solution that \nworks for the American consumer and for the American agriculture \nindustry, that on a voluntary basis gives them the opportunity to \nprovide country-of-origin labeling as well as solving the WTO \nchallenge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \n        Brown, Mr. Tester, and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 1856. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nsuspension and removal of employees of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for performance or misconduct that is a threat to public health \nor safety and to improve accountability of employees of the Department, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, going back to my colleagues who have \nappeared to talk about issues of accountability for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, I want to say how grateful I am for the spirit of \ncollaboration that prevailed yesterday in our meeting.\n  Very generously and responsibly, the chairman of that committee, \nSenator Isakson--my good friend and distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia--offered and committed to continue the effort to improve the \nmeasures we approved yesterday in our committee to hold accountable the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and all of its employees--just as we do \nany other agency of government--to make sure we keep faith with our \nveterans and leave no veteran behind.\n  Our Nation needs to make sure we provide the robust resources and the \nprompt delivery of health care services\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nand other measures to our veterans with the honest and efficient \nmanagement our veterans deserve.\n  So many of us were repulsed and outraged by the revelation just a \nlittle more than 1 year ago about delays in health care, irresponsible \nand reprehensible and, indeed, criminal obstruction of justice in \ncooking the books that prevailed at health care facilities of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs around the country, and the \nramifications were sweeping. There were indeed changes in management, \nbeginning at the very top, with a new Secretary. There were also \nmeasures approved by this Congress in the last session, the Veterans \nAccess, Choice and Accountability Act, to make sure no veteran \nsuffering 30 days or more in delays in health care be denied a private \nprovider if he or she chooses one or is living more than 40 miles from \nany facility.\n\n  We are working on additional measures, constructive and positive \nmeasures, to make sure this Nation fulfills its promise of prompt, \nworld-class, first-class health care to every veteran who needs it, \nregardless of what that need is, the specialty or the illness, and to \nmake sure we also cure the other deficiencies, such as the delays in \ndisability claims, homelessness, joblessness, the need for job training \nand skills among our veterans.\n  Part of our task is accountability to make sure members of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs are held accountable. That is one reason \nwhy I insisted and urged from the very beginning of those revelations \nof wrongdoing and criminality in the Department of Veterans Affairs \nthat there be a Department of Justice investigation. I called on the \nAttorney General of the United States to investigate, not the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Attorney General of \nthe United States because only the Department of Justice has the \nresources and expertise, direction, and leadership to successfully \npursue the wide-ranging criminality and wrongdoing that I thought was \nrevealed.\n  For all of us who hope there is honesty and fair dealing in our \ngovernment, regrettably there has now been a criminal indictment. The \nindications are that more should follow, that there was and is reason \nfor a Department of Justice investigation, that there are and need to \nbe continued reports and results of the IG investigation. I have called \nin hearing after hearing that we be given those reports and results of \nthe ongoing inspector general investigation, and we still are lacking \nin the full work product from that office. There is clearly more work \nto be done on the wrongdoing that has been committed in the past, and \nthere is clearly more work to be done to prevent it in the future.\n  Part of what needs to be done is to protect the whistleblowers. \nIndeed, those revelations of wrongdoing came in part from \nwhistleblowers who had the courage and fortitude to step forward and \nwho were intimidated and ostracized and sometimes persecuted within the \nVA. They need protection. One part of what we need to do is to make \nsure they are protected.\n  There ought to be accountability going forward in disciplining \nemployees within the VA when there is malfeasance or waste or fraud. \nThat involves eliminating some of the redtape and rigaramole that in \nthe past have hampered the VA Secretary or other managers in making \nsure that there is accountability. That is why I welcome the focus of \nour committee on assuring accountability and transparency.\n  Those changes in the law are necessary to enable the VA Secretary and \nhis team to make sure that there is not only accurate and effective \nprompt discipline but also the appearance of it so that employees at \nthe VA will know that there is a standard of conduct and it will be \nenforced and it will be upheld in the courts when it is challenged. \nThat is true not only in the VA but of every department of the U.S. \nGovernment. There needs to be that perception and reality of the \nenforcement of codes of conduct and ethics.\n  There needs to be a recognition that it is in the interest not only \nof the American taxpayer but the employees of the U.S. Government \nthemselves. The majority of them are honest and hard-working. Those \nnurses, counselors, therapists, doctors, and administrators at the VA \nwho are doing their job--in fact, working overtime often without \nadditional pay--who are serving valiantly and responsibly, their \nclients deserve that wrongdoers be rooted out and held accountable. \nThey are the vast majority of those honest and hard-working employees, \nand we owe them thanks for what they do to serve our veterans, but the \nwrongdoers need to be disciplined.\n  The idea that they should receive bonuses is absolutely abhorrent. I \nwelcome legislation that stops bonuses for employees who fail the most \nbasic notions of effective and honest service. They deserve that those \nbonuses be stopped.\n  My colleague Senator Isakson has spoken about S. 627, the bill that \nhas been sponsored by Senator Ayotte and was approved yesterday. I want \nto make sure in the improvements I am going to offer to it and that my \ncolleague Senator Brown offered yesterday--that we actually make it \nmore effective. That is the nature of this deliberative process, that \nwe try to improve on what we are doing to make enforcement more \neffective.\n  I know as an enforcer, as a former U.S. attorney and a Federal and \nState official, enforcement is key to making the law work. The same is \ntrue of S. 1082, sponsored by our colleague Senator Rubio, which also \nwas approved yesterday by our committee. I have offered a bill that \nwill improve the measure we approved yesterday in a number of different \nrespects.\n  First of all, there are serious questions about the constitutionality \nof the provision approved yesterday. I think in fairness to all of the \nAmerican taxpayers as well as this body, we should face whatever \ndeficiencies there are constitutionally in the law before that law \nbecomes unenforceable.\n  The importance of making sure a law is constitutional goes to \nenforcement. A law that is unconstitutional, that fails to provide \nsufficient notice, a statement of causes, a right to be heard, an \nopportunity to achieve basic constitutional protection that the U.S. \nSecurity Court has repeatedly said is necessary, those deficiencies can \nmake law unenforceable.\n  As I said yesterday in our committee meeting, as a former attorney \ngeneral, and there are others in this body, we know how difficult the \ntask is to defend a law or defend State action that is based on a \nconstitutional and firm statute.\n  A law that is unenforceable is worse than no law at all because it \ncreates a false sense of security, an expectation that never can be \nfulfilled because a law that is unenforceable will never be effective \nin preventing the wrong that it is designed to do.\n  I want to improve S. 1082--in fact, to make it more effective--but to \nmake sure it is done in a way that can be upheld, also to protect those \nwhistleblowers, and to make sure that if there are firings and \ndisciplines, it is done on the merits, that it is done on the basis of \nreal cause and evidence, not as part of a political witch hunt.\n  We have been through the spoils system. This Nation has lived through \na time when, in effect, offices were bought and sold. That certainly is \nnobody's intention here, and I am sure my colleagues and I can work \ntogether to move toward a measure that fulfills our common shared \nobjective in making sure that merit and effective action is rewarded \nwith bonuses and through other means and that wrongdoing is punished \nand deterred.\n  There can be no enforcement unless the law is framed as well as \npossible, and there can be no deterrence unless there is enforcement. \nThat is what we want to do: prevent this kind of wrongdoing going \nforward, not just looking backward and pursuing and prosecuting the \nwrongdoers, which I hope will be done. There is more than ample \nevidence to support it but also to prevent it going forward.\n  I am tremendously heartened by our committee chairman's commitment to \nwork with me and others on that committee. He said to me very \nexplicitly, and it is on the record, that he will, in fact, work with \nus. We will engage in collaboration.\n  I think we are going to improve these measures. They may not be huge \nor sweeping changes in what we approved yesterday, but we all know that \nwords can sometimes lead to courts concluding that there are defects in \nthe law that were never intended by the\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nFramers. That is a consequence, an unintended result that we should \navoid if possible. It may seem like lawyer talk, but it has \nramifications in the courts. That is the reason we heard from the DAV \nat our June 24 hearing that it is ``vitally important to VA's long-term \nfuture to create an environment in which the best and brightest \nprofessionals choose VA over other Federal or private employers.''\n  We need those best of the best in the VA, not working in the private \nsector alone. Fairness and due process in our workplace will encourage \ntalented doctors, lawyers, nurses, and other professionals to come to \nthe VA, which is where we need them, for the strength of that system.\n  As the independent U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board stated in its \nstatement for the record in the committee's June 24th hearing, there is \na need to follow and respect constitutional due process. The \nPartnership for Public Service said much of the same thing in this \nletter of July 21, 2015.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Partnership for Public Service,\n\n                                     Washington DC, July 21, 2015.\n     Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee: On \n     behalf of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, \n     nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the \n     effectiveness of our federal government, I am writing to \n     express my views on S. 1082, the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Accountability Act of 2015, and a substitute \n     amendment to be offered by Senator Blumenthal, which would \n     address employee accountability and broader management \n     challenges at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n       As members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, you \n     have a unique opportunity to fix serious problems at the \n     Department and improve the ability of the Department to \n     deliver on its mission to provide high-quality services to \n     veterans. Unfortunately, the reforms promoted in S. 1082 will \n     not accomplish these objectives. As drafted, the bill \n     eliminates due process protections for employees--which will \n     silence the very whistleblowers we rely on to sound the \n     alarm--and could lead to removals for partisan or \n     discriminatory reasons. The bill will also have an adverse \n     impact on the ability of VA to recruit and retain top talent, \n     as seasoned reformers may be less inclined to pursue VA \n     leadership positions without due process protections. In \n     addition, the bill expedites the appeals process without \n     providing additional resources, which, according to a \n     statement for the record from the Merit Systems Protection \n     Board (MSPB), could overwhelm MSPB's capacity to manage its \n     workload.\n       The Partnership strongly agrees that poor performance is a \n     real problem at VA and that federal employees at all agencies \n     must be held accountable for their performance and conduct. \n     We have recommended dozens of reforms to the current civil \n     service system that, we believe, will lead to a better \n     managed government and a higher performing workforce. \n     However, moving to at-will employment will have many \n     unintended consequences and will not solve the critical \n     management challenges that are hobbling VA and jeopardizing \n     the care of our veterans. We believe a better solution lies \n     in Sen. Blumenthal's substitute amendment that would give the \n     Secretary an additional tool to remove individuals who are a \n     threat to public health or safety, and improve the management \n     of the Department.\n       Among other things, the substitute amendment would do the \n     following:\n       Hold senior political leaders accountable in performance \n     plans for recruiting and selecting the right people for \n     employment at the agency, engaging and motivating employees, \n     training and developing employees and holding managers \n     accountable for making difficult performance decisions. \n     Accountability for management in government starts at the \n     very top and this provision will ensure all leaders, career \n     and political, are held accountable.\n       Ensure managers are fully using the probationary period to \n     develop high-potential employees and to remove someone if \n     they are not the right fit for the position. The amendment \n     would require managers to make an affirmative decision as to \n     whether an individual who serves in a probationary period has \n     demonstrated successful performance and should continue past \n     the probationary period. It also requires new supervisors to \n     demonstrate management competencies, in addition to technical \n     skills, in order to remain in a management position.\n       Require periodic training for managers on the rights of \n     whistleblowers and how to address an employee allegation of a \n     hostile work environment, reprisal or harassment; how to \n     effectively motivate, manage and reward employees; and how to \n     effectively manage employees who are performing at an \n     unacceptable level.\n       Hold VA managers accountable in performance plans for \n     taking action to address poor performance and misconduct and \n     for taking steps to improve or sustain high levels of \n     employee engagement.\n       Create a separate promotion track for technical experts so \n     they can advance in their careers without having to go into \n     management positions for which they are ill-suited. Too often \n     we hear that supervisors promote their employees to \n     management positions because they want to pay them more, even \n     when the employees are technical experts who may be \n     uninterested or unskilled in managing people.\n       Require GAO to study the implementation of Section 707 of \n     the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, \n     which was enacted last year, to understand its impact on \n     performance, accountability, recruitment and retention at VA, \n     particularly at the executive level. The provision would also \n     require GAO to review VA's internal policies for dealing with \n     performance issues and make recommendations for how the \n     Department could expedite the process for addressing \n     performance and misconduct administratively.\n       The challenges at VA are critical and must be addressed. We \n     encourage the Committee to adopt the substitute amendment and \n     ensure these critical management provisions are included as \n     the bill moves to the floor. Our veterans deserve the very \n     best care and this is the time for real reform, not simple \n     expediency.\n           Very best wishes,\n                                                        Max Stier,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask that my colleagues join in this collaboration \nbecause I know how deeply you and I feel, how we share that common \ngoal, not just in our committee. I ask that we work to incorporate the \nmeasure I have introduced today, S. 1856, with the cosponsorship \nSenators Murray, Sanders, Brown, Tester, and Hirono, my colleagues on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nEquitable Employee Accountability Act. This measure is introduced \ntoday, and it will help us improve and enhance S. 1082 and the \nsupremely important objectives that motivate it.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for our work together, and I look forward to \npursuing it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Booker, Mr. Bennet, \n        Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Coons, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Kaine, \n        Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mrs. McCaskill, \n        Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Peters, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Udall, Mr. Warner, Ms. \n        Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1858. A bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, \ngender identity, and sexual orientation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equality \nAct of 2015--comprehensive civil rights legislation for our LGBT \ncommunity.\n  There are few concepts as fundamentally American as equality. We were \nfounded on this principle with these simple words:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, they are endowed by their Creator with \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  For more than two centuries, we have been working to fulfill that \nvision of equality. We have taken direct action as a nation so that our \nlaws align more closely with these founding ideals. We have challenged \nunjust rules and destructive prejudices and chosen to advance basic \ncivil rights.\n  Martin Luther King put forth the vision that the arc of the moral \nuniverse is long but it bends towards justice. He knew that in the \n1950s and 1960s Americans were hard at work making that moral arc of \nthe universe bend towards justice. That is the work we continue here in \nthe Senate, here on Capitol Hill, here in the House of Representatives \njust 100 yards away.\n  Step by step, stride by stride, the barriers that once prevented \npeople from enjoying the full measure of liberty, the full measure of \nopportunity, the full measure of equality have broken down.\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\n  At the same time, we recognize there is much more to be done to \nsecure that reality for each and every American. In cities and towns \nacross our Nation, many of our citizens do not receive equal treatment, \nnot because of anything they have done but because of who they are--\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, whom they love, and who they are.\n  Yes, we have made progress in advancing rights for the LGBT \ncommunity. We passed the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act \nafter I came to the Senate in 2009. We repealed don't ask, don't tell, \nwhich prevented all Americans from serving openly in the U.S. military. \nWe reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, with \nprotections for services for the LGBT community. We passed the \nAffordable Care Act so that no one could be denied health care because \nof their sexual orientation or gender identity. And we have seen \nlandmark victories in the Supreme Court, first in the Edith Windsor \ncase when the Court ruled it was unconstitutional for the Federal \nGovernment to discriminate and just last month when the Court \nreaffirmed that ``love is love'' and ensured that marriage equality \nwould come to all 50 States.\n  That is a significant number of steps, a significant number of \nstrides on the path toward full equality, and it happened in a \nrelatively short period of time. But we are far from where we need to \nbe--full equality for every American. As long as people are afraid to \nput their spouse's photo on their desk at work, as long as they are \nworried about being evicted from their apartment if they do not pretend \nto be just roommates, we have a lot of work to do.\n  The harsh reality remains that in far too many States there are still \nno laws specifically prohibiting discrimination against LGBT Americans. \nNearly two-thirds of the LGBT community reports they have faced \ndiscrimination in their lives. In Pennsylvania, a transgender woman can \nbe denied service and kicked out of a restaurant just for being who she \nis and it would be perfectly legal. In Michigan, a newly married couple \ncan be denied the chance to buy their first house just because they are \nboth women and that would be perfectly legal. In North Carolina, a gay \nman can be fired from his job today just for being gay and that would \nbe perfectly legal.\n  Only 22 States and the District of Columbia have passed legislation \nthat prevents workers from being fired because they are gay. Only 19 of \nthose States and the District of Columbia include language protecting \nagainst gender identity bias.\n  The time has come to right this wrong. The time has come for us as a \nnation to be bolder and better at ensuring full rights and full \nequality for the LGBT community. Not only is it within our power, it is \nsomething America must work to lead. And the most powerful form of \nleadership is the example we set.\n  In 1962, Bobby Kennedy said:\n\n       Nations around the world look to us for leadership not \n     merely by strength of arms, but by the strength of our \n     convictions. We not only want, but we need, the free exercise \n     of rights by every American.\n\n  Our commitment to the vision of equality and fairness is a \nsignificant part of America's soul. It makes us strong. It makes us who \nwe are as a people. And we should settle for nothing less. These \nfundamental principles served as the guiding force behind the \ncomprehensive legislation--the Equality Act of 2015--we are introducing \ntoday here in the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  I thank my lead cosponsors in the Senate, Cory Booker and Tammy \nBaldwin, who have done enormous good work in setting the stage for \ntoday's introduction.\n  I thank four staff members who worked very hard on this on my team, \nincluding my chief of staff, Michael Zamore; my legislative director, \nJeremiah Baumann; my legislative assistant, Adrian Snead; and my \nlegislative correspondent, Elizabeth Eickelberg. There are many other \nmembers of the team who pitched in, but they have worked day and night \nto help make this moment arrive.\n  We have had support, such critical support and involvement from \nnumerous outside groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of dozens of groups endorsing this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n          National Organizations that endorse the legislation:\n\n       9to5, National Association of Working Women, Advocates for \n     Youth, Aids United, American Civil Liberties Union, American \n     Federation of Teachers, American Federation of Teachers, \n     Anti-Defamation League, Athlete Ally, Bend the Arc Jewish \n     Action, CenterLink: The Community of LGBT Centers, Central \n     Conference of American Rabbis, Family Equality Council, \n     Family Equality Council, Freedom to Work, Generation \n     Progress, GLSEN, Hindu American Foundation, Human Rights \n     Campaign, Interfaith Alliance, JWI.\n       Lambda Legal, NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Black \n     Justice Coalition, National Center for Lesbian Rights, \n     National Center for Transgender Equality, National Council of \n     La Raza (NCLR), National Education Association, National \n     Education Association, National Employment Law Project, \n     National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, National LGBTQ \n     Task Force Action Fund, National Organization for Women, \n     National Partnership for Women & Families, National Women's \n     Law Center, People For the American Way, PFLAG National, \n     PFLAG National, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, \n     Secular Coalition for America, Sexuality Information and \n     Education Council of the U.S. (SIECUS), The Trevor Project, \n     Union for Reform Judaism.\n\n\n           State organizations that endorse the legislation:\n\n       9to5 California, CA; 9to5 Colorado, CO; 9to5 Georgia, GA; \n     9to5 Wisconsin, WI; Equality Michigan, MI; Equality Michigan, \n     MI; Gender Justice, MN and Upper Midwest; Gender Rights \n     Maryland, MD; PROMO (Missouri), MO; Southwest Women's Law \n     Center, NM.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I particularly want to draw attention to \nseveral organizations that played a leading role, and I apologize to \nothers that were also very involved. The Human Rights Campaign played a \ncentral role in organizing today's introduction. I also thank the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, the National Council of La Raza, the \nNational LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, the National Women's Law Center, \nand so many others.\n  The Equality Act will create uniform Federal standards to protect all \nLGBT Americans from discrimination in housing, in workplaces, in \nschools, in public accommodations, and in financial transactions. It is \na vision of equality deeply rooted in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It is \nsetting the same foundation to end discrimination for the LGBT \ncommunity that was set for ethnicity and set for gender and set for \nrace. That is the foundation for the vision of eliminating \ndiscrimination in area after area, and it is time we place LGBT \nnondiscrimination on that same foundation. That is what we are doing \ntoday--comprehensively taking on discrimination.\n  The bill also addresses gaps in legal protections against sex \ndiscrimination--ensuring women are treated equally in all aspects of \ntheir lives. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a steadily \nincreasing number of courts have recognized that sexual orientation and \ngender identity discrimination are properly understood as forms of sex \ndiscrimination in light of multiple controlling sex discrimination \ncases. The EEOC has done this through several decisions, most notably \nMacy v. Holder in 2012, which held that transgender discrimination is \nsex discrimination, and Baldwin v. Foxx very recently, which held that \nsexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Equality Act, codifies this \nunderstanding, making it clear that sexual orientation and gender \nidentity are correctly understood as sex discrimination.\n  In addition, the bill adds the terms ``sexual orientation'' and \n``gender identity'' to the list of protected characteristics throughout \nthe code. This change should not be read to mean that sexual \norientation and gender identity are not correctly understood as sex \ndiscrimination. These additions were made so covered entities as well \nas LGBT people can clearly see that these protections exist. Employers, \nbusinesses, and institutions are often not aware of the decisions by \nthe EEOC and the courts holding that sexual orientation or gender \nidentity are protected.\n  This bill represents a paradigm shift in two ways. First, our civil \nrights community has worked incredibly hard\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\nto defend the principles established in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and \ntoday we are asking for their engagement to not simply defend this act \nbut to expand this act. Second, we have worked very hard to take on \npieces of discrimination, whether it be don't ask, don't tell, whether \nit be Federal benefits for same-sex partners. But today we are saying \nwe need a vision of comprehensive nondiscrimination. That is the \nexpression of full opportunity. You cannot access full opportunity if \nthe door is closed in financial transactions or jury selection or \npublic accommodations if you can still be turned away from a restaurant \nbecause of whom you love or whom you are. Every American deserves \nequality in every basic function of our society. Discrimination has no \nplace in our Nation's laws.\n  If it is wrong in marriage, as the Court has held, as numerous States \nhave established, it is wrong also in employment. If it is wrong in \nemployment, it is wrong in housing. If it is wrong in housing, it is \nwrong, too, in education.\n  Overwhelmingly, Americans believe discrimination is wrong. \nOverwhelmingly, they believe it is already illegal, and they believe it \nhas no place in our society and no place being condoned by our laws.\n  Even though the Equality Act addresses multiple dimensions of \ndiscrimination, it is quite simple. It says that people deserve to live \nfree from fear, free from violence, and free from discrimination, \nregardless of who they are or whom they love.\n  Writing these protections into law will bring us another stride \nforward in our Nation's long march toward inclusion and equality. It \nwill extend the full promise of America to every American. I will keep \nfighting until this bill is on the President's desk. I will not be \nsatisfied until everyone in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender \ncommunity is guaranteed the dignity and the freedom they deserve, the \nwhole sense of opportunity provided through participation in American \nsociety. A full measure of equality: equal citizen.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in this fight. I thank the 40 \nSenators who stood up today to be original cosponsors of the Equality \nAct of 2015. Let's make our democracy more inclusive and our freedom \nmore perfect by bringing our laws and our actions in line with the \nfounding principle that all are created equal.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month, the Supreme Court took a \nsignificant step towards a more perfect union when it ruled that every \nAmerican has the right to marry the person they love and have that \nlawful marriage recognized. It was a victory for love and justice over \nbigotry and intolerance. This historic milestone should be celebrated, \nbut we must remember that the journey is not complete. The Fourteenth \nAmendment's principles of liberty and equality safeguard all couples' \nright to marry, and also serves as a bulwark against discriminatory \ntreatment in the other aspects of everyday life, including where we \nlive, where we work, and our interactions with the government.\n  While LGBT Americans are now able to marry the person they love, they \ncontinue to experience discrimination in many other aspects of their \nlives. Achieving full equality means that LGBT individuals should be \nable to provide security for their families without fear that they will \nbe fired from their jobs or denied housing. It means that a restaurant \ncannot refuse to serve an LGBT couple because the owner disapproves of \nthat couple's relationship.\n  These are not abstract concepts. In our country today, LGBT Americans \ncontinue to experience discrimination, and it must end. In a June 27 \narticle in the New York Times, entitled ``Next Fight for Gay Rights: \nBias in Jobs and Housing,'' the author Erik Eckholm provides clear \ndocumentation of such discrimination. A landlord in East Nashville, TN, \nrefused to rent his apartment to two women in a loving relationship \nafter he learned of their partnership because it made him \n``uncomfortable.'' He refused their rental application even after they \noffered to raise the rent by $150. A transgender individual was fired \nfrom her job as an industrial electrician because, according to her \nboss, her identity was becoming ``too much of a distraction,'' in spite \nof the fact that she was doing ``great work.''\n  If such discrimination were based on race, religion, sex, or national \norigin, these individuals would be protected under Federal law. But \nbecause Federal civil rights law, as well as many state and local laws, \ndo not provide explicit protections based on sexual orientation and \ngender identity, these individuals continue to experience \ndiscrimination without any legal protection. Their stories show us that \nLGBT Americans continue to be treated as second class citizens in their \ndaily lives.\n  That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Equality Act. The bill \nwould amend existing Federal law to provide explicit civil rights \nprotections for LGBT individuals. This non-discrimination bill would \nensure that sexual orientation and gender identity are protected under \nFederal law in the same way that race, sex, religion, national origin, \nand disability are also protected classes. The result would be to \nprotect LGBT individuals against discrimination in public \naccommodations, federally-funded programs, employment, housing, \neducation, credit, and other aspects of daily life. This is the kind of \nequality and security that all American families should enjoy.\n  I am proud that Vermont was one of the first States to pass a \ncomprehensive law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual \norientation in 1992, and also passed a law explicitly prohibiting \ndiscrimination on the basis of gender identity in 2007. All Vermonters \nare protected from discrimination in employment, places of public \naccommodation, housing, credit, and other services. This is what we \nneed on the Federal level as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \narticle referenced above be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 27, 2015]\n\n          Next Fight for Gay Rights: Bias in Jobs and Housing\n\n                           (By Erik Eckholm)\n\n       Exhilarated by the Supreme Court's endorsement of same-sex \n     marriage, gay rights leaders have turned their sights to what \n     they see as the next big battle: obtaining federal, state and \n     local legal protections in employment, housing, commerce and \n     other arenas, just like those barring discrimination based on \n     race, religion, sex and national origin.\n       The proposals pit advocates against many of the same \n     religious conservatives who opposed legalizing same-sex \n     marriage, and who now see the protection of what they call \n     religious liberty as their most urgent task. These opponents \n     argue that antidiscrimination laws will inevitably be used to \n     force religious people and institutions to violate their \n     beliefs, whether by providing services for same-sex weddings \n     or by employing gay men and lesbians in church-related jobs.\n       Nationally, antidiscrimination laws for gay people are a \n     patchwork with major geographic inequities, said Brad Sears, \n     executive director of the Williams Institute at the School of \n     Law of the University of California, Los Angeles. ``Those who \n     don't live on the two coasts or in the Northeast have been \n     left behind in terms of legal protection,'' he said.\n       At least 22 states bar discrimination based on sexual \n     orientation, and most of them also offer protections to \n     transgender people.\n       Tennessee is one of the majority of states that do not bar \n     such discrimination. There, in East Nashville, Tiffany Cannon \n     and Lauren Horbal thought they had found the perfect house to \n     share with a friend, and the landlord seemed ready to rent \n     when they applied in April.\n       Then he called them to ask what their relationship with \n     each other was, Ms. Horbal, 26, recalled.\n       She said that when the landlord learned that she and Ms. \n     Cannon, 25, were partners, he said, ``I'm not comfortable \n     with that.'' He refused to process their application, even \n     after they offered to raise their rent by $150, to $700 a \n     month, Ms. Horbal said.\n       The women, both restaurant workers, are still looking for a \n     place to live.\n       In many states, some local governments have \n     antidiscrimination laws, but they are often weak or poorly \n     enforced, said Ruth Colker, an expert on discrimination law \n     at Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University.\n       ``Typically, the penalty for violating a city ordinance is \n     more akin to a traffic violation,'' she said. ``State-level \n     penalties can be much more significant.''\n       As they push for more state and local safeguards, rights \n     advocates are also starting a long-term campaign for a broad \n     federal shield that would give sexual orientation and gender \n     identity protected status under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n       The goal is to achieve overlapping local, state and federal \n     laws, an approach that has proved effective in curbing other \n     kinds of discrimination, said Sarah Warbelow, legal\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\n     director at the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy \n     group. Visible laws can not only permit lawsuits, she said, \n     but also deter employers and others from biased behavior.\n       Although a majority of states lack such protections, \n     federal orders and court decisions, especially in employment, \n     are gradually offering more safeguards.\n       With executive orders last year, President Obama barred \n     discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \n     identity by federal agencies and federal contractors, \n     including companies employing about one in five American \n     workers, Mr. Sears said.\n       At the same time, the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission, charged with enforcing federal law in the \n     workplace, has determined that discrimination against gay \n     men, lesbians and transgender people amounts to illegal sex \n     discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and \n     it is bringing or endorsing lawsuits under that provision.\n       That application of existing law is still being tested in \n     court and is more established for transgender workers than \n     for gay and lesbian workers. In the past two years, the \n     agency has successfully pursued 223 cases involving gay or \n     transgender people who faced workplace harassment or other \n     discrimination, gaining settlements or court orders, said \n     Chai R. Feldblum, one of the agency's five commissioners.\n       Patricia Dawson of Pangburn, Ark., 46, hopes to join that \n     list. Ms. Dawson, who grew up as Steven, had more than 15 \n     years' experience as an industrial electrician and had been a \n     rising employee at H & H Electric, an industrial contractor, \n     for four years when she informed her boss in 2012 that she \n     was transitioning to female and had changed her name.\n       The boss, she said in a Title VII-based lawsuit brought by \n     the American Civil Liberties Union, told her to keep her \n     plans secret and not to ``rock the boat'' with clients.\n       When her identity became obvious and gossip raged at the \n     work site, she said, the boss said to her, ``I'm sorry, \n     Steve, you do great work, but you are too much of a \n     distraction, and I am going to have to let you go.''\n       Ms. Dawson said she was devastated by her treatment. ``I \n     love what I do; I get the greatest joy out of fixing \n     things,'' she said in an interview. ``Treating us as second-\n     class citizens, it's hurtful.''\n       Civil rights groups worked for years for an employment \n     antidiscrimination act, an effort that was blocked by House \n     Republicans and collapsed this year over discord about \n     religious exemptions. Buoyed by the rapid advance of same-sex \n     marriage, these groups are now determined to seek a far wider \n     law.\n       ``I think there's a very strong consensus now among \n     advocacy groups that we need a broader bill that puts \n     discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \n     identity on the same footing as race, religion and gender,'' \n     said Shannon P. Minter, legal director at the National Center \n     for Lesbian Rights.\n       ``No court decision could accomplish all of that,'' Mr. \n     Minter said.\n       Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said he planned \n     to introduce a bill within the next few months to add \n     protections for gays and transgender people to the Civil \n     Rights Act.\n       ``People are going to realize that you can get married in \n     the morning and be fired from your job or refused entry to a \n     restaurant in the afternoon,'' Mr. Merkley said. ``That is \n     unacceptable.''\n       But the effort will take years, he said, because it appears \n     unlikely that Republican committee heads in Congress will \n     advance such a bill.\n       In the emerging state-by-state battles for \n     antidiscrimination laws, the strongest opposition has come \n     from conservative religious groups that have been alarmed by \n     a few well-publicized cases, like that of a florist in \n     Washington State who was fined for refusing to provide \n     flowers for a same-sex wedding.\n       ``We've got good reason to be concerned about these laws, \n     because they've been found to be coercive where they've been \n     enacted,'' said Greg Scott, vice president of communications \n     at Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal group.\n       Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious \n     Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said \n     that it was wrong to equate religious objections to \n     homosexual behavior with racism, and that proposed \n     antidiscrimination laws could ``do more harm than good.''\n       ``Some have suggested that we work out a compromise, \n     addressing housing and employment discrimination and \n     protecting religious freedom for those who dissent from the \n     ideas of the sexual revolution,'' he said. ``But I have yet \n     to see any proposal that would do both of those things \n     well.''\n       There is some common ground. For example, under the Civil \n     Rights Act, religious organizations have the right to give \n     preference in hiring to those of their faith, Ms. Warbelow of \n     the Human Rights Campaign noted. In housing, federal rules \n     exempt owner-occupied rentals with four or fewer units from \n     discrimination provisions.\n       ``We wouldn't expect these things to change,'' Ms. Warbelow \n     said. ``We really want L.G.B.T. people to be protected the \n     same as those in other protected categories.''\n       But some disagreements, especially involving private \n     businesses, may be unbridgeable. The major gay and civil \n     rights groups are united in their opposition to ``religious \n     liberty'' bills, a priority of conservative Christian \n     advocates, which would allow religious vendors to refuse to \n     serve gay couples or wedding celebrations.\n       ``Religious liberty does not authorize discrimination,'' \n     said James D. Esseks, the director of gay rights issues at \n     the American Civil Liberties Union.\n       ``It's profoundly harmful to walk into a business open to \n     the public and be told, `No, we don't actually serve your \n     kind here,' '' he said. ``That's not how America works.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to join in sponsoring the \nEquality Act.\n  Last month, the Supreme Court ruled on the right side of history by \ndeciding that loving and committed same-sex couples have the right to \nbe married. While same-sex couples now can be legally wed, Federal law \nstill does not protect them from being fired or evicted from their \nhomes on the basis of their sexual identity or gender identity. The \nEquality Act addresses this issue and represents a major step forward \nin protecting the civil rights of all Americans.\n  At the same time we celebrate this historic bill, we must ensure that \nreligious institutions have the right to their own views of marriage. \nAs the Supreme Court noted in its decision, ``it must be emphasized \nthat religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may \ncontinue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine \nprecepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.'' I look forward to \nworking with colleagues to address these issues as the bill advances \nthrough the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1860. A bill to protect and promote international religious \nfreedom; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1860\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Further Independence of \n     Religion for Security and Tolerance Freedom Act of 2015'' or \n     the ``FIRST Freedom Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Many of our Nation's founders fled religious \n     persecution and placed great importance on religious freedom. \n     President George Washington summed up the prevailing view of \n     our founders when he wrote, in 1793, ``in this Land of equal \n     liberty it is our boast, that a man's religious tenets will \n     not forfeit the protection of the Laws''.\n       (2) In 1791, the First Amendment to the Constitution was \n     ratified, enshrining freedom of religion as the ``First \n     Freedom'' of all Americans and becoming an inspiration to \n     people all over the world who struggle to throw off the yoke \n     of religious persecution.\n       (3) Throughout our Nation's history, the United States has \n     sought to protect and promote fundamental human rights, \n     including religious freedom, in the United States and \n     throughout the world.\n       (4) After World War II, under Eleanor Roosevelt's \n     leadership, the United States spearheaded the ratification of \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted at Paris \n     December 10, 1948, which recognized freedom of religion as a \n     fundamental right of all people. Article 18 of that treaty \n     states ``Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, \n     conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to \n     change his religion or belief, and freedom either alone or in \n     community with others and in public or private, to manifest \n     his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and \n     observance.''.\n       (5) The International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, adopted at New York December 16, 1966, and which was \n     ratified by the United States in 1992, states, ``Everyone \n     shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and \n     religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to \n     adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either \n     individually or in community with others and in public or \n     private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, \n     observance, practice and teaching.''.\n       (6) Since the enactment of the International Religious \n     Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292), referred to in this \n     section as ``IRFA'', which established the Department of \n     State's Office on International Religious Freedom, the \n     Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, and \n     the United States Commission on International Religious \n     Freedom (referred to in this section as ``USCIRF''), the \n     state of religious freedom throughout the world has \n     significantly worsened.\n       (7) In section 2(a)(4) of IRFA (2 U.S.C. 6401(a)(4)), \n     Congress stated, ``More than one-half of the world's \n     population lives under regimes that severely restrict of \n     prohibit the freedom of their citizens to study, believe, \n     observe, and freely practice the religious faith of their \n     choice.''.\n       (8) According to ``Rising Tide of Restrictions on \n     Religion,'' the most recent report of\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\n     the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life, \n     three-quarters of the world's population lives in countries \n     in which restrictions on religion were high or very high.\n       (9) According to the 2014 USCIRF Annual Report, ``The past \n     10 years have seen a worsening of the already-poor religious \n     freedom environment in Pakistan, a continued dearth of \n     religious freedom in Turkmenistan, backsliding in Vietnam, \n     rising violations in Egypt before and after the Arab Spring, \n     and Syria's decent [sic] into sectarian civil war with all \n     sides perpetrating egregious religious freedom violations.''.\n       (10) Under section 402 of IRFA (22 U.S.C. 6442), the \n     President is required to designate a country as a country of \n     particular concern (referred to in this section as ``CPC'') \n     if the government of the country has engaged in or tolerated \n     systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of religious \n     freedom.\n       (11) According to the 2015 USCIRF Annual Report, since \n     October 1999, when the first countries were designated as \n     CPCs, ``the list has been largely unchanged. Of the nine \n     countries designated as CPCs in July 2014, most had been \n     named as CPCs for over a decade . . . Since IRFA's inception, \n     only one country has been removed from the State Department's \n     CPC list due to diplomatic activity.'' This track record \n     calls into serious question the utility of the CPC mechanism \n     and the utility of IRFA to improve the state of religious \n     freedom throughout the world.\n       (12) The United States has a long tradition of providing \n     safe haven to refugees, including members of religious \n     minority groups and those fleeing religious persecution. \n     Following the international community's tragic failure to \n     shelter Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi genocide, the United \n     States played a leadership role in establishing the \n     international legal regime for the protection of refugees. \n     Since that time, the American people have generously welcomed \n     millions of refugees fleeing war and totalitarian regimes, \n     and the United States traditionally accepts at least 50 \n     percent of resettlement cases handled by the Office of the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (referred to in \n     this section as ``UNHCR'').\n       (13) According to the 2014 UNHCR Global Trends Report, more \n     than 59,500,000 people were forcibly displaced in 2014--\n       (A) which is equal to 1 displacement for every 122 people \n     worldwide;\n       (B) which is the most displacements in a year in recorded \n     history;\n       (C) including--\n       (i) 38,200,000 individuals who were internally displaced \n     within their own country;\n       (ii) 19,500,000 refugees; and\n       (iii) 1,800,000 asylum-seekers;\n       (D) many of whom were victims of serious human rights \n     violations, including religious persecution; and\n       (E) many are whom are members of vulnerable populations, \n     including religious minorities.\n       (14) The ongoing conflict in Syria has led to the world's \n     worst ongoing humanitarian crisis and worst refugee crisis \n     since World War II. More than 50 percent of Syria's \n     23,000,000 people have been forcibly displaced from their \n     homes and, as of 2015, 20 percent of the world's refugees are \n     Syrians. UNHCR is seeking to resettle 130,000 Syrian refugees \n     during 2015 and 2016, with a particular focus on vulnerable \n     individuals such as religious minorities. Although the United \n     States traditionally accepts at least 50 percent of UNHCR \n     resettlement cases, the United States has only accepted \n     approximately 800 Syrian refugees since the beginning of the \n     Syrian conflict, which is an unacceptably low number.\n       (15) There are several steps that would facilitate the \n     efforts of the United States Government to protect and \n     provide safe haven to refugees from religious persecution. \n     The 2015 USCIRF Annual Report recommends that Congress ``work \n     to provide the President with permanent authority to \n     designate as refugees specifically-defined groups based on \n     shared characteristics identifying them as targets for \n     persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, \n     membership in a particular social group, or political \n     opinion''.\n       (16) The United States Government has limited tools to hold \n     accountable the perpetrators of religious freedom violations. \n     Section 604 of IRFA added section 212(a)(2)(G) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)), \n     which made foreign government officials who commit \n     particularly severe violations of religious freedom \n     inadmissible to the United States, but it has only been \n     applied once, to deny entry to Narendra Modi, who was Chief \n     Minister of Gujarat, India. In its 2015 Annual Report, USCIRF \n     recommends that the State Department: ``Make greater efforts \n     to ensure foreign government officials are denied entry into \n     the United States due to their inadmissibility under U.S. law \n     for their responsibility for religious freedom violations \n     abroad.'' The effectiveness of this law is also limited \n     because it does not apply to non-state actors, such as \n     international terrorists, and it can only be used to deny \n     entry to a perpetrator who has not yet arrived in the United \n     States, not to deport a perpetrator who has already entered \n     the country.\n       (17) In the 2015 USCIRF Annual Report, USCIRF recommended \n     that the United States Government ``should call for or \n     support a referral by the UN Security Council to the \n     International Criminal Court to investigate ISIL violations \n     in Iraq and Syria against religious and ethnic minorities, \n     following the models used in Sudan and Libya, or encourage \n     the Iraqi government to accept ICC jurisdiction to \n     investigate ISIL violations in Iraq after June 2014''. Given \n     the weakness of the international criminal justice system, \n     particularly that an ICC referral is subject to a UN Security \n     Council veto, the United States Government should have the \n     ability to prosecute members of ISIL in United States courts \n     for crimes against humanity, including religious persecution.\n       (18) Under United States law, it is a crime for a non-\n     United States national to commit genocide, torture, \n     terrorism, or several other violations of the law of nations, \n     but it is not a crime under United States law to commit \n     crimes against humanity, including religious persecution. \n     Since the United States Government is unable to prosecute \n     perpetrators of these crimes, many foreign war criminals have \n     found safe haven in this country.\n       (19) In 2006, the United States Government learned that \n     Marko Boskic, a man who participated in the Srebrenica \n     massacre in the Bosnian conflict, was living in \n     Massachusetts. Rather than charging him with crimes against \n     humanity, or religious persecution, Mr. Boskic was charged \n     with visa fraud and sentenced to only 5 years in prison.\n       (20) There is bipartisan agreement about the need for the \n     United States Government to promote and protect international \n     human rights, including religious freedom. USCIRF is, by \n     design, a bipartisan organization, with Commissioners \n     appointed by the President and Congressional leaders. USCIRF \n     can most effectively promote religious freedom on a \n     bipartisan basis.\n       (21) In its 2014 Annual Report entitled ``Additional \n     Opportunities to Reduce Fragmentation, Overlap, and \n     Duplication and Achieve Other Financial Benefits'', which \n     identifies unnecessary duplication in the Federal government, \n     the Government Accountability Office (referred to in this \n     section as ``GAO'')--\n       (A) highlighted the lack of coordination and overlapping \n     missions of USCIRF and the Office of International Religious \n     Freedom in the Department of State;\n       (B) found that ``the lack of a definition regarding how \n     State and the Commission are to interact has sometimes \n     created foreign policy tensions that State has had to \n     mitigate.''; and\n       (C) concluded that the lack of coordination between the \n     USCIRF and the Department of State may undermine the efforts \n     of the United States Government to promote international \n     religious freedom by sending mixed messages to foreign \n     governments and human-rights activists who are fighting to \n     defend religious freedom in their countries.\n       (22) Congress, which is responsible for overseeing the work \n     of USCIRF and ensuring that it is effectively pursuing its \n     mission, should provide greater oversight of USCIRF's \n     practices, including addressing concerns regarding financial \n     irregularities and the work environment for religious \n     minorities.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the protection and promotion of international human \n     rights, including religious freedom, should be an important \n     priority for the United States Government; and\n       (2) the United States Government should pursue new \n     strategies for protecting and promoting religious freedom \n     throughout the world, including--\n       (A) the creation of new tools--\n       (i) to deter and punish the perpetrators of particularly \n     severe violations of religious freedom, including non-state \n     actors; and\n       (ii) to protect the victims of such violations; and\n       (B) increased diplomatic engagement that does not focus \n     primarily on CPC designations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 228\n\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic \n     cancers;\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among women in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2015, approximately 21,290 new cases of ovarian \n     cancer will be diagnosed, and 14,180 women will die of \n     ovarian cancer in the United States;\n       Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not \n     significantly decreased since the ``War on Cancer'' was \n     declared more than 40 years ago;\n       Whereas 25 percent of women will die within 1 year of \n     diagnosis with ovarian cancer and over 50 percent will die \n     within 5 years;\n       Whereas while there is the mammogram to detect breast \n     cancer and the Pap smear to detect cervical cancer, there is \n     no reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas the lack of an early detection test means that \n     approximately 80 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are \n     detected at an advanced stage;\n       Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and \n     approximately 20 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian \n     cancer have a hereditary predisposition to ovarian cancer, \n     which places them at even higher risk;\n       Whereas scientists and physicians have uncovered changes in \n     the BRCA genes that some women inherit from their parents, \n     which may make them 30 times more likely to develop ovarian \n     cancer;\n       Whereas the family history of a woman has been found to \n     play an important role in accurately assessing the risk of \n     that woman of developing ovarian cancer and medical experts \n     believe that family history should be taken into \n     consideration during the annual well woman visit of any \n     woman;\n       Whereas many experts in health prevention now recommend \n     genetic testing for young women with a family history of \n     breast and ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas women who know they are at high risk of breast and \n     ovarian cancer may undertake prophylactic measures to help \n     reduce the risk of developing these diseases;\n       Whereas the Society of Gynecologic Oncology now recommends \n     that all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer receive \n     counseling and genetic testing;\n       Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of \n     ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal \n     pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary \n     symptoms, and several other symptoms that are easily confused \n     with other diseases;\n       Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by \n     women and health care providers can lead to a quicker \n     diagnosis;\n       Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus \n     statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to provide \n     consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier for \n     women to learn and remember the symptoms; and\n       Whereas each year during the month of September, the \n     Ovarian Cancer National Alliance and partner members hold a \n     number of events to increase public awareness of ovarian \n     cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2015 as ``National Ovarian Cancer \n     Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Ovarian \n     Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/23/senate-section/article/S5537-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 229--DESIGNATING JULY 26, 2015, AS ``UNITED STATES \n                    INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS DAY''\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Burr, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nBlunt, Mr. Risch, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kaine, Mr. King, Mr. Rubio, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Cotton, and Ms. Hirono) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 229\n\n       Whereas on July 26, 1908, Attorney General Charles \n     Bonaparte ordered newly-hired Federal investigators to report \n     to the Office of the Chief Examiner of the Department of \n     Justice, which subsequently was renamed the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation;\n       Whereas on July 26, 1947, President Truman signed the \n     National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), \n     creating the Department of Defense, the National Security \n     Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, thereby laying the foundation for today's \n     intelligence community;\n       Whereas the National Security Act of 1947, which appears in \n     title 50 of the United States Code, governs the definition, \n     composition, responsibilities, authorities, and oversight of \n     the intelligence community of the United States;\n       Whereas the intelligence community is defined by section \n     3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)) \n     to include the Office of the Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \n     Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \n     National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National \n     Reconnaissance Office, other offices within the Department of \n     Defense for the collection of specialized national \n     intelligence through reconnaissance programs, the \n     intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, \n     the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the \n     Department of Energy, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research \n     of the Department of State, the Office of Intelligence and \n     Analysis of the Department of the Treasury, the elements of \n     the Department of Homeland Security concerned with the \n     analysis of intelligence information, and other elements as \n     may be designated;\n       Whereas July 26, 2015, is the 68th anniversary of the \n     signing of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 \n     et seq.);\n       Whereas the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 118 Stat. 3638) created the \n     position of the Director of National Intelligence to serve as \n     the head of the intelligence community and to ensure that \n     national intelligence be timely, objective, independent of \n     political considerations, and based upon all sources \n     available;\n       Whereas Congress has previously passed joint resolutions, \n     signed by the President, to designate Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day on May 15, Patriot Day on September 11, and other \n     commemorative occasions, to honor the sacrifices of law \n     enforcement officers and of those who lost their lives on \n     September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas the United States has increasingly relied upon the \n     men and women of the intelligence community to protect and \n     defend the security of the United States in the decade since \n     the attacks of September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community, \n     both civilian and military, have been increasingly called \n     upon to deploy to theaters of war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \n     elsewhere since September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas numerous intelligence officers of the elements of \n     the intelligence community have been injured or killed in the \n     line of duty;\n       Whereas intelligence officers of the United States are \n     routinely called upon to accept personal hardship and \n     sacrifice in the furtherance of their mission to protect the \n     United States, to undertake dangerous assignments in the \n     defense of the interests of the United States, to collect \n     reliable information within prescribed legal authorities upon \n     which the leaders of the United States rely in life-and-death \n     situations, and to ``speak truth to power.'' by providing \n     their best assessments to decision makers, regardless of \n     political and policy considerations;\n       Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community \n     have on numerous occasions succeeded in preventing attacks \n     upon the United States and allies of the United States, \n     saving numerous innocent lives; and\n       Whereas intelligence officers of the United States must of \n     necessity often remain unknown and unrecognized for their \n     substantial achievements and successes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates July 26, 2015, as ``United States \n     Intelligence Professionals Day'';\n       (2) acknowledges the courage, fidelity, sacrifice, and \n     professionalism of the men and women of the intelligence \n     community of the United States;
