Mr. President, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct is one of the most bipartisan pieces of legislation one could \npossibly imagine. Ever since this bipartisan human rights bill was \nintroduced by a Democrat and a Republican in January and made publicly \navailable for any person to read, Members of both parties have sung its \npraises repeatedly. This bipartisan bill has gained the support of 13 \nDemocratic cosponsors.\n  Recently, Democrats voted unanimously to approve it in committee. \nThis week Democrats consented unanimously to advance it on the floor. \nEven the Democratic leader himself said he ``underscore[d], \nappreciate[d], and agree[d]'' with my call to pass this bipartisan \nlegislation overwhelmingly. ``I doubt there will be problems on my \nside,'' he said. ``If there are, I will work to clear them.''\n  That was Monday.\n  By Tuesday, Democrats seemed to be threatening to filibuster human \nrights legislation for abused and neglected victims and children. Let \nme repeat that. Democrats are now threatening to filibuster human \nrights legislation for abused and neglected victims and children. So \nwhy?\n  Democrats now say they don't like language that has been in the bill \nsince it was introduced months ago that does nothing more than reaffirm \nthe bipartisan law of the land. That is all that language does. This \nbipartisan provision was on page 4 of this modest-sized bill, so \nDemocrats obviously knew it was there to begin with. Democrats \nobviously wouldn't have cosponsored the bill or voted for it in \ncommittee or called for passage on the floor if they hadn't read the \nbill first.\n  These Democrats surely don't want to see more quotes such as this one \nfrom an official with the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women. She \nsaid: ``Senate Democrats are choosing a phantom problem over real \nvictims.''\n  So if these Democrats keep their word to the victims of human \ntrafficking, then a partisan filibuster attempt will fail \noverwhelmingly. If these Democrats keep their word to the vulnerable \nand the oppressed, then the Senate will pass a bipartisan human rights \nbill.\n  But if these Democrats truly are having second thoughts about \nsupporting such important human rights legislation, they are free to \noffer an amendment. But let's not filibuster bipartisan help for \nvulnerable victims just to make a point for leftwing special interest \ngroups.\n  Our Democratic friends have to resist the siren song of their \npollsters who tell them that the path to victory lies in turning \nbipartisan bills into manufactured fights over cultural issues. \nAmericans are looking for statesmen and stateswomen on the Democratic \nside to stand up--stand up--and help us emancipate the victims of \nmodern slavery, not score another empty political point.\n  So I am calling on these Democrats to help us do that. Help is almost \nthere for the vulnerable victims of these awful crimes. Surely no \nleftwing special interest group is more important than fighting modern-\nday slavery. So\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nthe Democratic cosponsors and declared supporters of this bill need to \nkeep working with us in a bipartisan way to ensure that help comes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1452-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A collective \n     ``Seriously?'' has emerged in reaction to the open letter \n     that 47 Republicans penned to the Iranian leadership, which \n     seemed designed to undercut nuclear talks with the Obama \n     administration.\n\n  Here are some of the things they said:\n  ``A blot on 114th U.S. Senate,'' from the Detroit Free Press.\n  ``The Senators who signed the letter should be ashamed,'' said the \nPittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n  Some sounded embarrassed.\n  ``Cringe-worthy buffoonery on the global stage,'' says the Salt Lake \nTribune.\n  Others seemed just weary of Capitol Hill's continuing dysfunction.\n  ``Has Congress gone crazy?'' wondered the Courier-Journal in \nLouisville, KY.\n  Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois ``has not been among the crazies in \nCongress, particularly on foreign policy matters. But he joined them \nhere,'' wrote the Peoria Journal Star.\n  Noting her signature endorsing the letter, the Concord Monitor said \nof New Hampshire Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte:\n  ``It's not every day that a United States senator attempts to \nundermine U.S. foreign policy and weaken the nation in one cursive \nswoop.''\n  In Phoenix, AZ, the Arizona Republic editorial board concluded that \nthe Republican Senators ``are effectively declaring a congressional \nright to conduct subversive foreign policy proxy wars with the \npresident, with threats to blow up agreement negotiations as their \nweapon of choice.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1452-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the last Congress legislation to combat \nhuman trafficking was a bipartisan matter. Senators Klobuchar and Leahy \nhave long been leaders on this issue. But this year--and we could talk \nabout how it got in the bill, many believe it was sleight of hand--\nthere is an abortion provision in this bill that is now before this \nbody.\n  For well more than 25 years I had the pleasure of serving with Henry \nHyde in the House of Representatives, who was famous for a number of \nreasons, but one is that he has penned the Hyde language which deals \nwith abortion. In all these 25-plus years, that matter has been put \nover 1 year at a time. We have never chosen to make that permanent law.\n  This year Republicans have sought to inject into this consensus bill \none of the most controversial issues of the last 40 years--a woman's \nright to choose.\n  Don't take my word for it. Leading Republicans acknowledge that \nabortion politics is extraneous to the bill before us.\n  Yesterday John Cornyn said: ``This bill is being hijacked and being \nused to debate something that it really doesn't have very much to do \nabout, and that is the subject of abortion.''\n  Orrin Hatch said: ``I can't believe that this Senate has become so \npolitical that we would raise that issue at this time on this bill.''\n  The solution is so simple. Take the abortion language out of the \nbill.\n  The bill dealing with human trafficking is going to pass. If we don't \ndo it now, we will do it. It is something that is imperative that we \naccomplish, but it should not be dealt with in relation to abortion. \nTake the abortion language out of the bill.\n  The Republican Senators have a choice, to legislate or to hijack the \nlegislation. If they want to get something done, they need to take \nabortion politics out of this bill. If they want to leave abortion \npolitics in the bill, then the Republicans will only continue this \nsession's record of dysfunction.\n  This is the second day my friend, the Republican leader, has come to \nthe floor and quoted something I said a few days ago. Every word he \nquotes is perfect--that is what I said--but here is the context in \nwhich I said it. I am an expert on motions to proceed. During the last \n6 years I have had to file cloture as a leader here hundreds and \nhundreds of times--in the last Congress more than 200 times. Virtually \nall of the cloture motions were filed because Republicans wouldn't let \nus get on the bill. They simply wouldn't let us get on the bill--every \nbill--even bills they favored. We would have to spend a couple of days \ngetting it ripe for a vote on cloture, and once that was done, then we \nhad to wait 30 hours. What I said the other day is true, human \ntrafficking is something that needs to get done, and we Democrats are \nnot going to ask you, the Republican leadership, to file abortion \nlanguage. Get on the bill. And we are on the bill. We could finish this \nbill in 20 minutes. The only thing that needs to be done is the \nlanguage relating to abortion should come out of this bill. Abortion \nand human trafficking have nothing to do with each other.\n  So my friend the Republican leader can come and quote me any time he \nwants, and I know he will quote me correctly, but it should be put in \nthe proper context, and that context is this: We have proven during the \nfirst few months of this Congress that on issues that we believe should \nbe debated, we will allow the Senate to get on the bill. We are not \ngoing to be stalling, as has been done for the last 6 years, just to \nkill time. We are on this human trafficking legislation because it is \nsomething that needs to be completed, and the only way at this stage it \nis going to happen is the abortion language must come out of the bill.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1452-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my amendment \nto the Justice for Victims of Trafficking bill that would make a minor \nbut nevertheless important commonsense update to the current \ntelecommunications law to provide law enforcement with access to \ninformation that should and could help locate individuals in life-or-\ndeath situations. My amendment--identical to the stand-alone \nlegislation I plan to reintroduce later this month--is aptly named \nafter the young Kansan whose life and bright future was cut short by a \nsenseless act of violence and whose case is the inspiration for why we \ndesperately need to update this law.\n  Almost 8 years ago. On June 2, 2007, 18-year-old Kansan Kelsey \nSmith--a lovely girl--was abducted in broad daylight from an Overland \nPark, KS, parking lot. Kelsey's abduction was captured on the closed \ncircuit camera, therefore leaving little doubt of the emergency \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\n  Here is the tragedy. Four days after Kelsey disappeared, authorities \nwere finally able to locate her body after her wireless provider \nreleased the ``ping'' or call location information from her cell phone. \nIt took 4 days to get that vital information. Providing this \ninformation as fast as possible is absolutely critical to ensure law \nenforcement officials can rescue victims in imminent danger of death or \nserious physical harm and hopefully prevent future cases similar to \nKelsey's.\n  This amendment is a culmination of years of work between legislatures \nat both the Federal and State level, industry stakeholders, private \nadvocates and, most importantly, Kelsey's brave parents who spearheaded \nthis initiative and advocated to create commonsense reforms that \nproperly balance the needs of law enforcement with the Fourth Amendment \nprotections of all citizens.\n  Through their advocacy and tireless efforts, Missey and Greg Smith \nhave helped enact laws in 17 States, including my home State of Kansas, \nto provide law enforcement with the necessary tools to rescue \nindividuals in emergency situations where the threat of death or \nserious bodily injury is imminent.\n  The impact of this law at the State level has been real and \nmeasurable. For example, in May of 2012, 1 month after the enactment of \nthe State's version of the Kelsey Smith Act, local authorities in \nTennessee were successful in saving the life of a child who had been \nabducted by a suspected child rapist. Because the child was believed to \nbe in imminent danger, police were able to receive the location of the \nsuspect's cell phone in a window of time that led to the safe recovery \nof the child alive and before she was assaulted.\n  According to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the first \n3 hours are critical to recovering a child alive. This is why it is \nnecessary that in these few isolated instances where a person's very \nlife is at stake, an exemption should be made to release the \nwhereabouts of that individual. Understanding this, my amendment would \nprovide law enforcement with the ability to recover the location of \nchildren and other missing individuals in only very specific emergency \nsituations, namely when there is risk of death or serious bodily \ninjury, but in order to obtain the location, law enforcement must first \nprovide a sworn written statement to the telecommunications providers \nstating the facts that support probable cause to believe that \ndisclosure of the location is required to prevent death or serious \nbodily injury. Furthermore, 48 hours after the location is disclosed to \nlaw enforcement, they must request a court order stating whether such \nagency had probable cause to believe the facts surrounding the rescue \nor recovery were warranted.\n  The privacy of every Kansan, and every American for that matter, is \nextremely important and that is why my amendment includes this language \nto put into place safeguards against possible abuses of authority by \nlaw enforcement. I believe my amendment strikes the appropriate balance \nbetween the ability for law enforcement to help individuals in grave \ndanger while also ensuring that proper checks are in place to guard \nagainst any overreach by the government.\n  Kelsey was never given the opportunity to attend college or get \nmarried or have children and experience the American dream that many of \nus take for granted every day, but what she did do was inspire her \nmother and father to make it their mission in life to help educate and \nempower communities and children to help prevent another case like this \nfrom happening again.\n  Kelsey's father, Greg, a former law enforcement officer himself and a \nKansas State Senator representing parts of Johnson County, said it best \nwhen he quoted Abraham Lincoln to describe what Kelsey had \naccomplished: ``In the end, it's not the years in your life that \ncounts. It's the life in your years.''\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to speak on the floor \ntoday, and I would have liked to have offered my commonsense amendment \nthat would help prevent tragedies like Kelsey's, so I ask every \ncolleague in this body to ask one question: If it were your child, your \ngrandchild, your spouse, would you not want law enforcement to have \nimmediate access to this information?\n  Let's honor Kelsey's memory by passing this legislation whether it is \nstand-alone legislation or in amendment form. I had every intention to \nask for a vote on my amendment. I believe I would have had my \ncolleagues' support on both sides of the aisle. This legislation is \nlong overdue and so is the trafficking bill.\n  At this time we are grateful for those who use their abilities and \nskills in ways that promote justice and goodwill in our land and to \npromoting the good of every citizen. That is, unfortunately, not \nhappening at this time. We have objections from the minority over a \nprovision that has been in law for 36 years.\n  This is delay again for Kelsey Smith and amendments such as mine that \nI think have bipartisan support. In this regard I am frustrated, and I \nthink it is shameful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  It would appear to the Senator from Kansas that there is not a \nquorum.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Mr. President, I am proud to join several of my \ncolleagues this morning in submitting a substitute amendment to the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015.\n  Human trafficking is a global scourge, and we should be working on a \nbipartisan basis and on a bicameral basis to stop it. However, I am \ndeeply concerned to learn that our friends on the other side of the \naisle have inserted a worrisome provision into this year's version of \nthe bill. This provision would expand upon the so-called Hyde amendment \nwhich restricts funds for women's reproductive health choices. The new \nlanguage, which has been offered by Senator Cornyn from Texas, would \nset a new, dangerous precedent by enabling Hyde restrictions to apply \nto nontax funding streams set forth in this bill.\n\n  This language paves the way for political leaders in the future to \ninterfere even more with a woman's basic personal health decisions, and \nit sets the tone for a dramatic expansion of abortion restriction for \nyears to come.\n  I am upset about this provision in that it shouldn't be in this bill. \nThis bill is not about abortion, it is about human trafficking. \nInstead, this provision has now become another opportunity for \npolitical speeches and delay.\n  The good news is the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act can still \nbe bipartisan, and we have high hopes it will be. Democrats are ready \nto work with Republicans to fix this bill and move past the partisan \nobstacle which literally stopped us this week from doing anything.\n  The substitute amendment removes the Hyde restrictions from the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It includes two important \nbipartisan pieces of legislation, the Runaway and Homeless Youth and \nTrafficking Prevention Act, originally offered by Senator Leahy, and \nthe Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act sponsored by Senator \nKlobuchar.\n  We know that colleagues can work on a bipartisan basis to effectively \naddress this issue. I urge my colleagues, when we look at what we have \ndone so far in this session of Congress, we have very little to show \nfor the time we have spent here. This is an opportunity to pass a \nbipartisan human trafficking bill--not a grab bag for every notion or \nidea any Senator has on any subject, but one that addresses a very \nserious issue.\n  I also know that another Senator from Louisiana on the Republican \nside has an amendment which he wishes to offer on this bill which, \nagain, has nothing to do with human trafficking.\n  Senator Vitter offers an amendment that would deny citizenship at \nbirth to children born in the United States unless one of the parents \nof the child is a U.S. citizen, national permanent resident, or an \nactively serving armed services member.\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\n  As the ranking member of the constitution subcommittee on the \nJudiciary Committee, let me begin with the obvious for my colleagues in \nthe Senate: Birthright citizenship is a constitutional right. Congress \ncan't amend that amendment with a statute. I would think that every \nSenator knows that. To put this provision before us is merely to try to \nprovoke a debate on a bill which has no impact on the Constitution.\n  The citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment states: ``All persons \nborn or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the \njurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the \nstate wherein they reside.''\n  I urge my colleagues, particularly the one offering this amendment, \nto pick up the Constitution and read it. The 14th Amendment is as clear \nas can be.\n  The citizenship clause has been restated and established by four \ncenturies of Anglo-American jurisprudence. The 14th Amendment raised \nthe short-lived exception to birthright citizenship that was \nestablished by the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857. We certainly \nremember that. It was one of the provocations that led to a civil war \nin this country. We should take this issue extremely seriously.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the 14th Amendment \napplies to U.S.-born children of noncitizens. What part of that does \nthe author of this amendment not understand?\n  The Court rejected arguments that the son of Chinese nationals, who \nwere forbidden under the Chinese Exclusion Act from ever becoming U.S. \ncitizens, could be deprived of citizenship because of his parents' \nstatus.\n  The Supreme Court ruled that: ``Nothing is better settled at the \ncommon law than the doctrine that the children, even of aliens . . . \nare subjects at birth.'' Subsequent decisions have backed that up.\n  The famous case of Plyer v. Doe basically said--the Court reasoned \nthat even if the Court wanted to control the conduct of adults, \n``legislation directing the onus of the parent's misconduct against his \nchildren does not comport with fundamental concepts of justice.'' The \nlaw is clear.\n  So this amendment being offered by Senator Vitter is a provocative, \nunnecessary, and basically feckless effort to stall an important bill \nthat should be passed on a bipartisan basis.\n  I hope my colleagues, whatever their feelings on this issue, will \nunderstand, you cannot amend the Constitution by a statute. I thought \nthat was in basic Senate 101, but we have to get back to it to make \nclear that my colleagues understand this important human trafficking \nbill should not be bogged down or stopped with issues such as \nabortion--as important as it is--which should be saved for a separate \ndebate, or this effort to amend the U.S. Constitution with an amendment \non the floor to a statute. That certainly is not a good way for us to \naccomplish things in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1454-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1454-S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FOR-PROFIT SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been coming to this floor for a \nlong time. The Presiding Officer is new to the body so I know he has \nbeen spared my speeches on the subject talking about for-profit \ncolleges.\n  This is an industry that lures students with flashy ads and \nmisleading promises, gobbles up the Federal loan and grant money these \nstudents can bring to them and then ends up producing students--if they \nare lucky enough to get a diploma--who can't find good-paying jobs. To \nunderstand the for-profit college industry in America today, you only \nneed to know three numbers--and for those who are listening, this will \nbe on the final. Here are the three numbers: For-profit colleges enroll \nten percent of college students in the United States of America. When \nyou think of for-profit colleges, think of University of Phoenix, \nDeVry, Kaplan. There are a lot of them. Ten percent of college students \ngo to these schools.\n  These schools, the for-profit schools, receive 20 percent of the \nFederal aid to education.\n  Why do they get so much if they only have 10 percent of the students? \nThey charge so much. Their tuition goes through the roof. Ten percent \nof the students, 20 percent of the Federal aid to education. But this \nis the number I don't want you to forget--44.\n  Forty-four percent of all student loan defaults are students of for-\nprofit schools. What does that tell us? It tells us these students are \ngetting in over their heads. They are borrowing too much money. It \ntells us these students are dropping out and unable to pay their loans \nor end up with a worthless diploma and can't find a job.\n  How can the Senate stand back and say this is acceptable? For-profit \ncolleges are the most heavily subsidized private companies in America \ntoday--the most heavily subsidized.\n  In the home State of the Presiding Officer and mine, we have some \nfarmers. Our farmers get kicked around a little bit about all of the \nFederal money they receive. Our farmers don't hold a candle to the for-\nprofit colleges and universities.\n  These folks have turned siphoning money out of the Federal Treasury \ninto an art form. The money they pay the CEOs who engineer these \narrangements is in the millions of dollars each year, all Federal \ndollars, virtually all, 90, 95 percent of Federal dollars. How can you \ncall yourself a private, for-profit company, when 80 to 90 percent of \nyour money is coming directly from the Federal Government?\n  As a matter of fact, this industry, the for-profit college industry, \nif we took the money we spent in subsidies to these schools, would be \nthe ninth largest Federal agency in Washington.\n  Yet many flinty conservatives who hate subsidies and hate deficits \nlook the other way: Oh, it is a private company--10 percent of the \nstudents, 20 percent of the aid in Federal education, 44 percent of all \nthe student loan defaults--and they are getting 80 to 90 percent from \nthe Federal Treasury and we are supposed to look the other way?\n  From time to time, students come and sit in our galleries. Many of \nthem are soon to graduate from high school. They will be inundated by \nthese for-profit schools.\n  As soon as you reach a certain age, you can't log onto your computer \nwithout these schools roaring at you about the great deals they have to \noffer. I took a look back in recent memory. They actually ran an ad \nbefore the Presiding Officer was elected, and it was an ad that was on \nlocal television here. It showed a very attractive young lady in her \npajamas, lounging on her bed, and she had her laptop computer. She said \nin this ad: I am going to college in my pajamas. I am going to a for-\nprofit college--I don't even have to get out of my pajamas, I can go to \ncollege.\n  That is a bad joke, and unfortunately too many people are lured into \nthis belief: I can just log on and get a degree. Well, it turns out \nmany times it is too darned expensive--and it is worthless, if you ever \nget it.\n  The stories that come to my office of young people who signed up for \nthese for-profit schools and ended up with more debt than they could \never possibly imagine are horrifying. Imagine a 30-year-old woman in \nthe suburbs of Chicago with over $100,000 in debt and a worthless \ndegree from Westwood College, one of the for-profit colleges in the \nChicagoland area.\n  She watched all these crime shows on television, and they told her \nshe could go into law enforcement with this degree. She spent 5 years, \nover $100,000 in debt, and not a single law enforcement agency in the \nChicagoland area would recognize that degree.\n  Was she ever told that along the way with all those fancy ads? Never. \nSo I say to students: Think twice about these for-profit schools.\n  But I want to say a word about one particular instance that bothers \nme a lot. Corinthian was one of the largest--most people didn't know \nCorinthian as a for-profit school, but they knew some of the schools \nthat were involved in it. Everest Colleges were owned by Corinthian.\n  Well, it turned out that Corinthian ran into a problem. Corinthian \nColleges was falsifying information they gave to the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government asked Corinthian Colleges, as it \nasks all of these other for-profit colleges: How many of your students \nget jobs after they graduate?\n  Corinthian was falsifying the students getting jobs. In fact, \nCorinthian had this arrangement with many companies. They would give \nthem $1,000 and say: Can you hire our graduates for a month? You can \nlet them go, but hire\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nthem after graduation for a month or two, and we will give you some \nmoney to do it. The companies went along with that, subsidized \nemployees, then they let the employees go.\n  Then Corinthian would report to the Federal Government: our graduates \nare working.\n  Well, when we called them on it and they couldn't produce the real \ninformation, Corinthian stock started plummeting and eventually went \nout of business. It was more than 1 year ago that I wrote to the \nDepartment of Education asking them to investigate Corinthian Colleges \nabout falsifying job placement rates. It was originally reported by the \nHuffington Post. According to the Department, they looked into it. \nCorinthian was, in fact, lying, falsifying placement rates and creating \nattendance records at several of its institutions. Corinthian would use \ninflated placement rates to lure other unsuspecting students into the \nschool. After the Department of Education placed financial sanctions on \nthe company and delayed their title IV disbursements, Corinthian \nreported they didn't have enough cash flow and would have to close.\n  That is exactly what would have happened. Unfortunately, the \nDepartment of Education kept the school afloat even after this, \nshoveling hundreds of millions of dollars to the failed Corinthian \ncompany, allowing it to continue advertising and signing up students. \nAt a point when private investors were jumping ship, the Department of \nEducation was jumping in. Now, in a transaction blessed by the \nDepartment of Education, most of the former Corinthian campuses have \nbeen sold to ECMC.\n  This is a corporation that has served historically as a debt \ncollector for the Department of Education. This is one of the companies \nthat goes after students when they are not paying their student loans. \nNow this debt collection agency is going to own one of these for-profit \ncolleges, what is left of Corinthian.\n  We are told this new debt collection university will operate as a \nnot-for-profit entity. That was enticing, and I thought, well, at least \nthey are not in the for-profit world. Despite being a not-for-profit \ncompany in name at least, I am troubled that ECMC is already--just \nweeks into owning and operating these schools--failing to live up to \nthe promises they made to the students and to me.\n  This is an example. I wrote ECMC's head, David Hawn, in December, \nasking him to discontinue Corinthian's use of mandatory arbitration \nclauses as part of the school's enrollment agreement. What are these \nclauses? These clauses, signed by students, take away the rights of \nstudents to bring grievances before a court. And once students end up \nin arbitration proceedings, they find the rules stacked against them \nand in favor of the corporate players.\n  The associations that represent not-for-profit schools have informed \nme that their member schools do not use these mandatory arbitration \nclauses. These clauses are essentially only used by companies in the \nfor-profit college sector. I told Mr. Hawn if he was truly going to run \na not-for-profit institution, he should follow the clear model of \nnonprofit education--no mandatory arbitration clauses for students.\n\n  In his response to me, Mr. Hawn certainly said the right thing. He \ntold me that ECMC had ``eliminated Corinthian's policy of binding \nmandatory arbitration.''\n  The reason this is important is that if a student has been defrauded, \nand they signed one of these mandatory arbitration clauses, they can \nnever get their case and their facts before an impartial jury or judge. \nIt is going to be decided in an arbitration hearing instead.\n  Mr. Hawn summed up their policy and the issue as follows:\n\n       Bottom line: We believe that students have an unquestioned \n     right to seek redress for grievances, including the right to \n     file a lawsuit. We will not stand in the way of any student \n     who wants to pursue litigation based on his or her personal \n     experience.\n\n  It couldn't have been stated more clearly and better. It meant that \nthis debt collection company that is taking over the failing for-profit \nschool is saying that we are truly not-for-profit and we are truly \ngoing to play this on the square. If students feel they have been \ntreated unfairly, they have every legal right to go to court so they do \nnot end up with tens of thousands of debt because we defrauded them.\n  I felt pretty good about that response. Well, then we read the fine \nprint. We found out that ECMC uses a combination of carrots and sticks \nto try to keep students out of court. First, ECMC's new enrollment \ndocument requires students to irrevocably waive their right to seek a \ntrial by jury and waive their ability to join any class action lawsuit \nagainst the school.\n  That isn't what Mr. Hawn told me was going to happen. In other words, \nstudents who were wronged by ECMC have to challenge the school alone. \nThey have to stand by themselves, and they can't make a court case in \nfront of a jury.\n  Then there are carrots. ECMC's enrollment agreement does everything \nit can to scare students into arbitration. They offer to pay half the \ncost of a student's filing fee for arbitration if--and only if--the \nstudent waives his or her right to appeal the arbitrator's decision to \ncourt or bring a lawsuit against the school. And if a student \ndemonstrates hardship, for example, because the student is saddled with \nenormous student loan debt and no job, ECMC will offer to pay the \nentire arbitration filing fee but, again, only if the student will \nforfeit their right to bring a lawsuit, which means the arbitrator's \ndecision becomes binding.\n  I see another colleague of mine on the floor, and I know she wants to \nmake a statement, so I will wrap up here.\n  Meanwhile, Corinthian executives seem to be off the hook. They have \nfaded into obscurity. They took millions of dollars in Federal \nsubsidies, they lured students into worthless schools, and the students \nended up with the debt and worthless diplomas. They falsified the \nresults of their activities to the Federal Government. Then they \nbasically went bankrupt, took their million dollar salaries, and faded \naway. What is left behind? How about all the students with all the debt \nfor the worthless courses at the worthless school?\n  That is the reality of the for-profit college industry, and \nCorinthian is exhibit A. It doesn't appear that any prosecution of \nthese individuals who ran Corinthian into the ditch is likely. They \nhave literally taken their money, and they are off to some other \npursuit. Maybe they are looking for some new Federal subsidy that can \nmake them rich. But the former students are left with worthless \neducations and more debt than they can ever repay--students such as \nDawn Thompson from my State of Illinois.\n  Dawn has a parallel degree from Everest--part of Corinthian--but \nnever ever could find a job in her field. She has over $100,000 in \nstudent loan debt to become a parallel. How about that? She has Federal \nand private loans. After graduating, she was working a minimum-wage job \nnow as a bank teller. She tried to file for bankruptcy a couple of \nyears ago and--you guessed it--student loan debt is not dischargeable \nin bankruptcy. Dawn, it is with you for your lifetime. It is one of the \nfew debts that are not dischargeable.\n  Dawn Thompson thought at that point her only option was to go back to \nschool. She went back to Everest, the original school she went to. She \nthought that getting a master's degree from Everest would make a \ndifference. It did. Her student loan debt went from $100,000 to \n$170,000. She is still struggling to find a job.\n  How can we stand by and let this happen? How can the Federal \nGovernment recognize these as real schools? How can we allow students \nto be misled into believing these are real colleges and universities? \nHow can we continue to give these outrageous scandalous subsidies to \nthese worthless companies where the CEOs are taking out millions of \ndollars?\n  It is time for us to do something about this. Shame on us if we sit \nhere and make speeches about how bad the deficit is and how much we \ncare about struggling students and ignore the obvious. For-profit \ncolleges and universities as an industry are basically an industry that \nneeds to be thoroughly investigated, carefully monitored, and most of \ntheir players need to go out of business--and not at the expense of the \nstudents.\n  We are talking about 10 percent of students, 20 percent of the \nFederal aid to education, and 44 percent of student loan defaults from \nfor-profit colleges\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nand universities. It is time for the Senate, when it reauthorizes the \nHigher Education Act, to change this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1456-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nwhat I believe may be one of the most critical pieces of legislation to \naddress human trafficking in the United States, and that is the piece \nof legislation authored by Senator Leahy--the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth and Trafficking Prevention Act.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and to add my name \nto the amendment Senator Leahy submitted yesterday that adds this \nimportant piece of legislation to this current debate.\n  Senator Leahy, as we all know, has been a tireless advocate for \nhomeless and runaway youth and for LGBT individuals and for victims of \nhuman trafficking. His bill would provide the necessary services and \nadditional protections for all of these young children. So I thank \nSenator Leahy again for his continued work on behalf of some of our \nmost vulnerable--our runaway and homeless youth.\n  As a former attorney general, I certainly believe that additional \ntools need to be made available to prosecutors so they can prosecute \ntraffickers and johns and that we need to intervene and provide \nrecovery services for victims. I think that need has never been \ngreater. But why I am speaking today on this legislation is because it \ngoes to that critical element of prevention. It supports those who are \nmost susceptible to human trafficking, and that is our runaway and \nhomeless youth.\n  Preventing one of the most vulnerable segments of our population from \nfalling prey to this modern-day slavery should be one of the top \npriorities of this Nation. When we talk about trafficking, frequently \npeople think these are young girls who may be coming into our country \nin containers or are trafficked from elsewhere. But we know that over \n80 percent of the people trafficked, especially in the sex trade in \nthis country, are citizens of our country. They are our children. They \nare American children. So we cannot simply put a face on this that \ndoesn't recognize that American children are being trafficked.\n  Who among these children are the most vulnerable? It is runaway and \nhomeless youth. So it is our responsibility to do everything we can to \nprevent those children from being in a place where they are \nextraordinarily vulnerable.\n  We have heard some people say they do not believe that homeless and \nrunaway youth are more susceptible to being trafficked and that we \nshouldn't single out special services for LGBT youth. I don't believe \nthat, and I know better, because I have been to facilities that provide \nservices for runaway and homeless youth. I don't believe people who say \nthis have ever spoken to the social workers and the professionals who \ndeal with these children every day.\n  I don't believe people who say that understand that runaway and \nhomeless youth, unfortunately, have been, more than likely, already \nsexually and physically abused or told every day they are worthless or \ntold that because of who they are, they are no longer welcome in their \nhome. And when you diminish the spirit of a child, you then create a \nvulnerability in that child to be a target for traffickers.\n  A lot of people also think this is just a big-city problem. Well, let \nme tell you some of the stories of North Dakota. Just last June, a 13-\nyear-old runaway from Minneapolis was rescued and her traffickers were \narrested in Fargo-Moorhead. Police believe the traffickers were more \nthan likely on their way out to our oil patch with the victim, and they \nstopped over in Fargo-Moorhead to make a little cash by selling these \nchildren in the Fargo-Moorhead area. This is a story we hear over and \nover again--the vulnerability of children, the trafficking of children \ninto the oil patch in western North Dakota.\n  In fact, talking to the experts who track advertising of young \nchildren, whether it is in the deep or dark Net or whether it is in \nthings such as backpage, they will tell you the spike in trafficking \nand ads in western North Dakota alarms them and should alarm us. So \nthis is not a big-city problem. We know this is a problem that affects \nNorth Dakota. If traffickers are willing to snatch up a runaway in the \nTwin Cities and bring them out to North Dakota, you can be sure they \nare trying to prey on this vulnerable population in North Dakota as \nwell.\n  This is personal for me. I know a lot about this topic because my \nsister works in this area, and I have spent a lot of time with her \nstaff. They are the largest agency in North Dakota serving runaway and \nhomeless youth populations in Fargo-Moorhead. I have heard stories of \nhow vulnerable these children are. I have heard them tell stories about \nhow the trafficking victims, with whom they have already worked, are \nsometimes recruited by those bold enough to try to cycle through \nwaiting rooms where they are waiting for these kids.\n  I have heard the stories of guys waiting just down the block or in \nparking lots of shelters to snatch up these kids. Also I have heard \nstories of how once a young child is involved in this, they then become \nrecruiters of other young runaway children.\n  These stories are why it is so imperative to take action. And we can \ntake action here in the Senate. We can take action by taking up the \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking Prevention Act. This bill \nreauthorizes vital programs that provide short-term shelter for youth \nwho do not have a place to sleep--imagine that: youth, our children, do \nnot have a place to sleep; crisis interventions and referrals to youth \non the street and at drop-in centers--a hand up: we will take you and \nwe will help you recover from whatever has happened in your life; long-\nterm residential services; training and education; and employment \nsupport to help get these kids off the street and permanently provide a \nsafe and secure path forward.\n\n  Importantly, this bill makes sure that LGTB runaway and homeless \nyouth are not discriminated against when it comes to providing \nresources and services. We can have an opinion about this, but we all \nknow that no human should be subjected to those kinds of conditions, \nand we must do everything we can to help them seek and receive the same \nservices as any other child.\n  By ensuring that runaway and homeless youth have a safe place to stay \nand the resources they need, we can stem the tide of human trafficking \nin our country. By identifying vulnerable youth early and as \neffectively as possible, we can reduce the number of child sex \ntrafficking victims by preventing them from becoming victims in the \nfirst place.\n  We can and we must do everything in our power to not only identify, \nprosecute, and help victims recover, we must do everything we can to \nprevent human trafficking. We can take a huge step forward on that by \nfocusing attention and resources on our runaway and homeless youth \npopulation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy from the \ndistinguished Republican leader, Senator Cornyn, in letting me go \nforward for a few moments.\n  I would like to note that the executive director of the Vermont \nCoalition of Runaway & Homeless Youth Programs--a group I know well for \nthe important work they have done--wrote to me yesterday to express the \nconcern of the coalition and to express their support for the Runaway \nand Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act and encourage us to \nput aside our differences and work together to support those in need.\n  He wrote:\n\n       Difference of opinion and the deliberative role of the \n     Senate is part of what makes our democracy strong, but \n     sometimes unity of purpose should prevail, particularly in \n     efforts involving protections for the most vulnerable among \n     us. There should be no doubt that legislation involving the \n     well-being of individuals who have been victimized by the \n     most base of human behavior should be free of partisan \n     wrangling. I . . . encourage your efforts to remove partisan \n     language from the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act in \n     an effort to ensure that the Act and the Runaway and Homeless \n     Youth amendment that Senator Collins and you introduced \n     [will] move forward unimpeded.\n\n  I believe that reflects the views of Vermonters of all political \nstripes.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Texas and I and others want to \nhelp these greatly abused and abandoned children, and I hope we can \ncontinue to work to find a way forward.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues--the Senator from Illinois, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, and I think we are going to be joined by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and perhaps others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before I turn to Senator Portman, I would \nlike to put up a quote from one of the leaders of the anti-trafficking \nmovement, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, who expresses my \nsentiments exactly, my frustration over a partisan filibuster of a \npiece of legislation which has enjoyed broad bipartisan support and how \nsomehow partisanship has infected what should be a bipartisan \ncommitment to helping the victims of human trafficking. She says, \n``Senate Democrats are choosing a phantom problem over real victims.'' \nI think that expresses the facts and certainly my sentiment.\n  I want to turn to the Senator from Ohio first, who has been one of \nthe leaders in this effort. He has offered an important piece of \nlegislation which has already been incorporated in the bill which \nperhaps he will talk about but also has some additional amendments that \nI know he would like to get a chance to get a vote on to further \nimprove the bill--in particular, his provision Bringing Missing \nChildren Home Act with Senator Schumer, the Senator from New York, \nwhich is already in the base bill, and then with Senator Feinstein, the \nSenator from California--they offered the Combat Human Trafficking Act, \nwhich is already included in the base bill.\n  So with that, I would yield to the Senator from Ohio for any remarks \nhe would care to make, and then perhaps we could engage in a colloquy \nwith our colleagues.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from Texas. I thank him for his \nleadership on this legislation, along with Senator Klobuchar and \nothers, in bringing this to the floor. Senator Grassley, the chair of \nthe committee, is with us. I appreciate the fact that these two bills \nwhich we have worked on over the last few years are included in the \nlegislation the Senator mentioned.\n  Sadly, some of the most vulnerable youth are those who are missing or \nare in foster care, kids who end up being, unfortunately, exposed to \nhuman trafficking, sometimes sexual trafficking. So the idea of the \nmissing children legislation is really very simple. It says: Let's help \nfind these children as quickly as possible by having better information \non them.\n  I will give one example of that. In Ohio we have had 71 kids who have \ngone missing since January 1. These are 71 children who are out there \nsomewhere--minors. For those 71 children, we only have 22 photographs. \nThis is since January 1. One thing this legislation does is it says: \nLet's get the data, including photographs, so all of us can have an \nopportunity to find these young people before they become subject to \nhuman trafficking.\n  In Ohio we, unfortunately, have this issue in all of our regions, \nincluding in some of our smaller communities as well as our bigger \nurban centers where we have sex trafficking. They say the average age \nof children who are getting involved in this is between 11 and 13 years \nold.\n  We have talked a lot on the floor over the last several days. I have \nbeen out here talking about these issues. These are the most vulnerable \namong us. These are crimes against children.\n  This is in the bill, and if we can pass this legislation, getting \nthis additional information and better awareness and training of child \nwelfare agency officials and better training for law enforcement is all \npart of this.\n  The other legislation the Senator mentioned is about increasing the \npenalties on those who are involved in trafficking. That is important \nbecause we haven't had a major bill on this for 15 years, and we have \nlearned a lot in this process. What we have learned is there are better \nways to give prosecutors and other law enforcement the tools they need \nto be able to take these cases, prosecute them, and stop this heinous \ncrime.\n  There are some really good provisions in this legislation that I have \nworked on, on a bipartisan basis. As was said, one is with Senator \nFeinstein with regard to increasing the penalties, and the other piece \nof legislation is with Senator Schumer on bringing children home. There \nare also a couple of amendments we would love to offer. In fact, we \noffered them, but we haven't been able to get votes on them because \nthis week we haven't moved forward on the legislation.\n  I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to allow us \nto move forward with the process. Let's go ahead and start having \nvotes. There might be disagreements on some parts of the bill. I \nthought because it had gotten out of committee by a unanimous vote that \nthere wouldn't be disagreements, but if there are, let's have that \ndiscussion and debate. Let's not let the most vulnerable among us wait \nfor us to work this out. Let's move forward on this legislation in a \nway that allows everybody to have their views heard.\n  Some of the legislation I talked about comes out of meeting with \nfolks back home on this issue and talking to victims who have been \nthrough this horrible process and gone through the very difficult \nprocess of recovering from it. Some of the amendments we are going to \noffer would help with regard to that issue, help to respond to these \nyoung people--often children--who are involved in this.\n  It also comes out of the work that has been done right here in the \nSenate through a caucus we formed about 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Senator \nBlumenthal and I cofounded this caucus, we cochair it, and we meet \nevery month and bring people in from around the country who are experts \non this issue. Some are experts on child welfare, law enforcement, \npeople who are involved in trying to stop this. Others are experts \nbecause, unfortunately, they found themselves in very difficult \nsituations. Among others, some have come forward and talked about how \nas a young girl they were taken in by a trafficker. Increasingly--this \nis true in Ohio, unfortunately--drug abuse is part of this, so they \nbecome dependent on the trafficker. It is, to me, a form of bondage \nbecause these are young people who become addicted. In Ohio it is \ntypically\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\nheroin now. So it is keeping these young people trapped in this \ndependency. The drug treatment and the drug recovery are tough, but so \nis the recovery from having been trafficked.\n  This is an opportunity for us to take the information we have \nreceived through this caucus we have formed. I think the Members who \nare involved in that caucus, including the Members here today, would \nagree it has been a good experience for our staff and for us to raise \nthe awareness and consciousness on this issue. Now we have taken some \nof this information and put it in this legislation. Let's get it \npassed. We will have plenty of time for politics around here, trust me. \nWe will have lots of that next week and the week after and over the \nnext couple years. That is part of the process; we understand that. But \nthere are certain issues where we should be able to move forward on not \na bipartisan basis but I would say on a nonpartisan basis, and this is \none of them.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas for allowing me to speak briefly and \nmy colleagues from South Dakota and Illinois who are here to talk about \nthis issue.\n  My hope is that even today we can begin the process of having votes, \nmoving forward with amendments, and getting this good work done to help \nthe most vulnerable among us.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Briefly, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his leadership \non these issues. He has worked hard and long to address them and to \nbring us to the point where we are today.\n  I wish to emphasize one point the Senator made at the beginning, and \nthat is that the average age of the people who are targeted for human \ntrafficking are girls between the ages of 12 and 14. So this is a very \nvulnerable part of our country. I know we get wrapped around the axle \nup here about procedure, about politics, about a lot of different \nissues, but we ought to keep our focus on them, on the victims, these \nchildren, these girls who are the hapless victims of these pimps and \njohns and other people who make money selling their bodies. We ought to \nbe trying to figure out what can we do to help them. They are the ones \nwho will be the real losers. We get so balled up around here because of \nall of the political maneuvers, we take our eye off the ball. That is \nwhy our friends at the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women talked \nabout a phantom problem over real victims. The focus should be on the \nvictims.\n\n  The phantom problem--the shiny object they are trying to hold up and \nrelitigate--is something that has been the law of the land since 1976. \nIt has been included in a lot of pieces of legislation they voted for. \nThis is a phony diversion from what should be our real focus, which \nshould be the victims.\n  I wish to turn to the Senator from Illinois who has also been a \nleader on this issue. He has been a warrior in dealing with people who \nrun some of these Web sites, backpage.com in particular. My friend is \nalso trying to figure out a way to integrate some of our veterans who \nare leaving military service to lead the investigation of these crimes.\n  I turn to the Senator from Illinois for any comments he cares to \nmake.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for moving \nthis legislation, especially including the text of the HERO Act, S. \n575, which is bipartisan, thanks to the help of Senator Blumenthal, \nthat would also have us find wounded warriors to search on the Internet \nto find these exploiters.\n  With the amendment I was trying to offer earlier this week on the \nSAVE Act, I intended to go after backpage.com, which is the largest \nprovider of slavery-related services in the country. They make about \n$30 million a year off of slavery. We really ought to be able to charge \nthem to clean up the mess they have created.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. His \nfocus is exactly where we ought to be having our focus, which is how to \ntake the profit out of this modern-day slavery and redirect it to help \nthe victims, and that is what this bill does. It ends some of the \nimpunity that some of these purveyors of human flesh--the rewards they \nare reaping--and plows it back in to help the victims. I know the SAVE \nAct has been a particular focus for the Senator from Illinois.\n  Earlier I talked to Senator Feinstein, the Senator from California, \nabout this issue. She is very concerned about how the Internet is \nbecoming integrated as part of the business model of some of these \nperpetrators of this crime.\n  I am also told--and the Senator from Illinois may be aware of this--\nthat veterans will participate.\n  Mr. KIRK. Under the HERO Act, we have ICE hiring veterans to get on \nthe Internet to find some of the slave dealers online.\n  We should thread the needle very carefully when it comes to matters \nsuch as backpage.com. Under the Communications Decency Act, freedom in \nAmerica does not mean you have the freedom to enslave others.\n  With the victory in the Civil War--and I apologize to the Senator \nfrom Texas for mentioning it--we have established the real principle of \nthe ever expanding rule of freedom here in the United States and that \ndoes not include human slavery empowered by the Internet.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator from Illinois, and I take no offense \nfor talking about the fact that the South lost the Civil War.\n  Mr. KIRK. I believe a recent statement by my colleague referred to it \nas the recent unpleasantness.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I hold the Senate seat that was first held by Senator Sam \nHouston who actually resigned his seat as Governor of Texas rather than \nparticipate in secession. He was a Union man and believed in the Union.\n  I know the Senator from Illinois has worked very hard on a bipartisan \nbasis with Mr. Blumenthal, the Senator from Connecticut, and others on \nthis legislation, and that is why I find this situation so baffling. \nWhat has been a uniquely bipartisan effort has now turned into a \npartisan filibuster and, frankly, I am perplexed by that. Maybe some of \nour friends on the other side of the aisle will come out and explain \nwhy they are filibustering the bill they voted for in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We had a unanimous vote in the Judiciary Committee. We had \n10 Democratic cosponsors. Yet the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, now \nsays they will not allow a vote on any amendments and they are going to \nkill this bill because they don't want to vote for a bill that has a \nprovision they have voted for time and time again, and indeed has been \nthe law of the land for 39 years.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  We are joined by the Senator from South Dakota who is head of our \nRepublican conference and has been very concerned about the dysfunction \nin this place. We actually saw this legislation as an opportunity to \nstart demonstrating that we can do the people's business once again \nafter coming off of a very tough election--tougher for our Democratic \nfriends than it was for our side of the aisle. It was an election where \nvoter after voter said they were sick and tired of the dysfunction \nhere. We want to show we can be responsive to the needs of the most \nvulnerable people in our country.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Dakota for any comments he cares to \nmake.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nleadership on this issue, as well as the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, for moving this legislation to the floor.\n  As the Senator from Texas--who has authored and been involved with \nthis legislation for a long time--knows, if there was ever an issue we \nhave dealt with here in the Senate that goes beyond the line of \npartisan politics, it is this. We are talking about untold stories of \nthousands of American children and adults who are sold into modern-day \nslavery. Those stories are bone chilling and undeniably some of the \nmost deplorable acts of humankind.\n  What the Senator from Texas' bill is designed to do is to start \nattacking this issue in a way we have not seen for a very long time. It \ngives law enforcement the tools in order to target these traffickers, \nbring them to justice, and provides the tools that are necessary to \nhelp restore the lives of the victims of these heinous crimes.\n  It is interesting to me that we are where we are. This is clearly a \nbipartisan issue. My understanding is when this bill was marked up, \ndebated, and voted on in the Judiciary Committee, it came out \nunanimously. In other words, all the Democrats on the committee voted \nfor it. Is that correct? Is that the way it proceeded from the \nJudiciary Committee?\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will respond to my friend from South \nDakota to say he is absolutely correct, which is one reason I am so \nperplexed we find ourselves where we are today.\n  We have 10 cosponsors from the Democratic side for this underlying \nbill which was filed on January 13. It was marked up in the Judiciary \nCommittee a month later and got a unanimous vote. I will add to that, \nin response to my friend's question, we also saw something we have not \nseen here in a long time on the Senate floor, and that is an agreement \nby all 100 Senators that we would proceed to consider this bill and \nbegin the amendment and debate process without having to jump through \nall of the procedural hoops we traditionally have to do on cloture \nmotions and the like.\n  What happened a couple of days ago when apparently some of our \nfriends woke up and found out about this issue--what has been called a \nphantom problem--is very disturbing.\n  Mr. THUNE. My understanding is the bill itself is approximately 68 \npages long. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will say to my friend that he is correct. That includes \nthe strikeout provisions of the substitute, so actually the text is \nroughly half of that.\n  The provisions our friends across the aisle suddenly woke up and \ndiscovered--apparently a couple of days ago--were written in plain \nsight and incorporate by reference a bill they voted for, which was the \nlast appropriations bill we voted for in the lameduck session.\n  Mr. THUNE. This bill was filed on what date?\n  Mr. CORNYN. On January 13, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. THUNE. When was it marked up at the committee level?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to my friend, it was marked up or passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee roughly a month later.\n  Mr. THUNE. This legislation has been here in the Senate for weeks or \nmonths.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Months.\n  Mr. THUNE. It is 68 pages long. It was introduced back in January. It \nwas reported out unanimously. All the Democrats on the committee voted \nfor it when it left the Judiciary Committee. When it was brought up on \nthe floor of the Senate, all 100 Senators, including every single \nDemocrat, voted to get on this bill.\n  All of a sudden, here at the 11th hour, we are being held up on a \npiece of legislation that clearly has unanimous support, or at least I \nthought should have had unanimous support. They are now objecting \nbecause of the language in this legislation. Evidently it is only 68 \npages long, which is not a lot to read.\n  ObamaCare was obviously a story where it was argued that after it was \npassed, we had to figure out what was in it, but that was several \nthousand pages long. This is a 68-page bill.\n  When the bill was filed, there was an opportunity for people to look \nat this when the bill went to markup. Countless staffers and Members of \nCongress have looked at and read this legislation. Now all of a \nsudden--at the 11th hour--there is an objection because there is \nlanguage included in this bill which was voted on by 55 Democrats as \nrecently as December. Is that correct? Was there a spending bill that \ncame out of the Congress in December of 2014?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to my friend that was the so-called CRomnibus. It \nwas the continuing resolution omnibus bill that passed in November \nduring the lameduck session and it included the same or very similar \nlanguage. It was actually incorporated by reference into the Justice \nfor Victims of Trafficking bill. It is the same language our Democratic \nfriends voted for then, and now they are complaining about it being in \nthis bill for no apparent reason.\n  Mr. THUNE. Is it correct that that particular provision, referred to \nas the Hyde amendment, has been a part of spending bills dating back to \n1976? So for literally 40 years the Hyde amendment language has been \nincluded in bills we have passed here, particularly bills that are \nappropriations bills and spending and funding bills?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to my friend from South Dakota, he is exactly \ncorrect. This has been the law of the land for 39 years. This is an \narea that has been very controversial--that is abortion, generally--and \nthis has been a rare area of bipartisan consensus that no tax dollars \nbe used to fund abortion.\n  Again, this is a red herring and a phantom problem, as it has been \nreferred to here, and I can't believe our friends on the other side \nwould throw their staff under the bus who were responsible to bring \nthis language in the legislation to their attention, and I can't \nbelieve they would throw the victims who will benefit from this bill \nunder the bus and say they should have to pay the price for this \nphantom problem they discovered. To me it is not plausible. It doesn't \nmake any sense whatsoever.\n  Mr. THUNE. I say to my colleague from Texas, again, who has been so \ninstrumental in getting this to the floor, that a 68-page bill is \ncertainly readable. They have had several months to look at and read \nit. When a bill is reported out of a committee, it means it has been \nanalyzed, looked at, and open to debate and amendments, and it came out \nunanimously. Every Democrat voted for it. They voted for a provision \nthat literally has been a matter of policy and law in this country \ndating back to 1976 and was voted on as recently as December of last \nyear.\n  We had 55 Democrats in this Chamber who voted for this language--very \nsimilar language--in December of last year and now they are objecting \nto a piece of legislation they reported out unanimously in the \nJudiciary Committee which does something to stop the brutal violation \nof the innocent in this country, and they are objecting to it over this \nlanguage.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I could interject. The Senator from \nSouth Dakota is exactly right. I will add to that that not only does \nthis enjoy broad bipartisan support within the Senate and Congress, we \nhave more than 200 law enforcement and victim rights organizations that \nhave endorsed this bill and they are begging us to pass it.\n  One of those groups includes the Coalition Against Trafficking in \nWomen. They know we need to focus on not only taking the profit out of \nthis crime but, just as importantly, we need to get the services to the \nvictims to begin to let them heal and get on with their lives.\n  As we said earlier, these are typically young girls who are 12 to 14 \nyears of age. Can you imagine the scars, both physical and \npsychological, they bear having experienced this terrible crime?\n  Every day we delay in getting this bill passed because of the \npolitical shenanigans here is another day these victims of this \nterrible crime are denied access to the services they need.\n  Mr. THUNE. If they survive, imagine how messed up some of these young \nvictims are going to be for the rest of their lives. We have an \nopportunity to do something about it.\n\n  The Democratic leader has described this as a sleight of hand. That \nis not what this is. This is a clear choice. This is a clear choice by \nDemocrats to choose partisan politics over the victims of human \ntrafficking. It is as simple as that.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to stop--stop the partisan politics, \nstop derailing this important opportunity to come together in a spirit \nof bipartisanship to end human trafficking. Putting partisan politics \nover the lives of 100,000 American children who fall victim to the \nbrutal reality of human trafficking every year is absolutely wrong.\n  To quote our distinguished colleague from the State of Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski: ``Let's get it done and let's get it done now.''\n  I would say to my colleague from Texas, life is too precious. These \ncrimes are too serious for this issue to be caught up in the crosshairs \nof Washington politics. This has to stop. This has to end.\n  This is a piece of bipartisan legislation that will help literally \nhundreds of thousands--millions, I would say--of Americans across this \ncountry. It is time we begin to right the wrongs of injustice by \nturning the tide in law enforcement's favor to help those who are \ntrying to combat these terrible, heinous crimes to succeed and to help \nthe victims of these crimes restore their lives.\n  I appreciate the good work of the Senator from Texas and others who \nhave been involved with this.\n  I urge my colleagues to end this shenanigan, this charade that is \ngoing on\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\nbefore the Senate. Let's get this bill passed and on the President's \ndesk.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains in our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to the \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  We have neglected perhaps the most important person in this process; \nthat is, the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who responded to a letter written by all 20 female Senators, \nasking him to have a hearing on this important topic and to move this \nbill forward.\n  The Senator from South Dakota mentioned Senator Mikulski. She came to \ntestify, along with Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire and Senator \nKlobuchar, and she talked about how important this was to all 20 of our \nwomen Senators and how proud they were of the fact that it moved \nforward. It wouldn't have happened without the Senator from Iowa, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, willing to take that challenge up \nand to move the bill to the floor in such a unanimous fashion.\n  I wish to close by saying that all Members of the Senate presumably \ncame here to try to do something important--not just to march in place \nor fill up space. Presumably, they spend the time away from their \nfamilies, they go through the rigors of political campaigns, they \nsuffer the slings and arrows of partisan politics in order to try to do \nsomething good, to try to help people who cannot help themselves.\n  Here is a perfect opportunity to do exactly that. We are not asking \npeople to do anything extraordinary. We are certainly not asking them \nto do anything they haven't done before, which is to vote on language \nthat is included and has been the law of the land for 39 years and that \nthey have voted on before. We are not asking to change the status quo. \nWe are just asking them to focus on the victims.\n  As Ms. Gaetan, who is with the Coalition Against Trafficking in \nWomen, said: ``Senate Democrats are choosing a phantom problem over \nreal victims.''\n  Shame on us if we allow that to happen. Shame on us. We can do \nbetter. These victims deserve better. The people we work for in the 50 \nStates around this country deserve better. Shame on us if we don't get \nthis problem solved and if we don't pass this piece of bipartisan \nlegislation and get it to the President's desk where he will gladly \nsign it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heller). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, our Republican colleagues say they are \nhere fighting for women. If that were the case, then they wouldn't have \nsnuck into this bill a provision that hurts women. It is not just me \nsaying this; it is a story in the Washington Post. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2015]\n\n  Anti-Human-Trafficking Bill Gets Caught Up in Abortion Politics in \n                                 Senate\n\n                           (By Mike DeBonis)\n\n       Proving that there is virtually no issue that cannot get \n     mired in partisan combat, an anti-human trafficking bill now \n     under Senate consideration is in limbo after Democrats \n     accused Republicans of sneaking anti-abortion language into \n     the legislation before it hit the Senate floor.\n       The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, authored by \n     Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) and sporting a bipartisan stable of \n     cosponsors, was supposed to be a turn toward comity after a \n     couple of contentious weeks on Capitol Hill. What's not to \n     like about a bill that would increase penalties for those \n     convicted of slavery, human smuggling and sexual exploitation \n     of children and provide for additional compensation for their \n     victims?\n       On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \n     and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) locked arms in \n     calling on their colleagues to support the measure. ``I doubt \n     if there will be problems on my side,'' Reid said, according \n     to The Hill. ``If there is, I will work to clear them.''\n       But by midday Tuesday, the good feelings had eroded into a \n     bout of finger-pointing, with Senate Democrats accusing \n     Republicans of subterfuge in slipping language into the bill \n     that would extend the longstanding Hyde Amendment barring the \n     use of taxpayer funds for abortions to the new Domestic \n     Trafficking Victims' Fund.\n       The word ``abortion'' does not appear in the trafficking \n     bill, but there is language specifying that the victims' fund \n     ``shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending \n     of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of \n     the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 . . . to the same \n     extent as if amounts in the Fund were funds appropriated \n     under division H of such Act.''\n       That would apply the Hyde Amendment language to the new \n     fund, which is supported by a proposed $5,000 assessment on \n     those convicted of a wide variety of federal crimes related \n     to sexual abuse and human trafficking.\n       Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) accused Republicans of ``trying \n     to pull a fast one'' in inserting the abortion provision. Two \n     Democratic leaders, Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Charles E. \n     Schumer (D-N.Y.), both said Democrats had been advised that \n     it was not among the changes made to the bill since it was \n     taken up last year by a Democratic-controlled Senate. Earlier \n     in the day, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), ranking member of the \n     committee that unanimously forwarded the bill, said Judiciary \n     Committee Democrats were ``assured'' the provision was not \n     included.\n       In an early January e-mail reviewed by the Post, a \n     Republican Judiciary Committee staffer sent a Democratic \n     staffer a summary of changes to the previous version of the \n     bill, in seven bullet points. The abortion provision was not \n     among them.\n       ``This bill will not be used as an opportunity for \n     Republicans to double down on their efforts to restrict a \n     woman's health-care choices,'' Murray said. ``It is \n     absolutely wrong and, honestly, it is shameful. I know there \n     are a whole lot of us who are going to fight hard against any \n     attempt to expand the Hyde Amendment and permanently impact \n     women's health.''\n       But Republican leaders--including Cornyn, the majority \n     whip--pushed back on the notion that the abortion language \n     represented any kind of subterfuge. A Cornyn aide suggested \n     that Democrats knew very well about the language before the \n     committee vote--including, the aide said, Leahy staffers--and \n     thus were being ``disingenuous.''\n       ``It was out in the public domain for a month before it was \n     marked up in Judiciary Committee on Feb. 26, and all members \n     of the Judiciary Committee voted to support it,'' Cornyn \n     said. ``So that leads me to believe that some of the \n     suggestions being made now that there were provisions in the \n     legislation that people didn't know about are simply untrue. \n     That presupposes that none of their staff briefed the \n     senators on what was in the legislation, that nobody read a \n     68-page bill and that senators would vote for a bill, much \n     less co-sponsor it, without reading it and knowing what's in \n     it. None of that strikes me as plausible.''\n       Republicans and Democrats are also sparring about the \n     impact of the abortion language. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman \n     for Reid, called it a ``significant expansion of the scope of \n     the Hyde amendment'' by applying it to fees and fines, not \n     just taxpayer funds. He also said the rider in the \n     trafficking bill would be permanent--unlike the Hyde \n     Amendment, which must be continually attached to each year's \n     appropriations--and thus ``could lead to a dramatic expansion \n     of abortion restrictions in future years.''\n       Cornyn took to the Senate floor late Tuesday to rebut that \n     notion, noting that the 2009 health reform law included a \n     similar restriction. ``Democrats have supported legislation \n     consistent with the Hyde Amendment for a long, long time,'' \n     he said. ``My hope is this: that members of the United States \n     Senate will rise above this--this agreement, this posturing, \n     this attempt to try to play gotcha at the expense of these \n     victims of human trafficking.''\n       Reid said debate would continue Wednesday on the bill, and \n     a Democratic aide suggested the tiff could be overcome if \n     McConnell allows a vote on an amendment removing the abortion \n     language from the bill--an amendment that is likely to fail.\n       ``You can blame it on staff, blame it on whoever you want \n     to blame it on, but we didn't know it was in the bill,'' Reid \n     said. ``And . . . this bill will not come off this floor as \n     long as that language is in the bill.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The article states in part:\n\n       In an early January e-mail reviewed by the Post, a \n     Republican Judiciary Committee staffer sent a Democratic \n     staffer a summary of changes to the previous version of the \n     bill, in seven bullet points.\n\n  Guess what. They left out the change they made to women's \nreproductive health.\n  Now, I have been around here a long time and I thought there was \ntrust in this body, but don't stand up and say it is a phantom problem \nwhen the Washington Post confirms it. They have the email that proves \nthis change was made and was not told to the Democrats on the \ncommittee. If it had been told to the Democrats on the committee, we \nwould have worked this out.\n  If they want to fight for women, take the provision out that harms \nthe victims of trafficking. If they want to help women, bring up \nLoretta Lynch for confirmation--a fantastic woman, qualified--held up \nby the Republicans longer than any other Attorney General nominee ever. \nIf they want to help women, those are two ways to do it.\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\n  Solve this problem. Don't stand up and say it is a phantom problem \nwhen the Washington Post saw the email.\n  We know the bill before us has an extremely worthy goal. We want to \nhelp victims of human trafficking. I wish to ask rhetorically, How does \nit help women who have been brutally trafficked when we don't let them \naccess their legal right to end a pregnancy that resulted from their \nenslavement? A woman is enslaved. She becomes pregnant. Shouldn't she \nhave the ability to get the same kind of health care as any other \nwoman? But, no, in this bill, they say she can't use that victims \ncompensation fund for that legal right.\n  Republicans are doing this all over the place. They attached \nimmigration to the homeland security bill. They are threatening to \nattach the Keystone Pipeline to a highway bill. Now they include \nabortion in a human trafficking bill. And then they tell us we are \nseeing phantom problems? I don't think so. They have been in charge for \nmore than 8 weeks and all we see is them taking hostage after hostage \nafter hostage legislatively to get their way on their philosophy.\n  Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. If they don't like it, why don't \nthey just propose doing away with it. Let's have that out. This bill \nsingles out and hurts vulnerable women--women who have been the victims \nof a heinous crime. Women who face deplorable conditions, ripped out of \ntheir homes, taken advantage of, treated brutally, women who many times \nare forced into pregnancy by their captors, and in an unprecedented \nmanner, because of sneaking this language into this bill, the bill \nimposes abortion restrictions on private funds--private funds that have \nbeen collected from the criminals and the perpetrators of these \nunspeakable acts.\n  Don't these women deserve better? Shouldn't these victims have access \nto services that are guaranteed to them by the Constitution?\n  My friends on the other side don't like it. They want to tell women \nwhat to do. They want to get into the most personal decisions that \nwomen and their families make. Let them do that for their families. But \nif they want to change the law of the land, Roe v. Wade, and tell women \nthey are criminals--and doctors, make them criminals too--then why \ndon't they just have the courage to bring it to the floor directly, not \nsneak it into a bill and have the staffers write a note to their \ncolleagues saying, Oh, they are silent. Oh, we didn't do anything on \nthat. Oh, no.\n  I will tell my colleagues there is one advantage to being around here \nfor a long time. One has a sense of what used to be decent around here, \nwhen one's word was one's word and one's bond was one's bond. Thank \ngoodness we have proof. We have proof that the Republicans left this \nout of a memo in which they told the Judiciary Committee the changes \nthat were made. We have proof. Don't call this a phantom problem \nbecause we have it in writing.\n  This is a clear path of injecting these unrelated, extremely \npolitically charged provisions into key pieces of legislation. I have \nnot seen it. We used to have a little bit of an understanding around \nhere that if we agreed on a piece of legislation, we would keep out the \npoison pills. We wouldn't put them into bills, whether they were \nwritten by Democrats or Republicans. We know at the end of the day what \nhappens. Everybody gets hurt because nothing gets done. If this is the \nnew way it is going to be around here, it is a bad way for the people.\n  We should be working on a bill that protects the victims of the most \nheinous crime: human trafficking. We should be protecting our society's \nmost vulnerable people and making sure they are not denied their \nrights. The Republican provision that was added in secret and tried to \nbe kept quiet would hurt every single woman we are trying to help. They \ninserted language that was not in the same bill last year that was \nsupported by Democrats and Republicans. They added the new language \nquietly, hoping nobody would notice, and then we would all march down \nthere--I put my name on this bill, by the way, because my staff trusted \nthe Republican staff when they said there wasn't any change in abortion \nlanguage. How awful it was for my staff that they said to me, Senator, \nwe feel terrible. We took their word. So I got my name off this bill.\n  Why on Earth would anyone want to single out these victims of human \ntrafficking and take away their constitutional rights?\n  At least own up to it, I say to my Republican friends. They got \ncaught. We have the email. Don't get up here and say it is a phantom \nproblem. Don't make these speeches about how Democrats want to hurt \nwomen, when they put a poison pill in the bill, hurt the very women \nthey say they want to protect, did it in secret, and then call us out \nfor it as if we are doing something wrong.\n  The American people were not born yesterday. They are pretty darn \nsmart. If I stopped one of them on the street--I don't care if they are \na Republican or Democrat or what their view is on abortion--and I said \nto them: If a friend tells you they have made no changes to a letter \nyou asked them to write, and you took their word for it and signed the \nletter and later found out there was something in that letter that they \nknew would hurt you, would you be angry, they would probably say: I \ndon't even want to deal with that person anymore; they can't be \ntrusted.\n  One thing I have learned around here is your word is your bond, and \nthe relationships we have with one another across the aisle are \nprecious. They are important.\n  So let's not make these phony arguments. Let's fix the problem. Let's \nremove this offending language. Let's come together, for once. Let's \npass a bill that helps these victims.\n  Then my colleague says: Well, all the groups want this bill anyway. \nLet me quote from one of them, the Polaris Project: ``The bipartisan \nsupport to address modern slavery should not be held up by a separate \ndebate on partisan issues.''\n  That is a direct quote.\n  If ever there was a partisan issue, it is the right to choose. That \nis a partisan issue.\n  Then there is a letter from the National Network For Youth: ``This \nlegislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this moment pass us \nby because of the addition of partisan and divisive provisions.''\n  Let me read that again: ``This legislation is desperately needed and \nwe can't let this moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan \nand divisive provisions.''\n  Again, we are offering Republicans a simple solution: Remove the \nlanguage. Go back to the same language that was in the bill last year \nwhich enjoyed broad support.\n  If Republicans do that today, we would pass this bill today.\n  I know this is the Democratic time to talk, so I am going to allow \nSenator Hirono to continue. We need to end this sneak attack on women's \nhealth so we can get the victims of human trafficking the services and \nsupport they need.\n  We are ready, willing, and able to sit down and work with our friends \non the other side to drop this provision. The Senate is not going to \nget things done if the Republican majority continues to insist on \nputting politically charged, extreme measures on bills that should pass \nwith bipartisan support. I hope my colleagues will work with us. I \ncertainly want to be able to trust the staffers again and trust my \ncolleagues again, and it would start with removing this provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of my friend from California, Senator Boxer. I rise today to \nspeak against attempts to turn this bill--the Justice for Trafficking \nVictims Act--into a political football. While there are many issues \nthat may divide this Congress--and certainly the issue of choice for \nwomen is one of them--human trafficking should not be one of those \ndivisive issues.\n  This bill started off as a bipartisan bill, but along the way a \nprovision was added to the bill that brings me to the floor today in \nopposition to that provision. Not only do I oppose the substance of \nthat provision, but I very much object to how the provision was added \nto the bill unbeknownst to the sponsors of this bill such as myself. \nBuried in this bill is a provision that allows government to dictate a \nwoman's health care options, and this provision would limit choices for \nwomen\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\nwho have been victimized by human trafficking.\n  Women are often forced to endure rape and violence on a daily basis. \nThat is what human trafficking is. This is an unprecedented and, I have \nto say, appalling expansion of government's role in women's health care \ndecisions. The provision is anti-women and anti-victim. This body \nshould be working to help these victims of trafficking violence, not \nplaying politics with their lives. But that is not what we are seeing \ntoday.\n  The truth is there are some in this body who have time and again put \ntheir own ideological agenda and need to score political points ahead \nof consensus-driven legislation.\n  We have seen this before. A few weeks ago Congress came close to \nshutting down the Department of Homeland Security--the third largest \nDepartment in the Federal Government--because a few Members wanted to \nhold funding national security priorities hostage to score points \nagainst the President's immigration actions. We saw it during the \nshutdown. We saw it during the debate over the Shaheen-Portman energy \nbill. We saw it during Congress's drawn-out debate over the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, yet another issue \nthat should be free of partisan politics.\n  This body shouldn't let ideological grandstanding on divisive issues \nstall and kill bipartisan legislation that will make a difference for \npeople--particularly for the most vulnerable people in this country, \nvictims of trafficking.\n  This bill is no exception. A bill on human trafficking should not be \na method of expanding the government's powers to dictate women's \npersonal choices, women's health care decisions.\n  I join my colleagues in urging the Senate to stop using this \nlegislation and others like it to advance an ideological agenda, and \nhelp the women, men, and children who are being trafficked across this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I don't seek the floor to speak now because I think I \nam infringing upon some other Democrats who wanted to speak before I \nspoke. I assume they are on their way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor with a very \nclear message for my Republican colleagues: A bill about combatting \nhuman trafficking is no place for partisanship. It is not an \nopportunity to try to get a political victory for your base, and it \nabsolutely should not be a vehicle for policies that would roll back a \nwoman's right to make her own choices about her own body. Instead, a \nbill like the Justice for Trafficking Victims Act should be focused \nonly on protecting the rights and the safety and the health of \nsurvivors of sex trafficking, who have faced truly extraordinary \nviolence and hardship.\n  I called on Republicans to work with Democrats to ensure this \nlegislation gets back on track as the bipartisan effort it should be--\nby simply removing a provision that would expand the so-called Hyde \namendment, allowing politicians to interfere even more with the most \ndeeply personal health decisions a woman can make.\n  I am disappointed that so far my Republican colleagues have said no \nand continued to push for a completely unnecessary fight over women's \nhealth. So today I am back on the floor, joined by several of my \nDemocratic colleagues, to tell the other side of the aisle that we are \nnot taking no for an answer. We Democratic women believe a bill \nintended to help women should be about helping women, period.\n  There is no reason for a political restriction on women's health in \nthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, just as there wasn't a \nreason for Republicans to threaten the government with a shutdown over \nPlanned Parenthood funding back in 2011 or try to jam through \nreproductive health riders on spending bills.\n  The women Senators who have joined us on the floor today have seen \nthis kind of inappropriate, disappointing political stunt geared at \nrolling back women's rights before. Republicans are going to get the \nsame response they have gotten every other time: not on our watch.\n  Right now the ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary is \nworking on alternative legislation that would take out the divisive, \nharmful expansion of the Hyde amendment and keep this effort focused on \nsurvivors who need support and deserve justice. Democrats are laying \nout a path to keep this bill bipartisan and get it done.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will reconsider the partisan \napproach they have taken and work with us. I hope they will think about \nwhy it doesn't make sense to choose partisanship over trying to just \naddress a truly horrific problem in our country, especially one we all \nagree needs to be solved. I hope they will commit to putting the \npolitics aside and join us to make this bill the bipartisan effort we \nall hoped it would be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we just heard Members of the minority \nparty complaining there are things in this bill nobody knew anything \nabout. On our side, I think we have done a good job of refuting it.\n  I am going to suggest again they ought to read the legislation. They \nhad plenty of time to read the legislation. But it is kind of remindful \nof the story about Speaker Pelosi saying after the 2,700-page ObamaCare \nbill was written that you have to pass it to find out what is in it.\n  Obviously this legislation before us isn't law. It is a proposal. But \nit is just like people evidently don't read this legislation before it \ngets out of committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 20-0. The fact \nis this legislation was on the Web site several weeks before it was \nvoted out of committee, and this language was in it. So you have to \nwait until a bill gets out of committee before you read the language? \nNo. There are 20 people on the Committee on the Judiciary who had an \nopportunity to read this legislation before it ever got out of \ncommittee. There were no concerns about this language that we hear from \nthe minority of the Senate that they have all of a sudden found \nobnoxious and somehow it was sneaked into a piece of legislation, which \nis not true. That is what I am going to speak about.\n  As one example of what I referred to, yesterday we heard from the \nSenator from Vermont--my friend, the distinguished ranking member of \nthe committee and former chairman of the committee--that an \norganization called ATEST is urging that we strike the Hyde amendment \nlanguage in this bill. ATEST is one of many organizations that had the \nopportunity to review and comment on this legislation prior to the \ncommittee markup of this bill. They met with my staff in February to \ndiscuss this bill and never raised any concern with the Hyde amendment \nat that time. So now I can legitimately question why they are coming \nforward with this concern only now, weeks after the Senate Committee on \nthe Judiciary reported this legislation.\n  Then we also heard the Senator from California comment on emails. I \nwant her to know there are emails that clearly show the other side was \naware of the Hyde provision, and it is not our majority saying the \nDemocrats are raising a phantom problem. The Senator from California is \ncriticizing a human trafficking advocate who is saying that very point.\n  It is pretty bad around here when you have Senators attacking anti-\ntrafficking advocates. We learned last week that law enforcement \nofficials in Texas arrested 29 people in an online trafficking \nsting. As reported in Texas in the Waco Tribune-Herald on March 10:\n\n       The sting was designed to catch suspects seeking underage \n     escorts for sexual acts or trying to become ``pimps'' by \n     trafficking underage prostitutes.\n\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\n\n  This is only the latest in a string of news stories showing that the \ncommercial exploitation of children is a problem in the United States. \nThe reality that adolescents are victims in many of these cases makes \nthe situation all the more wrenching.\n  It is vital that we act now to pass legislation to further protect \nthese and other domestic victims of human trafficking. These reports \nare reasons why this bill should not be stalled by the minority Members \nof the Senate, particularly when we in the majority pledged, as a \nresult of the last election, that we were going to have an open \namendment process.\n  This bill is under the open amendment process so anybody who doesn't \nlike this language ought to offer an amendment, and let us see where \nthe votes are--whether their side prevails or whether the people who \nwant to pass an antitrafficking bill prevail.\n  I take this opportunity to again urge my colleagues to support this \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which would establish strong \nantitrafficking measures that target predators who exploit innocent, \nyoung people. The measure focuses both on sex and labor trafficking. It \nwould benefit both children and adult victims of these despicable \ncrimes.\n  The legislation would equip law enforcement with new tools to fight \ntrafficking, enhance services for victims, and increase penalties for \nperpetrators. The bill would help fight demand for domestic sex \ntrafficking by ensuring that any person who is trafficking an adult or \npurchasing a child for sex will be punished under the full force of \nlaw. In other words, it goes after the demand side as well as the \nsupply side of these terrible crimes. So it is a meaningful solution \nthat is supported by a large bipartisan group of Senators and more than \n200 outside organizations.\n  The other day, one human trafficking advocate characterized the \nconcern raised by the minority with the Hyde amendment provision in \nthis bill as a phantom problem, and I agree.\n  The minority leader is focusing on a provision that passed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in February unanimously, after committee members \ndebated the bill and had the opportunity to even strike this provision \nthat they find so obnoxious at this particular time. Not only has this \nlanguage, called the Hyde amendment language, been in a part of this \nbipartisan bill for months, it is the law of the land today--a \nconsensus measure adopted in 1976. It has been included in \nappropriations bills every year for decades.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, it has been included in authorizing \nlegislation on occasions as well.\n  Why, when we have agreed on the inclusion of Hyde amendment language \nin bills on so many prior occasions over a 39-year period of time, \nwould we at this time be unable to agree to its inclusion in a bill to \nhelp human trafficking victims?\n  It is fitting that this bill includes such Hyde amendment language. \nThe bill creates a Federal victims fund, and money in the fund will \nderive from fines imposed on human traffickers. The fund will be a \nfederally administered program.\n  If the fund is used to support abortion services, then it constitutes \nFederal funding of abortion. Including the Hyde language is consistent, \nthen, with what we have always done in such cases. This is not the \nappropriate time or place for the minority party Members of the Senate \nto seek a rollback of consensus legislation that was adopted as far \nback as 1976 and has been extended every year since that time.\n  I urge my colleagues to find another place and another time for \ncongressional debate on taxpayer funding of abortions--not to do it on \na bill that has broad, bipartisan support and definitely not on a bill \nthat was reported out of committee 20 to 0, which means 11 Republicans \nand 9 Democrats supported it.\n  The argument that this Hyde amendment language was included by--you \nhave heard these words--``sleight of hand'' is simply disingenuous. \nThis bill, after its introduction, was put into the public domain--not \nafter it was voted out of committee, not just 1 day before it was in \ncommittee, but weeks before the committee considered it. So it was in \nthe public domain. Nobody could say it wasn't there. So you could read \nit and know this Hyde language was in it.\n  It was distributed by email to numerous organizations and \ncongressional offices for their input. It has been posted for 2 months \non the U.S. Government Web site, accessible to any congressional \nstaffer or member of the public. So we have people who come to the \nSenate saying they didn't know this was in there. Well, then, did they \nnot read the bill? Did they not have their staff read the bill? For a \nlong period of time it has been right out there where 300 million \npeople could access it on the Web site.\n  If lawmakers then are asserting that they did not know the Hyde \namendment was included in the bill, then it means they simply didn't \nread this legislation.\n  I again call on my colleagues to support the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, focusing on helping survivors of trafficking heal and \nprotect others from becoming victims of such a terrible crime.\n  It is a meaningful solution that is supported by large bipartisan \ngroups of Senators. We have a real opportunity to provide survivors of \ntrafficking with the kind of support that is essential to their \nrecovery and future success.\n  Working together, in a bipartisan way, we can restore dignity to \nsurvivors. That is why we need to pass this act right now.\n  It also gives this Senate an opportunity to do what I hear from the \npeople of grassroots Iowa so often in my town meetings, such as \nSaturday when I was in Truro, IA, and 33 people showed up. I was in \nNorwalk, IA, and 66 people showed up. At those meetings they keep \nasking: Why can't you Republicans and Democrats get together?\n  This is one of those bills where Republicans and Democrats are \ngetting together. Now we find some people--who evidently don't read \nlegislation until the midnight hour--coming to the floor of the Senate \nsaying something along the lines of: We snuck something into the bill.\n  Snuck something into the bill when the bill has been out there on the \nWeb site for a couple of months already? No, that is disingenuous. So \nthe bill is not moving along. But when this bill is brought up for a \nfinal vote, the people will see that Republicans and Democrats can work \ntogether if we can get over this hurdle of the stonewalling by the \nminority party of the Senate, holding up this bill for a disingenuous \nreason.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I rise today in support of the bill that \nis currently pending before us, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct. I commend the chairman for his hard work and effort on this piece \nof legislation and for ushering it through the Senate.\n  I also thank and commend the senior Senators from Texas and Minnesota \nfor coming together in a bipartisan fashion on this vitally important \nhuman rights legislation.\n  Because this is such a bipartisan bill--frankly, a nonpartisan \nissue--I am frustrated that we are at an impasse on moving this bill \nforward with an open debate.\n  Let me repeat. This is a nonpartisan issue. I encourage my colleagues \nacross the aisle to move forward with an open debate on this vitally \nimportant human rights legislation.\n  Every day countless innocent victims are bought and sold into modern-\nday slavery in America. All too often, many of these victims are \nchildren.\n  As the father of four and a grandfather of two, I believe every child \nshould have the opportunity to grow up in a loving and safe \nenvironment. I know the Presiding Officer agrees with that. I know \neverybody in this Chamber agrees with that today. Unfortunately, that \nis not the case for too many children.\n  Recognizing this is an important issue. My home State of Nevada has \ntaken action over the past several years not only to assist victims of \ntrafficking but also to ensure these victims have the opportunity to \nseek compensation for their traffickers. Given Nevada's unique \nlocation, especially southern Nevada, this is a crime that is all too \nprevalent within my home State. Just to give us an idea, 2 years ago \nthe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department reported that 2,144 sex\n\n[[Page S1464]]\n\ntrafficking victims under the age of 18 were rescued in Las Vegas since \n1994. That is an average of 126 per year. Even more daunting, that is 1 \nperson rescued every 3 days. This is one city in one State. More than \nhalf of these victims were from Nevada, and the rest of them were \ntrafficked through the State.\n  While Nevada is taking important steps forward in providing \nrestitution of victims of trafficking, much more needs to be done to \nstop this crime from occurring in the first place. All too often, \ntrafficking is a crime that is hidden from plain sight. It occurs in \nevery single State. That is why it is vitally important to recognize \nthe warning signs of someone who may be a victim of human trafficking, \nas well as those who are committing these crimes.\n  I am pleased to see this underlying bill recognizes this need, \nespecially for local law enforcement, especially for health providers, \nand especially for first responders.\n  The bill, however, fails to recognize the important role of our \nNation's ports of entry and how they play into our Nation's domestic \nand international transportation system, and the opportunity they \nprovide for human trafficking. That is why I filed an amendment to this \nlegislation, to ensure that victims of human trafficking and \nperpetrators of this crime will not be able to pass through such places \nwithout additional law enforcement awareness.\n  My amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security to train \nTSA, CBP, and other relevant departments' personnel to effectively \ndeter, detect, and disrupt human trafficking. Recognizing the different \nneeds of States and the critical role of local law enforcement in \ncombatting human trafficking, it also allows DHS to provide training to \nany State, local or tribal government or private organization in order \nto establish a human trafficking awareness training program.\n  Finally, this amendment requires DHS to keep records of the number of \nhuman trafficking cases reported or confirmed and to report these \nnumbers annually to Congress. That way we can measure progress in our \nefforts to end human trafficking.\n  Instead of creating another layer of bureaucracy, my amendment simply \ncomplements and enhances the current efforts by DHS to equip its \npersonnel with effective strategies to combat human trafficking at our \nNation's ports of entry and other high-risk areas.\n  Earlier this year, I was pleased to see similar legislation pass the \nHouse of Representatives with unanimous support.\n  I think most of us can agree that this issue of human trafficking is \nnot a partisan issue; it is a human rights issue. Whether one is a \nparent, a sibling, a child or a relative, this issue is real. That is \nwhy I am so pleased to see this Chamber come together in a bipartisan \nmanner to bring this bill to the floor. Once again, I only hope we can \ncome together and move this debate forward.\n\n  As I tell Nevadans back home, I came to Washington, DC, to work. I \nwork with Republicans and I work with Democrats. There are issues we \nmay at times have to agree to disagree on, but moving forward on a \nbipartisan bill such as this should not be one of them.\n  We need to do all we can to end this disgraceful and disgusting crime \nonce and for all. We should move forward in providing much needed help \nto these victims, including children.\n  There is more work to do on this bill and ways to make it a better \nproduct through the amendment process, but we should be moving forward \ninstead of stalling out.\n  I hope I have the opportunity to call up my amendment, and I would \nurge my colleagues to support my amendment so we can ensure that DHS \npersonnel are properly trained to prevent the serious threat of human \ntrafficking. Help is almost there for these victims. I hope we can come \nto a resolution today to move forward on this bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I support S. 178, the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act. The bill supports law enforcement officers \nand prosecutors in their efforts to prevent, respond to, and combat \nhuman trafficking. Of particular importance, the domestic trafficking \nvictims' fund created by this legislation would help States and \nlocalities develop training and services for survivors.\n  In February, I was proud to join all the women in the Senate in \nrequesting that the Judiciary Committee hold a hearing on human \ntrafficking. I appreciate the work of Chairman Grassley and Ranking \nMember Leahy in quickly scheduling that hearing and thank them for \ninviting Senators Mikulski, Ayotte, Gillibrand, and me to testify \nbefore the committee on behalf of all of the women in the Senate. I \napplaud the committee's bipartisan work in shining a light on some of \nthe darkest stories imaginable.\n  No State is immune from the evils of sex trafficking. Traffickers \nlure vulnerable victims with the promises of a better life and use \nviolence, threats, lies, money, drugs, and other forms of coercion to \ntrap them in a life of commercial sex. Many criminals who once worked \nin drugs have now turned to sex trafficking because it is more \nprofitable.\n  The stories of victims are shocking. Just this past January, police \nin Bangor, ME, arrested a man and woman for allegedly forcing a 13-\nyear-old girl into prostitution. This child, who was listed as a \nmissing person, was being sold for sex through ads on the Internet. \nUnfortunately, there are many horrific cases like this occurring across \nthe country.\n  The policies and tools for law enforcement, prosecutors, and \nsurvivors included in S. 178 are important pieces of a strong Federal \nresponse to human trafficking, and I commend Senators Cornyn and \nKlobuchar for their work on this legislation.\n  I also hope the Senate will adopt an amendment I have cosponsored \nwith Senator Leahy that would reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act programs, which provide critical preventive and treatment \nservices that help homeless youth around the country. Runaway and \nhomeless youth are especially vulnerable to becoming victims of \ntrafficking and sexual exploitation. A meaningful response to the very \nserious problem of human trafficking must also ensure that those most \nvulnerable to human trafficking--including our Nation's homeless \nyouth--have the resources they need. The preventive measures provided \nby the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs can help stem the tide \nof potential trafficking victims.\n  The State of Maine is doing its part to end the scourge of human \ntrafficking, where the Not Here Justice in Action Network and other \npartnerships between law enforcement and service providers are helping \nto raise awareness and help victims. Our health care workers in Maine \nare also tremendous partners. St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor, ME, for \nexample, has focused its efforts on educating and training clinicians, \nnurses, and emergency medical providers to recognize the signs of human \ntrafficking among their patients. With the proper tools and training, \nthese nurses can intervene. They are learning how to identify victims \nand how to ask the right questions, which are critically important to \nkeeping these atrocities from continuing.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act offers important supports \nfor victims and enhanced tools for our law enforcement. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n          Tribute to George And Donna Gunning and Burt Truman\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise to share some good news from my \nhome State of Maine. It is the story of veterans helping veterans--of \nthree people from Maine who have positively impacted the lives of \nthousands of veterans in my State and have done so in a unique way. \nThey make personalized wooden canes with a bold and intricate bald \neagle head carved into the handle for any Maine veteran who wants one.\n  I have some pictures that show a large number of the canes and a \ncloseup. As I noted when one of these canes appeared in my office \nrecently, this eagle has an attitude and he is positive about the \nfuture of this country.\n  About 8 years ago, George and Donna Gunning from Windsor, ME, heard \nabout a project in Oklahoma called the Eagle Cane Project. The mission \nwas to help post-9/11 veterans who had trouble walking because of leg \ndisabilities due to combat-related action by providing them with a \nunique hand-carved cane.\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\n  As a Navy veteran, George and his wife Donna Gunning, who grew up in \na Navy family, were both intimately familiar with the sacrifices and \ndifficulties that accompany military service. This project touched \ntheir hearts and they quickly recognized it as an opportunity to give \nback to veterans in Maine. They brought their own version of the \nproject to our State, offering a personalized eagle cane to any Maine \nveteran who had served anywhere in the world in any conflict across the \nglobe.\n  It wasn't long before the Gunnings were joined by another fellow \nnamed Burt Truman from Hallowell, ME, who spent two decades in the \nmilitary, in the Navy, Army Reserve, and the Air National Guard. The \ntrio worked together on each cane they made--crafting them, painting \nthem, personalizing each one by etching the veteran's name and molding \nmedals to show their branch of the service and any honors they \nreceived.\n  As impressive as each of these masterpieces is, the number that these \nthree people have produced is what is astounding and remarkable. The \ncurrent count is 2,474 of these personally hand-made canes, made free \nof charge and funded for Maine veterans entirely through donations.\n  For all their hard work and dedication, the trio remains adamant that \nthey deserve no special recognition, although I am giving it to them \nhere today. Instead, they would rather the attention and admiration and \nthanks of all of our people be directed toward the veterans who are \nreceiving these canes, who have borne so much for our country.\n  That is the true magic of this project. It is about recognizing our \nveterans, supporting them, and giving them something to lean on, both \nliterally, physically, and emotionally.\n  In recent months, as the Presiding Officer knows, there have been a \nnumber of efforts in the Congress to further support our veterans--to \nimprove their access to care and support services. While the Choice \nAct, which was signed into law last August, made progress in this area, \nmore work needs to be done. To ensure that provisions of this \nlegislation we all voted for and supported last year are implemented in \naccordance with our intent, Senator Jerry Moran, Senator Susan Collins, \nmyself and others have introduced a bill to improve how the VA \ndetermines eligibility for the Choice Program.\n  Currently, veterans can only use their Choice cards if they cannot \nget an appointment within 30 days at a VA facility and face an \nexcessive burden of travel, such as a body of water, or if they live \nmore than 40 miles as the crow flies from any VA facility, regardless \nof whether it provides the type of care they need.\n  In my opinion this isn't what Congress intended. In rural States such \nas Maine, as the crow flies is not a good definition of distance. We \nhave to take into account whether the VA facility in question can \nprovide our veterans with the specific care services they require. So \nthe bill sponsored by Senators Moran, Collins, myself, and others \noffers a fix by requiring the VA to use its existing authority to offer \ncommunity care to veterans who live more than 40 miles driving distance \nfrom the nearest VA facility that provides the type of care they need.\n  I hope in the coming weeks the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and \nthe similar committee in the House will hold hearings on this issue so \nwe are able to provide a path forward and correct what I think is \ncertainly a fixable portion of the Choice Act we passed last year.\n  As we look for that path, and as we think about veterans' issues, I \nthink these eagle canes provide some inspiration. The bald eagle of \ncourse is a national symbol of freedom and independence, and with these \ncanes it has also come to symbolize in Maine the debt of gratitude we \nowe to our Nation's veterans. Each cane is a treasured reminder that \nsomeone cares, someone notices, and someone appreciates what they have \ndone.\n  I have seen firsthand the powerful effect these canes have. Earlier \nthis month I was meeting with members of the Maine Veterans of Foreign \nWars and one of the gentlemen who sat right next to me in my office had \nwith him this beautifully carved eagle cane. Thinking it was the only \none of its kind, I asked him where he found something so unique and \ninteresting and powerful. He said: Well, it was made right here in \nMaine, and I am not the only person who has one. It was one of \nthousands made in a Windsor, ME, workshop.\n  Even more telling was how quickly and enthusiastically the VFW \nmembers, also in my office that day, jumped in to explain where the \ncanes came from and how glowingly they spoke of this project and what \nit has meant to veterans in Maine. They knew the history of the \nproject, they described the meticulousness of the craftsmanship--which \nwe can see here--and they quickly gave me George Gunning's name. Their \nenthusiasm underscored their true appreciation for the support and \nrecognition this Eagle Cane Project in Maine had given to them and \ntheir fellow veterans.\n  Burt, George, and Donna's work is a true testament to the strength of \nour veterans community in Maine, and that is what it is all about.\n  Good news from Maine, Madam President. Good news about our commitment \nto each other and our commitment to our veterans. It is often said that \nMaine is a big small town with very long streets. We know each other, \nwe care about each other, and in this case we deeply care about our \nveterans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I come to the floor incredibly \ndisappointed that we can't seem to move forward on what should be a \nnoncontroversial, powerful, and bipartisan effort.\n  I think we can all agree in the Senate that we must do more to combat \nhuman trafficking and help the victims of this heinous act, and I was \nlooking forward to, I believe, Senator Corker offering an amendment on \nlegislation that passed out of the Foreign Relations Committee that \nwould establish a private, nonprofit grantmaking institution known as \nthe End Slavery Initiative Foundation to reduce the worst forms of \nforced labor and sexual servitude around the world. I was looking \nforward to having a serious debate about this important issue, and it \nis truly unfortunate that the debate has been sidelined by matters that \nare not to the core of the trafficking issue.\n  I rise to specifically address an amendment that I understand is \npending to attempt to hijack our debate about human trafficking. This \namendment is out of place and out of step with everything I believe we \nstand for in the Senate. It is an amendment to a bill that seeks to \namend the Constitution of the United States. It is an amendment offered \nby a Republican colleague that grows the government and increases \ntaxes. It is an amendment to a trafficking bill that could make people \nmore likely to be trafficked.\n  I am talking about the amendment to eliminate birthright citizenship \nand end the people's right to be citizens by being born on American \nsoil.\n  Birthright citizenship is a bedrock principle found not in law but in \nthe Constitution. The 14th Amendment states clearly that ``all persons \nborn or naturalized in the United States and subject to the \njurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the \nState wherein they reside.''\n  For 115 years the obvious and plain meaning that people born on \nAmerican soil are American citizens has been affirmed before the \nSupreme Court and can only be changed by a constitutional amendment. My \ncolleague from Louisiana instead presents a bill and tries to argue \nwith the Supreme Court and the English language by claiming \nundocumented immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction thereof. Is \nhe suggesting, for example, that if an undocumented immigrant was \nbrought to court, he or she wouldn't be subject to the court's \njurisdiction? Clearly not. And the civil rights leaders who drafted the \n14th Amendment didn't think so either.\n  Instead, the 14th Amendment was adopted after the infamous Dred Scott\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\ndecision to make sure the United States never has an unequal class \nsystem. This principle, that America isn't a country club, is a \nprofound American value. If my friend from Louisiana wants to change \nthe Constitution, he should abide by the framework our Founding Fathers \nset up.\n  If a Senator wants to make a monumental change to how our Nation \ndefines citizenship in the Constitution, he or she must go to the \nconstitutional amending process our Founding Fathers set up to make \nsure we have widespread and overwhelming consensus. That is why the \nFounders created a process in which amending the Constitution needed a \nbroad swath of the American population to say, yes, that is worthy of \nchanging the Constitution that has worked so well for us for so many \nyears. We are here to protect the Constitution, and the 14th Amendment \nis sacrosanct and too important to be defined by the political and \ndiscriminatory impulses of any Member of Congress.\n  But beyond trying to change our Constitution with a piece of \nlegislation, my friend from Louisiana's amendment to a human \ntrafficking bill could make human trafficking worse. Eliminating \nbirthright citizenship would create a perpetual class of undocumented \nimmigrants, ironically growing the undocumented population by ensuring \nthat undocumented children, and their children born here, would become \nundocumented, and their children and their children's children could \nnever come out of the shadows and be equal under the law.\n  This new permanent underclass would inevitably lead to some without \nany citizenship in any country; in other words, they would be \nstateless. This new underclass would be subject to the worst forms of \nexploitation, including, for some, becoming victims of human \ntrafficking themselves.\n  But the irony doesn't stop there. For the party of limited government \nand low taxes, my friend from Louisiana proposes an amendment that \nwould put the Department of Homeland Security in every delivery room \nand require the creation of a brandnew, extensive bureaucracy with \nburdensome procedures. It would also create a de facto birth tax for \npeople to have to go back and prove their citizenship.\n  My friend from Louisiana tries to justify all this by saying it will \nprevent people from coming to the United States solely to give birth, \nbut I don't even know if he truly believes that explanation. It ignores \nthe plain fact that the practice he describes is already illegal under \nthe law.\n  If he wants to get into a discussion about enforcing the existing \nlaw, I am always willing to talk about the need for more resources for \nthe men and women in law enforcement in order to be able to do that. \nThis amendment wouldn't make the practice he describes one bit more \nillegal, but it would change the Constitution of the United States by a \nsimple passage of the Senate, not as an amendment to the Constitution.\n  This isn't the time and this isn't the place for an amendment \nattacking birthright citizenship. A bill isn't the place or the venue \nto change the Constitution. A bill on human trafficking isn't the time \nfor a measure that might increase human trafficking.\n  Frankly, for someone who wants limited government, they shouldn't put \nthe Department of Homeland Security in the delivery room. This is just \nanother attack on immigrants that is against American values and in \nthis case against our Constitution. We can do far better than that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act legislation that has been \ndrafted and introduced by my good friends Senator John Cornyn of Texas \nand Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. The bill helps survivors of \nhuman trafficking and child pornography and aids law enforcement in \ndiscouraging demand for these serious crimes.\n  This is a bill they originally introduced in 2013. I was a cosponsor \nof that bill, and I am also an original cosponsor of this bipartisan \nlegislation which was introduced earlier this year because I believe it \nis very important legislation. It is important because it not only \ncompensates victims of human trafficking and other crimes of \nexploitation for their injuries but also provides resources to help law \nenforcement prevent such crimes in the future by targeting demand.\n  The need for this bill is real and it is troubling. Every year across \nAmerica, children and adults are bought and sold for reprehensible \npurposes. According to the National Center For Missing and Exploited \nChildren, at least 100,000 American children each year are the victims \nof commercial child prostitution and child trafficking. It is not just \na big-State, big-city problem. Every State in the country is facing \nthis issue, including my home State of North Dakota, but we currently \nhave trouble addressing this problem because of the many needs, \nincluding the need for resources.\n  After consultation with the attorney general's office, we learned \nthat North Dakota has had difficulty applying for anti-human \ntrafficking grants because to be eligible, the Department of Justice \nrequires at least 2 years of local data on human trafficking. In recent \nyears, North Dakota has been the fastest growing State in the country \nin terms of both population and income growth. Consequently, North \nDakota has only recently seen a sudden increase in human trafficking \nissues. To remedy that, I have offered an amendment to the Cornyn-\nKlobuchar bill to make sure it does not mandate a required time period \nof collected data. The proposed amendment clarifies that a local or \nState government with a worthy trafficking initiative will not be \nprecluded from receiving funds under the Cornyn-Klobuchar legislation \nbecause they, like North Dakota, have only recently begun collecting \ndata on human trafficking. They only have to demonstrate a valid need, \nwhich is, of course, significant and growing across the country.\n  Here is what a group of victims support groups and law enforcement \norganizations had to say:\n\n       Women and children, especially girls, are advertised online \n     where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and \n     impunity. This happens in every city, in every State.\n\n  There are few issues that we as a governing body can be more unified \non than that our children are precious and that it is our duty to \nprotect them. For this reason, the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill has strong \nbipartisan support in the Senate, and I believe it will also be \nsupported in the House. While it may need some amending here and there, \nwe all recognize we could be doing more to help victims of human \ntrafficking, child pornography, and other crimes of exploitation \nagainst children and vulnerable adults. These often-invisible victims \nnot only need to be rescued from their situation, but they also need \nmedical, mental health, housing, legal, and other important services.\n  The Cornyn-Klobuchar bill addresses the need to do more head-on. It \nestablishes the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which is paid for \nthrough fines on persons convicted of child pornography, human \ntrafficking, child prostitution, sexual exploitation, and human \nsmuggling offenses.\n  Under current law those convicted of child abuse, trafficking, and \nrelated crimes must pay just a $100 special assessment fee. Under this \nlegislation that fee is increased to $5,000 for every individual \nconvicted of human trafficking, child pornography, and other forms of \nchild exploitation. Those funds go to the Domestic Trafficking Victims' \nFund, which will be used to increase the Federal resources available \nfor human trafficking victims by $7 million a year over a 5-year \ntimeframe, for a total of $35 million.\n  Funding will be awarded as block grants to State and local \ngovernments under the Victim-Centered Human Trafficking Deterrence \nBlock Grant Program. The purpose of these grants is to develop and \nimplement victim-centered programs that train law enforcement to rescue \ntrafficking survivors, prosecute traffickers and pornographers, and \nhelp to restore the lives of their innocent victims.\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\n  In addition, the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act does a \nnumber of things, including making sure that victims get restitution \nand witnesses get rewards for cooperating with law enforcement before \nothers, encouraging prosecutors to get training on restitution in human \ntrafficking cases, and giving law enforcement greater authority to \nseize the assets of convicted human traffickers.\n  It protects victims and witnesses by requiring human traffickers to \nbe treated as violent criminals for purposes of pretrial release and \ndetention pending judicial proceedings.\n  It ensures that Federal crime victims are informed of any plea \nbargain or deferred prosecution agreement in their case and clarifies \nthat the ordinary standard of appellate review applies in cases \nconcerning Federal crime victims' rights petitions.\n  It recognizes that child pornography production is a form of human \ntrafficking and ensures that victims have access to direct services at \nchild advocacy centers to help them heal.\n  It allows State and local human trafficking task forces to get \nwiretap warrants within their own State courts without Federal \napproval. That will help them to more effectively investigate crimes of \nchild pornography, child exploitation, and human trafficking.\n  In addition, the bill improves nationwide communications so that law \nenforcement can better track and capture traffickers and child \npornographers. It ensures regular reporting on the number of human \ntrafficking crimes for purposes of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting \nProgram. It also requires law enforcement to upload photos of missing \nindividuals into the National Criminal Information Center database and \nnotifies the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children of any \nchild reported missing from foster care.\n  Finally, it strengthens the current law to reduce demand for human \ntrafficking by encouraging police, prosecutors, judges, and juries to \ntarget all persons involved in the buying and selling of human \ntrafficking victims. It is wrong to prosecute victims and to fail to \nprosecute those who prey on them.\n  The value and importance of this bill are reflected in the broad \ncoalition of victims' rights and law enforcement organizations that \nsupport it. It has been endorsed by nearly 200 groups, from the \nFraternal Order of Police, to the National Center For Missing and \nExploited Children.\n  We need to pass the Cornyn-Klobuchar legislation because crimes such \nas human trafficking and child pornography target the most vulnerable \namong us in a most despicable way. I urge all of my colleagues to pass \nthis bill to put an end to modern-day slavery and to help victims get \nthe support they need.\n  Again, I would like to close with my request to our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle that we be allowed to proceed on the bill and \nagain reference the importance of including my amendment, which ensures \nthat all States, including those that have seen a recent real increase \nin human trafficking, have access to funds so that they can truly help \nvictims in their State combat human trafficking in their State in \nconjunction with local law enforcement.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  All this week I have come to the floor to talk about this issue of \nbirthright citizenship and to offer my amendment that would end that \npolicy. I come to the floor again on that issue.\n  I have an amendment pending on this bill to change that policy, to \nend birthright citizenship. I would like to read a statement on the \nsubject:\n\n       The American people are upset, and I think they have a \n     right to be upset, but they are upset for a reason. Our \n     immigration policies, regulating all aspects of entry to \n     the United States, have simply ceased to function in the \n     national interest. ``Immigration policy'' and ``national \n     interest'' are terms that are rarely heard in the context \n     of immigration. We seem to have lost sight of the fact \n     that it is a public policy and, like all public policies, \n     our immigration policy should serve the public interest. \n     But they do not.\n       Let us talk about legal immigration.\n       We now admit the equivalent of a major city every year, \n     without having the vaguest idea of how we will educate all \n     the new children, care for the sick, provide housing, jobs, \n     build infrastructure, or attend to any of the human needs of \n     the newcomers or those already here.\n       Mr. President, each year, we admit--I repeat--the \n     equivalent of a major city. We admit more people each year \n     than make up some of our States. We admit a new State with \n     legal immigrants every year.\n       At a time of huge budget deficits and severe financial \n     constraints, we have no idea of how these huge costs will be \n     borne. We just do it.\n       We admit the equivalent of a major city without any \n     assessment of whether these newcomers are likely to be \n     contributing members of our society. Only a tiny fraction of \n     those admitted each year enter because they have skills and \n     abilities that will benefit our country. The rest come merely \n     because they happen to be relatives of other recent \n     immigrants. The result of this so-called policy is that there \n     is now a backlog of almost 3\\1/2\\ million people--the \n     population of a city the size of Los Angeles--who have a \n     claim to immigrate to the United States for no other reason \n     than they are somebody's relative. Is this really a way to \n     run immigration policy?\n       If making it easy to be an illegal alien is not enough, how \n     about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant? No \n     sane country would do that, right? Guess again. If you break \n     our laws by entering this country without permission and give \n     birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship \n     and guarantee full access to all public and social services \n     this society provides. And that is a lot of services. Is it \n     any wonder that two-thirds of the babies born at taxpayer \n     expense in county-run hospitals in Los Angeles are born to \n     illegal alien mothers?\n\n  This is not my statement. This is Senator Harry Reid's statement on \nthe floor of the Senate, including his strong support for an end to \nbirthright citizenship, that he gave on September 20, 1993, to which I \nrefer my colleagues' attention.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Reid for his prior words in strong \nsupport of what he yesterday called, quote, Vitter's stupid amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Wildfire Prevention\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this morning, in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, there was a very valuable hearing on a bipartisan \npiece of legislation called the Sportsmen's Act, obviously designed to \npromote hunting and fishing activities which are so important to \nOregonians and something our people just enjoy immensely.\n  I was not able to sit through the whole hearing because we had \nimportant business in the Finance Committee, but I got a flavor of it \nby listening to parts of it here and there. When it came to my turn to \nask questions, I pointed out that one cannot go into the woods and hunt \nand fish if the woods are burning up. My sense is--particularly after \nwhat I learned last weekend--that is exactly what we are going to be \nfacing, particularly in the West, and we are going to be facing it \nsooner rather than later.\n  We all know the Senate left on Wednesday in order to avoid the \nsnowstorms, so I basically flew all night to make it to Medford, OR, \nfor a fire briefing on Thursday. The idea that we would need to have a \nfire briefing in March was pretty much unheard of years ago. The fire \nseason was something we faced in the summer or maybe in the early \nsummer we would have a briefing on the challenges and what resources \nthe local officials and Forest Service would need, such as tankers and \nthe like.\n  Fires are now a year-round proposition. They are getting bigger, \nhotter, lasting longer, and they are infernos.\n  What I was told last week in my home State in Medford is that they \nare facing the driest fire season in 25 years. They took out the map \nand showed us California, which looks bone dry. After that eye-opening \nbriefing, I went on to Lane County, which is closer to Portland. It is \nfurther up the valley. They said they had the least snow in 10 years \nand so they were just as concerned as Medford.\n  Malheur County has already asked our Governor to declare a State \ndrought emergency due to record low snowpack and below average water \nrunoff, and these drought declarations usually don't come until months \nand months later.\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\n  One of the reasons I wanted to come to the floor is to highlight how \nserious this fire season is going to be. This ought to be a wake-up \ncall for all Americans because this is going to put pressure on scarce \nresources, in my view, like we have never seen before.\n  These firefighters, as the Presiding Officer knows, are incredibly \ndedicated and patriotic people. But when we have fires in multiple \nareas, trying to move resources around quickly becomes a huge \nchallenge, and it is particularly challenging when the system of \nfighting wildfires in America is broken. I can't describe it any other \nway than it being essentially broken and badly in need of repair.\n  The heart of the problem is that Federal policy has consistently \nshorted the prevention accounts. So what they need to do is go in there \nand thin forests out and deal with underbrush, such as small trees that \npose the greatest risk of fire, and those accounts have been \nshortchanged for quite some time.\n  It gets hotter and drier on the forest floor. We can have a debate \nabout why that is. I happen to think climate change is a part of it, \nothers will cite other considerations, but what is indisputable is what \nis happening. It is hotter, drier, and in our part of the country there \nare frequent lightning strikes which can cause an inferno that leaps \nacross Federal and State and private lines.\n  When we have a huge fire on our hands, often what happens is the \ngovernment runs out of money to fight that megafire, and the handful of \nothers like it, so the government then--really the agencies--borrow \nfrom the prevention fund in order to put the fire out, and the problem \njust gets worse and worse and worse.\n  What Senator Crapo and I have proposed in the Senate--and there is a \nsimilar bipartisan effort in the House--is to change that. What we have \nsaid is that it is time for the government to fight these megafires--\njust the 1 percent or so of megafires--from the disaster account and \nnot shortchange the prevention fund because that is how we prevent \nthese infernos from taking place. We go in there and do the thinning, \nwe deal with the small trees and underbrush, and we prevent those big \nfires.\n  The budget office has actually given us an analysis that this is \npretty close to a wash from a budget standpoint, because if we only \nfight those megafires--the 1 or 2 percent--and we get solid, \nsubstantial benefits from prevention because we have prevented a \nmegafire, we really have not added to the budget.\n  By clearing away the fuels and reducing both the number and intensity \nof future fires, reducing the amount of fuel on the ground simply makes \nit easier for our courageous firefighters to stop a fire in its tracks.\n  I brought this poster to the floor this afternoon. It is not too hard \nto tell what the benefits are when we actually go out and receive these \nfuel treatments. It is clear this is a useful tool for holding down the \ndamage for communities and taxpayers. These fuel treatments can be \nparticularly beneficial for reducing wildfires and protecting our \npopulated areas.\n  My hope is that now we are finally starting to see what this fire \nseason is going to be like, that focusing on prevention and not raiding \nthe prevention fund to deal with those 1 percent of the megafires will \nhelp us get out ahead of the problem instead of spending substantially \nmore money and trying to play catchup as the infernos rip their way \nthrough the West.\n  I will close by saying that I think the bill Senator Crapo and I have \nintroduced is not the only answer to what we are going to be dealing \nwith this fire season, but it is an important one. Another approach I \nthink makes a great deal of sense is the Forest Service Collaborative \nForest Landscape Restoration Programs because, again, these help bring \ntogether people of differing political views and differing philosophies \nto clear flammable materials from our forests while producing saleable \ntimber for the mills.\n  In the Malheur National Forest in my home State, for one, the \nSouthern Blues Collaborative Project is a real success story. The \nstewardship contracts there not only helped clear the forests of \nunhealthy snags and hazardous wildfire fuels, they helped to bring the \nMalheur Lumber Company mill back from the brink of closure at least \nonce.\n  There is an effort at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage \nthese collaborative partnerships across the country. I commend the \nDepartment of Agriculture, Chief Tidwell in particular, for these \ncollaboratives because they are vital to the health and vitality of our \ncountry's forests, and they are a solid foundation for wildfire \nresponse.\n  I would also like to thank the President and the Forest Service for \nsupporting the bipartisan efforts of Senator Crapo and me, and a \nsimilar one that is underway in the House. To me, the bottom line is if \nwe can pass the legislation I have described here today and shore up \nour priority as being prevention while, at the same time, making better \nuse of existing money by saving the megafires we deal with for the \ndisaster fund, that gets us off to the races in terms of having a more \nsensible system for fighting wildfires; then, if we support the \ncollaboratives I have just described that are really floundering across \nthe country, and we are seeing more of them, we are seeing bigger \ncollaboratives; that is the kind of policy that helps us get out in \nfront of what is going to be, in my view, another dangerous fire \nseason. If we are just crossing our fingers and hoping somehow this \nfire season isn't going to be as bad as I was told last week in Medford \nand in Eugene--that doesn't make any sense to me, particularly given \nsome of the other activities in the Senate that have been bipartisan \npriorities.\n  That is why I felt compelled to come to the floor this afternoon \nbecause of the hearing this morning on sportsmen. We want to have those \nopportunities for sportsmen and fishermen and all of the people who \nwant to use our great natural resources. They are part of our heritage \nand they are a big shot in the arm economically as well. We are not \ngoing to be able to go into those woods this summer to hunt and fish if \nthey are burning up.\n  So I am very hopeful we can quickly pass the bipartisan legislation \nto change the way in which we fight wildfires, that we can shore up our \ncollaboratives which, dollar for dollar, are about as useful as \nanything that is done in the natural resources area. I encourage my \ncolleagues this afternoon, given what is looking us in the eye with \nrespect to this fire season, to join me in fixing the wildfire budget \nand encouraging collaborative partnerships that get us out in front of \nthe fires and end this catastrophic growth of wildfires, particularly \nin the Western United States.\n  Mr. President, I note that one of my colleagues is ready to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  My good friend from Wyoming was on the floor yesterday, I believe. He \nis a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act. He made a pretty \nsimple point that was reported in the press yesterday critical of the \nadministration for holding so many events talking about the success of \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  His suggestion was that we shouldn't be celebrating--the \nadministration shouldn't be celebrating--the success of the Affordable \nCare Act in terms of the number of people who are gaining access to it, \nthe stabilizing cost curve of health care expenditures all across the \ncountry, and the number of people whose emotional well-being is much \nbetter today because they don't have to worry about ever losing their \nhealth care simply because they get sick, or losing all of their \nsavings simply because their child comes down with an expensive \nillness.\n  I guess I would beg to differ because I talk to people all across my \nState of Connecticut who are celebrating today because the ACA works. \nThey are celebrating because their lives have been transformed by the \nfact that we now have finally made a commitment as a nation to make \nsure that if someone's son gets sick, they won't lose their savings, \ntheir college 529, their house, their car, just because of an illness.\n  I think the Affordable Care Act is something to celebrate because a \nlot of my constituents believe the same thing. Betsy from Litchfield, \nCT, said that without the Affordable Care Act, she would not have \nhealth insurance at\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\nall due to her preexisting condition. One month before the ACA was \nimplemented, she was sick with stage 4 cancer and her insurance company \ngave her 2 weeks' notice that it was going to end her coverage early. \nLuckily, Betsy was able to resolve that issue. But she says: ``The \nbottom line is that before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance \ncould and did kick sick people off of their rolls and `pre-existing \nconditions' left many uninsured indefinitely.''\n  She says:\n\n       If you are not insured and have to pay the outrageous costs \n     of U.S. health care out-of-pocket, you will quickly spend all \n     of your retirement savings. That was the situation I was \n     facing in December 2013 and it was an unsettling prospect.\n\n  Linda from Winsted, CT, says she is grateful for affordable health \ncare because she has multiple chronic illnesses such as diabetes, \nhypertension, and osteoarthritis. She was unable to buy health \ninsurance at any price because the health insurance companies were \ncharging her more because of her preexisting conditions. In Linda's \nview, this issue boils down to people having basic rights, the freedom \nto be healthy, the freedom for her to live a life in which she knows \nshe is going to be able to afford coverage for herself.\n  She said this in an email to me: ``There is no freedom in poverty and \ncertainly none in needless human suffering.''\n  So Betsy is celebrating today. Linda is celebrating today. There are \nmillions of others like them all across the country who know the \nAffordable Care Act is working.\n  But it is not just those individuals, it is newspapers, from the New \nYork Times to USA TODAY, and the Washington Post on down, that are \nsaying with a clear voice: ``The Affordable Care Act has achieved \nnearly all of its ambitious goals,'' and ``11.4 million Americans are \nnow signed up for health care.''\n  This is a success story all across the country, but a success story \nthat is at risk. It is at risk because of a Supreme Court which is \nconsidering an evisceration of the Affordable Care Act that would be a \nstunning act of judicial overreach if the plaintiffs were to succeed in \nthe King v. Burwell case. Their contention is simply that it was the \nintent of Congress to only provide insurance subsidies to States that \nhad State exchanges and not Federal exchanges. I haven't found a single \nSenator or Representative who voted for that law who says it was their \nintent to punish States that didn't establish State exchanges by \nwithholding subsidies from millions of Americans. In fact, there is no \nway to plainly read the statute without coming to the conclusion that \nsubsidies were not just intended but written into the law to go to \nevery single State, no matter what kind of exchange they decided to \nestablish. The law says that because it specifically states that States \nthat don't choose to set up their own exchange will have a Federal \nexchange take the place of that State exchange.\n\n  The totality of the law is clear as well. If the Federal Government \nhad intended to give subsidies only to States that had State exchanges, \nthey would have also made the insurance reforms contingent upon those \nState exchanges being established. Instead, the insurance reforms are \nnationwide, meaning that, clearly, the statute was set up to make \nsubsidies nationwide, because the insurance reforms cannot exist--\ncannot exist--without those subsidies being available to people to be \nable to buy affordable insurance.\n  It is not just the individuals who voted for this law who are clear \nthat subsidies should be available; it is the Congressional Budget \nOffice. The Congressional Budget Office reads statutes we pass, \nindependently interprets them, and then assesses a cost to the laws we \npass. Doug Elmendorf was before the Appropriations Committee yesterday \nand I asked him a simple question: When you independently reviewed the \nAffordable Care Act, did you come to the conclusion that it allowed for \nsubsidies to go to State and Federal exchanges? His answer was clear: \nYes. We read the Affordable Care Act as to provide insurance subsidies \nto both State exchanges and Federal exchanges and, thus, we priced the \nbill accordingly.\n  The law is clear. The law's intent is clear. The voices of those who \nvoted for it are clear. The independent Congressional Budget Office is \nclear. The Affordable Care Act only works if subsidies flow to both \nStates that have Federal exchanges and States that have State \nexchanges.\n  For families such as those of Betsy in Litchfield, CT, and Linda in \nWinsted, CT, who continue celebrating the success of the Affordable \nCare Act on the ground floor for the millions of lives that have been \ntransformed, this body needs to continue to stand up for the premise \nthat the Affordable Care Act continues to work. That is absolutely \nsomething to celebrate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would ask my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut--we have worked closely together on a number of items--a \nquestion or two relating to the fact that the CBO report recently came \nout--just on Monday--and mentioned that the benchmark policy next year \nis going to be up 8 percent across the board. The benchmark policy will \ngo up 8 percent, meaning higher premiums not just next year, but the \nyear after that, another 8 percent, and then another 8 percent. I would \nlike to know, as a Senator representing people and as a doctor, how \nmany people in his State believe that is actually a good deal. The \nPresident promised the people from his State that premiums would drop \nby $2,500 per family. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House--and my \nfriend from Connecticut was a Member of the House at the time--said \npremiums would drop for everyone.\n  So we are talking about specifically people buying policies on the \nexchange. Yet the numbers that came out Monday that the President of \nthe United States is celebrating--and my friend and colleague has a \nsign up about how this health care law is supposedly working--how that \nworks for people when next year they are going to pay 8 percent more \nand the year after that 8 percent more, and these are people who are \nactually getting subsidies who are buying the benchmark insurance \nthrough the exchange.\n  I know we are running short on time, but I would ask my colleague to \naddress that specific component because I hear about it every day.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I appreciate my friend's question and I will be quick in \nthe answer because I know we are running short on time.\n  I actually asked the CBO Director a question very similar to the one \nthe Senator from Wyoming proposes. I said: Explain to me why your \nreport actually says the Affordable Care Act is going to cost 10 \npercent less than you originally estimated and explain to me why the \ninsurance subsidies are going to cost 20 percent less than you \noriginally estimated.\n  His answer was very clear: It is because premiums have come in lower \nthan CBO initially estimated.\n  In fact, this year, Kaiser reviewed premiums within these exchanges \nall across the country and said the average premium increase from last \nyear to this year is 1 percent all across the country. In Connecticut, \nour biggest insurer increased their premiums by 1 percent. One of the \nother offerers on the exchange decreased their premiums by 10 percent. \nThe reason the Affordable Care Act is costing much less today is \nbecause our actual experience--not our estimated experience into the \nfuture--is that premiums are being stabilized in large part because of \nthe reforms in this act.\n  So if we want to talk about actual experience--what is happening on \nthe ground today--it is that we are seeing premiums coming in almost \nexactly where they were last year, this year, in comparison to 5 years \nago and 10 years ago when we were seeing double-digit increases in \npremiums from year to year.\n  So part of the reason I am celebrating this law, quite frankly, I say \nto my good friend, is because the actual experience from this year to \nlast year is that premiums are remaining stable and in some places like \nConnecticut are actually coming down, and the Affordable Care Act is \ncosting less money than was initially estimated by CBO, in large part \nbecause premiums are lower than expected.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would point out to my friend that the \nactual reason which he never addressed\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\nis that they are going up next year. CBO has suggested they are going \nto go up 8 percent next year, and 8 percent the year after that, and 8 \npercent the year after that.\n  The other issue, as he says, is the amount of money spent is because \nfewer people are signing up. People realize it is not a good deal. I \nthink the CBO at one point thought there would be 14 million people \nsigned up by this point and now it is only 11 million. So the fact that \npeople are deciding to not sign up--to not sign up--is one of the \nreasons the government, while still spending more money than they were \nin the past, is spending not quite as much as they thought they might \nhave to, had all the people the President thought would sign up for his \nidea signed up. So that seems to be the situation, when we actually go \ninto the CBO report.\n  I agree the total dollar figure is less than the high figure \nanticipated. It has come down some, but it is because fewer people have \nactually chosen to participate which is because the health care law \ncontinues to be unpopular. Many people think it is not a good deal for \nthem; that even though they have subsidies, they can't afford to meet \ntheir copay, meet their deductible. Many have insurance, but they can't \nsee a doctor. They have lost their doctor.\n  Those are some of the issues that I think were highlighted in that \nCBO report that the President ought to be honest about with the \nAmerican people. The reason for the celebration I think is very \npremature and actually in error because so many people have been harmed \nby this law.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I think I might not be alone, I say to my \ngood friend from Wyoming, in suggesting that most people probably would \nnot suggest that 11 million people signing up for health care means the \nlaw is unpopular. Indeed, we have seen a reduction by 25 percent in \nthose across the country who do not have insurance, in a year's worth \nof time. I think that is a pretty stunning uptake, and it shows how \ndesperately people wanted insurance. But, again, I asked the same \nquestion to the CBO head yesterday. His review of why there has been a \nslight differential--it is a pretty small one between what they \ninitially estimated and why people signed up--is because more companies \nare maintaining their own health care insurance, less cancellations are \nhappening, and, thus, there are fewer people who are uninsured. So this \nsecond argument as to how the sky was going to fall after health care \nreform, that you were going to see mass cancellations of policies, the \nCBO Director is saying the reason the number is coming in slightly \nbelow where it was initially estimated--albeit 11 million people have \ninsurance because of this law--is because employers are holding on to \ntheir insurance, even though we heard from many detractors of the law \nthere was going to be a mass exodus of private insurance plans. Twenty-\nfive percent fewer people have no insurance today. That is the bottom \nline. In Connecticut, 50 percent fewer people have no insurance. There \nis just no way to argue that we have not made a big dent in the number \nof uninsured because of this law's passage.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes be reserved for \nSenator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I point out that on Saturday, I am going to be in \nBuffalo, WY, at a health fair. As a doctor, I continue to attend health \nfairs around the State which are designed to bring low-cost health care \nscreenings to people. I know I will hear from folks there who are \nconcerned with the fact that the CBO has come out and said the premiums \nare going to go up 8 percent next year, and 8 percent the year after \nthat. Some of them are actually going to be on the ObamaCare exchange. \nI know some of them are people who had insurance that worked well for \nthem before the President passed his law, and their insurance was \ncanceled.\n  The President and the Senator from Connecticut may list them as \nsuccesses, but they don't believe it is that way. They had insurance. \nThey had insurance that they liked. It worked for them, and it worked \nfor their family. They had the benefits that were important for their \nfamily, things for which they needed insurance. The President, on the \nhealth care law, came out with this mandate that everyone buy health \ninsurance, and not just what worked for them. The President described \nit as essential benefits. I described them as excessive benefits, \nbecause there is a lot of insurance they are forced to buy, according \nto the law, that they do not need, do not want, cannot afford, and it \ndoes not even apply to their families. They have no choice in the \nmatter.\n  They have had to lose insurance that worked for them and buy \ninsurance that the President said they had to buy, even though it \nwasn't what was best for them and their families. They know what is \nbest for them and their families, not President Obama.\n  I expect while I am in Buffalo, WY, visiting people, listening to \nwhat they have to say at a health fair, I will hear stories such as \nthat because I do every weekend in Wyoming. People are concerned about \nthe cost. Even those who have been getting subsidies through the \nexchanges are noticing that deductibles are higher than their previous \ninsurance, and copays are higher. They are paying more. They are paying \nmore and getting less, which is why this health care law continues to \nbe unpopular across the country.\n  Take a look at any of the national numbers that are coming out, and \nyou are going to find many more people who feel they were harmed by the \nlaw than helped by the law. There is a ratio of more people who think \nthey were harmed than helped. More people want it repealed than \ncontinued. That is what we are seeing across the country with this \nhealth care law.\n  The President and I would say we should listen to the American people \nwho have these stories to tell. I was on the floor yesterday, and I \ntalked about a woman from Maine. There was an article in the paper in \nMaine. She found the whole experience that she has been going through \nnow frightening, and she has insurance through the exchange. She said \nit is a frightening experience. She did her taxes and found out that \nshe ended up owing a lot of money in taxes that she didn't know she was \ngoing to owe because of mistakes that were being made and the way the \nbookkeeping works. That is what is happening. H Block, the insurance \nfolks who do the calculation to help people file their policies, are \nsaying, on average, half of the people filing their returns this year \nare finding they are getting shocked and surprised that their amount of \nmoney coming in to the returns is a lot less, by an average of $530, \naccording to H Block. This is across the board.\n  There are a lot of disgruntled people who are disappointed in a \nPresident who made promises to them about a health care law, people who \ncan't keep their doctors, high deductibles they can't afford. A study \ncame out yesterday that many people with insurance can't afford \nanything close to the deductibles they are forced to be paying under \nthe President's insurance that they had to buy, many of whom lost the \ninsurance they liked. We see these problems, and the amount of \ngovernment waste in this program is incredible.\n  Oregon earlier this week shut down their exchange. The State of \nOregon spent $248 million putting together their own State exchange, \nand the Governor just signed something saying we are done with it. They \nhave not signed up one single person on the Oregon computer exchange \never--$248 million, taxpayer dollars, gone. Gone. The only people who \ncould sign up in Oregon had to do it by filling it out with paper and \npen. This is supposed to be--I heard President Obama--as easy as \nshopping on Amazon; insurance is cheaper than your cell phone; keep \nyour doctor if you like your doctor. That is not what happened under \nthis health care law. People lost their doctors and can't afford their \npolicies. It is a very complicated situation related to this. Then you \nget Washington State. It is State after State--13,000 people had too \nmuch money taken out of their checking account as just part of the \nregular process of the monthly withdrawals.\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1471-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1471-S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF CHRISTOPHER A. HART TO BE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL \n                      TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF THO DINH-ZARR TO BE A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL \n                      TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Christopher A. Hart, of \nColorado, to be Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board \nfor a term of two years; and Tho Dinh-Zarr, of Texas, to be a Member of \nthe National Transportation Safety Board for the remainder of the term \nexpiring December 31, 2018.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on a number of issues. I \nrise in support of the nominations of Christopher Hart to be chairman \nand Bella Dinh-Zarr to be a board member of the National Transportation \nSafety Board.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board helps keep all of us safe. \nWhen a terrible crash happens, we watch on television or read about the \ncrash and wonder what happened. But it is the National Transportation \nSafety Board that steps in. During those first moments, they get in, \npreserve evidence, sift through the debris, and then figure out what \nwent wrong.\n  They play a difficult role. They must put aside all differences \nbetween jurisdictions, politics, and partisanship to get the job \ndone. In the last month alone, the board has launched investigations \ninto a ship collision in Texas, a plane veering off the runway in New \nYork, two terrible and fatal train crashes in New York and California, \nand a tragic incident in DC where smoke filled one of the Metro tunnels \nand resulted in a passenger dying.\n\n  They are also helping with an oil train derailment in West Virginia \nand one in Illinois that sparked fires and an evacuation. Their work \nplays a critical role in guiding our decisions about safety and their \nrecommendations have influenced safety improvements. They have played a \nrole in everything from drunk driving and seatbelt laws to the amount \nof rest that pilots and truck drivers should get, and they are also \nhelping to shape the safety requirements of travel in the future.\n  In October of last year, a test flight for commercial space flight \nended in tragedy when an experimental spacecraft broke apart in \nmidflight over the desert in California.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board stepped in to investigate \nthe tragic accident. They are still conducting the investigation, and \nthe results are going to help us better address the future safety of \ncommercial space flight to and from the edge of space, which is what \nthat spacecraft was designed to do. This is why it is so critical that \nwe select people with technical knowledge and human compassion to put \nthe pieces of these tragedies back together.\n  We have two great nominees. Christopher Hart is a dedicated public \nservant with an extensive career in transportation safety. He has \nserved as Vice Chairman of the NTSB for 5 years; and since April 2014, \nhe has served as the Acting Chairman of that agency.\n  Like Mr. Hart, Dr. Bella Dinh-Zarr has a distinguished career in \ntransportation safety. She currently serves as the director of the FIA \nFoundation, which is dedicated to promoting safe and sustainable \ntransportation.\n  Previously, Dr. Dinh-Zarr worked in various safety capacities with \nthe Make Roads Safe campaign, the American Automobile Association, and \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n  They are both good leaders, and I ask the Senate to join me in \nsupporting their nominations.\n\n\n                             Takata Airbags\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to provide the Senate with an update on what \nevery Senator has had their attention called to--the Takata airbag \nrecall. We have seen five deaths. We have seen a spate of serious \ninjuries related to these defective airbags. One of the deaths occurred \nin my home State of Florida.\n  Through my position of working with Chairman John Thune of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I have been pushing \nTakata and the automakers to speed up fixes for these defective \nairbags.\n  People are driving around with a lethal bomb in their steering wheel. \nIf it is defective and it goes off, they are filled with shrapnel. That \nhas killed five people. It is documented in this country that it has \nkilled five people.\n  Nobody ought to be driving, therefore, a car for months when, in \nfact, they have a known defect that can seriously kill them.\n  Well, it is just not acceptable, and the progress has been painfully \nslow. We received a letter from NHTSA noting that only 2 million of the \nvehicles recently recalled--2 million of 17 million--are all that have \nbeen repaired as of the end of last year.\n  That letter notes that Takata has continued to stonewall NHTSA's \nrequest for documents related to the defect. It is now being fined \n$14,000 a day until they start cooperating fully. They have also failed \nto produce a number of critical documents that the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee has requested as part of its investigation \ninto this mess.\n  Earlier today, Senator Thune and I sent a letter to Takata again \nrequesting that they turn over these documents to the committee as soon \nas possible so that we can complete our investigation into how this \nmess happened and, very importantly, how we can get people's cars fixed \nso they are not driving around with this bomb about to explode in their \nsteering wheel. Safety can't wait.\n\n\n                              Bob Levinson\n\n  Mr. President, sadly, this week is the eighth year that Bob Levinson, \na retired FBI agent who disappeared on a tourist island in Iran called \nKish Island, has not been seen or heard from. He has a wife and seven \nchildren.\n  A couple of years ago, the family received a video. A few months \nafter that, they received a photo.\n  In these extensive discussions with Iran over matters of war and \npeace as to whether Iran is going to be willing to step down and not \nhave a nuclear weapon, one of the discussion items also is not only the \nthree known Americans in captivity in Iran but Bob Levinson, who has \nbeen missing for 8 years.\n  Only the Iranian Government can produce the evidence of what has \nhappened to Bob and where he is, and we continue that vigil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on \ntwo nominees who are critical to ensuring the safety of our Nation's \ntransportation network: Christopher Hart, to be Chairman of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, also known as the NTSB, and Bella \nDinh-Zarr to be a member of the Board.\n  Mr. Hart has a distinguished career in aviation safety and has served \nwith distinction as acting chair in recent months.\n  Dr. Dinh-Zarr has a distinguished career in auto safety and will \nbring an important perspective and background to the board.\n  Right now, the NTSB only has three members, with one--Mr. Hart--\nserving as Acting Chairman. Today's vote will add another member and \nensure Mr. Hart is Chairman in an official capacity. It is imperative \nthat we have a strong, long-term team at the helm. As a member of the \nCommerce Committee, I know there is much important work ahead for the \nagency.\n  The NTSB is charged by Congress with investigating every civil \naviation accident in the United States as well as\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\nsignificant accidents in the other modes of transportation--railroad, \nhighway, marine, and pipeline--and issuing safety recommendations to \nagencies and others in the transportation industry aimed at preventing \nfuture accidents.\n  It is not a regulatory or oversight agency; rather, it has a unique \ntask--investigating safety issues and accidents and then making \nrecommendations on how we can save lives. It is independent, and this \nensures that agencies that regulate and oversee safety aren't \ninvestigating themselves when and if there are potential lapses in \ntheir oversight.\n  The NTSB's work is critical--and it has been very busy recently--\nespecially in my region. Last month, we saw a horrific collision at a \nrailway crossing just outside of New York City on our commuter \nrailroad, Metro-North. The tragic incident killed six, including a \nresident of Danbury, CT. The NTSB is investigating that crash, and its \nfinding will help us so we don't have to witness similar disasters \nagain. Having a full board helps this important work move forward.\n  This recent investigation comes after the NTSB dedicated tremendous \nresources and hours into investigating other horrific incidents on \nMetro-North in 2013 and 2014. At one point, all of the NTSB's rail \ninvestigators worked on that one investigation, which resulted in a \nsubstantial report last November. The NTSB's conclusions in that report \nhave been a guidepost for reform. At the same time, the NTSB has been \nbusy investigating other major incidents such as rail-grade crossings \nelsewhere in our country, like in southern California, derailments of \ntrains carrying crude oil, like in West Virginia, plane crashes, major \nhighway disasters, and significant transit incidents.\n  The NTSB is also evaluating other issues, such as the safety of \npassenger vehicle tires, distracted driving, substance abuse in the \ntransportation sector, and ensuring procedural compliance by \ntransportation providers. It is a long and extensive list of projects.\n  We need these nominees in their posts immediately so they can keep \nthese investigations moving forward and bolster the NTSB's critical \nwork. And I note that here in Congress, we need to do our part as well \nto advance the NTSB's efforts and findings, which include ensuring \nrailroads install positive train control, or PTC, which was first urged \nby NTSB after a rail collision in 1969 in Darien; requiring advanced \ntechnology like cameras in trains; requiring railroads to have \nredundant signal protection, which, had it been in place, would have \nsaved the life of one of my constituents; requiring better fatigue \nmanagement in all modes of transportation; improving the \ncrashworthiness of passenger rail cars; and ensuring labor has a voice \nin safety investigations, among many key reforms.\n  Thankfully, we have before us today two supremely qualified nominees \nwho will help us advance these key initiatives and make our \ntransportation network safer, more secure, and more reliable. Again, I \nurge my colleagues to support them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Human Trafficking\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, all week we have been on an important \npiece of legislation on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. \nJust to remind everybody, this is a bill to treat child prostitutes not \nas criminals but as the victims they are--obviously, beneath the age of \nconsent--and to recognize that the criminal organizations that traffic \nin human flesh for sale, economic, sex, and other reasons, are a real \nproblem in our society. So much of what happens in this trade is really \nnothing more or nothing less than modern-day slavery--something we \nthought was relegated to the history books and didn't exist in the \nUnited States of America, the freest country in the world.\n  We got here through a rather strange set of circumstances, because \nthe legislation that I introduced was broadly bipartisan--which is a \nnovelty these days. We had 10 Democratic cosponsors of the legislation.\n  Then, when we had a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee--Chairman \nGrassley kindly called up that bill in February--we had a unanimous \nvote of the Senate Judiciary Committee. All Republicans and all \nDemocrats voted for it.\n  Then we had another unusual development. Majority Leader McConnell \nwas left wondering: Am I going to have to go through procedural steps \nto get the bill to the floor? The minority, our Democratic friends, \nsaid, I think, fairly: This is not a controversial piece of \nlegislation. We are going to agree to get on the legislation.\n  But then something very strange happened. All of a sudden, some of \nour Democratic friends, including the Democratic leader, said: We are \ngoing to filibuster this legislation. You can imagine my surprise after \nthat bipartisan record of cooperation leading up to that point.\n  I was even more surprised when the stated reason for that was a \nprovision in the bill, which was as plain as the nose on your face, and \nit actually was a provision of the law that was voted on unanimously by \nall of our Democratic friends late last year.\n  So it is a provision that has been the law of the land for 39 years, \nwhich they reaffirmed with their vote just late last year.\n  This is what one of the 200 groups--law enforcement and victims \ngroups--had to say about this discovery this week of this \nappropriations provision known as the Hyde amendment. It said: ``Senate \nDemocrats are choosing a phantom problem over real victims.''\n  So I wish to take a minute to think about who is actually paying the \nprice for the political games that are going on in the Senate. Who is \nbearing the consequences? Is it going to be the Republican Party or the \nDemocratic Party in the next election? That seems to be the rage in \nWashington, DC. People want to talk about the politics.\n  But here we have children, typically between the age of 12 and 14, \nmainly girls, who are trafficked for sex and who have nowhere to turn. \nOur bill gives them an opportunity to begin to heal by penalizing the \nvery people who demand this sex trade, taking that money and diverting \nit into services for the victims.\n  Reflecting on what has happened this week and thinking that surely we \ncan all get together on something as bipartisan as combatting human sex \ntrafficking for children, surely we can finally come together, all join \nhands together and support this important legislation, I had to \nreflect: Why in the world would they ever want to come to the Senate if \nthey are not going to try to help make the lives of these victims of \nhuman trafficking just a little better? I mean, we are all used to the \nhardball of elections and politics. We get it. We are all volunteers. \nWe are grownup men and women. But these children shouldn't have to pay \nthe price for the political games that are going on in the Senate. And \nit is not only this legislation.\n  I think it really speaks to: Why in the world would anybody want to \nserve in a body where all we are doing is filling space and throwing \nobstacles to the passage of bipartisan legislation that is going to \nhelp some of the vulnerable people in our society?\n  If this is our legacy, I just have to say: Shame on us. Shame on \nthose who would put partisan political games and phantom problems ahead \nof the welfare of these child victims of human trafficking.\n  Is this the legacy that any Member of the Senate, Republican or \nDemocratic, would want to be known by? Yes, they served in the Senate, \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world. But do you know what they \nare remembered for? For stopping help for child victims of human \ntrafficking. That is their legacy. Does anyone want that? I don't think \nso.\n  Why in the world would we squander a perfectly good opportunity to do \neverything we can? This isn't a panacea. This isn't going to all of a \nsudden wipe out the issue of human trafficking in America, but it is a \nsmall first step to dedicate $30 million in a crime victims \ncompensation fund--paid for by the very people who purchased these \nservices and who are convicted and pay fines. This is a first step to \ntake that $30 million and to divert it to help the victims of this \nsordid crime to begin to heal.\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\n  So I ask our colleagues to reconsider, to reflect on why they are \nhere--just to play partisan games, or are they actually here to do some \ngood? Is this what they want to be known by? Is this how you want to be \nremembered by your children and grandchildren? Is this how you want to \nbe remembered in our history books? And why in the world would you come \nto the Senate only to squander the opportunity to do something good for \nthe most vulnerable people in our country by blocking this legislation \nover a provision of law which has been the law of the land for 39 years \nand which all of our Democratic friends have repeatedly voted for time \nand time again, as recently as late last year in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill?\n\n  This is a phantom problem, and they are choosing a phantom problem \nover real victims. It is beyond belief and I think deeply depressing. \nBut there is an opportunity for our colleagues to rise above this \npartisanship they have displayed and to do the right thing. One would \nthink the 10 people who have been cosponsors of the legislation would \nbe for advancing this legislation, as well as all the members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats alike. One would \nthink that since they have already voted for this provision, they would \ndo so again and let us consider it, along with an open amendment \nprocess.\n  In the end, this isn't hurting us or other Senators. This isn't just \npoisoning the well here in Washington, DC, making it harder and harder \nfor us to get things done; this isn't just poisoning our reputation in \nthe eyes of the people we represent around the country who look to \nWashington and see nothing but dysfunction; it is squandering an \nopportunity to help vulnerable children who are the victims of this \nsordid sex trafficking. I hope my colleagues will reconsider and allow \nus to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                   unanimous consent request--S. 178\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the bipartisan Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act will go a long way to fight the scourge of modern-day \nhuman slavery. It was introduced back in January by a Republican, \nSenator Cornyn, and a Democrat, Senator Klobuchar. As is done with all \nlegislation, it was posted on the Internet for everyone to read.\n  Not long after, 14 female senators on the Democrat side joined their \nfemale counterparts on the Republican side to call for a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on the matter. Chairman Grassley is committed to \nfighting human trafficking. So not only did he hold the hearing they \nrequested, he promptly scheduled a markup on legislation to combat \nmodern human slavery, including the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct. That markup was conducted in an open and transparent way. The \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act was debated and amended in \ncommittee.\n  For example, the senior senator from Connecticut offered an amendment \nto this bipartisan bill on behalf of himself and the junior senator \nfrom Illinois. That amendment was approved.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was reported unanimously \nto the floor. Every single Democrat on the Judiciary Committee voted \nfor it. Every single one. Soon after, the junior Senator from North \nDakota called on me to take up this bill, which I was happy to do.\n  The Democratic Majority did not bring this bill to the floor in the \nlast Congress, and I was determined to try to do something about the \nterrible problem of human trafficking. Just a few days ago, every \nsingle Democrat consented to the Senate taking up this bipartisan bill. \nThe Democrat Leader even committed to work to clear any problems that \nwould arise on his side of the aisle, although he said he doubted that \nany would.\n  Well, no sooner had these words been uttered, then our Democrat \ncolleagues began complaining about a provision that was sitting on page \nfour of the bill. This provision was in there when this bipartisan bill \nwas introduced. It was in there when the committee held a hearing on \nit. It was in there when the committee marked it up--at which point \nevery single Democrat voted for it. And it was in there when every \nDemocrat in the Senate agreed to proceed to it on the floor. But now \nthey are complaining about it and even threatening to filibuster this \ncritical human rights bill over it.\n  Now, I understand threatening to filibuster a bill that you oppose. \nBut our colleagues are threatening to filibuster a bipartisan bill that \nthey have co-sponsored, voted for, or in some cases, done both.\n  We have been reasonable throughout this process. Consistent with that \napproach, I suggest we resolve this bizarre issue the way the Senate \nhas traditionally done. I will be proposing a consent agreement where \nour friends on the other side of the aisle will get to offer a motion \nto strike a provision that so many Democrats voted to support in the \npast. As part of my offer, I would further propose that such an \namendment be the first amendment in order, and that it be decided as a \nsimple up-or-down vote. That is as fair as one can be. An up-or-down \nvote at a simple majority threshold.\n  Not only is that the regular order way to resolve this issue, it is \nalso the way that leading antitrafficking groups have said we should \nresolve this issue. For example, an official from the Coalition Against \nTrafficking in Women said, ``Senate Democrats are choosing a phantom \nproblem over real victims.'' She said Senate Democrats should offer an \namendment to strip out the provision if they don't like it. And then \nshe said, ``Win or lose and move on.''\n  I think that is good advice, Mr. President. That is precisely what I \nam going to suggest. And I hope my Democratic colleagues will take \n``yes'' for an answer.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Texas, who has been a leader on this \nissue and is the craftsman of this bill--as has Senator Grassley, the \nchairman of the committee--has laid out how we got to where we are. It \nis sort of a mind-boggling, twisted path that makes almost no sense \neven to the casual observer. The dilemma seems to be that our \nDemocratic friends, having read and signed off on this bill all along \nthe way, have suddenly discovered a piece of it they do not like. Well, \nof course, the way to eliminate a piece you don't like would be to vote \non it.\n  So I am going to offer a unanimous consent agreement that would give \nour friends on the other side an opportunity for an up-or-down, simple \nmajority vote on the provision they have recently discovered, after \nreading the bill for 2 months, that they find offensive. I will give \nthem an opportunity with a simple majority vote to strike the provision \nwhich they find objectionable and which Senator Cornyn has pointed out \nhas been part of the law for 39 years.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S. 178, that it be in order for Senator Leahy or his \ndesignee to offer an amendment to strike the limitations language; that \nthere be up to 1 hour of debate on the amendment equally divided \nbetween the managers or their designees; and that following the use or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate vote on the amendment; further, \nthat following disposition of this amendment, the managers or their \ndesignees be allowed to offer amendments in an alternating fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend the senior Senator from Texas \ncould write a book on how the Senate has been dysfunctional. That \nchapter, which would become a huge part of what he would be writing \nabout, would be on what has happened in the last 6 years. Talk about \ndysfunction. The Republicans have basically filibustered everything, \nand I mean everything--everything. The decision was made after Obama \nwas elected that they weren't going to support anything, and to your \ncredit, I say to the Presiding Officer and all Republicans, you stuck \nwith it. You supported nothing Obama wanted to get done. So let's not \ntalk about the dysfunction of the Senate because the book on that has \nbeen written by the Republican minority for the last 6 years.\n  Mr. President, the legislation dealing with human trafficking is \ngoing to pass this Congress, but it is going to pass this Congress \nwithout abortion language in it.\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\n  There has been a lot of talk in the last couple of days about how to \nhandle this issue, and the way to handle the issue is very simple: Just \ntake it out of the bill. It could be done with a consent agreement in \nthe matter of a second or two. So that is what we proposed, and we have \nbeen proposing it for the last several days. Take the abortion language \nout of this bill. If my Republican colleagues want to get something \ndone, just take the abortion politics out of this bill. Unfortunately, \nfor those who want to see this trafficking bill pass, Republicans are \nignoring the obvious path forward while setting a new low standard on \nall bipartisan business that is conducted in the Senate.\n  By saying that Democrats should always assume their Republican \npartners are just not being forthright, I guess it is our fault because \ntime and time again, whether it is on the funding of Homeland Security \nor whether it is trying to solve a problem we have in the Middle East, \nthere is always something that comes out of nowhere--something so \nunusual, so unbelievable that we would have 47 Senators sign a letter \ndirected to the Ayatollah. Never in the 200 years of this body has \nthere been this level of interference in negotiations by the President \nuntil just a few days ago.\n  The bottom line is this: Democratic Senators have been working in \ngood faith on this critical legislation for years. Assuming their \nRepublican partners were being forthright when they provided a list of \nchanges that did not include the addition of the Hyde language, \nRepublicans are now saying that trusting them was a mistake.\n  There is a clear path forward to passing this trafficking bill, which \nis the goal shared, I hope, by Democrats and Republicans. Republicans \nshould work with us to remove the unrelated abortion language that has \nno business being in this bill. Democrats are open to any number of \nways to improve the language in this bill, but it is so simple: Just \ntake it out. Take the abortion language out.\n  Today, Senator Leahy, a senior Member of this body, submitted text \nthat omits the abortion language. One way forward would be for the \nSenate to adopt, not simply vote on, this text. Voting to reject the \nchange Democrats are seeking, as Senator McConnell says he wants to do \ntoday, is not a viable path forward since it does not address \nDemocrats' concern that abortion language has no place in a bill \ndesigned to protect victims of human trafficking.\n  This trafficking bill could pass quickly if the abortion language \nwere removed, as I said. We hope Republicans will do the right thing in \nthe interest of passing this bill and will work with us to remove the \ncompletely unrelated abortion language that has no business being in \nthis bill.\n  I, therefore, object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make sure everybody \nunderstands what has been objected to. The provision that was in the \nbill has been in there for 2 months. Everybody had a chance to read it. \nIt came out of committee unanimously. No one objected to proceeding to \nit on the floor.\n  I just offered the minority an opportunity for a simple up-or-down \nvote to strike the provision they recently discovered, and they have \nobjected to it.\n  Senator Cornyn, Senator Grassley, and a number of others of you have \nworked very hard on this extremely important legislation. I brought it \nto the floor the other day, open for amendment, but we have not been \nable to offer any amendments because the minority doesn't want to have \nan open amendment process and is insisting on trying to kill this \nimportant bill because of a provision they claim somehow they missed. \nAfter its being in there for 2 months, they now suddenly find it \noffensive.\n  So where we are is we are still on the bill, and we are going to pass \nthis bill, I assure you. I want to assure Senators Cornyn, Grassley, \nand all the people out in America who have been clamoring for this \nbill--and I might ask Senator Cornyn, how many groups are there that \nare supporting this measure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If I could respond, Mr. President, there are about 200 \ndifferent law enforcement and victims' rights organizations, including \nthe one from the chart I mentioned earlier, the Coalition Against \nTrafficking of Women. This is one of those rare subjects where people \nhave genuinely come together in revulsion to this terrible crime but \nalso in an attempt to do something meaningful to address it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So what I want to say to those groups is that we are \ngoing to stay on this bill until we pass it. I have offered the \nminority an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote to take out the \nprovision they have suddenly discovered is offensive to them even after \nhaving it in the bill for 2 months. Even the most casual observer would \nhave to conclude that the minority is going to great lengths to prevent \nthe Senate from even doing business on things that are overwhelmingly \nsupported. But I will say this to everybody out there who cares about \nthis bill: We are going to stay on it until we finish it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Vote on Hart Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Christopher A. Hart, of Colorado, to be \nChairman of the National Transportation Safety Board for a term of two \nyears?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act of 2015. I am proud to join with my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this important legislation, and I applaud \nSenator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar for putting together this \nbipartisan bill.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act is a call to action. We \nheard a lot of discussion about it on the floor over the last several \ndays. The horrible crime of human trafficking impacts thousands of \nAmericans--mostly women and children--each year, and it occurs in \ncities, suburbs, and in rural towns. We cannot allow this horrendous \ncrime to continue.\n  Last year, I hosted a forum at West Virginia State University to \ndiscuss how we could help in West Virginia to combat human trafficking. \nThe event was very well attended and featured law enforcement \nadvocates, academics, and State lawmakers. I also supported several \nbills when I was in the House of Representatives to further this fight \nand end this vicious crime.\n  It is monstrous to consider the sexual exploitation of a human being, \nespecially a child. We must stand up for those voices that have been \nsilenced and say ``no more.''\n  While not in large numbers, trafficking occurs in West Virginia's \nsmall communities and towns, in our hotels and in our truck stops, in \nschools, and online. Several things contribute to trafficking in the \nMountain State--the interstates running in and around, our high poverty \nand unemployment rates. We also have a drug epidemic which contributes \nto this problem.\n  I am working in a bipartisan way with Senator Joe Donnelly to address \nthis drug epidemic, but we must also say ``no more'' to this shameful \ncrime.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will make it easier for \nlaw enforcement to identify and address patterns of human trafficking. \nIt takes a needed two-pronged approach. It bolsters the tools available \nto law enforcement to crack down on human traffickers and helps victims \nrestore their lives through increased Federal resources.\n  We need to take care of our sons, our daughters, and our neighbors \nand keep our eyes and our ears open. This is not a Republican or \nDemocratic issue; it is a human issue. Now is the time to stand up and \nsay ``no more'' to human trafficking. Now is the time to show broad \nsupport for these victims and punish traffickers to the fullest extent \nof the law.\n  This bill has gone through a very transparent process. It was \ncarefully considered and unanimously approved in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. It has been available for every Senator or member of the \npublic to read for months. Earlier this week each and every Senator \nconsented to consider this bill on the Senate floor.

Now \nis the time for us to join together and pass this legislation and take \na significant step to end this crime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1475-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1475-S1476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the nomination \nof Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  It is interesting that this is a week when we have been engaged in a \ndialogue about human trafficking, which is a serious and significant \nissue, obviously. But it, along with many other issues, demands a \nstrong Justice Department, and a strong Justice Department is not \npossible without a confirmed Attorney General as a leader.\n  Ms. Lynch has now been nominated over 4 months ago. It has been 124 \ndays since her nomination, and she has still yet to be confirmed. I \nrise to speak on her behalf.\n  I have visited with Loretta Lynch in person. I have observed her \nthroughout the nominations process. My brother-in-law worked as an \nassistant U.S. attorney with her in the Eastern District of New York in \nthe late 1990s. I am impressed, as are many of my colleagues, by her \ncredentials and her extensive experience, and I was gratified to see \nthat the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination to the floor.\n  I am disappointed that it has taken 124 days to get to this point. I \nwas pleased to hear the majority leader indicate that the Senate may \ntake up her nomination next week, but I think it is important for the \nNation to recognize how critical this appointment is and how we should \nnot have let it go this long.\n  I want to reflect back to probably the hardest elected office I held \nor will hold, which was mayor of Richmond. When I was a city councilman \nand mayor from 1994 to 2000, my city had the burden of having the \nsecond highest homicide rate in the United States. We worked in our \ncommunity together with everyone, especially law enforcement and \ncommunity leaders, to try to bring down that scourge of violent crime \nthat was affecting neighborhoods, especially the poorest neighborhoods.\n  We were able, over the course of 7 years, to achieve some very \ndramatic success to make our city safer, but along the way I learned a \ncouple of very important things. The first was this. One can't tackle \nmajor public safety challenges without a strong relationship between \nthe community and the local police department. It is impossible to make \nprogress if that does not happen. Secondly, I also learned that one \ncannot tackle a difficult public safety challenge without a strong \nDepartment of Justice. We relied upon that partnership with our local \nU.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia--all the way \nup through\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\nmain Justice and the Attorney General--in order to try to tackle and \nturn our city's public safety situation around.\n  Today there are critical issues facing this country--urgent issues \nfacing this country--that deal with the relationship between our \ncommunities and law enforcement agencies. If there were ever a time \nwhen we would want to have a confirmed Attorney General in office \nwithout question marks surrounding when that confirmation will take \nplace, it would be now.\n\n  Over the last few months, we have seen a series of controversies that \nhave torn at all of us as we have watched challenges and distrust \nbetween communities and law enforcement agencies. In early August, \nMichael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot during a confrontation \nwith an officer in Ferguson, MO. That shooting spurred nationwide \nprotests and concerns against what many in Ferguson and elsewhere \nviewed as overly aggressive tactics by the police.\n  A month prior to the death of Michael Brown, Eric Garner died as a \nresult of a police chokehold in July in New York when he was confronted \nover the selling of untaxed cigarettes. There have been similar \ninstances in Cleveland and Madison. It is not limited to one part of \nthe country. It is not limited to North, South, East, or West. There \nhave been similar instances that have raised serious concerns about the \nconnection between law enforcement and communities.\n  There have also been horrible atrocities committed against members of \nthe law enforcement community, the deaths of two NYPD officers, Wenjian \nLiu and Rafael Ramos, who were shot pointblank weeks ago in New York \nCity while they sat in their patrol car. Yesterday, as we heard \nreported, there were shootings of police officers in Ferguson, MO.\n  These instances in cities around the country demonstrate a \nsignificant level of tension and even distrust between the police and \ncommunities they serve, which are often minority communities or \ncommunities of color.\n  I am here to say these tensions do not have to exist. They can be \nbridged. They can be solved. But it takes a fully functioning \nDepartment of Justice with a leader at the helm who has been confirmed \nto solve these issues.\n  The Department of Justice has, throughout history and today, played a \ncritical role in investigating cases such as this and some of the \nsituations I mentioned. The DOJ has been able to come in and be \ninvolved and provide some calm to situations, provide some level of \nconfidence that there would not be a sugarcoating or an effort to sweep \nlegitimate questions into the closet in the community.\n  In the State of Virginia, there is currently a DOJ investigation \nconcerning the police shooting death of John Geer, an unarmed Caucasian \nwho was shot on the steps of his residence in August of 2013. Local \nofficials in that county have welcomed the involvement of the \nDepartment of Justice because they knew that citizens would have a \ngreater confidence in the outcome if it was being done by someone other \nthan the officials who had been elected locally.\n  There is a critical need at this point to provide some confidence to \ncommunities that have questions about the relationship between their \nown concerns and the service of law enforcement departments, just as \nlaw enforcement departments want to have a way to build bridges with \nthe communities they represent.\n  Loretta Lynch understands the significance of the Attorney General's \nrole in these situations. She testified that one of her key priorities \nwould be to work to strengthen the bonds between law enforcement \npersonnel, whom she has worked with during her entire career, and the \ncommunities they serve which she well understands.\n  Last week, the DOJ released a report from their investigation into \nthe Ferguson policing practices that laid out a number of significant \nconcerns that, if left unaddressed, will continue to lead to distrust \nin Ferguson and elsewhere. A strong Justice Department that can help \nmediate and bring the sides together is a part of the solution.\n  I raised these issues only to highlight that right now we are at a \ncritical time in the Nation's criminal justice system. A delay of \nconfirming an Attorney General for 4-plus months is never warranted, \ngiven the importance of the position. A delay is not warranted in this \ncase, given these strong credentials of Loretta Lynch, but the delay is \nespecially unwelcome, given the urgent need to have leadership at the \nDepartment of Justice. They can try to calm any potential situations \nand build confidence in communities and among law enforcement agencies.\n  We need our incoming AG to be on the job, taking on these challenges \nin a manner that will bring different aspects of the community \ntogether, to make changes as necessary and to strengthen the equality \nof our criminal justice system for all.\n  Of course, beyond the issue of community policing, we face so many \nother challenges, such as national security and terrorism, and in that \nrespect the Eastern District of New York, which is where Ms. Lynch has \nserved, has had one of the most significant dockets of antiterrorism \ncases of any jurisdiction in the country. She is an expert in those \nareas. Cyber security, the very human trafficking issues we have been \ndiscussing on the floor today, are issues Ms. Lynch has worked on \nsignificantly in her role, protecting voting rights, and so many more.\n  Ms. Lynch is a no-nonsense, hard-working prosecutor known for her \naplomb, her demeanor, her intelligence, and her ability to work with a \nwide variety of stakeholders. I am absolutely confident Ms. Lynch will \napproach these issues with the same focus, fairness, and expertise with \nwhich she has approached her work in the past.\n  I stand today to urge my colleagues to not wait, and to support \nLoretta Lynch as our next Attorney General. It has been said to the \npoint where it is a cliche, but nevertheless a true one, that justice \ndelayed is justice denied. The refusal to confirm a leader to head the \nmost important law enforcement agency in the United States is a delay \nof justice that for many seems to be a denial of justice. We can \nrectify that concern in communities across this country if we act with \ndispatch to confirm a person who is eminently qualified to hold the \nNation's highest law enforcement position.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been working on the issue of human \ntrafficking on a bipartisan basis for almost a year, and it is usually \nbipartisan.\n  I know when we included my amendment on the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act, most Senators voted for it. Only 20 \ncurrent Republican senators voted against that victims act, and the \nrest voted for it. All the Democrats voted for it.\n  But on this issue today, the Judiciary Committee reported out a \ncomprehensive bill with strong bipartisan support. We did that last \nfall. This year we reported out a less comprehensive bill with fewer \nprotections for those at risk of human trafficking, and despite that \nsetback, I agreed to keep working across the aisle to make it stronger, \nincluding the crucial prevention piece that was in last year's \ncommittee-reported bill.\n  We have been on this bill for 3 days. I think we can all admit the \nprogress has been thwarted by the inclusion of a divisive provision \nthat would limit the services available to victims of human \ntrafficking.\n  I wish to propose a way forward. I know all Senators want to work \ntogether to end human trafficking. And just as we saw on my bill, the \nViolence Against Women Act, 78 Senators voted for that act with its \nprovision on trafficking. We want to support a bill that will pass the \nSenate.\n  I filed a substitute amendment, Senate Amendment 300, to get us \naround\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\nour current impasse. It includes three things. First, the Klobuchar-\nCornyn bill as reported earlier this month by the Judiciary Committee; \nsecond, the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill, also reported earlier this month by \nthe Judiciary Committee, but without the divisive language that limits \nvictims services; third, the Leahy-Collins-Murkowski-Ayotte amendment \nthat was filed yesterday to protect runaway and homeless youth from \ntrafficking.\n  This trafficking prevention bill was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee last year with the support of Senator Grassley, Senator \nCornyn, and nearly all of the other Judiciary Committee members, but \nhas been narrowed here at the request of Republicans this year.\n  I hope the combination of these three bills--and I do it in good \nfaith--can bring us together. More importantly, it is responsive to the \nrequests of survivors and the many dedicated people who work with them \nto remove the unnecessary partisan provision that has resulted in this \nimpasse. They need us to find a way forward. They need the Senate to \nstop playing politics and pass a meaningful bill.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that letters written by a number \nof groups and others who support the removal of this divisive provision \nso that we can move forward on this trafficking legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               The National Network for Youth,\n\n                                                   March 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Network for Youth is \n     grateful for your leadership on human trafficking which is a \n     dark mark on our modern society. Slavery has no place in \n     America and we stand proudly with you to prevent and end \n     human trafficking in America.\n       The National Network for Youth, founded in 1974, champions \n     the needs of runaway, homeless, and other disconnected youth \n     through strengthening the capacity of community-based \n     services, facilitating resource sharing, and educating the \n     public and policy makers. NN4Y members work collaboratively \n     to prevent youth homelessness and the inherent risks of \n     homelessness, including exploitation, human trafficking, \n     criminal justice involvement, and death.\n       Human trafficking is a bipartisan and nonpartisan issue. \n     Together, we stand united against modern day slavery, \n     including both sex and labor trafficking. Presently, we are \n     at an important moment in the Senate with both parties \n     unified to take a strong stand against human trafficking, \n     from prevention to law enforcement, and service provision to \n     survivors. We are so pleased that the Runaway and Homeless \n     and Youth Trafficking Prevention has become a part of this \n     important conversation and we thank you for your support of \n     that legislation last Congress.\n       The National Network for Youth is writing this letter with \n     the hope that the U.S. Senate will remove the partisan piece \n     of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This \n     legislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this \n     moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan and \n     divisive provisions.\n       Respectfully, thank you for your work. Please work across \n     the aisle to ensure that this critical trafficking \n     legislation becomes the law of the land.\n           Best regards,\n\n                                          Darla Bardine, J.D.,\n\n                              Executive Director, National Network\n     for Youth.\n                                  ____\n\n         Vermont Coalition of Runaway & Homeless Youth Programs,\n                                   Montpelier, VT, March 11, 2015.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy, The Vermont Coalition of Runaway and \n     Homeless Youth Programs wishes to express our ongoing \n     appreciation for your efforts to move the Runaway and \n     Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act. As a \n     longstanding champion of Federal support for efforts to \n     assist vulnerable runaway, homeless and trafficked young \n     people, I know that you must be as frustrated as we are in \n     recent efforts to insert an element of partisanship into what \n     should be a broadly bi-partisan effort to protect victims of \n     human trafficking. The Runaway and Homeless Youth and \n     Trafficking Prevention Act and the broader legislation it's \n     amended to should be important opportunities for citizens of \n     the United States and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to \n     unite in moral outrage over the realities of victims of human \n     trafficking.\n       Difference of opinion and the deliberative role of the \n     Senate is part of what makes our democracy strong, but \n     sometimes unity of purpose should prevail, particularly in \n     efforts involving protections for the most vulnerable among \n     us. There should be no doubt that legislation involving the \n     well-being of individuals who have been victimized by the \n     most base of human behavior should be free of partisan \n     wrangling. It's disappointing and deeply distressing that \n     this isn't always the case.\n       I write this letter to encourage your efforts to remove \n     partisan language from the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \n     Act in an effort to ensure that the Act and the RHY amendment \n     that Senator Collins and you introduced move forward \n     unimpeded.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kreig Pinkham,\n       Executive Director, Washington County Youth Service Bureau/\n     Boys & Girls Club, VT Coalition of Runaway & Homeless Youth \n     Programs Board Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Human Rights Campaign,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2015.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Human Rights Campaign's \n     (HRC) more than 1.5 million members and supporters \n     nationwide, I write to support the Leahy substitute amendment \n     to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act which would \n     ensure critical protections for victims of trafficking and \n     add necessary protections for runaway and homeless youth that \n     does not include an expansion of the Hyde Amendment language. \n     Each of the components of this substitute amendment has \n     strong bipartisan support.\n       This amendment will help many vulnerable populations \n     including the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) \n     community. LGBT individuals are particularly impacted by \n     human trafficking and are at an increased risk for \n     victimization globally. In fact, 10 percent of all \n     trafficking victims identify as LGBT. They also make up a \n     disproportionate amount of the total homeless youth \n     population. Recent studies have found that while LGBT youth \n     comprise only 10 percent of the total youth population, up to \n     40 percent of youth living on the streets today identify as \n     LGBT.\n       Increased incidence of homelessness and family rejection \n     make LGBT individuals--especially youth--particularly \n     vulnerable to trafficking. According to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services Administration for Children and \n     Families, one in four LGBT youth is rejected by their \n     families because of their sexual orientation or gender \n     identity. Due to this rejection, many LGBT youth find \n     themselves homeless and living on the streets. Once on the \n     street, these youth are targeted for exploitation and \n     trafficking.\n       Because homelessness can often lead to trafficking, \n     inclusion of protections for runaway and homeless youth will \n     result in a more effective Justice for Victims of Trafficking \n     Act. Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs provide critical \n     funding for support systems that serve youth who become \n     homeless. The programs funded by the act--including emergency \n     shelters, street outreach, transitional living and assistance \n     for homeless youth in rural areas--can serve as critical, \n     final safety nets for youth who would otherwise become \n     victims of trafficking.\n       According to the American Bar Association, for LGBT people \n     who are trafficked the societal stigma around their sexual \n     orientation or gender identity is an additional factor that \n     prevents them from accessing help or reporting abuse. This \n     amendment provides important protections against \n     discrimination for LGBT youth by prohibiting any program \n     funded by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act from \n     discriminating on the basis of actual or perceived race, \n     color, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, \n     sexual orientation, or disability.\n       We greatly appreciate your commitment to improving the \n     lives of young people across America, including those who are \n     LGBT. Thank you for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  David Stacy,\n\n                                      Government Affairs Director,\n     Human Rights Campaign.\n                                  ____\n\n     Planned Parenthood Action Fund\n     For Immediate Release: Tuesday, March 10, 2015\n     Contact: Planned Parenthood Action Fund media office: 212-\n         261-4433\n\n\n  Planned Parenthood Condemns Effort to Insert Extreme Anti-Abortion \n                 Agenda into Bill on Human Trafficking\n\n       Washington DC.-- Planned Parenthood Action Fund condemned \n     efforts by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) to advance an extreme \n     abortion restriction as part of important bipartisan efforts \n     to establish greater protections for victims of human \n     trafficking. Following is a statement by Cecile Richards, \n     President, Planned Parenthood Action Fund:\n       ``It's outrageous that some politicians are using a bill to \n     protect victims of sex trafficking to push an extreme anti-\n     abortion, anti-immigrant agenda. This is politics at its \n     worst. A bill that was supposed to help women is instead \n     being used to hurt women.\n       ``The Senate should protect victims of human trafficking \n     but should not do so at the expense of women's access to safe \n     and legal abortion. The majority of human trafficking victims \n     are women and girls, and they need access to the full range \n     of reproductive health care services without barriers.''\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                               Legal Momentum,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2015.\n       New York, NY.--Today, Legal Momentum, the Women's Legal \n     Defense and Education Fund, urged that a provision harmful to \n     women's health be removed from a human trafficking bill being \n     considered by the Senate, the Justice for Victims of \n     Trafficking Act of 2015 (S. 178).\n       ``The intent of this bill--to support survivors of \n     trafficking--will be subverted if the provision is left \n     intact. Human trafficking survivors--survivors of the worst \n     kind of exploitation, which our government has called `modern \n     slavery'--who were raped and became pregnant should have \n     access to the full spectrum of health services, including \n     abortion,'' said Legal Momentum's President and CEO, Carol \n     Robles-Romaan.\n       Legal Momentum fully supports the aims of the bill minus \n     the troubling provisions. The bill would enhance services for \n     runaway and homeless victims of youth trafficking, improve \n     the response to victims of child sex trafficking, and \n     establish an interagency task force to monitor and combat \n     trafficking. Harmful provisions that deny health care to \n     victims, restrict women's health options, are harmful to \n     immigrants, or fail to adequately protect the LGBT community, \n     should be removed so that the bill can help victims of one of \n     the most heinous crimes, human trafficking, which has been \n     condemned by the whole world. We urge all senators to vote \n     for the Leahy Comprehensive Substitute Amendment, which \n     adheres to the bi-partisan compromises made when the JVTA was \n     reported out of the Judiciary Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Give Way to Freedom,\n\n                               Essex Junction, VT, March 11, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \ngravity of the current situation with regard to the administration's \nnegotiations with Iran for a nuclear agreement.\n  I believe it is important to note that we received some important \ninformation today in the Senate Armed Services Committee that is \nhelpful to us in this regard.\n  This morning the Armed Services Committee heard from ADM Bill \nGortney. He gave us his assessment of Iran's capabilities and ongoing \nefforts to thwart international agencies. Admiral Gortney is the \ncommander of the U.S. Northern Command. He is personally responsible \nfor defending Americans in the United States mainland. He is an \nappointee of President Obama, and here are the words given to us today \nby Admiral Gortney: Iran has ``committed considerable resources to \nenhancing its ballistic missile capabilities and has already placed \nanother satellite into orbit this year using a new booster that could \nserve as a demonstrator for ICBM, intercontinental ballistic \ntechnologies. Despite international condemnation and sanctions, Iran \nhas failed to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency to resolve all outstanding concerns regarding its nuclear \nprogram, particularly those concerning its possible military \ndimensions.''\n  These are the words from the head of the Northern Command in this \nadministration, and this regime, which Admiral Gortney described, is \nthe very regime our President and Secretary of State have confidence \nwill live up to any nuclear agreement.\n  As the Admiral went on to say, the hope for a diplomatic solution \nshould not come without vigilance, and that is what Members on this \nside of the aisle are trying to insist upon. We cannot ignore these \nwarning signs of noncompliance and uncooperative behavior while \nexpecting Iran to make good on its promises.\n  A few days ago Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed Iran's record of \nmisconduct and sinister objectives in his powerful address to Congress. \nHe emphasized that a nuclear Iran would have serious implications for \nthe world, the region, and of course for Israel, one of our most \nsteadfast allies. These concerns are important for lawmakers, and I am \nglad we had a chance to hear them in person.\n  With a record of foreign policy failures, I regret to say President \nObama is under intense scrutiny to hold Iran accountable at this \ncritical moment. He is under intense scrutiny because of these foreign \npolicy failures. Like many of my colleagues, I am concerned and I think \nAmericans are concerned that the administration might be too generous \nwith concessions to Iran, as it has been with deals in past.\n  The time is running out for the President to establish his legacy--a \ndangerous motivation for negotiations with the unreliable and volatile \nnation Admiral Gortney described today.\n  At the very least, the Senate should insist on the passage of a \npartisan bill to ensure that the American people have a say in any \nagreement between the White House and Iran. Congressional approval \nwould add legitimacy to any agreement, and I think that is important. \nAny foreign nation negotiating with the United States should be mindful \nof our constitutional system of checks and balances. Congress should \nalso be discussing the appropriate steps to take if an agreement is not \nreached by the deadline this month.\n  The President is now threatening to veto legislation that puts \ntougher sanctions on Iran. But shouldn't there be consequences for Iran \nif they refuse to cooperate with international investigators? Mistakes \nare too high to make excuses for stalled negotiations or to rely on \nwishful thinking about Iran's intentions.\n  As Mr. Netanyahu said in his speech, ``If Iran wants to be treated \nlike a normal country, let it act like a normal country.''\n  Instead Iran continues to support terrorist groups and oppressive \nauthoritarian regimes. We cannot afford to ignore its influence in \nunstable areas and how this influence could dramatically change should \nthey be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech is a reminder that Iran has made no \nexcuses for its belligerent aims and ties to terrorist groups. A bad \ndeal would spell disaster for Israel, whose very existence has been \nthreatened by Iranian leaders.\n  Israel and the United States share an unwavering commitment to \nkeeping Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. It is unfortunate that \ncriticism from the Obama administration surrounded the Prime Minister's \nearlier visit.\n  Meanwhile, the world is not safer. Global threats continue to \nmultiply, posing complex challenges to America's national security \nissues. One looks at the unrest around the world, and it is easy to see \nhow America is failing to lead.\n\n  Another member of this administration, Director of National \nIntelligence\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\nJames Clapper, underscored the widespread instability when he testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. It is important \nto compare Director Clapper's testimony with that of the Secretary of \nState earlier. Director Clapper, our Director of National Intelligence, \nsaid there were more deaths from state-sponsored mass killings, more \npeople displaced from their homes, and a higher rate of political \ninstability last year than we have seen in decades. In fact, 2014 was \nthe most lethal year on record for terrorism. We are now facing \nunpredictable instability as the ``new normal,'' according to this \nadministration's Director of National Intelligence.\n  The White House's foreign policy team, however, seems unwilling to \naccept these harsh truths. Listen to the words of Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry, our chief negotiator with Iran, in contrast to the words of \nour Director of National Intelligence. Senator Kerry said:\n\n       We are actually living in a period of less daily threat to \n     Americans and to people in the world than normally; less \n     deaths, less violent deaths today, than through the last \n     century.\n\n  It is hard to square the testimony of our chief negotiator with Iran \nwith the words of our Director of National Intelligence.\n  Particularly troubling is the administration's past reliance on empty \npromises from adversaries. Under President Obama's watch, Vladimir \nPutin has invaded and annexed part of Ukraine, continued to support the \nbrutal regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and violated the \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\n  On February 27, we saw yet another troubling development in Moscow. \nOpposition leader Boris Nemtsov was gunned down in cold blood on the \nstreet after dinner in a secure, well-protected part of Moscow, just \nsteps away from the Kremlin. The Russian Government has denounced Mr. \nNemtsov's assassination, but this is not the first time one of \nPresident Putin's opponents or critics has been murdered. I will only \nnote that Mr. Nemtsov is only the latest in a line of Putin critics who \nhave mysteriously met their demise over time, and Russia's record of \ncorruption and shameful disregard for human rights continues.\n  In conclusion, U.S. leadership is of the utmost importance to global \nsecurity and stability at this pivotal time. Director Clapper was frank \nin his testimony that ``pervasive uncertainty makes it all the harder \nto predict the future.'' That is why we must remain vigilant. America \ncan succeed if we demonstrate the fortitude and resolve necessary to \ndefend freedom and stop those who threaten it. This includes taking an \nhonest look at Iran's past and present behavior before we cut a deal we \nwill later regret.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate in morning business and to enter into a colloquy with the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1479-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1479-S1481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to make reference to \nthe famous letter by Senator Cotton to the Iranians conveying to them \nthe realities of the U.S. Constitution and the situation as it will \nprevail, hopefully, and that is that the Congress of the United States \nmust ratify any agreement between the United States and Iran. Anybody \nwho says we shouldn't ignores history and ignores the impact of this \ntreaty.\n  I signed that letter, and I believe it is a direct result of the \nPresident's statement that he would veto any role the U.S. Congress \nshould play in the ratification or nonratification of a pending \nagreement. That is what triggered the letter from Senator Cotton, and \nthat is why I stand by it.\n  Seventy-one percent of Americans believe negotiation with Tehran will \nnot make a difference in preventing Iran from producing nuclear \nweapons, and 71 percent of the American people are right.\n  Now I wish to speak with my friend from South Carolina about the \nsituation in Iraq today--specifically, the role Iran is playing and, \neven more specifically, the combat that is taking place around the city \nof Tikrit.\n  Tikrit is the hometown of Saddam Hussein. Tikrit is a Sunni \nstronghold. Tikrit is now under attack--the ISIS people who are \noccupying it--by Shia militia, including, specifically, the Badr \nbrigades, and they are led and trained by Iranians. An individual named \nSoleimani, who is the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, is now \nthe most visible leader. Soleimani is the same guy who sent copper-\ntipped IEDs into Iraq which killed hundreds of American soldiers and \nmarines. We now are somehow accommodating the individual who is \nresponsible for the deaths of brave young Americans. That is not only \nunbelievable, it is totally unacceptable.\n  The question is, When these Shia militias get into Tikrit, how are \nthey going to behave? There are well-documented human rights abuses by \nthese Shia militias. Again, these are the same Badr brigades that we \nfought against in the Battle of Sadr City during the surge. And now the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff said in January: ``As long as the \nIraqi government remains committed to inclusivity of all the various \ngroups inside the country, then I think Iranian influence will be \npositive.'' I am not making that up.\n  There is an AP story today that I wish to quote from entitled \n``Little progress in key plank of Obama anti-IS struggle.''\n\n       Instead of reaching out for Sunnis, the Iraqi government \n     has bolstered its already close ties to Iran and to Iranian-\n     backed Shiite militias that have been credibly accused of \n     massacring Sunnis, U.S. officials acknowledge. The Iraqi \n     military's reliance on Shiite militias this week to retake \n     Tikrit, a Sunni stronghold, has complicated the prospects of \n     political reconciliation, experts say.\n       Human Rights Watch said in a March 4 report that it has \n     documented ``numerous'' atrocities against Sunni civilians by \n     the Shiite militias  . . .\n       ``They see it as a Persian invasion of the Sunni \n     heartland,'' said John Maguire, a former CIA case officer \n     with long Middle East experience who travels frequently to \n     Iraq.\n\n  I am interested in the reaction of my friend from South Carolina to \nthis:\n\n       After meeting with Abadi, Dempsey--\n\n  That is our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--\n\n     told reporters he was given firm assurances that the Shiite-\n     led government is committed to reconciling with the Sunnis. \n     Asked in an interview whether he considered those assurances \n     credible Dempsey said, ``They seemed credible today.''\n       Dempsey noted that during his helicopter flight over \n     Baghdad, he saw worrisome signs of Iranian influence. He \n     spotted a ``plethora of flags'' at checkpoints and elsewhere \n     in the capital, ``only one of which happens to be the Iraqi \n     flag,'' he said, alluding to the banners of Iranian-backed \n     Shiite militias.\n\n  Can we get real, I ask my friend from South Carolina, as to what is \ntaking place?\n  The Iranians are now in Sana'a, they are in Baghdad, they are in \nBeirut, they are in Damascus, and they are on the move. Meanwhile, this \nadministration, this President, and this Secretary of State pursue the \nmirage of a nuclear agreement that will somehow change the entire \nequation.\n  I would also be interested in the views of the Senator from South \nCarolina of what the Saudis are doing, which is accommodating in their \nown way and possibly making plans to acquire their own nuclear weapons \nalong with other nations in the Middle East.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, just to sum it up, our foreign policy is \nin a free-for-all. It is incompetent at its core.\n  No one can feel good about Shia-led groups going into Tikrit with \nIranian command and control. If we know anything about Iraq, the hope \nfor Iraq is for the Sunnis, the Shias, and the Kurds to accommodate \neach other's interests and to work together. So when we see a Shia-led \neffort against, as the Senator from Arizona said, the Sunni stronghold, \nwith an Iranian commander on the ground who was responsible for killing \nAmericans, and we think that is a good day for us, that is nuts. That \nis a bad day for America.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the Iranian nuclear negotiations. I did \nnot sign Senator Cotton's letter until the President threatened to veto \ncongressional legislation to make sure that we would have a say about \nrelieving the sanctions we created. When President Obama told the \nCongress--a bipartisan\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\ngroup was being formed to make sure that Congress would have a say \nabout relieving the sanctions that were created--that ``I will veto \nyour efforts to have a say,'' then all bets were off at that point for \nme.\n  So I want the Iranians to know, in case they are listening, the Obama \nadministration, the P5+1, the U.N., cannot relieve congressional \nsanctions without our approval. I don't know what kind of system they \nhave in Iran; I am pretty well sure it is not Democratic.\n  To President Obama: When you indicated that the letter that was \nwritten--the open letter to the Ayatollahs about Congress's insistence \nthat we have a say about sanctions we are creating--you said: You have \nempowered the hard-liners.\n  All I can say is that if the President of the United States believes \nthere is a hard line and moderate split in Iran, I want to look at the \ndeal now more than ever. Please name the moderate elements who are in \nthe Government in Iran. And if these people are moderate, God forbid \nthe hard-liners ever get in charge. The idea that there is a split is \nridiculous. The President of Iran, the Foreign Minister of Iran are \nplaying the oldest game in the Mideast. The moderates were gunned down \nin 2009. I can show my colleagues a moderate who was a young lady who \nwas killed in the streets. Every moderate voice was crushed by force of \narms, and our President in 2009 sat on the sidelines because he didn't \nwant to disrupt his chance to reach an agreement with the Ayatollahs.\n  Mr. President: You scare me when you say you believe there is a \nmoderate element in charge of Iran. Look what they are doing as you \nnegotiate regarding their nuclear ambitions. They have taken down a \npro-American government in Yemen that allowed us a platform to watch \nand attack Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula, the terrorist \norganization responsible for the terrorist attack. The Houthis, an \nIranian-backed group within Yemen, was able to take down the government \nthat we were working with in providing us counterterrorism platforms. \nThe Iranians are supporting Assad, who has killed 220,000 of his own \npeople, and the instability from Assad's brutality is putting the King \nof Jordan and everyone else at risk. Over 1 million Syrians have left \nSyria to go to Lebanon and Jordan. That is not a moderate regime. \nModerate regimes do not support insurgencies that, through the force of \narm, take down elected governments. Hezbollah is not a moderate voice \nin Lebanon. They are supported by the Iranians. They have had a record \nof attacking Israel and killing us for decades. So Iran's support of \nHezbollah, of the Houthis, and of Assad--that is not what moderate \npeople do. Now, in Iraq itself, the Shia militia who are roaming around \nIraq are committing war crimes as I speak.\n  So you are completely disconnected from the behavior of the people \nyou are negotiating with, and you don't understand the Iranians at all. \nYou are dangerously in denial or delusional about the threats we face \nand whom we are dealing with.\n  So I am glad we wrote the letter to bring some certainty to the \nprocess. If the President of the United States negotiates a deal with \nIran and that deal includes lifting the congressional sanctions and he \ndoes it without our input, he will change a balance of power that has \nexisted for hundreds of years in this country.\n  We created congressional sanctions by a 100-0 vote over your \nobjection. We are not going to let you tell us we have no voice in \nlifting the sanctions we created. We are not going to let the United \nNations lift sanctions we created.\n  The Iranians need to understand the following: If there is a deal \nbetween the P5+1 and they are telling you congressional sanctions will \nbe lifted by signing the deal, that is not accurate. They won't be \nlifted unless we agree. I would vote to lift sanctions if I thought we \nhad a good deal. I would vote against a bad deal because a bad deal \nwill start a new arms race in the Middle East.\n  I will sum this up. I have never been more worried than I am today \nwith what is happening in the Middle East. You have people in our \nmilitary celebrate Iranian ground activity in Iraq that will expand \nsectarian conflict. When the Iranians are marching on Tikrit, that is \nnot a sign that Iraq is coming together. To anybody on the American \nside who believes that is a good idea, what movie have been you been \nwatching?\n  To the President of the United States: We are going to insist to have \na say about sanctions we created before you can negotiate their relief. \nI am sorry you may not like that. You may find this inconvenient, but \nwe have a say, too.\n  The bill we are talking about only deals with the sanctions we \ncreated. So I hope my Democratic colleagues who are so disappointed \nwill understand why we, at least on this side, are pretty offended at \nthe idea that the President can negotiate away sanctions we created \nwithout an input. You should be equally worried. The Israelis and the \nArabs have told us one thing: Iran is the most destabilizing force in \nthe Middle East. This President and this administration negotiate a \nnuclear deal without saying a word about the havoc Iran is creating on \nthe ground.\n  If I were President, I would tell the Iranians we are not going to \ntalk to you anymore about your nuclear ambitions until you stop \ndestabilizing the region and invading your neighbors. We are not going \nto talk to you about your nuclear ambitions until you stop building \nICBMs that can threaten us, until you stop sponsoring terrorist \norganizations. But not only has the President remained silent about \nIran's wreaking havoc throughout the region, he is negotiating a deal--\nat least from what I have been able to find out about it--that is a \nNorth Korea in the making, and he wants us to be silent.\n  To my Democratic colleagues and the President, we are not going to be \nsilenced. We are going have a say. We are going to have a vote. I hope \nin a bipartisan fashion, we will vote a good deal in and a bad deal \ndown. Under the construct, you have to get 60 votes to disapprove the \ndeal, so Republicans alone cannot kill it.\n  If it is a good deal, we will know it. It will be a deal that gives \nthe Iranians what they say they want, a peaceful nuclear power program. \nA bad deal is a deal that will allow them to have a nuclear weapon one \nday. The only thing between a nuclear weapon, us, and Israel is the \nUnited Nations. Forget that. That is what we had in North Korea.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my friend if he recalls the recent testimony \nby Henry Kissinger, probably the most highly regarded individual in \nAmerica today? He voiced his concern. His fundamental problem was that, \nas he put it, we have gone from negotiations to rid Iran from ever \nhaving the capability of developing nuclear weapons to delaying it. So \nthat on its face--and again, I want to remind my friend from South \nCarolina that he and I and our beloved friend, former Member of this \nbody, Joe Lieberman, made visit after visit to Baghdad and to Iraq. We \nprobably were everywhere in that country on many occasions. And how \nwell we remember the fight the surge brought on to bring stability to \nIraq. It did bring stability. You remember the battle of Sadr City. Who \nwas it that our forces, our young men and women, were fighting against, \nthe Badr Brigades? Guess who is fighting in Tikrit today. The Badr \nBrigades.\n  The Senator and I have been to Walter Reed and many other places like \nthat and have seen our wounded. Wounded by what? By IEDs, the copper-\ntipped IEDs that Soleimani made sure came into Iraq, that would \npenetrate armor and wreak havoc and wounded so many and killed so many \nyoung Americans.\n  It is now Soleimani who is visibly leading the fight in Tikrit. \nStrangely enough, our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saw so many \nflags--guess what--with the banners of the Iranian-backed Shia \nmilitias.\n  I would ask my friend, isn't this in some ways a Greek tragedy? Isn't \nthis in some ways a situation where we sacrifice so much? And thanks to \nthe inspired, fantastic leadership of General Petraeus and Colonel \nMcFarland and all of those individuals who fought so well and led so \nwell, we had it won, it was stabilized. And now because of the \nPresident's decision not to leave a residual force, we are seeing \ncapitals in the Middle East--whether it be Sana'a, Baghdad, Beirut, or \nDamascus--we are now seeing an overwhelming Iranian presence that is \ndedicated, among other things, to the extinction of the State of \nIsrael.\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. All I can say is to the soldiers and to the military \npersonnel who participated in the Iraq fight, you did your job. \nPresident Bush made mistakes. To his credit, he adjusted. He made a lot \nof mistakes upfront, but he did adjust because the surge did work.\n  President Obama was dealt a pretty good hand when it came to Iraq. \nThings were better on the security front. Economic and political \nprogress was well noted. His decision not to leave a residual force \nbehind has come back to haunt us, Iraq, and the entire region. It was \nhis decision. We tried to blame the Iraqis. That is just rewriting the \nhistory. When he decided to turn down the entire recommendation of his \nnational security team--the national security team's entire \nrecommendation--about doing a no-fly zone and helping the Free Syrian \nArmy 3 years ago, everything Senator McCain said about that decision \nhas come true. Radical Islamists filled in that vacuum.\n  What you see in the Middle East is as a result of bad policy choices, \nbut what you see today is the beginning of the worst decision, which \nwould be a bad deal with Iran in dealing Congress out.\n  To the American people, here is one thing I promise you. We and the \nCongress in a bipartisan fashion will make sure that any deal, if there \nis one, negotiating with the Iranians, will come to this body to be \nopenly debated so you will know what is in it, and every Member of this \nSenate is going to take a vote as to whether it is good enough to lift \ncongressional sanctions that we created.\n  I promise we are not going to allow the most historic decision any \nPresident will make any time soon to go without checks and balances. It \nwill come to this body. We will have a vote. I promise you this: If \nthis administration believes there is a hard-line moderate split \nbetween those who govern Iran, it should scare you because it scares \nme. Given what Senator McCain has described, do you really believe \nthere is a moderate element in Iran?\n  I hope we can reach a diplomatic conclusion to the Iranian nuclear \nambitions. They have been lying about their nuclear program for 20 \nyears. I would like to see a good deal, but I will insist on voting on \na deal that leads to congressional sanctions.\n  To the Germans, our friends in Germany, the Foreign Minister of \nGermany said the letter empowered the Iranians. With all due respect to \nour German allies, that is the most ridiculous statement I think I have \never heard. Requiring a deal between the Iranians and involving \ncongressional sanctions to come back to the Congress should not \nembolden anybody. I don't know if the deal you are negotiating goes to \nthe Parliament--the Bundestag in Germany--but we do things a certain \nway. The efforts of the French and the Germans to discipline Putin, how \nwell has that turned out? We have a group of nations trying to deal \nwith the most thuggish regime in the world acting like the Keystone \nKops, in my view.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I remind the Senator that it is the same German \nForeign Minister who criticized us and sat by and watched the \ndismemberment of a European nation for the first time in 70 years; the \nsame Foreign Minister who keeps threatening Vladimir Putin if he keeps \nthis up, and Vladimir Putin continues his aggression and will continue \nhis aggression as well.\n  I can't give up the floor without mentioning, again, my sorrow at the \npassage of and murder of my friend, Boris Nemstov. The recent arrests \nby Vladimir Putin's crack law enforcement team is reminiscent--they \nrounded up some Chechens--of everybody's favorite film ``Casablanca'' \nwhere at the end, Claude Raine says, ``Round up the usual suspects.'' \nWe have seen a scene from that movie again as the Russians have rounded \nup the usual suspects. Under this regime in Russia, we will never know \nwho the murderers are of Boris Nemstov; and that, my friends, is a \ntragedy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1481-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1481-S1482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today I rise to support the Justice for \nTrafficking Victims Act, and I want to commend the numerous Senators--\nCornyn, Klobuchar, and so many others--who have worked so hard to move \nthis act forward.\n  I realize there are many of us who are new to this body, and I \ncertainly am still learning my way around the procedural maze here. \nHowever, it is easy to see how frustrating this maze can be and how it \nkeeps us from getting good things done for the people who elected us \nand sent us here.\n  Last year I traveled my State, Alaska, and one of the top concerns I \nheard from Alaskans is that they were tired of the gridlock, and they \nwant to see a functioning government and an open process in the Senate. \nSo here we are on a bill that is of immense importance to the country \nand to Alaska--a bill that has very broad bipartisan support. It comes \nto the floor with a promise of an open amendment process so all \nSenators can be heard. Yet, a few of my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are preventing us from moving forward on a bill that will \nprotect some of the Nation's most vulnerable citizens. Evidently a \nprovision in the bill that has been the law of the land for decades has \nnow become an excuse among some not to move the bill forward.\n  That is a shame for the country, and particularly for the victims who \nhave been snared in the heinous world of human trafficking. As a former \nattorney general of the great State of Alaska, I have seen the horrible \npain and suffering that human trafficking and cases of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault can cause among our fellow citizens. I hail \nfrom a great State. We are proud Alaskans, proud of many things that \nare wonderful about our State. But like most States, we have problems. \nWe have some of the highest rates of sexual abuse and exploitation in \nthe country. Human trafficking is a big problem in my State, just as it \nis throughout the rest of the country. Since the human trafficking bill \nwas placed on the calendar, I have been working closely with all of my \ncolleagues, not only on this bill but on an amendment that I plan on \noffering with many others, the Mann Act cooperation amendment. This is \nan amendment that would be a rare thing in Washington today, a truly \nwin-win amendment for the Federal Government, State governments, and \nmost importantly, for victims of human trafficking.\n\n  Now, human trafficking is a problem that, unfortunately, comes in \nmany forms and in many States--all States, in fact--in all corners of \nour Nation. In order to best combat human trafficking, we must work \ntoward a seamless Federal and State partnership in order to stop this \ngrowing problem.\n  To that end, I have been proud to have worked with many Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle--Senators Heitkamp, Gillibrand, Ayotte, and \nMurkowski--on a simple yet straightforward amendment that incentivizes \nState and Federal cooperation on this important issue.\n  The Mann Act cooperation amendment will free Federal resources by \nallowing State attorneys general and local DAs to prosecute human \ntrafficking cases that would otherwise be assigned to Federal \nGovernment prosecutors; or if Federal Government prosecutors do not \nhave the resources to take on such cases, oftentimes they are not going \nto be pursued.\n  At the same time, this amendment preserves the Federal prosecutor's \nability to exercise prosecutorial options while, importantly, \nincreasing transparency about decisions made on human trafficking \ncases.\n  In human trafficking cases, it is often local investigators and local \nprosecutors who have the most information on these cases. As Alaska's \nattorney general, I saw this firsthand. We usually had great \ncooperation with our partners in the Federal Government.\n  But when the Feds can't take on human trafficking cases due to \nlimited resources, they should be encouraged to allow State officials \nto take on such cases. That is the key goal of this amendment--to \nenable the resources and cooperation between State and Federal \nprosecutors to ensure that all cases of human trafficking are pursued, \nvictims have justice, and perpetrators\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\npay penalties. That is what this amendment will do. That is why I \nbelieve it is such a win-win approach to State and Federal prosecutions \nwith regard to human trafficking.\n  This amendment also provides oversight and transparency by assuring \nthere must also be communication between the States and the Federal \nGovernment when making human trafficking prosecution decisions.\n  However, as to the broader human trafficking bill that so many \nMembers of this body have been working on--so many on both sides of the \naisle--if that bill dies on the Senate floor, so will the numerous \namendments that would also advance justice for the victims of human \ntrafficking, including the Mann Act cooperation amendment. This is just \none of many amendments on this important topic. We should not allow \nthis to happen.\n  We need to get to work for the victims of human trafficking, who are \nlooking for the Senate's leadership to help stamp out this scourge of \nhuman trafficking, which is affecting our country in so many different \nareas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1482-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1482-S1483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak again on the impending \nexhaustion of reserves in the disability insurance program or the \ndisability insurance trust fund.\n  As we know, disability insurance, or DI, is an important program \nadministered by Social Security Administration, or SSA. The impending \nexhaustion of the DI trust fund threatens disabled American workers \nwith benefit cuts, under current law, toward the end of calendar year \n2016.\n  Once again, I am committed to working with anyone to ensure that \nthose cuts do not occur. Unfortunately, the administration and SSA have \nyet to show they are committed to addressing this problem.\n  As chair of the Senate Finance Committee, I will continue speaking on \nthe floor about the imminent challenge that we face with the DI trust \nfund and about solutions.\n  I will continue to reach out to shareholders and to anyone who is \ninterested in bipartisan discussions aimed at achieving solutions. And \nI will be acting to at least begin to chip away at the financial \nchallenges facing the DI program, which I have been warning people \nabout for years--that it is going to go broke unless we do something to \nimprove them. I do believe we should act at least to begin to chip away \nat the financial challenges the DI program is facing, while examining \nways we can help improve and modernize the Social Security system \nitself.\n  I once again call on my friends on the other side of the aisle and in \nthe administration to join me in this effort.\n  I wish to take a moment to note that some recent proposals to reform \nSocial Security that have been put forward by some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle are, simply put, irresponsible. We have seen \nproposals recently to raise taxes in the Social Security Program, \nusually to increase net progressivity in an already progressive \nstructure and then spend most of the revenue on benefit expansion \nwithout adequately considering the fact that even under their proposal \nwe have gaping long-run holes in Social Security's finances. Raising \ntaxes and increasing some benefits now, while still leaving an \nunsustainable financial structure in place, would be fundamentally \nunfair to younger generations of workers who will have to eventually \npay even more taxes, suffer from benefit cuts or, more likely, both.\n  The so-called progressive reform plans that tax more and promise more \nbenefits, even though the promises are unsustainable, are surely poll-\ntested with demographic groups who probably do not scoff at promises of \nmore benefits and higher taxes on the so-called rich. Those plans may \nhelp in fundraising for numerous groups who try to benefit from the \npolitics of fear surrounding the Social Security system.\n  But those plans do nothing for younger generations of workers, aside \nfrom sending them a clear message that they are on their own.\n  Again, this is irresponsible.\n  More generally, some believe that we could solve all or most of the \nfinancial challenges facing the DI program and Social Security, in \ngeneral, through higher taxes.\n  To investigate whether that is the case, I made several requests of \nthe Congressional Budget Office regarding this strategy. Recent \nanalysis performed in response to those requests shows how difficult \nthis approach can be.\n  Most proposals to reform Social Security by raising payroll taxes \nwould result in massive tax increases, particularly on the middle \nclass--on middle-class Americans--which would negatively impact job \ngrowth and harm middle-income families. That is hardly what our economy \nneeds.\n  For example, according to CBO, if you wanted to generate long-term \nbalance between inflows and outflows for the DI program--using a DI \npayroll tax increase alone--you would have to increase the tax rate by \n39 percent, which would hit low-, middle-, and upper-income earners \nalike, and it would hit hard.\n  If you wanted to generate long-term balance for Social Security, \ngenerally, including DI and retirement, and try to do it by eliminating \nthe maximum on earnings subject to the payroll tax and resulting \nbenefits, according to CBO, a worker earning $150,000 a year would pay \nabout 26 percent more in payroll taxes. A worker earning $200,000 a \nyear would pay about 68 percent more, and a worker earning $250,000 a \nyear would pay 109 percent more.\n  Now, it may be that raising taxes by 26 percent to more than 100 \npercent on those earners is something that my friends on the other side \nof the aisle are comfortable with--under the notion of taxing the so-\ncalled rich.\n  I would note, of course, that while a family headed by someone \nearning $150,000 a year may be comfortable in many areas of the \ncountry, it appears that the ever-changing definition of rich is \ndescending lower and lower into the middle class, as my friends on the \nother side have lectured more and more over recent years about \ninequality.\n  Even if you were to eliminate the taxable minimum entirely but still \nprovide corresponding benefits to upper earners in accordance with \ncurrent law, only around 45 percent of Social Security's long-run \nfinancial challenges would be addressed. You would still need to hike \ntaxes more, cut benefits, or both, to fully address the program's long-\nterm fiscal problems. Because upper earners will pay more taxes but \nalso receive corresponding benefits, since Social Security was designed \nto have such a correspondence, the policy of increasing the taxable \nmaximum ends up giving higher replacement rates to upper earners.\n  That hardly seems to be a workable solution--since it doesn't solve \nthe financial problem, and it doesn't solve the inequality problem that \nis so bothersome to my friends on the other side.\n  Perhaps just for the sake of argument, we should consider eliminating \nthe taxable minimum, thereby raising taxes substantially on upper \nearners, and not giving them any corresponding benefits for those \nincreased tax payments.\n  Of course, such a policy is bothersome to some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle, since it breaks the connection in Social \nSecurity between what people put in and what they get out.\n  Some would say that this would convert Social Security into another \nwelfare program focused on redistribution and away from a program \nfocused more on self-financed retirement security and protection \nagainst income losses from disability. So, instead, maybe we should \nconsider eliminating the taxable maximum and give some small benefit \nreturn in exchange.\n  Well, in such a case, according to CBO, you would still not be able \nto solve the financial challenges facing Social Security. Using \nscheduled benefits and replacement rates ``would increase noticeably \nonly for people in the highest quintile of lifetime household \nearnings.'' I don't think that result would be desirable to the tax-\nthe-rich coalition.\n  Let me continue by noting some recent remarks on the Senate floor \nfrom the junior Senator from Vermont and the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, who promises to put forward what he suggests is a \ncourageous way to confront Social Security's financial challenges.\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\n  Of course, he has not put forward any legislation or plan in this \nCongress. So if we want to talk specifics, we have to look at his \nprevious plan, which he released in the 113th Congress.\n  Under that plan, the current taxable maximum is preserved, as are \ncurrent payroll tax rates. The new twist is that his plan imposes \ncurrent payroll tax rates on earnings above $250,000 a year, which, \nevidently, is where the distinction between the so-called rich and \neveryone else lies, in their opinion.\n  That $250,000 threshold is not--let me repeat--is not indexed to \ninflation. Earnings subject to the tax above $250,000 a year would not \nbe included in earnings used to compute benefits, which is to say that \nunder this plan a worker would pay Social Security taxes on earnings \nabove $250,000 a year, with no corresponding increase in Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  Again, this would move the system away from a self-financed insurance \nprogram toward what some would call welfare and redistribution. Since \nthe new $250,000 threshold is not indexed, eventually more and more \nearnings will become subject to increased Social Security taxes without \ngetting anything in terms of benefits and return.\n  In around 20 years, middle-class earners who today have just \nsurpassed the taxable maximum will be pushed into the earnings category \nwhere they lose the connection between Social Security taxes and \ncorresponding benefits.\n  At that time, an indexed income equivalent of what is around $120,000 \na year today will be deemed to be rich, with earnings above that amount \nworthy of being taxed more for Social Security but not worthy of \nreceiving any additional Social Security benefits.\n  So what does the Senator's scheme that, once again, was put forward \nin the last Congress, accomplish? Admittedly, it does extend the \nsolvency of Social Security by around 28 years or so, but it still does \nnot make the system financially sustainable in the long run, leaving an \nassured financial shortfall and attendant need for yet more taxes or \nbenefits cuts, and leaving it to younger generations or workers to \nfigure it out. More than likely it will, in many respects, sever the \nconnection between what people pay in to Social Security and what they \ncan expect to get out of this program in terms of benefits. Once again, \nthis represents a fundamental shift in Social Security policy, one that \nsome may support but few are now willing to openly defend.\n\n  I look forward to debating, discussing, and voting on any plan that \nany of my friends on the other side of the aisle put forward to tackle \nSocial Security's financial challenges, including any new plan the \njunior Senator from Vermont wants to put forward, particularly if it \nresembles the plan he introduced last Congress. Indeed, I would be \nanxious to see how many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwant to go on record in support of yet more tax increases and a \nfundamental shift in the nature of the Social Security Program.\n  In the meantime, we still have the pending depletion of reserves in \nthe DI trust fund, which is something we will have to address before \nthe end of calendar year 2016.\n  From my perspective, the sooner we tackle this challenge the better, \nbut it is hard to act when we have an administration that refuses to \nengage in discussion and seems to want to make this a partisan issue by \nputting forward a plan to reallocate payroll taxes from one trust fund \nto another without any further discussion or debate.\n  What I continue to hear from the administration and many of its \nallies in Congress are stale talking points, many of which are wrong or \ndistorted, and a ``take it or leave it'' approach to deliberating over \nthe reallocation scheme devised unilaterally by this administration. \nThe only thing this administration appears willing to discuss when it \ncomes to Social Security is its own kick-the-can strategy coupled with \nadditional administrative funds for the SSA, either funded with yet \nmore Federal debt or by crowding out spending on other discretionary \nprograms.\n  Meanwhile, I am comforted by many in the disability advocacy \ncommunity who are at least willing to have conversations about how we \ncan work to improve Social Security's programs while also paying \nattention to its financial challenges. There are several groups \ncurrently hard at work analyzing options and having debate and \ndiscussion about what we could look at for program improvements and \nfiscal responsibility.\n  There is certainly more we can do to improve the DI system and help \nmake it work better for beneficiaries. There is certainly more we can \ndo to improve Social Security's retirement side to help make it work \nbetter for modern family situations. There is certainly more we can do \non the program integrity side, including some of the President's \nproposals and more. There is certainly more we can do to protect \nagainst frivolous decisionmaking by administrative law judges in the DI \nprogram--and there is plenty of that which is costing us arms and legs. \nThere is certainly more we can do to reduce fraud in the DI program, \nwhich literally robs resources from those truly in need.\n  Sadly, the Obama administration's approach to DI and Social Security \nin general has thus far been largely to remain silent, even in the face \nof the impending DI trust fund exhaustion. The only major structural \nchange the administration briefly considered was adoption of the \nchained CPI in governmentwide price indexation coupled with benefit \nenhancements for vulnerable populations. However, the President has \nsince withdrawn even that modest proposal and has publicly stated he \nwould not even discuss the idea unless he was assured of getting yet \nanother tax hike for the general fund to go along with it.\n  As I have said before, it is premature to kick the can down the road \nagain by agreeing on some payroll tax reallocation between the two \ntrust funds in Social Security as a temporary patch of convenience and \na patch that was unilaterally constructed by this administration.\n  Yes, there have been reallocations among many trust funds in the \npast, under many varying circumstances, and, yes, many of them have had \nbipartisan support, but we have known about this coming shortfall for \nroughly 20 years. In other words, Congress has had roughly 20 years to \ncome up with solutions to help put the DI program and perhaps Social \nSecurity in general on a path to long-term financial sustainability, \nand Congress has failed.\n  We are now being asked by the current administration to double down \non that failed approach--to do another reallocation of push the problem \nfurther down the road and hope that in the interim Congress will not \nfail again.\n  President Obama, in other policy areas, has argued that if decades \nshow a policy is not working, then ``it's time for a new approach.'' \nSadly, that sentiment does not seem to apply when he is talking about \nSocial Security.\n  As I have said before, it seems we have two paths to choose from; one \nis the path I prefer, involving examination and discussion of what we \ncan do to enhance the DI program and its finances and what we can agree \nupon; the other is to engage in divisive political rhetoric and \ndemagogue the issue even further, which is irresponsible, in my view, \nand not what disabled American workers and all workers insured by the \nDI program should tolerate.\n  I repeat my previous call to my colleagues in the Senate: To anyone \nfrom either party who wishes to engage in a constructive dialogue about \nhow to fix and improve the DI program and Social Security in general, \nmy door is open. In the meantime, I plan to take whatever steps I can \nas the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction to help preserve these \nprograms for beneficiaries in the near and long term.\n  We can't keep going down this way of always demanding more taxes and \nmore spending to solve problems we could have solved a long time ago. \nWe are going to have to get serious about this, and I intend to see \nthat we do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nSportmen's Act of 2015, and I will start out by acknowledging the great \nwork by the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Murkowski of Alaska, who has been a great partner in quickly \nmoving this legislation forward.\n  The Sportsmen's Act of 2015 is gaining new momentum and earning \nwidespread bipartisan support from both sides of the aisle, from the \neast coast to the west coast and, frankly, everywhere in between. \nImproving access for hunters and anglers, restoring wildlife habitat, \nand protecting the way of life that so many of us cherish are things we \ncan all agree on because as Americans we all have a unique and deep \nconnection to the outdoors.\n  The Sportmen's Act of 2015 includes a broad array of bipartisan \nmeasures to enhance opportunities for hunters, anglers, and outdoor \nrecreation enthusiasts. It reauthorizes key conservation programs, \nimproves access to our public lands, and helps boost the outdoor \nrecreation economy. Hunting is a way of life for me and for many \nfamilies across this great Nation,\n  Similar to many New Mexicans, my 11-year-old son and I went out \nhunting on public land last fall. The bull elk we brought home will \nfeed our family for most of the coming year, but more importantly the \nexperience of backpacking into the Sangre de Cristos and Carson \nNational Forest, sleeping on the ground, and hearing the elk bugle all \naround us will feed my son's imagination for decades to come.\n  The Sportmen's Act will help ensure that American families can pass \non these outdoor traditions year after year and for generations to \ncome.\n  When I travel around New Mexico and talk with sportsmen and \nsportswomen, their No. 1 issue is access, and that is why I am so \npleased that a provision I have been championing to unlock countless \npublic lands is included in this package. Public lands, such as the \nGila Wilderness, Valles Caldera National Preserve, and the Rio Grande \ndel Norte National Monument are some of the most special places to hunt \nand fish left on the planet.\n  The HUNT Act directs all Federal public land management agencies to \nidentify our shared lands where hunting and fishing and outdoor \nrecreation are permitted but where access is nonexistent or \nsignificantly restricted and develop plans to provide that access.\n  Additionally, a provision led by my colleague, Montana Senator Jon \nTester, is also included in this bill to require a percentage of our \nannual Land and Water Conservation Funds to be made available to \nimprove recreational access to difficult-to-reach public lands.\n  Among many other bipartisan, pragmatic efforts to enhance \nopportunities for hunters and anglers, the Sportsmen's Act would \nreauthorize NAWCA, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and the Federal Land Transaction \nFacilitation Act.\n  It is clear these efforts increase and reaffirm our country's \ncommitment to the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat, but they \nare just as important for the future of our economy across the West.\n  Nationally, according to the Outdoor Industry Association, more than \n140 million Americans either make their living off the outdoors or make \noutdoor activity a priority in their daily lives. When they do that, \nthey end up spending $646 billion on outdoor recreation, resulting in \nquality jobs for another 6.1 million Americans.\n  In my home State of New Mexico--a small State with just 2 million \npeople--outdoor recreation generates more than $6 billion a year. It \nprovides 68,000 jobs and $1.7 billion in wages and annual salaries.\n  A survey done recently by New Mexico Game and Fish found that \nsportsmen alone spend more than $613 million per year in our State. \nThis boost to our economy is felt by business owners, outfitter guides, \nhotels, restaurants, gas stations, and the entire local community--\nespecially in our rural communities. The truth is our deep connection \nto the outdoors is part of the American experience and it is part of \nour heritage and culture in the West. It is something we learn from our \nmothers and fathers and pass down to our sons and our daughters.\n  The Sportmen's Act will help protect that heritage and ensure it \ncontinues for generations to come.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for indulging me, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak about and honor \nour Nation's Vietnam veterans, particularly North Dakota's Vietnam \nveterans. Since I took office, I have made it a priority to travel \nthroughout North Dakota to meet with my State's veterans, so many \nwonderful men and women who continue to serve not only their country \nbut also our State and their communities. All these veterans deserve a \nplace of honor in our society.\n  We are in the midst of the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war. On \nMay 25, 2012, President Obama issued this proclamation calling on the \nNation to honor Vietnam veterans and to honor particularly those brave \nservicemembers who gave their lives in service to their country.\n  This special period of honoring our Vietnam veterans runs through \n2025. Today I follow up on a commitment I made last year. I want to \nfocus on North Dakota's soldiers who lost their lives in Vietnam. In \nthis effort, I have partnered with students from Bismarck High School \nin researching these soldiers. I want to thank their instructors, Lori \nForde, Sara Rinas, and Allison Wendel for coordinating this project and \nsharing their students' research with my office. I think this is a \nwonderful partnership to explain and to research a war that was long \nforgotten for many of these young students.\n  Throughout this effort I want to make sure our Nation never forgets \nthe needs of our Vietnam veterans. I want to make sure our Nation \ncontinues further to honor them. I have a poster that we have created \nthat will be placed in every one of our offices, both in Washington, \nDC, and in my various State offices. I am hopeful we will be able to \ndistribute this poster throughout all of the veterans service \norganizations in North Dakota as we continue this period of \nremembrance.\n  In North Dakota, we take much pride in our history and devotion to \nservice. When our Nation, our State, and our community are called, \nNorth Dakotans stand up--no matter what the cost. And 198 sons of North \nDakota did not make it home from the Vietnam war; 198 sons of North \nDakota gave their lives in service to the freedom of this country. \nThese sons, brothers, and fathers have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Today, I want to honor them individually by talking about the lives \nof these individuals--some of these individual members. I intend \nthroughout this Congress to come to the floor and remember each one of \nthem individually and remember each one of their sacrifices.\n\n\n                             David Elsbernd\n\n  So today, I begin with David Elsbernd. He was born June 28, 1949, and \nhe was from the community of Crosby. He served in the Army in the 196th \nLight Infantry Brigade. The date of his death was September 9, 1969. He \nwas 20 years old. David had a sister and three brothers--one who also \nserved. The brother who also served was injured in Vietnam. David's \nfather remembers him as a kind, generous person who thought of everyone \nelse first.\n  Fellow soldier Paul Hughes wrote the book ``The Light Within,'' which \nincludes an account of David's death. David's family is thankful to his \nfellow soldiers and friends for taking care of him.\n\n\n                              Elroy Beier\n\n  Elroy Beier was born February 26, 1947, and grew up in Langdon. He \nserved in the Army in the 101st Airborne Division. His date of death \nwas May 5, 1968. He was 21 years old. He had three brothers and one \nsister. His mother Violet was proud to be a Gold Star Mother and was a \nmember of the VFW and the American Legion Auxiliary.\n  Elroy played basketball for Langdon Area High School. In Vietnam, \nElroy\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\nwas injured while firing at opposing forces to help his fellow soldiers \nreturn to safety. Despite his injury, Elroy refused to return to the \nUnited States. After healing, he bravely stood his ground in a \nfirefight to help his fellow soldiers but was fatally wounded.\n  Elroy's nephew, Marcus, was inspired by Elroy's bravery and sacrifice \nand, as a result, he joined the military.\n\n\n                              John Lundin\n\n  John Lundin was born February 3, 1932. His hometown was Sentinel \nButte. He served in the Army, Advisory Team 91. The date of his death \nwas April 25, 1970. He was 38 years old. John was the oldest of eight \nchildren.\n  While stationed in Germany, he met and married Charlotte. When he was \nkilled in action, he left behind Charlotte and 3 children, ages 14, 9, \nand 4.\n  Before his deployment to Vietnam, the Army taught him the Vietnamese \nlanguage. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in \naction and the Bronze Star for valor. John's family cherishes the \nletter the Army gave them describing John's heroism the day he died, \nwhen he sacrificed himself by drawing fire away from his fellow \nsoldiers.\n  I want to give special thanks to Bismarck High School students Emily \nSchmid, Brittany Hawkinson, McKenzie Rittel, and Shelby Wittenberg for \nreaching out to John Lundin's family and learning this important \ninformation about John's life and his extraordinary service.\n\n\n                              Marvis Briss\n\n  Marvis Briss was born November 6, 1948. He grew up in Binford. He \nserved in the Army, 11th Battalion, 9th Infantry Division. He died May \n28, 1969, at the age of 20.\n  Marvis grew up on a farm, and his siblings remember him as a \nwonderful brother. His family is honored that he was so brave. He \nearned the Air Medal for meritorious achievement, outstanding degree of \nprofessionalism, and devotion to duty, and the Army Commendation Medal \nfor heroic actions in keeping with the highest traditions of military \nservice.\n  Marvis was pictured in the 1969 LIFE magazine article about the 242 \nAmerican soldiers killed in 7 days in the Vietnam war.\n\n\n                              Kenyon Bean\n\n  Kenyon ``Ken'' Bean was born May 25, 1946. He grew up in Williston. \nHe served in the Army, 35th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division. His date \nof death was May 19, 1967. He was 20 years old. Ken was the oldest of \nthree. Ken's sister Cheryl and brother Lowell remember his wonderful \nsense of humor and his strong desire to farm.\n  He earned the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and the National Defense \nService Medal for heroism in his attempt to move his critically injured \nplatoon leader to safety while under sniper fire.\n  His commanding officer cited Ken's courageous self-sacrifice and \ninspiring bravery as reflecting great credit upon himself and the U.S. \nArmy.\n\n\n                               Paul Wolos\n\n  Paul Wolos was born July 22, 1947.

At the time of his death, he \nwas 20 years old.\n  His uncle, a U.S. Marine, sponsored him so that as a Canadian he \ncould enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps. Paul was proud to volunteer and \nto serve the United States as a marine so he could fight communism.\n  Paul signed a noncitizen waiver so he could serve in-country in \nVietnam with his unit. One story that his friends recall is on a \nhunting trip Paul was so proud of his service as a U.S. Marine, that \nwhen he went home for Christmas after basic training, his friends joked \nthat Paul didn't take his uniform off once.\n\n\n                             David Berdahl\n\n  David Berdahl was born January 16, 1953.

Mr. President, in my home State of Kansas, we enjoy a \nspecial way of life. I have talked about it many times on the Senate \nfloor. That special way of life includes a rich tradition of hunting, \ntarget shooting, and other law-abiding activities covered by our Second \nAmendment rights. Our State welcomes nearly 300,000 hunters each year, \nand in turn those individuals create jobs and economic opportunity for \nmany Kansans.\n  I was disturbed to learn of a recent proposal by the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. On Friday, February 13, the \nATF proposed--without any instruction from Congress, on its own \nvolition--a framework to determine whether M855 ammunition, which is \npopular for hunting and target shooting, is primarily intended to be \nused for sporting or if it is more likely to be used in handguns by \ncriminals. ATF indicated it wants to ban the ammunition, which has been \nused by law-abiding citizens, including Kansans, for decades because it \nis ``armor piercing'' and, therefore, poses a risk to the safety of law \nenforcement officials.\n  The fact is that almost all rifle ammunition is armor-piercing. The \nLaw Enforcement Protection Act of 1986, which ATF cites as a statutory \nauthority to ban this ammunition, specifically exempts armor-piercing \nammunition ``which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to \nbe used for sporting purposes.'' Congress's intent for providing this \nexemption was clear: Law-abiding citizens should not be deprived of \ntheir right to use this ammo for legitimate purposes, such as target \nshooting, hunting, and shooting competitions. In fact, Kansans, who \nexpressed their concern to me about this issue in recent weeks, have \nconsistently indicated that the proposed ban would directly interfere \nwith their sporting uses and, more broadly, their Second Amendment \nrights.\n  Most troubling about the ATF proposal was how it intended to judge \n``likely use'' of this ammunition. ATF planned to judge that M855 \nammunition is more likely to be used in a handgun for criminal purposes \nrather than for sporting purposes simply based upon the bullet's weight \nand type of firearm in which it could be loaded. What was missing was \nany interest by ATF in the law-abiding ammunition consumers across the \ncounty. How might they use the ammunition? How could ATF determine \nprimary intended use without conducting a study on how that ammunition \nactually would be used by the public?\n  The ATF framework failed to make any objective conclusions and would \nhave served as nothing more than a tool for increased gun \nrestrictions--and I would say increased gun restrictions that weren't \npassed by Congress.\n  Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Grassley, \ncirculated a letter among my colleagues and to me directed at ATF \nDirector B. Todd Jones outlining these and many other concerns related \nto the proposed framework to ban this ammunition. I join Senator \nGrassley in signing this letter, and I am thankful it appears that our \nmessage was received because on Tuesday of this week the ATF announced \nthat it will ``formally delay'' the implementation of the proposed \nammunition ban. I thank the thousands--in fact, tens of thousands of \nAmericans who voiced their concerns both to Congress and to ATF. ATF \nreceived an incredible 80,000 public comments on the proposed \nframework.\n  Congress has never banned this ammunition and has never intended to \nban it. In the future, the ATF should not propose to ban any widely \nused form of ammunition favored by law-abiding civilians for lawful \npurposes.\n  Again, I am thankful that the proposed framework has now been \nrescinded, and I will continue my efforts in the Senate to support the \nSecond Amendment freedoms of all Americans.\n  I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the good work of the Senator \nfrom Kansas. We have worked on, in the Banking Committee, a number of \nissues together, and I appreciate the work we have been able to do \nacross party lines. So I thank the Senator for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1486-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1486-S1489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TRADE TRANSPARENCY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am joined on the floor this evening by \nSenator Casey. Just 2 weeks ago, he and I and a half dozen other \nSenators came to the floor in an unusual configuration. It is not \nsomething Senators do all that often. We came as a group, but each \nspoke individually about our concerns with trade promotion authority \nand the Trans-Pacific Partnership, both the so-called fast track and \nthe trade agreement that is being negotiated among the United States, \nCanada, Mexico, some Pacific nations, and Peru, I believe, too, as well \nas nations in Asia.\n  The concerns we have and the concerns an increasing number of \nSenators have about trade promotion authority, about fast track--they \nchanged the name because they knew the public did not like fast track, \nso they tried to obscure it by coming up with some technical-sounding \nname--trade promotion authority. We have increasingly seen the public \nrising up against these trade agreements because we have watched them \nfor some 20 years, and we have seen the damage the North American Free \nTrade Agreement did to the United States, to our economy, and to \nworkers around the world. We have seen that has been sort of a \nprototype for the next generation of CAFTA and other agreements in \nColombia and Peru and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I want to discuss this, in part, because we know so little about the \nU.S. Trade Representative's upcoming trade agenda and specifically the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership. The way we pass trade agreements, and it is \nimportant for colleagues to understand this, stands in a class by \nitself. No other legislation we do is as hidden not only from public \nview but even those in this body whose constitutional duty it is to \napprove or reject them.\n  Senator Casey and I stood here in the well of the Senate, we raised \nour right hands--Senator Casey and I were honored to come in at the \nsame time, as of January 2007 and then again in January 2013. We raised \nour right hands and took an oath understanding our constitutional duty \nto approve or reject trade agreements.\n  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution entrusts in Congress the \nauthority to regulate commerce with foreign nations, but the current \nTPP language is\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\nbeing guarded as though it were a State secret. Members of this body \nwere permitted to view the language only with U.S. Trade Representative \nstaff there, not with their personal staff.\n  Nora Todd, in my office, who has great skills and expertise and has \nworked on trade issues for years, because she is not committee staff is \nnot able to view this. The USTR refuses to put down in writing their \npolicy for restricting access. So the access is restricted, but we \ncan't even find out from the U.S. Trade Rep what this actually means, \nexcept we know access is restricted. It means few Senators and fewer of \nour staff--and damn the public who have worked on this issue--have ever \nseen the text at all.\n  Trade agreements such as this affect our entire economy. Forty \npercent of world GDP is included in this Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nwith countries as big as Japan, the United States, and economies as big \nas Canada's and Mexico's. This will affect the entire economy and cause \nripple effects for decades.\n  We know what CAFTA did, and that was only three countries--the United \nStates, Canada, and Mexico. This is four times that many countries. \nThey should be debated in a transparent process. The public should \nknow, Senators and Members of Congress should know. We don't know \nenough. Yet the Finance Committee fairly soon is going to push this \ntrade agreement out of fast track and the agreement out onto the Senate \nFloor, when we simply don't have access to information.\n  Let me give an example. Last year, the U.S. Trade Rep developed a \nproposal on something called the rules of origin for automobiles. That \nreally matters in my State. It matters in Senator Casey's State because \nthey are such a major part of the steel and other supply chain items \nfor autos. I have been trying to work with the USTR to better \nunderstand this proposal since last October. I personally spoke again \nlast week with Ambassador Froman to understand it better.\n  Rules of origin are very important provisions in a trade agreement. \nThey determine how much of a product's components need to come from TPP \ncountries in order to qualify under the agreement. What that means is \nwe know as American consumers it is hard to find a suit, it is hard to \nfind much of anything made in the U.S.A., but we also know many \nAmerican consumers would like to buy products that are 40 or 50 or 80 \npercent from the United States--made by workers in Kansas or workers in \nPennsylvania or workers in Ohio. But we aren't able to tell under the \nrules of origin what that number is and where those components come \nfrom.\n  So if there is going to be a trade advantage to Japan--and they have \nhad plenty of trade advantages when it comes to autos--we don't know if \nthose automobile components come 70 or 80 percent from Japan and maybe \n20 percent from China or 60 percent from China. We don't know that \nbecause the U.S. Trade Rep will not tell us. So what we are concerned \nabout--and China is not in TPP--is that the People's Republic of China \nwill manufacture so much of the supply chain, so many of these \ncomponents, backdoor it into China, so people in China are hired \ninstead of people in the United States or the people in these countries \nwe are trading with.\n  These provisions are critical for the auto supply chain in our \ncountry because they are already facing fierce competition with China. \nWe need to make sure we have strong rules of origin so cars are made \nand assembled in TPP countries, not China. The auto supply chain \nemploys 120,000 people in Ohio. It will be affected by the auto rules \nof origin in TPP.\n  To understand how important that is, our country, from 2000 to 2010, \nthe end of the Clinton administration until 2 years into the Obama \nadministration--mostly the 8 Bush years--we lost 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs, 60,000 plants in places such as Pennsylvania and \nOhio. We know that. Our economy has been growing, however, since two \nthings: the Recovery Act of 2009 and the auto rescue of 2010. We have \nseen 58, 59, 60 months of economic growth, consecutive months, since \nthen. That underscores how important auto is in my State, where, as I \nsaid, 120,000 people are in the auto supply chain.\n  But we continue to face roadblocks just to getting the basic \ninformation on a plan that would have a major effect on Ohio's auto \nsupply chain. What I don't understand is why would this body, why would \nthe 100 people who took that oath, as Senator Casey and I did in 2013 \nand 2007 in this Chamber, vote for something we can't get information \nabout? Why would anybody who took an oath of office do that?\n  We worked with the administration to rescue the auto manufacturing \nsector, and it helped save our auto industry--tens of thousands of jobs \nin that supply chain--so I want to make sure the TPP rules of origin \nfor autos will not benefit China. I want it to benefit American \ncompanies, and I want it to benefit American workers.\n  I grew up in Mansfield, OH. I have seen what globalization has done \nfor jobs, and I have seen what globalization has done to wages. \nMansfield, OH, is a city of 50,000. We have a lot of Mansfields in my \nState: Zanesville, Chillicothe, Ravenna, Lima, Springfield. These are \ncities that used to be prosperous manufacturing hubs that have lost so \nmany jobs. Not all jobs were lost due to globalization, but a big part \nof that is globalization. That is why, when USTR will not share the \ninformation we need to understand this proposal, it is particularly \ntroubling.\n\n  We can see what has happened. This trade agreement--corporate \nhandout, worker sellout--look what has happened since 1980. These are \nthe average salaries, the blue line, of the richest 1 percent in \nAmerica. Look what has happened to the richest 1 percent starting in \nthe early days of the Reagan administration. Look what has happened to \neveryone else. We have the richest 1 percent who have seen their \nincomes go up about 130 percent. We have everybody else's incomes that \nhave gone up around 10, 12 or 15 percent--and that is not for here, \nthat is for overall.\n  Again, globalization is not the entire reason, but when they will not \nshare, when USTR will not tell us what is going on, it is particularly \ntroubling when we look at this chart. We know our workers--we know Ohio \nworkers and manufacturers can compete with anyone in the world, but \nthey need fair rules and they need a level playing field. They do not \nhave that here. It is clear. The rules of origin aren't the only part \nof the deal being developed in the dark. News reports yesterday \nrevealed the USTR may be negotiating side letters on intellectual \nproperty provisions. The same report indicates the side letters might \ncover other issues as well.\n  We remember the NAFTA side letters on labor and the environment and \nwe know how effective they were. They weren't. Clearly, they were sort \nof the Bush administration, the first, negotiating and then the Clinton \nadministration, trying to get support in the Senate and the House, \nadding these side agreements that amounted to nothing. It was to \nplacate workers and to placate the environmentalists, but it did very \nlittle. We can't make the same mistake with the TPP.\n  Will the side letters be covered by the agreement's dispute \nsettlement? When will Members of Congress be able to see these letters? \nWhat impact will they have on the overall agreement? These are \nquestions Members of Congress are asking and we are not getting answers \nfrom Ambassador Froman or the U.S. Trade Rep's office. It is time the \nUSTR provided some real answers.\n  It is our job to scrutinize every trade proposal to ensure it creates \na level playing field. It isn't just another corporate handout that \nshifts jobs overseas.\n  This lack of transparency isn't limited to TPP. I have asked the USTR \nto make the United States-European Union--the so-called TTIP \nagreement--proposal public. Once again, these requests for more \ntransparency have been met with nothing but secrecy. Meanwhile, the EU \nmakes their proposals public.\n  This isn't about protecting the privileges of Senator Casey and me--\nthe privilege of Senators, this is about protecting our small \ncompanies, our manufacturing companies that get obliterated when large \ncompanies move offshore. This is about protecting the workers in places \nsuch as Toledo and Akron, OH. This is about protecting these \ncommunities. When plants close in Jackson, OH, and plants close in \nWaverly and Portsmouth and St.\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\nClairsville and Lisbon, school districts lay off teachers, police \ndepartments lay off cops, and cities lay off firefighters.\n  We have been down this road too many times in this country. It has \nbeen more than 20 years since NAFTA. Too many plants shut down in Ohio, \ntoo many shut down in Pennsylvania, and too many shut down in the State \nof Louisiana--the State of the Presiding Officer. Too many good jobs \nwere shipped abroad, and if they were replaced at all it is with low-\nwage jobs with little benefits.\n  Bad trade deals exacerbate the rise in inequality, corporate profits \ngo up, and middle-class families struggle to get by. These trade \nagreements are all about corporate handouts and worker sellouts. Over \nthe past four decades, worker productivity rose 75 percent, wages rose \n9 percent. What that says, since 1946 into the Reagan years, \nproductivity went like this, workers were this much more productive, \nand wages stayed parallel to that. But since the Reagan years, as \nproductivity went up workers wages have been flat, except for the \nrichest 1 percent, who saw their salaries explode. Everybody else has \nlived in an economy where things just don't get better.\n  The report of the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity, cochaired by \nLarry Summers, concluded that ``powerful forces of globalization . . . \nmust be navigated or inequalities will continue to widen, and for many, \nprecarious low-skill work will increasingly become the norm.''\n  Fast-tracking--that is what TPA is--fast-tracking proposals such as \nTPP, without congressional input, without congressional knowledge, let \nalone public knowledge of this--without congressional input, without \noversight, even the bare facts of the deal--reduces our ability to \nnavigate the forces of globalization and to advocate for the workers, \nwhich is what Senator Casey and I spend most of our time doing here. It \nperpetuates the USTR's approach to trade negotiations. I am in the \nmiddle of reading a book, ``The House of Morgan,'' about J.P. Morgan, \nSr., and J.P. Morgan, Jr. I can't help thinking, that attitude, the \npublic be damned, is what the USTR is doing to us right now. They don't \ncare to share information with Senator Casey and me and the rest of \nthis body, supporters of the USTR and opponents of the USTR, and they \nsure don't care about the public learning more about this. All of this \nwill only lead to more inequality.\n\n  I want trade; I support trade; I want more trade. Ohio workers want \naccess to new markets for our products. But we need trade that works. \nThe way we get trade that works is not by rushing into more corporate-\nsponsored trade agreements without even knowing what we are signing. \nThe USTR needs to open up the process; otherwise, the public is \nconvinced they are going to see more corporate handouts and more worker \nsellouts.\n  I yield the floor to my friend, Senator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the same issue Senator \nBrown raised, the issue of trade, and I thank him and commend him for \nnot only his leadership on this issue for many years, his time in the \nU.S. House of Representatives and now in the Senate for the last 8 \nyears, but especially his work and his focus on this issue most \nrecently because we are moving into a period now of great debate about \ntrade promotion authority and trade agreements that will be debated \nhere in the Senate and throughout the country. So I commend him for \nthat.\n  What Senator Brown spoke to was a basic economic insecurity that so \nmany Americans feel. It didn't just arise in the last couple of years. \nThis is a long-standing problem and a long-standing threat to people's \neconomic insecurity. Trade agreements play a role in it.\n  I spoke the last time when the Senator and I were here about the \nconcerns I had about these trade agreements, but also the specific \nconcern about jobs or the adverse impact on jobs since the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement and then subsequent trade agreements in \nthe intervening years. Today I rise to talk about a related but very \nurgent issue, and that is the issue of wages. Senator Brown spoke to \nthis as well.\n  We know that middle-class spending power is the main driver of our \neconomic growth and the foundation of the American dream. If people \nhave money in their pockets because they have reasonable and fair \nwages, they are going to drive the economy in a much more substantial \nway. But in recent years this spending power that I speak of, of most \nAmericans, has fallen dramatically.\n  According to the Federal Reserve, the average worker's weekly \nearnings were 15 percent lower in 2012 than in 1972, when adjusted for \ninflation. So just in that roughly 40-year time period, wages were down \nin real dollars by 15 percent.\n  Senator Brown referred to a disconnect between productivity and wage \ngrowth, and there was a recent chart that was developed by the Economic \nPolicy Institute. The source for this is the Economic Policy Institute \nanalysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis. \nI hold it up. It is not big enough for people to see, but there is a \nbig line in the middle of this chart. Because it is a chart, I won't \nenter it into the Record, but I will refer to it.\n  The basic conclusion is, when we look at the question of productivity \ngrowth and wage growth from 1948 to 2013, here is what we find. It is a \ntwo-chapter book. Chapter 1 is a positive chapter; chapter 2 is really \ndisturbing. It is one of the most significant charts I have ever seen \nof what has happened to the wages of working Americans.\n  Here is what it says. From 1948 to 1973, productivity up 96.7 \npercent, hourly compensation up 91.3. So the difference between \nproductivity increase and wage increase basically from World War II to \n1973 was a differential of about 6 percentage points.\n  As Senator Brown mentioned, an alignment over that time period \nbetween wages and productivity makes sense. When workers are producing \nmore, when the economy is, as it was after World War II, producing so \nmuch more, wages should go up in a commensurate manner. Unfortunately, \nthat is chapter 1. Chapter 2 of this book starts in 1973 and it ends on \nthis chart in 2013. In that 40-year time period, productivity was up \nagain. It wasn't up 96.7 percent, but it was up 74.4 percent, so still \na strong productivity increase between 1973 and 2013.\n  What, we might ask, happened to wages? Was it still a line? Was there \na gap? Was it exactly the same? Unfortunately, the story is a terribly \nsad story. Hourly compensation, 1973 to 2013, was up a grand total of \n9.2 percent.\n  So in the first period, wages were up 91.3 percent. In the second \nperiod, 1973 to 2013, wages were only up 9.2 percent. No one in this \nbody, no one in the other body in Congress--no one who represents the \nAmerican people in Congress or any State legislature, no one who \nrepresents our country, can be satisfied with a 9.2-percent wage growth \nover 40 years when we are still having robust productivity increases.\n  There are a lot of reasons for it. There are a lot of causes we could \nmake that we could attribute to that terrible diminution, but we have \nto do something about it. Part of that is having an agenda that will \nspeak to wages and the middle class, and not to the issues that are in \nfront of us, including these trade agreements.\n  I would argue without a doubt that our trade agreements have made \nthis problem significantly worse over the last 20 or 25 years, and I am \nafraid we are headed down that path were trade promotion authority, the \nso-called Trans-Pacific Partnership, enacted into law.\n  Here is what the wage diminution meant in Pennsylvania in a shorter \nperiod of time, about 15 years. Pennsylvania median household income \nfell by 3 percent in the years between 1998 and 2013, according to the \nCensus Bureau.\n  But this trend we are talking about continues today. Even as our \neconomy recovers and stock markets reach a record high, the average \nAmerican's paycheck is barely keeping up with the rising cost of \nliving. So this problem of a lack of wage growth is nowhere near being \nsolved.\n  The decline in middle-class workers' purchasing power--another way of \nsaying wages--is not just unfair, but economic analysis also shows it \nis a drag on our economy, which is primarily driven by consumption. So \nthis isn't just a story of a worker and his or her\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\nfamily being pulled down by very powerful forces, only having their \nwages go up 9 percent in 40 years, it is also about the wider economy. \nIf folks don't have fair wages, it is going to drag down the economy, \nand we are seeing evidence of that over those 40 years.\n  But instead of enacting policies that help the middle class and focus \non this issue of wages or the lack of growth of wages, like policies \nsuch as increasing the minimum wage--that would be one of the right \nthings to do to go at this problem--or facilitating access to high-\nquality childcare, for a lot of families the second highest cost they \nhave other than housing and maybe some other expense, usually housing \nor some other expense--No. 2 is usually the cost of childcare. It is a \nbarrier to work. If you can't afford childcare, you can't go to work or \nyou have to accept a job that pays less.\n  Extended relief to workers displaced by foreign competition. I would \nput the word ``unfair'' foreign competition. That is something else we \nshould work on.\n  So if we are working on raising the minimum wage, growing the middle \nclass, helping families pay for childcare, helping families pay for the \nterribly high cost of higher education, maybe no other number is more \ndisturbing than this ``wage, 9 percent in 40 years'' number that I \nmentioned. Maybe the only other number more disturbing is the cost of \ncollege education going up higher than anything in our lives the last \ncouple of decades.\n  Middle-class workers know this type of policy that some are pursuing \nis headed in the wrong direction. Instead of them seeing us working on \npolicies that will advance and support the middle class, they see \nCongress considering a massive trade agreement with 11 Asia Pacific \ncountries. So these same middle-class families who look to us for \nprogress and action and results for the middle class and for their \nwages are seeing a lot of folks in Washington focus on trade agreements \nthat will make the problem worse.\n  A recent Pew poll of the Nation found that 83 percent of Americans \nsaid free trade does not raise their wages and 45 percent said so-\ncalled free trade lowers American wages. For many years, many \neconomists have argued that trade was a net positive for Americans and \ndid not have a noticeable impact on wages. However, recently I think \nother economists are having a different perspective.\n  A 2009 paper by three economists, one from the University of \nPennsylvania, found that when workers are displaced by trade and switch \njobs, they suffer real wage loss of between 12 and 17 percent. So in \nlight of this data by economists that says when you have a job switch \nor a job change because of trade and your wages are going to go down 12 \nto 17 percent, and all the other data that we have about what has \nhappened in States such as Pennsylvania, or Ohio, which Senator Brown \nrepresents--what has happened to those communities and those people--\nwhy would we go down the same path of ratifying agreements which will \ndo the same over time? I don't think we should, and that is why this \ndebate is very important.\n  Another analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a standard \neconomic model shows that American workers without a college degree \nearn $1,800 less each year as a result of expanded trade. Again, \nfurther exacerbation of the same problem that trade agreements lead to.\n  I know people in my home State of Pennsylvania--and I am sure this is \ntrue in Ohio and a number of other States--are skeptical of these trade \ndeals because they have experienced these pressures firsthand. This is \nreal life for them. So before we cut another deal, we should work to \nlevel the playing field for our own companies and workers, including \nensuring workers and companies get real relief from unfair trade \npractices.\n  Pennsylvanians and, I think, Americans want Congress and the \nadministration to focus on policies that lead to both good jobs and \ngood wages. Fundamentally, I argue that these agreements cause major \nconcerns on both fronts, the jobs front as well as the wage front.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1489-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1489-S1490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SAVING THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about an issue that \nall Senators should be concerned about, and that is the future of the \nOrganization of American States.\n  The origin of the OAS dates to the First International Conference of \nAmerican States held in Washington from October 1889 to April 1890. The \nOAS was formally established in 1948 with the signing of the OAS \nCharter, which entered into force in 1951.\n  As the OAS Charter states, its mission is to achieve among its \nmembers ``an order of peace and justice, and to promote their \nsolidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their \nsovereignty, their territorial integrity, and their independence.'' \nThat is an important and inspiring responsibility, and no less so today \nthan when the OAS was founded, although many of the challenges of one-\nhalf century ago have been replaced by new challenges today.\n  Today the OAS consists of 35 independent States and is, at least in \ncomposition and tradition, the primary political, judicial, and social \ngovernmental forum in this hemisphere. Another 69 States and the \nEuropean Union have permanent observer status.\n  The OAS supports programs and activities in four principle areas to \ncarry out its mission--democracy, human rights, security, and \ndevelopment--and it does so in a myriad of ways, some far more \nsuccessfully than others.\n  Few here may be aware that the United States is by far the largest \ncontributor to the OAS, paying 60 percent of its annual budget. Two \nother countries pay 22 percent and the remaining 32 countries together \npay only 12 percent.\n  Of course, the United States has by far the largest economy and \nshould pay its fair share, but no country should be assessed to pay \nmore than 50 percent. Other members should also pay their fair share, \nand we should all expect the OAS to be competently managed and to \ndeliver tangible results that justify its expenditures.\n  The OAS can be proud of the indispensable work of the Inter-American \nHuman Rights Commission and the Inter-American Court, its \ninternationally respected election observer missions, and other \nactivities to support democracy and promote transparent and accountable \ngovernance. These priorities should be strengthened, as I will mention \nshortly.\n  But the reputation of the OAS as a hemispheric leader has taken a \nbeating. This is partly due to ideological polarization driven \nprimarily by the viscerally anti-United States rhetoric and policies of \nthe leaders of four of its member States, and partly due to the fact \nthat the OAS has failed to exercise effective leadership in response to \nkey issues and events, while recent sub-hemispheric groupings have \ntaken up much of the slack and become the region's principal fora.\n  The OAS has allowed itself to be spread too thin, accepting too many \nmandates from its member States without rigorous assessment of the \ncosts and benefits. Scarce resources have been spent on employees--\nwithout regard to transparent hiring and promotion practices--some of \nwhom contribute little to the organization. At the same time, the OAS \nis facing severe budget constraints and there is no monetary reserve to \nrespond to contingencies. It is astounding that because some countries, \nincluding Brazil, stopped paying their quotas or are in arrears, and \nthe OAS had nothing in reserve, it had to obtain a loan in order to pay \nemployee salaries. This is not the kind of management the OAS needs; it \nis mismanagement.\n  The Inter-American Commission and the Inter-American Court play \nessential roles as institutions of last resort for victims of human \nrights violations in countries where impunity is the norm. When \ncorrupt, dysfunctional judicial systems fail to provide access to \njustice for victims of crimes against humanity or other violations of \nhuman rights, the OAS helps fill that void. Likewise, the Special \nRapporteur for Freedom of Expression plays a critical role at a time \nwhen some governments, such as Venezuela and Ecuador, are engaged in a \nsystematic effort to intimidate and silence their critics in the\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nindependent press, while others, including Mexico and Honduras, fail to \nprotect journalists from threats and attacks by gangs or violence \nrelated to drug trafficking.\n  Yet a shortage of funding and the failure of some member States to \ncomply with the decisions of the Commission and the rulings of the \nCourt undermine their effectiveness. Some governments have actively \nsought to weaken these key institutions by withholding financial \nsupport and proposing to limit the legal authority of the Commission \nand the Court. They and the Special Rapporteur for Freedom and \nExpression need sufficient resources to do their jobs, and it is time \nto establish a mechanism for sanctioning noncompliance.\n  The United States is not blameless, having signed but not yet \nratified the American Convention on Human Rights. This provides a \nconvenient excuse for other governments to accuse us of hypocrisy as we \nurge their adherence to human rights norms. It is time for the Congress \nto act on this piece of unfinished business.\n  I would add, however, that the United States is part of the Inter-\nAmerican Commission, as are all OAS member States, regardless of \nwhether or not they have ratified the Convention. In fact, the United \nStates has more cases at the Commission than any other country, and we \nstrive to implement its decisions.\n  The OAS needs to strengthen its election monitoring capability--\nincluding insisting on timely and equal participation by opposition \npolitical parties, freedom of the press and association--to ensure a \nlevel playing field when some Latin governments refuse to allow early \naccess by the OAS. Many Latin Americans are becoming cynical about the \nability of democratic governments to deliver basic services in a manner \nthat is transparent and accountable. Elected governments which are \ncorrupt and neglect, or are unable to protect their people, erode \nsupport for democracy.\n  Similarly, the OAS and the Secretary General in particular need to \nrespond swiftly to political crises, and exercise stronger leadership \nin defense of democratic institutions and human rights when they are \nunder assault, consistent with the OAS Charter and the Inter-American \nDemocratic Charter.\n  There is also the issue of hemispheric security. During the Cold War \nthere was a single-minded, concerted effort to prevent the Soviet Union \nfrom gaining another foothold in Latin America. Countless innocent \npeople were threatened, disappeared, tortured, or killed in the name of \nfighting communism by Central and South American security forces, many \nof them encouraged, trained and equipped by the United States, and only \na token number of the individuals responsible have been punished.\n  Today the hemisphere faces new threats, such as drug cartels, gang \nviolence, transnational crime, money laundering, and natural disasters. \nBut the plans to address them like the Merida Initiative and the \nAlliance for Prosperity, while identifying such priorities as police \nand judicial reform, poverty, fiscal transparency, and corruption, tend \nto be long on goals and short on specifics of how to achieve them. \nCooperation on multi-dimensional security threats is not a matter of \nideology. Cuba and the United States are already cooperating against \ndrug-traffickers, as we are with other countries. But there is a lot \nmore that can and should be done to identify the causes and develop and \nimplement more effective regional strategies to address these problems.\n  Several Latin countries have made notable strides in the past decade \nand are providing greater opportunities for their people. The OAS can \nplay a role in convening a debate, identifying solutions, and \nfacilitating an alliance of key development organizations, including \nthe Inter-American Development Bank and the Pan American Health \nOrganization, to address areas of shared interest such as achieving \nsustained, equitable economic growth, strengthening public education \nand health, and protecting natural resources.\n  The OAS has an important, under-utilized role to play in interfacing \nwith the wide range of civil society organizations which are essential \nto any democracy and are often under-appreciated, under-funded, and \npersecuted. With OAS offices throughout the hemisphere, its under-\nutilized employees could engage far more actively with academia, civil \nsociety, and the media. This should include any such entities that \nreject violence, not just those that are ``registered'' by local \ngovernments which sometimes use the registration process to silence \nlegitimate voices whose views the government disagrees with.\n  Finally, the OAS needs to decide how to interact with other \nhemispheric multilateral organizations in a manner that strengthens the \nOAS and encourages cooperation. Cuba's suspension, and then refusal to \nreturn, provided an impetus for the creation of new entities like \nCELAC, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, that are \nanti-OAS and anti-United States and have sowed division within the \nhemisphere.\n  The next Secretary General of the OAS, who will be selected on March \n18, has his work cut out for him. I say ``him'' because there is only \none candidate, which says volumes about how the job is perceived. The \nSecretary General plays a crucial role as the strategic leader, but not \nthe day-to-day manager, of the organization. The next Secretary General \nneeds an Assistant Secretary General with the managerial expertise and \nmandate to right this sinking ship.\n  It will mean tough budgetary decisions, including the ability to say \nno to new programs and mandates and to focus instead on doing better at \nwhat it does best.\n  As soon as possible after they assume their positions I urge them to \nreview Public Law 113-41, the ``Organization of American States \nRevitalization and Reform Act of 2013.'' That Act, which received \nbipartisan support, identifies key issues that need to be addressed--\nmany of which I have touched on here--and provides recommendations for \nhow to address them.\n  I wish them both well because the people of every country in the \nhemisphere, including those whose governments have sought to harm the \nOAS, need the OAS. But absent significant and rapid reforms beginning \nwith the quota issue, the OAS's decline may be irreversible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1490-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1490-S1491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONTINUING AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN MEDICAL INNOVATION FOR PATIENTS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee hearing this week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Continuing America's Leadership in Medical Innovation for Patients\n\n       We've got three major objectives in this committee: Fixing \n     No Child Left Behind, Reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, \n     and third--one we're all looking forward to without \n     exception--improving biomedical innovation, including the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH).\n       Today is the first hearing Ranking Member Murray and I are \n     holding on our bipartisan initiative to examine how we get \n     drugs, devices and treatments from the discovery process \n     through the regulatory process into our medicine cabinets and \n     doctors' offices.\n       Today discoveries supported by NIH often do not come to \n     FDA's door for six, eight, ten, or even twelve years. And the \n     average cost to get a single drug from the laboratory through \n     the approval process to the medicine cabinet is, according to \n     some estimates, about $1 billion. Other estimates say it's \n     double that or even more.\n       This initiative builds on work the committee has done--\n     legislation was passed in 1997 and as recently as 2012--to \n     try to get at the same goal of speeding up review and \n     approval of drugs and devices while still ensuring they are \n     safe.\n       This is a subject that has a lot of interest.\n       President Obama this year announced his new Precision \n     Medicine Initiative, saying: ``21st century businesses will \n     rely on American science, technology, research and \n     development. I want the country that eliminated polio and \n     mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine--one \n     that delivers the right treatment at the right time. In some \n     patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a \n     disease once thought unstoppable.''\n       In the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton and \n     Representative Diana Degette have been working on parallel \n     tracks on their 21st Century Cures initiative to accelerate \n     the pace of cures in America.\n       In late January, Sen. Burr and I released a report titled \n     ``Innovation for Healthier\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n     Americans'' that examined the process we have in place today \n     for drug and device development.\n       We have received over 80 comments already, and have shared \n     those with the staff of all members on the committee.\n       Our committee also has a bipartisan staff working group \n     that has been meeting for around a month now, learning more \n     about the key agencies involved in biomedical research and \n     development.\n       We have with us today Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health, which funds and enables much \n     of the early stage research that leads to medical \n     breakthroughs. And Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the head of the Food \n     and Drug Administration, which regulates all the medical \n     products we come in contact with.\n       Dr. Collins wrote in 2013 that: ``Drugs exist for only \n     about 250 of the more than 4,400 conditions with defined \n     molecular causes. And it takes far too long and far too much \n     money to get a new drug into our medicine cabinets. This is \n     an old problem that cries out for new and creative \n     solutions.''\n       Since Dr. Collins wrote that, the number of conditions with \n     defined molecular causes has increased to more than 5,400, \n     yet the number of new drugs approved has not kept pace with \n     these discoveries.\n       Dr. Hamburg has said that ``we are left relying on the 20th \n     century approaches for the review, approval and oversight of \n     the treatments and cures of the 21st century.''\n       So today's hearing is a perfect place for us to start--with \n     the heads of these two critical agencies, both of whom have \n     sounded the alarm on our existing process for drug and device \n     development.\n       This work will affect every single American--from a very \n     ill patient who has run out of treatment options and is \n     counting on the most cutting-edge drug, to an active child \n     with asthma who's hoping to run faster and farther with the \n     aid of a new drug.\n       I look forward to hearing from the witnesses more about \n     their thoughts on these five issues that Senator Burr and I \n     identified in our report: First, it costs too much to bring \n     medical products through the pipeline to patients. Second, as \n     science and technology advance, the discovery and development \n     process takes too long for medical products to make their way \n     to patients. Third, FDA's responsibilities have grown to \n     include many activities unrelated to the core function of \n     regulating medical products to advance the public health. \n     Fourth, the disparity in scientific knowledge at FDA and the \n     fast pace of biomedical innovation are slowing, and in some \n     cases, stifling innovation in American medicine. Fifth, a \n     working FDA is essential to continuing biomedical innovation \n     in the United States and maintaining America's global \n     leadership in medical innovation.\n       In the words of Andrew Eschenbach, the former Commissioner \n     of the FDA and Director of the National Cancer Institute: \n     ``We stand on the cusp of a revolution in health care. \n     Advances in molecular medicine will allow us to develop \n     powerful new treatments that can cure or even prevent \n     diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. Tomorrow's high-tech \n     cures can also slash health-care costs and eliminate \n     ineffective treatments.''\n       I look forward to taking the first step toward addressing \n     these important issues. If we do it right, our work here will \n     help improve the lives of every single American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1491-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION\n\n Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, this week marks the 50th \nanniversary of the signing of legislation to create the Appalachian \nRegional Commission, ARC.\n  In the decade of the 1960s, intense poverty and economic struggle \ncharacterized the existence for many people and towns running down the \nspine of the Appalachian Mountains. At the time, more than 19 million \nAmericans were living in the Appalachian region and struggling to \nachieve the American dream.\n  The magnitude and vastness of the challenges in Appalachia, which \nspread across many States, led the region's Governors in 1960 to form \nthe Conference of Appalachian Governors to develop a regional approach \nfor resolving these complex issues.\n  In 1961, they took their case to newly elected President John F. \nKennedy, who had been deeply moved by the poverty he saw during \ncampaign trips to West Virginia. Their efforts led to the creation of \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission and a broad bipartisan coalition in \nCongress passed the Appalachian Regional Development Act, ARDA, early \nin 1965. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law on March 9, \n1965. It is a unique agency to this day, made up of one Federal co-\nchair and 13 Governors who serve as State co-chairs. It also receives \nlocal input on allocation of resources from the local development \ndistricts.\n  Over the last 50 years, it has been able to inject Federal funds and \nleverage State and private resources to address the deep needs of this \nregion. Much success has been achieved, but yet much remains to be \ndone.\n  Poverty has been cut in half in Appalachia from nearly 31 percent of \nthe region's people in 1960 to about 16 percent today.\n  In 1960, only 32 percent of the Appalachian population completed high \nschool and 5 percent had a college degree. Since then, the number of \ncollege graduates had increased four-fold to 21 percent.\n  One of the most critical challenges facing the Appalachian region in \n1964 was its relative isolation. With the aid of the Appalachian \nRegional Commission, nearly 2,700 miles of highway development routes \nhave been built.\n  Since 1965, ARC has financed nearly 25,000 separate strategic \ninvestments in non-highway activities in the region, which includes \n$3.8 billion in Federal funds. The positive result has been that nearly \nthree times that amount, $9 billion has been forthcoming in matching \nfunds from other Federal, State and local funding sources. Better yet, \nARC-financed investments in Appalachia have also leveraged nearly $16 \nbillion in added private investment.\n  I want to congratulate the Appalachian Regional Commission on its \n50th Anniversary. I look forward to working with and supporting the \nfuture efforts of ARC and the local development districts as they \ncontinue to work with the States, localities and the private sector to \nbuild the economy of the Appalachian region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1491-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1491-S1492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING KEMP MILL SYNAGOGUE'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY AND THE SERVICE OF \n                      RABBI YAAKOV ``JACK'' BIELER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this Saturday, I will have the \nprivilege and pleasure of visiting Kemp Mill Synagogue, KMS, for a \nMelava Malka on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. KMS held its \nfirst service on March 17, 1990, attended by a group of 50 worshipers \nin a Kemp Mill home, and held its first services in its current \nlocation on Kemp Mill Road on Shabbat of September 19, 1998. The Modern \nOrthodox Synagogue is a vibrant and loving community where members of \nthe congregation gather to daven, learn, celebrate, and observe \nlifecycle events, smachot, and rituals together.\n  In 1994, Rabbi Yaakov (Jack) Bieler officially became the first rabbi \nof KMS. As the leader of the KMS community, Rabbi Bieler has led and \ninspired the development of an ambitious program of shiurim, study \ngroups, scholars-in-residence and educational programs. Weekly Divrei \nTora by men and women enlighten the congregation by offering a \ndiversity of perspectives. Youth groups and social activities \ncontribute to creating a warm and engaged community.\n  Rabbi Bieler is a great friend and true leader in Maryland's faith-\nbased community. While he has been at KMS for over 20 years, his \ncommitment to his faith and community has been a lifelong passion. \nRabbi Bieler was raised in Bayside, Queens, and attended local public \nschools. In 1969, he graduated from the James Striar School of Jewish \nStudies in New York, where he honed his mastery of Jewish texts. He \nspent the years of 1969 to 1971 studying at Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh in \nIsrael.\n  When Rabbi Bieler returned to New York, he studied at Yeshiva \nUniversity, where he was ordained by the Rabbi Isaac Eichanan \nTheological Seminary. This prestigious program, which dates back to \n1886, challenges and trains leaders of Judaism to hold fast to the ways \nof the Torah while responding to the questions and demands of modern \nsociety. During this time, he also pursued a master of arts in Jewish \nEducation from the Ferkauf Graduate School of Education, completing his \nstudies in 1974.\n  While Rabbi Bieler's studies prepared him to be a Jewish religious \nleader, he always sought new ways to share his knowledge with others. \nTo this end, Rabbi Bieler has spent much of his life in the classroom. \nHe served on the faculty and was a chairman of the Talmud Department of \nthe Joseph H. Lookstein Upper School of Ramaz from 1974 to\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n1988. In these roles, he helped to educate children in Judaic and \ngeneral studies, holding himself and others to high standards in the \nclassroom and in the community. And he has always been committed to \nmenschlichkeit, or the values of human dignity and mutual respect, and \nthe strength of Jewish heritage. Today, he is still guided by these \ncommitments.\n  Rabbi Bieler served concurrently on the faculty of the Adult \nEducation Institute of the Lincoln Square Synagogue between 1971 and \n1977 and as a permanent scholar-in-residence of Congregation Kehilath \nJeshurun from 1977 to 1988. This service speaks to Rabbi Bieler's \nbelief that our education--in faith and in life--never ends; we are \nalways learning, always seeking to become better versions of ourselves. \nHis role as an educator grew and changed before he found his way to \nKemp Mill Synagogue. In 1988, he assumed the position of lead teacher \nand chairman of the Judaic Studies Department at the Hebrew Academy of \nGreater Washington, now the Melvin J. Berman Hebrew Academy, a Modern \nOrthodox Jewish day school in Rockville, MD. He worked at the Hebrew \nAcademy of Washington for a number of years and in a variety of roles, \nbecoming the Upper School assistant principal in charge of Judaic \nStudies in 1991. During his tenure, Rabbi Bieler strove to provide \nstudents with a firm foundation in Torah and Jewish law, to encourage \ncreativity and critical thinking, and promoted a deep sense of \ncommunity and personal responsibility in students.\n  Rabbi Bieler is a man who is much loved and respected by his \ncommunity. And he is a humble man, so it falls to others to recite his \nmany achievements. During his tenure at Ramaz, he was awarded the Gruss \nOutstanding Educator award. In 1985, he received a prestigious \nJerusalem Fellows fellowship and spent the year with family, including \nhis beloved wife Dr. Joanie Bieler, in Jerusalem. Among other \nachievements, Rabbi Bieler has published numerous articles on Jewish \neducation and issues facing Judaism today, especially concerning Modern \nOrthodoxy.\n  Rabbi Bieler will be retiring from his service as the leader of the \nKemp Mill Synagogue community on June 30, 2015. He has faithfully \nserved KMS for most of its 25-year history, leading and inspiring the \ndevelopment of an ambitious educational program indicative of his love \nfor teaching, learning, and sharing Judaism. Under his leadership, KMS \nhas encouraged a congregation of mutual enlightenment and diversified \nperspectives. Furthermore, youth groups and social activities have been \ncultivated and grown, creating a warm and engaged community. KMS is an \nimportant hub of community and faith in Silver Spring. KMS members are \nleaders in the Jewish Federation, local day schools, the Rabbinical \nCouncil, the Emunah Society, the Kemp Mill Civic Association, the \nOrthodox Union, and the larger community. They are committed to worship \nand to service, to the United States, and to the State of Israel.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating KMS on its 25th \nanniversary and acknowledging the inspired service, dedication, and \nleadership of Rabbi Yaakov and Dr. Joanie Bieler who will undoubtedly \ncontinue to be involved in their community and inspire others to serve \neven when their formal leadership roles at KMS come to an end. I wish \nthem all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1492-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING PAUL CHRISTENSEN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, we honor the life and \nservice of Paul Christensen, whose passing signifies a great loss for \nNevada. I send my condolences and prayers to his wife Norma and the \nentire family in this time of mourning. Mr. Christensen was a man \ncommitted to his country, his State, and his community. He will be \nsorely missed.\n  Mr. Christensen moved with his father and mother to Las Vegas in 1939 \nwhen his father started the family's jewelry business. He graduated \nfrom Las Vegas High School in 1950 and continued his studies at Brigham \nYoung University, where he earned his bachelor's degree. He then \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force as a pilot, serving in the Korean war. \nAs one of our Nation's servicemembers, he made exceptional sacrifices \nfor our country. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Christensen for \nhis courageous contributions to the United States of America. His \nservice to his country and his bravery earn him a place among the \noutstanding men and women who have valiantly defended our Nation and \nwill never be forgotten.\n  After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Mr. Christensen returned to Las \nVegas in 1957 and worked in the family jewelry store. It was during \nthis time that he married Mrs. Christensen and began his lifelong \nlegacy of commitment to his local community. He served in the Nevada \nAssembly in the 1950s and then the Nevada Senate in the 1960s. In 1977 \nand 1981, Christensen was elected to the Las Vegas City Council, during \nwhich time he focused on the safety of southern Nevada communities by \nimproving police presence and increasing the number of firefighters. He \nalso worked to improve road conditions, specifically widening Jones \nBoulevard.\n  Mr. Christensen then continued his service to the great State of \nNevada by working tirelessly on the Clark County Commission until 1996. \nDuring his decades spent working to better the Silver State, he was \nalso chairman of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, \npresident of the Las Vegas Valley Water District, and was appointed by \nGovernor Kenny Guinn to serve on the Transportation Services Authority. \nIn October of 2013, the Paul J. Christensen Bridge was named after him \nin honor of his work in his local community, a distinction well \ndeserved. Mr. Christensen continued philanthropic work for the Las \nVegas community until his health declined.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Christensen worked tirelessly to make \nsouthern Nevada the best it could be, which I am honored to commend. He \nwas a role model and his legacy will live on. Today, I join the Las \nVegas community and citizens of the Silver State to celebrate the life \nof an upstanding Nevadan, Paul Christensen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1492-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1492-S1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING GOODWILL OF SOUTHERN NEVADA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Goodwill of \nSouthern Nevada for its commitment and dedication to providing our \nveterans, military servicemembers, and their families with supportive \nservices to aid in securing a job and financial solidarity. The \nVeterans Integration Program, VIP, is a unique service that assists our \nNation's bravest as they return from the battlefield and readjust to \nlife in their communities.\n  These heroes who served the United States and fought to protect our \nfreedom frequently arrive home to a struggling economy. All too often, \nreturning veterans and their families are unable to find a job and \nstruggle with financial uncertainty. Goodwill of Southern Nevada is a \npositive light in the local Las Vegas community, working to change this \nreality. As of the end of January 2015, VIP has helped 507 local \nveterans in southern Nevada and their immediate families find work. The \nprogram offers help in job training and job placement and provides \nnecessary tools to fluidly transition from the military back into the \nlocal community successfully. Although there is no way to ever \nadequately thank our military men and women, Goodwill of Southern \nNevada stands as a shining example of an organization that has gone \nabove and beyond to positively impact the lives of our heroes who so \nbravely fought for our freedom.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning home from the \nbattlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals but also to ensure they receive the quality care they \nhave earned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise \nfor our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the \nNation. I am very pleased that veterans service organizations like \nGoodwill of Southern Nevada are committed to ensuring that the needs of \nour veterans are being met.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nGoodwill of Southern Nevada, an organization with a mission that is \nboth noble and charitable. I am humbled and honored to recognize the \nGoodwill of\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\nSouthern Nevada and its tireless efforts in providing veterans with the \nskills necessary to reintegrate into the local community. This \norganization's commitment to helping veterans, military servicemembers, \nand their families get back on their feet is admirable, and I wish it \nthe best of luck in all of its future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1493-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING DR. KENNETH DOBBINS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Dr. \nKenneth Dobbins on his retirement and to thank him for his many years \nof leadership and service to the field of higher education. For 24 \nyears, including the last 16 years as president, Ken Dobbins has served \nSoutheast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, MO. Ken \nconsidered his job as president the position of a lifetime, and his \ndedication and passion for the University and its students is \nunparalleled. It is my pleasure to honor him today.\n  Ken received a B.S. in accounting from the University of Akron in \n1971. Upon graduation, Ken served as a commissioned officer and \ncivilian executive in the U.S. Air Force for nearly 10 years and was \nawarded the 1978 Air Force Audit Agency Outstanding Civilian Auditor of \nthe Year. Ken also received an M.B.A. from Old Dominion University in \n1979 and a Ph.D. in higher education administration from Kent State \nUniversity in 1987.\n  Before his tenure with Southeast Missouri State, Ken held positions \nin higher education administration at Kent State. At Southeast Missouri \nState, Ken served as the University's vice president of finance and \nadministration from 1991 to 1993 and executive vice president from 1993 \nuntil his appointment as president in 1999.\n  During Ken's presidency, the university reached significant \nmilestones in enrollment and diversity, academic partnerships, \nprograms, and construction. Ken's effective leadership shaped Southeast \nMissouri State University into the outstanding school it is today. As \npresident, one of his greatest accomplishments was the significant \nincrease in enrollment of students. In 1994, there were 7,500 students. \nToday there are over 12,000 students.\n  In addition, Ken oversaw more than $400 million in new construction \nand building improvement projects, including the Seabaugh Polytechnic \nBuilding and the $58 million River Campus. New academic programs, \nincluding the College of Science, Technology, and Agriculture and the \nEarl and Margie Holland School of Visual and Performing Arts were \nestablished. Ken instituted a comprehensive review of all academic and \nnonacademic programs to minimize student fee increases in the face of \nextensive State appropriation reductions. He was also responsible for \ndeveloping an innovative postprofessorial merit program, which provides \nbase salary increases and professional development funds for faculty \nmembers.\n  As president, Ken held numerous leadership positions in higher \neducation administration. He served a 2-year term as president of the \nMissouri Council on Public Higher Education, and served 3 years as \npresident of the Ohio Valley Conference. He currently serves on the \nboard of directors for the American Association of State Colleges and \nUniversities.\n  Outside his work in higher education, Ken serves on the Greater St. \nLouis Area Council for the Boy Scouts of America, and was elected by \nlocal council associates to serve on the National Council for the Boy \nScouts of America. Ken was awarded the Silver Beaver Award, the highest \nhonor given to a Boy Scout volunteer by a council. Additionally, Ken \nhas been elected to the St. Louis Regional Chamber board of directors \nand is a member of the Hawthorne Foundation.\n  Ken is looking forward to spending more time with his wife Jeanine, \nson Paul, daughter-in-law Stacey, and his two grandchildren. I know \nthey will enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with him. Ken will \ncontinue to be involved in higher education during his retirement by \nserving as a consultant with the American Association of State Colleges \nand Universities.\n  It is my pleasure to honor Ken Dobbins today. He has touched the \nlives of many and immensely improved the quality of Southeast Missouri \nState University and the Cape Girardeau community. His dedication to \nhigher education and the State of Missouri has been invaluable.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating and honoring Dr. \nKenneth Dobbins.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1493-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            103RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize the \n103rd anniversary of the Girl Scouts of America. What started out as a \ngroup of 18 girls in Georgia organized by Juliette Low has grown into \nan organization of more than 3.2 million girls and women and more than \n59 million alumnae, including myself. As a former Girl Scout, I know \nfirsthand how important the Girl Scouts are for learning about \nleadership, service, and personal development.\n  When the Girl Scouts started, women couldn't vote, women couldn't \nhave property in their name, and in some States women couldn't go to \ncollege. The founding of the Girl Scouts started a revolutionary \nmovement to empower girls. Now, Girl Scouts is working to bring gender \nbalance to leadership roles, whether it is creating jobs in the private \nsector or representing constituents in public office. I believe in that \nmission, and I know it can be achieved.\n  What I love about the Girl Scouts is that it is always reinventing \nitself and looking to the future. Whether it is new uniforms or new \nbadges, the Girl Scouts are engaging in a new generation of leadership. \nTheir core programs focused on environmental stewardship, healthy \nliving, financial literacy, and global citizenship help girls develop a \nsolid and well-rounded foundation in leadership. Their award-winning \nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics--STEM--Program helps \ngirls build strong, hands-on foundations to become future leaders and \nmeet the growing need for skilled science and technology professionals \nin the United States. And last year, the Girl Scouts joined the STEM \nmentoring initiative, Million Women Mentors, a national initiative to \nincrease interest for girls and women to pursue STEM career paths. This \nprogram would help close the gender gap in the field and gives girls \nthe confidence and the ability to believe that they too can be those \nfemale scientists, engineers, and doctors who are serving as mentors \nfor the program.\n  I have taken the lessons I learned from the Girl Scouts with me to \nthe U.S. Senate every day and in every way. These lessons include: \nLet's help people at all times. Let's be honest and fair. Let's be \nfriendly and helpful. Let's be considerate and caring, courageous and \nstrong and responsible. Let's respect ourselves and others, respect \nauthority, use resources wisely, make the world a better place, and be \na sister to every Girl Scout whether she is here or around the world. \nFor all of these reasons and more, I am honored to recognize the 103rd \nanniversary of the Girl Scouts of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1493-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1493-S1494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING GIRL SCOUTS OF THE USA\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I wish to honor Girl Scouts of the \nUSA. As the proud father of two Girl Scouts, I join them as they \ncelebrate Girl Scout Day. On this day in 1912, Juliette Gordon Low \nfounded the first Girl Scout troop with just 18 girls in Savannah, GA. \nOver 100 years later, Girl Scouts serves 2 million girls and has 59 \nmillion alumnae across the United States.\n  Juliette Gordon Low believed that all girls should be given the \nopportunity to develop physically, mentally, and spiritually. Gordon \nsought to bring girls out of isolated home environments and into \ncommunity service in order to become well rounded members of society. \nBy building courage, confidence, and character, Girl Scouts raised \nawareness on important issues. They became leaders and made their way \ninto American hearts.\n  Girl Scouts today participate in numerous activities that foster and \nstrengthen their leadership abilities, financial literacy, outdoor and \nenvironmental awareness, and teach them the value of service. They \nlearn new skills that help them develop their full individual \npotential, and take action to improve the world around them. Girls who \nearn the Gold Award, the highest achievement a Girl Scout can earn,\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\ntake extraordinary steps to effect positive change and make a \nsustainable impact in their communities and beyond.\n  Today's Girl Scouts are tomorrow's leaders. Former Girl Scouts are at \nthe top of their fields in science, media, medicine, business, and \npolitics. With one-half of the women in the 114th Congress being former \nGirl Scouts, it is evident that Girl Scouts builds girls of courage, \nconfidence and character.\n  On this Girl Scout Day, I wish to applaud the work of Girl Scout \ncouncils throughout Michigan and across our country. Their commitment \nto diversity and service, tied with their dedication, makes them true \nleaders of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1494-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a beloved American icon recently \ncelebrated her 90th birthday. For more than one-half century, Phyllis \nSchlafly has been a leading voice in defense of our Constitution, our \nvalues, and our way of life. Fearlessly, tirelessly, Phyllis has \nchampioned the American family and American values. As a speaker, \nauthor, activist, and radio commentator, Phyllis has inspired and \nmobilized generations of conservatives.\n  Her 1964 book, ``A Choice Not an Echo,'' took direct aim at the \nestablishment class and helped pave the way for Goldwater and Reagan. \nHer advocacy presaged many of the political challenges we face today in \nensuring that the voiceless have a voice and that the everyday worker, \nmother, father, and citizen is not drowned out by special interests. As \none profile noted, Phyllis ``continues comforting the afflicted \nconservative, afflicting the comfortable Republican.''\n  I remember well reading ``A Choice Not an Echo'' while in high school \nand her arguments helped shape my political philosophy as it shaped the \nphilosophy of many others. I also remember attending her speech at the \nUniversity of Alabama dealing with the national defense issues she \nwrote about while I was in law school. Dynamic, smart, beautiful, and \narticulate, she played an important role in establishing a sound \nconservative philosophy.\n  An unrelenting critic of big government, Phyllis has spoken out time \nand again on the need for the family--not the bureaucracy--to form the \ncenter of American life. She has explained that we cannot strengthen \nour financial system without also strengthening our families and our \ncommunities. She knows that no nation can be better than the people who \nmake it up and that families, communities, and churches are vital to \ndeveloping good people.\n  The values Phyllis embodies are not merely traditional but enduring--\njust as she is. Enduring values are a national compass, a guide for all \ntimes--always pointing true north in even the stormiest weather.\n  Congratulations to Phyllis on her remarkable 90th year and her even \nmore remarkable life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1494-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING THE LEARNING TRAIN\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, American small businesses across \nthe country possess the ability to recognize and fill unique service \ngaps in their local towns and cities. This is especially important when \nthese small businesses work with the children in our communities. Such \nis the case with this week's Small Business of the Week, The Learning \nTrain, located in Lafayette, LA.\n  Keri and Matt Hebert opened The Learning Train as a way to promote \nthe physical, emotional, educational, and social development of \nchildren aged 6 months to 4 years old through a variety of weekly \nclasses and camps. A mother of two, Mrs. Hebert designed The Learning \nTrain to offer small group classes that promote learning and bonding \nbetween parents and their children. A typical 45-minute session at the \ncenter provides children and their parents with a safe, fun space to \nhone age-appropriate developmental skills through enjoyable playtime \nwith peers. The center's structured learning activities aid in \ndeveloping crucial skills, including symbolic thinking, active \nlistening, problem solving, and knowledge retention.\n  In addition to the sharpening of technical skills, children are \nafforded quality time strengthening and developing healthy social \nbonds, as well. Having spent thirteen years as an educator, Mrs. Hebert \nnoticed a growing need for a safe, fun environment for young children \nto be nurtured. She maintains that a child's time spent playing with \ntheir guardian reinforces social development and builds trust between \nthe two. The Learning Center's diverse classes provide ample space, \nopportunity, and variety to reinforce bonds between a child's parents \nas well as with their peers. Since its establishment in 2013, the \nLearning Train also regularly partners with local organizations to give \nback to their community, including participating in food drives.\n  I am honored to recognize a business that provides the high quality \ncare and attention that our future generations deserve. Congratulations \nagain to The Learning Train for being selected as Small Business of the \nWeek, and I thank them for the important work they do for the families \nand children in the Lafayette region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/12/senate-section/article/S1494-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 4:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the \nSpeaker pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry) has signed the following enrolled \nbill:\n\n       H.R. 1213.

    \n\n[Pages S1496-S1497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 724. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide \nenhanced penalties for marketing candy-flavored controlled substances \nto minors; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley \nin re-introducing the Protecting Kids from Candy-Flavored Drugs Act of \n2015, formerly known as the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act.\n  For years, law enforcement has seen drug dealers flavor and market \ntheir illegal drugs to entice minors, using techniques like combining \ndrugs with chocolate and fruit flavors, and even packaging them to look \nlike actual candy and soda. This bill would address this serious and \ndangerous problem by providing stronger penalties when drug dealers \nalter controlled substances by combining them with beverages or candy \nproducts, marketing or packaging them to resemble legitimate products, \nor flavoring or coloring them, all with the intent to sell the drugs to \nminors.\n  Recent reports by law enforcement and by the media demonstrate the \nneed for this legislation. Last year, a captain in the Drugs and Vice \nDivision of an Oregon police department told my office that he \n``routinely encounter[s]'' ecstasy; it is ``often found packaged with \ncartoon characters on the labeling[,] shaped in pacifier form[,] or \nwith the outline of various animals stamped [on the] drug when in pill \nform.'' He continued that `` `[c]andy' bracelets of MDMA [ecstasy] are \nalso common. Various unique colors of pills are also frequently \nencountered with the clear intent to market and make the drug appealing \nto the young.''\n  Also last year, a narcotics team member in an Oregon sheriff's office \ntold my office that he frequently encounters gummy bears laced with \nXanex. The ``only customers are juveniles,'' according to the officer. \nHe noted that if a youth gets hooked, he will become a regular \ncustomer.\n  Law enforcement has made several notable busts of large productions \nof candied or flavored drugs. In January 2013, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration seized THC-laden soft drinks, cookies, brownies, and \ncandy from two phony medical marijuana dispensaries in my home state of \nCalifornia. These dispensaries grossed an estimated $3.5 million \nannually. The names of the products seized show how the purveyors of \nthese drugs marketed them under names that resembled popular soda and \ncandy products: bottles were labeled ``7 High,'' ``Dr. Feelgood,'' and \n``Laughing Lemonade''; cookies and brownies had such names as ``White \nChip Hash Brownie'' and ``Reese's Crumbled Hash Brownie; and candy was \nnamed ``Jolly Stones THC Medicated Hard Candies'' and ``Stone Candy.''\n  Around Halloween 2013, police seized more than 40 pounds of THC-laced \ncandy from a campus apartment at West Chester University, outside of \nPhiladelphia. This candy was vividly colored, in a virtual rainbow \nassortment--pink, yellow, orange, blue, and red. When college students \nare peddling these drugs, it is not hard to see how minors can become \ntargets of the operation.\n  Many recent incidents involve methamphetamine, a drug whose users \nface a ``very high'' risk of ``developing psychotic symptoms--\nhallucinations and delusions,'' according to a recent Harvard Medical \nSchool publication. A 2007 article in USA Today entitled ``DEA: \nFlavored meth use on the rise'' stated that ``[r]eports of candy-\nflavored methamphetamine are emerging around the nation, stirring \nconcern among police and abuse prevention experts that drug dealers are \nmarketing the drug to younger people.'' In March of 2012, police in \nChicago warned parents about a drug that ``looks and smells like \ncandy,'' called ``strawberry quick'' or ``strawberry meth.'' Because of \nthe drug's similarity to candy, police urged parents to tell their \nchildren not to take candy from anyone, not even a classmate.\n  Regrettably, this is a problem that has persisted for many years, \nwith drug dealers trying various methods to lure kids to try many \ndangerous drugs. The dealers' logic is simple: the best way to create a \nlife-long customer is to hook that person when he or she is young. \nAccording to an Indiana sheriff quoted in a 2007 article entitled \n``Fruity meth aimed at kids,'' flavoring a drug like methamphetamine \nmakes it ``more attractive to teens, because it takes away meth's \nnormally bitter taste, and some dealers will tell potential users this \nmeth is safer, and has less side effects.''\n  That is why the practice of flavoring or coloring drugs to entice \nyouth is so dangerous. It deceives the young customer into believing \nthat he or she is not actually ingesting drugs, or at least not \ningesting drugs that are as potent as non-flavored drugs. One in three \nteens already believes there is ``only a slight or no risk in trying \n[methamphetamine],'' according to the 2007 National Meth Use & \nAttitudes Survey. When you flavor methamphetamine or market it as candy \nor soda, the number of teens who believe that the drug is not harmful \nis surely higher.\n  The size and sophistication of some of these operations is \nparticularly alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale \nmarijuana cultivation and production facilities in Emeryville and \nOakland, CA. Thousands of marijuana plants, and hundreds of marijuana-\nrelated soda, candy, and other products were seized from the drug \ndealers' facilities. The products were designed and packaged to look \nlike legitimate products, including an item called ``Munchy Way'' candy \nbars.\n  Similarly, in March of 2008, Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, \nagents seized cocaine near Modesto, CA, that was valued at $272,400; a \nsignificant quantity had been flavored like cinnamon, coconut, lemon, \nor strawberry. After that raid, one DEA agent stated that \n``[a]ttempting to lure new, younger customers to a dangerous drug by \nadding candy `flavors' is an unconscionable marketing technique.''\n  I completely agree. That is why we need to act now to stop those who \nalter\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\ndrugs to make them more appealing to youth.\n  Under current Federal law, there is no enhanced penalty for a person \nwho alters a controlled substance to make the drug more appealing to \nyouth. Someone who alters a controlled substance in ways prohibited by \nthe legislation we are introducing today would be subject to an \nadditional penalty of up to 10 years, in addition to the penalty for \nthe underlying offense. If someone is convicted of a second offense \nthat is prohibited by the act, that person would face an additional \npenalty of up to 20 years. Furthermore, a prosecutor who does not \ncharge the separate crime of candying or flavoring a drug may still \nseek an enhancement at sentencing, under this bill.\n  This bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you \nflavor or candy up your drugs to try to entice our children, there will \nbe a very heavy price to pay. It will help stop drug dealers from \nengaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if they \ndon't.\n  I am pleased that many of the leading national law enforcement and \nanti-drug organizations support this bill: the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National District Attorneys Association, the Community \nAnti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, and the National High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, \nHIDTA, Directors' Association have all endorsed this legislation. The \nindividuals that these organizations represent are on the front lines \nworking to keep these drugs out of our communities.\n  The Senate passed a similar version of this legislation by unanimous \nconsent in the 111th Congress, but it was not considered in the House. \nThe time is now for Congress to finish this work, and enact this bill \ninto law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Franken, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Ms. Warren, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Schatz, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 729.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) section 1591 of title 18, United States Code, defines a \n     sex trafficker as a person who ``knowingly. . .recruits, \n     entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, or maintains \n     by any means a person . . . knowing, or in reckless disregard \n     of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, \n     coercion . . . or any combination of such means will be used \n     to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or \n     that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will \n     be caused to engage in a commercial sex act'';\n       (2) while use of the word ``obtains'' in section 1591, \n     United States Code, has been interpreted, prior to the date \n     of enactment of this Act, to encompass those who purchase \n     illicit sexual acts from trafficking victims, some confusion \n     persists;\n       (3) in United States vs. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066 (8th Cir. \n     2013), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth \n     Circuit ruled that section 1591 of title 18, United States \n     Code, applied to persons who purchase illicit sexual acts \n     with trafficking victims after the United States District \n     Court for the District of South Dakota erroneously granted \n     motions to acquit these buyers in two separate cases; and\n       (4) section 108 of this title amends section 1591 of title \n     18, United States Code, to add the words ``solicits or \n     patronizes'' to the sex trafficking statute making absolutely \n     clear for judges, juries, prosecutors, and law enforcement \n     officials that criminals who purchase sexual acts from human \n     trafficking victims may be arrested, prosecuted, and \n     convicted as sex trafficking offenders when this is merited \n     by the facts of a particular case.\n\n     SEC. 110.

MONITORING ALL HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AS VIOLENT \n                   CRIMINALS.\n\n       Section 3156(a)(4)(C) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``77,'' after ``chapter''.\n\n     SEC. 113.
