Madam President, in the coming days and weeks, we as a \nCongress face a series of real and important deadlines. First, we must \naddress the debt ceiling. Last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew let \nthe American people know that in 2 weeks--November 3--the United States \nfaces the threat of being unable to pay its bills. Unless we act, the \nFederal Government will default on its accrued debt--default on its \naccrued debt. A huge percentage of this debt is the result of unpaid \ntax cuts for the wealthy and two unpaid wars during the last Bush \nPresidential administration. If we allow the United States to default \non this debt, the consequences to world markets would be catastrophic, \nbut that is not all. It is not all this leadership has ignored.\n  Congress must reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which has basically \ngone out of business, causing the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs \nin the United States and hurting our economy in more ways than one. It \nis also important that we pass a long-term surface transportation bill \nand again avert another potential Republican shutdown of our government \nby December 11.\n  Yet as the Senate reconvenes today, we are considering none of those \nvitally important matters. Instead--just as he did as the shutdown \nloomed last month--the Republican leader is spending the Senate's time \non a partisan, ideological bill to placate the radicals within his own \nparty.\n  The senior Senator from Louisiana is the architect of this bill \nbefore the Senate, which targets the so-called sanctuary cities. \nSenator Vitter's legislation fails to match the family values rhetoric \nhe so frequently touts. This vile legislation might as well be called \n``The Donald Trump Act.'' Similar to the disgusting and outrageous \nlanguage championed by Donald Trump, this legislation paints all \nimmigrants as criminals and rapists. At\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nits core, Senator Vitter's bill undermines the ability of local law \nenforcement officials to police their own communities and ensure public \nsafety. It is then no surprise that the Fraternal Order of Police and \nMajor Cities Chiefs Police Association do not support the Vitter \nsanctuary cities legislation, and that is an understatement. If \nimplemented, this bill would punish local jurisdictions by withholding \nFederal community grants that police departments use to enhance public \nsafety and build community trust. Imagine that, holding hostage public \nsafety funding for police as a result of this misguided, farfetched \nlegislation that everyone knows will not pass.\n  Senator Vitter's legislation would also withhold community \ndevelopment block grants that ensure affordable housing and provides \nservices to the most vulnerable in our communities. The Donald Trump \nAct would establish new mandatory minimum sentences for those who enter \nthe country illegally. Initial estimates show that new mandatory \nminimums in this bill would result in the need for nearly 20,000 new \nprison beds--20,000--requiring the construction of 12 or more huge new \nFederal prisons, costing billions and billions in taxpayer dollars.\n  It seems Republicans don't care about the cost to public safety. They \ndon't care about the cost of building new prisons. A few billion here, \na few billion there of taxpayer dollars, that is OK. After all, \nRepublicans are not proposing this bill to solve any problem within our \nimmigration system; this Donald Trump Act was designed to demonize \nimmigrants and spread the myth that they are criminals and threats to \nthe public. It promotes discrimination and bias.\n  Decades--decades--of research demonstrate that immigrants are less \nlikely to commit serious crimes or be jailed than native-born \nindividuals, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower \nrates of violent crime, not higher. So the notion that The Donald Trump \nAct is necessary to protect Americans from violent criminals is \npreposterous.\n  Violent gun murders are a tragedy our Nation faces far too often. \nEvery year--and it is getting worse, not better--32,000 people are \nkilled by guns in this country. That is how many were killed last year. \nThat is how many are going to be killed this year, but the number is \ngoing up. More Americans have been killed by guns since 1968 than in \nall the wars of our Nation's history--all the wars in our Nation's \nhistory. Republicans should direct their energy toward saving the lives \nof thousands through safer, smarter gun safety legislation instead of \ncapitalizing on hateful political rhetoric to advance their radical \nagenda, even though almost 90 percent of the American public think \nthere should be a background check for someone who is a criminal or has \nmental problems, even though over 50 percent of members of the National \nRifle Association believe there should be background checks--but not \ncongressional Republicans. No; they know better than 90 percent of the \nAmerican people.\n  Democrats believe local communities and local law enforcement are \nbetter judges of what will keep their communities safe than Donald \nTrump or Bill O'Reilly. The safety of our neighborhoods and local \ncommunities should not be a pawn for Republicans' latest gambit to hide \ntheir failure to act on comprehensive immigration reform. Local law \nenforcement officials, domestic violence groups, immigrants' rights \ngroups, mayors, faith leaders, and labor groups all oppose The Donald \nTrump Act. This bill does nothing to keep Americans safe, and it \ncertainly does nothing to address our broken immigration system.\n  America is and always has been a nation of immigrants, and we are all \nthe better for having hard-working immigrants as contributing members \nof our communities. This Nation deserves a commonsense immigration \nprocess that works, one that is tough on lawbreakers, fair to \ntaxpayers, and practical to implement, but instead of joining Democrats \nin passing comprehensive immigration reform that unites families, \nstrengthens communities, and boosts our economy, Republicans remain \ncommitted to their only approach to immigration policy: mass \ndeportation. We all know this extreme rightwing approach would hurt our \ncountry and simply cannot work. The Donald Trump Act would shatter the \ntrust between law enforcement and communities that keep our Nation \nsafe. Republicans should abandon this shameless attempt to appease the \nbase elements of their party. They should work with Democrats to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform, which is years overdue.\n  Sadly, though, until Republicans get serious about immigration \nreform, the Republican leader shouldn't waste the Senate's time on \nlegislation that he knows will not pass. This legislation is not going \nto pass. He knows it. We all know it. Instead, he is just treading \nwater, waiting for time to go by. The Republican leader should focus \nthe Senate's time and all of our efforts on the pressing matters we \nface--such as avoiding a catastrophic default and keeping our \ngovernment open so we can do the people's business.\n  Madam President, would the Chair announce the business before the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/19/senate-section/article/S7290-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n               Tragedy of the Lost Cargo Ship ``El Faro''\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, on September 29, an almost 800-foot cargo \ncontainer vessel, the El Faro, a cargo ship carrying 33 men and women \nfrom Florida, left port in Jacksonville, FL, bound for Puerto Rico. \nThere is a regular trade route between San Juan and Jacksonville, and a \nlot of the goods the Puerto Rican Commonwealth receives are shipped by \ncargo container from the Port of Jacksonville.\n  Three hours before it left port, the tropical storm that had been \nbrewing had changed its status from a tropical storm to a hurricane, \nand over the course of the next 2 days, with communications from the \nship, that hurricane started to intensify, starting out as a category \n1, category 2, and later a category 3.\n  On the morning of the third day, October 1, at 7 a.m., there was a \ncommunication from the captain of the ship, first left on a voice mail \nand then he immediately called back the person in the communications \ndepartment of the shipping company who talked to the captain. The \ncaptain, in a very calm voice on both the telephone message voice mail \nand his communication with the person, said they had taken a position \nwhere the ship was leaning 15 degrees. They were in rough seas, and \nthey had lost power. Apparently in that communication, his voice was \nvery calm and had some degree of confidence that he was going to be \nable to get the ship back underway, under power.\n  It is not good to have a ship that is tilting 15 degrees in the \nmiddle of a storm, much less an oncoming hurricane, and with no power \nbecause that does not allow you to keep it directly into the waves or \ngoing away from the waves. Instead, the ship is going to turn \nbroadside, with the full force of the waves hitting the side of the \nship, and the ship was already listing 15 degrees to one side.\n  Well, that was the last communication. The hurricane had turned in a\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nsouthwesterly direction, and eventually, according to the forecast, it \nfinally made that turn to the right to start taking it north, and as a \nresult it did not hit the continental east coast of the United States. \nIt was out to the east of the Bahama Islands.\n  The hurricane was still in the vicinity, so it was another 2 days \nbefore the hurricane subsided enough that the U.S. Coast Guard could \nget in there, supplemented by the U.S. Navy, to start looking for \nsurvivors.\n  Let me say something about the Coast Guard. We have the Coast Guard \nin our jurisdiction in the Commerce Committee. It is an extremely \nprofessional military operation. I spent time this past summer with the \nCoast Guard up in Alaska. They are so good at what they do that the \nU.S. Navy can take its resources and use them elsewhere on the Alaska \ncoast, which includes the Bering Sea and the Bering Strait, which we \nshare with Russia, and the Coast Guard does an extraordinary job. Of \ncourse, throughout the Caribbean and all around my State of Florida, \nthe Coast Guard stands tall. They rescue folks.\n  It took them some time before they could get their C-130s flying in--\nand some of those may well have been Air Force. Until the Coast Guard \ncould get their C-130s and H-60 helicopters with the swimmers who \npropel down from the helicopter to rescue survivors--it took them that \nlong, and they started seeing debris.\n  I have seen a picture of the lifeboat. It is an old lifeboat, an open \nlifeboat. If you saw the movie ``Captain Phillips,'' Captain Phillips \nand the people who had taken over the ship went in that covered orange \nlifeboat. They propelled it off the back of the ship, and it dove into \nthe water. These were just plain lifeboats. They found a life preserver \nfloating. Indeed, they found a life preserver suit, which is a body \nsuit that inflates when in the water. When the helicopter finally got \nthere and checked it, they found no survivor in it. They saw remains. \nThey were still actively searching for any survivors. In this \nparticular case, when the swimmer went into the water, there were only \nremains left in the body suit, partially decomposed and so forth. This \nSenator cannot say enough about the Coast Guard.\n  Those who were on that ship were from the State of Florida. Maritime \nwork is a part of our culture, and we know the extreme importance of \nthese jobs and the very real risk mariners face in their tough jobs. \nThey are taken away from home for weeks and months to do hard work. \nWithout our maritime efforts, we could not survive. That is where the \nbiggest part of our shipping from other places is, on the sea, and our \nmariners provide this critical service. They move products and cargo \nthat drive our economy. Look at the economic engines of the seaports.\n  This has been a tremendous loss for us--not the loss of the cargo, \nwhich was certainly an economic loss, but the loss of 33 lives. It is \nespecially a loss for the families and friends who knew and loved the \ncrew of the El Faro. We share their grief.\n  The loss of this ship raised many questions, so over the recess I \nwent to Jacksonville. I went to the port. I talked to the National \nTransportation Safety Board. I talked to the Coast Guard. They have \nopened an investigation. I am giving these remarks to the Senate at \nthis time because tomorrow we expect a preliminary report from the \nNational Transportation Safety Board.\n\n  In dock is the sister ship, the El Yunque. One ship would be in one \nport and the other ship in the other port, and they would cross. In \nfact, those two ships crossed in the Caribbean within sight of each \nother before the El Faro, heading southeast, got into trouble. So I \nwanted to go there because it is our Commerce Committee that has the \njob of seeing that these agencies are doing as thorough a job as \npossible.\n  We expectantly await that report. I know we want all of the answers \nright now. It is important that a thorough examination is conducted to \nfind out exactly what happened. For the families and friends of those \nlost on the El Faro, and for the safety of all mariners, we are going \nto make sure that we get the answers.\n  What would I speculate? Well, I certainly do not have the expertise \nin the sea. But if you get a call and the captain's voice is calm, and \nhe says that we are listing 15 degrees, then there has been some breach \nof the ship. Likely, there is water inside of the ship. If in that same \nphone call that you get he is saying that we have lost power, then we \nknow that there is the making of a disaster. Why didn't the captain and \nthe crew know that the hurricane had become a hurricane that was \nannounced by the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane \nCenter 3 hours before they left the Port of Jacksonville? What caused \nthe captain to think he could sail, and sail in the direction of an \noncoming hurricane, and that he would not get into its effects? Why did \nthe engines cut off so that he lost power? All of these things we don't \nknow, but we expectantly look forward to getting some answers maybe in \nthis preliminary report tomorrow.\n  So, in honor of those lost on board the El Faro, I would simply \nconclude my remarks by asking for a moment of silence.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I can still remember the day in June a few \nyears ago, June 27, 2013--2\\1/2\\ years ago. The Senate gathered and \nvoted on comprehensive immigration reform. The vote was 68 to 22. The \nbill meant a lot to many of us. Eight of us--four Democrats and four \nRepublicans--had literally worked for months trying to craft a bill to \naddress the massive immigration system in America, a system that is \nterribly broken.\n  I think it surprised a lot of people, but we did it. Democrats and \nRepublicans agreeing on something--there is a headliner. Who sat across \nthe table? Not an easy jury to decide any issue when it came to Senate \nbusiness. On our side of the table were Chuck Schumer of New York, \nchair of the Senate immigration subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee \nat that point; myself; Bob Menendez, Hispanic American Senator from the \nState of New Jersey; and Michael Bennet of Colorado--four of us.\n  On the opposite side of the table, John McCain led the effort on the \nRepublican side, along with Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had a \nbackground in law enforcement in the military and is currently running \nfor President. Next to him, Marco Rubio from the State of Florida, \nCuban American, came to this undertaking. He, too, is running for \nPresident of the United States; and Jeff Flake of Arizona, a \nconservative Republican.\n\n  We worked for months. We went through every provision and came to a \nbipartisan agreement to move the bill forward. We passed it 68 to 22. I \nthink it would have been a dramatic improvement over the current laws \nor lack of laws in America.\n  The House of Representatives refused to call it up, wouldn't even \nbring the matter before its committees, and never had a debate on any \nimmigration issue in the 2\\1/2\\ years since. They missed an \nopportunity, an opportunity to do something important and a rare \nopportunity where Democrats and Republicans happened to agree on a \nsolution. That is hard to come by in this place.\n  This bill would have strengthened border security, cracked down on \nillegal immigration, protected American workers, and established a \ntough but fair path for 11 million undocumented immigrants in this \ncountry who are currently living here, and it gave them a path to legal \nstatus. They would pay their taxes, pay their fines, go through a \ncriminal background check, and then they would be eligible--not before \nthen.\n  Democrats were in the majority of the Senate at that moment. We \nreached across the aisle to work with Republicans, so the bill was \ntruly bipartisan. Well, it is a shame that the Republican-controlled \nHouse of Representatives would not even consider the bill. We asked \nthem: Just call the bill. If it is going to be defeated, call it.\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\n  No, we are not going to consider any immigration reform--and they \nhave not.\n  We are in a new Senate now, a new Senate under control of the other \nparty, and what has been the approach to immigration? Unfortunately, \nlittle time has been spent trying to find common ground. First, some \nSenate Republicans threatened to shut down the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This is the Department that not only has us take our shoes \noff at the airport, they are literally trying to protect us from \nanother act of terrorism in the United States. For months, the Senate \nRepublicans refused to pass an appropriations bill to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security until the Democrats would accept anti-\nimmigrant amendments. After we repeatedly rejected this approach, they \nfinally relented and passed a clean appropriations bill for this \nimportant Department for America's security.\n  Now here we go again. Some Senate Republicans have brought partisan \nlegislation to the floor--and understand this--to defund, remove the \nfunding from law enforcement efforts in this country. I don't know what \nis happening in many places, but I do know what is happening in the \nMidwest. We have seen violent crime, gun-related crime, go up \ndramatically, a 20-percent increase in gun-related deaths this year in \nChicago over the previous year. In the city of Milwaukee, there is a \n100-percent increase in gun-related crime this year.\n  So why would we even consider a bill that is before us on the floor \nof the Senate, offered by the Senator from Louisiana, to reduce funding \nfor law enforcement and police departments? Senator Vitter has offered \na bill that would block important police, disaster relief, and other \nfunding from communities that do not share immigration information with \nthe Federal Government or don't hold a detainee at the behest of \nFederal immigration authorities. My Republican colleagues know this \nbill has no chance to become law. They have made no effort to engage \nthe Democrats in a bipartisan conversation. It may pass the Senate--but \nI doubt it--and if it does, the President would veto it. This is done \nfor reasons other than passing a bill and creating a new law.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim they were \nresponding to the tragic--and, yes, it was tragic--death of Kate \nSteinle, a young woman who was allegedly shot and killed by Francisco \nSanchez, an undocumented immigrant with a long criminal history. Mr. \nSanchez had several drug convictions. He illegally reentered the United \nStates several times after he was deported. Earlier this year, he \nfinished his third prison sentence for illegal reentry.\n  The Bureau of Prisons should have turned Mr. Sanchez over to the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Department to be deported, but \ninstead they sent him to San Francisco to face a 20-year-old marijuana \ncharge. Not surprisingly, local authorities decided not to prosecute \nthis old charge, so sadly, unfortunately, tragically he was released. \nThis never ever should have happened. Federal and local authorities \nmust do a better job of communicating and coordinating so undocumented \nimmigrants with serious criminal records are detained and deported, \nperiod.\n  The bill before us doesn't solve the problem which I have just \ndescribed. It wouldn't have prevented the tragic death of this young \nwoman. In fact, this legislation would actually make us less safe by \nthreatening communities with the loss of millions of dollars in \ncritical Federal funding for local law enforcement, as well as \ndiscouraging immigrants from cooperating with local police.\n  The Chicago Tribune--not known as any liberal publication--published \nan editorial opposing the bill that is coming before us. They said: \n``Threatening to take money away from local police is a sound bite, not \na solution.''\n  Republican Congressman Bob Dold, from my home State of Illinois, was \none of five Republicans who voted against the House version of the \nbill. He said: ``Cutting funding for local law enforcement would not \nhave prevented this horrible crime.''\n  What would the consequences be of passing the Vitter bill that is \npending before the Senate? At risk are tens of millions of dollars in \nfunding from several programs. The State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram, also known as SCAAP, helps cover the costs for States and \nlocalities to detain undocumented immigrants with serious criminal \nrecords; the Community Oriented Policing Services Grant Program--which \nwe all know about from serving in the Senate because our local police \ndepartments benefit from COPS funding; and the community development \nblock grants provide critical funding for local communities for \ndisaster relief and other priorities.\n  I wish to give some examples from Illinois of the impact of the \nVitter bill. In fiscal year 2014, Cook County--our largest county--\nreceived $1,381,552 in SCAAP funding, and in fiscal year 2015, Chicago \nreceived $72,477,673 in CDBG funding, and $3,125,000 in funding through \nthe COPS Hiring Program to address gun violence.\n  The Fraternal Order of Police sent a letter opposing the Vitter \nbill--which is before the Senate--on behalf of its 330,000 police \nmembers who belong to that fraternity. This is what it said: ``It is \nwrong and a gross unfairness to punish these brave men and women, or \nthe citizens they serve, because Congress disagrees with their \nenforcement priorities with respect to our nation's immigration laws.''\n  This bill is supposedly an effort to punish so-called sanctuary \ncities--including some in my own home State--that have policies \nlimiting dealings between Federal immigration authorities and local law \nenforcement, but the goal of these policies is to promote effective \ncommunity policing by encouraging immigrant communities to trust local \npolice. Many of these policies were established in response to Secure \nCommunities, a program created by the Bush administration and a program \nwhich badly damaged the relationship between immigrant communities and \nlocal law enforcement around the country.\n  My State police signed a memorandum of agreement with immigration \nauthorities to participate in Secure Communities. The agreement said \nthe goal of the program was to ``identify, detain, and remove from the \nUnited States aliens who have been convicted of serious criminal \noffenses.''\n  However, it turned out more than 30 percent of those deported from \nIllinois in the program had no criminal record. Less than 20 percent \nhad been convicted of a serious crime. Illinois law enforcement \nofficials say the program eroded trust in law enforcement in the \nHispanic community. Their conclusion is backed up by polling data. A \n2013 University of Illinois study found that 44 percent of Latinos \nreport being less likely to contact the police if they are a victim of \ncrime out of fear that police will inquire about their immigration \nstatus or people they know.\n  The Vitter bill makes this problem even worse by forcing local law \nenforcement to become enforcers of immigration laws. I received a \nletter opposing the Vitter bill from the Law Enforcement Immigration \nTask Force, a group of more than 30 law enforcement officials, \nincluding Republican Lake County Sheriff Mark Curran, a local law \nenforcement official from my home State whom I have worked with in the \npast. These officials are very concerned that this bill will make our \ncommunities less safe by discouraging immigrants from cooperating with \nlaw enforcement.\n  This is what the local law enforcement in Illinois said:\n\n       When state and local law enforcement agencies are required \n     to enforce federal immigration laws, undocumented residents \n     may fear that they, or people they know or depend upon, risk \n     deportation by working with law enforcement. This fear \n     undermines trust between law enforcement and the communities \n     we serve, creating too much room for dangerous criminals and \n     violent crime.\n\n  The Vitter bill also dramatically increases penalties for illegal \nentry, including two new mandatory minimum criminal sentences. \nEstimates are that these new penalties created by the Vitter bill would \nrequire approximately 18,600 new prison beds and up to 12 new Federal \nprisons. New Federal prisons cost several hundred million dollars to \nconstruct, tens of millions of dollars to operate. In sum, these new \nmandatory minimums will cost taxpayers billions of dollars. There is no \nsuggestion in this bill of how we would pay for that.\n  The real solution to this problem is smart and targeted immigration \nenforcement that encourages cooperation\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nwith local law enforcement. The Homeland Security Department only has \nenough funding to deport a small fraction of the undocumented \nimmigrants in our country. President Obama has wisely said we should \nfocus on those who could do us harm. In fact, 85 percent of those \ndeported from the interior of our country in fiscal year 2014 had a \ncriminal conviction--and they should have been deported--compared to \nonly 38 percent in 2008 under the previous President. This President's \npolicies has focused our limited resources on deporting dangerous \npeople, deporting felons, not families; criminals, not children.\n  As part of the effort to target immigration enforcement, Secretary of \nHomeland Security Jeh Johnson has established the Priority Enforcement \nProgram, also known as PEP, to replace security communities. PEP is \ndesigned to protect our safety while improving trust between local \npolice and communities they serve. The program enables DHS to work with \nState and local law enforcement to take custody of individuals who pose \na danger to public safety before they are released. PEP has only been \noperational for a short time. We need to give it a chance to work \nbefore we rush in to pass this legislation which could only make the \nproblem worse.\n  The best way to fix our broken immigration system, incidentally, and \nmake our communities safer is to pass comprehensive immigration reform \nonce and for all. The bill the Senate passed in 2013 would have made \nunprecedented investments in border security, would have cracked down \non employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and ramped up interior \nenforcement of immigration laws.\n  The bill would have invested $46 billion in new resources in border \nsecurity, including no fewer than 38,405 U.S. Border Patrol agents \nalong the southern border, enhanced penalties for increased immigration \nviolations with sentences of up to 20 years for those with criminal \nhistories, and increased penalties for passport and immigration \ndocument trafficking and fraud.\n  Most important, this bill would bring millions of people out of the \nshadows and require them to prove their identity, pass a criminal \nbackground check, and pay all fines and taxes. This would allow \nimmigration enforcement to focus on the people who are truly a public \nsafety threat.\n  So instead of this Senate taking up a bipartisan bill for true \nimmigration reform, we have this bill, a bill not likely to go much \nfurther than this procedural motion which we will face tomorrow.\n  This bill on the floor would not have prevented Kate Steinle's tragic \ndeath. Here is the reality: The vast majority of immigrants are hard-\nworking, law-abiding individuals with strong family values. I work with \nthem, I know them, I trust them, and I believe they have an important \nrole to play when it comes to this country's future.\n  Many studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit \nserious crimes than native-born individuals. This bill unfortunately \nfocuses on the violent acts of the few to scapegoat an entire \ncommunity. This is dangerous and irresponsible. This bill continues \ndown a dangerous path by promoting the myths that immigrants pose a \nthreat to our Nation's safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Recognizing Hospice of the Western Reserve\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, both of my parents spent their final days \nin hospice care. My father passed away a decade and a half ago at the \nage of 89. My mother was in hospice care for a few weeks--seemed to be \nlong weeks, but a few weeks--and died at 88 6\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  I saw firsthand how home care workers and hospice workers make a \ndifference in someone's final days and the comfort they bring to \nfamilies. During the last moments of my mom's life, people who didn't \neven know her showed incredible care and kindness, and helped to bring \npeace to her, comfort to her, and to our family.\n  Last week I visited in my home city of Cleveland. Only a few miles \naway is the hospice Western Reserve, one of the best not-for-profit \nhospices in the entire Midwest. I held a roundtable with a number of \nemployees who have made a career of caring for Ohioans reaching the end \nof their lives.\n  Western Reserve's core values are: compassion, excellence, quality, \nintegrity, service, and stewardship. Each worker there--from social \nworkers to cooks to maintenance workers to nurses--embodies these \ntraits. They work in what some might assume to be a sad environment. \nMany of the patients they care for die in a matter of days or weeks. \nEach day they encounter not only Ohioans who are near the end of life \nbut they spend time with family members who are preparing to grieve for \na loved one.\n\n  Yet Hospice of the Western Reserve is far from being a depressing \nworkplace. The staff is committed to caring for parents and families, \nand they imbue their work--and their patients and their workplace--with \na fascinating joy of serving others.\n  Hospice nursing assistant Audrey Boylan said to me: ``It's an honor \nto be here.'' Laquita Bradford, a dietary server, talked about the \nsense of ``togetherness'' among the staff. She compared it to an \nextended family.\n  Workers spoke about other jobs they had elsewhere and all echoed the \nsame sentiment: ``It's different here'' at the Hospice of the Western \nReserve. As I said, it is one of the best not-for-profit hospices in \nthe Midwest. Their compassion and commitment has a deep impact on their \npatients and their families and, frankly, on me in my visit.\n  One of the social workers, Jennifer Stevens, spoke about how she \nhelps families and patients understand where they are in their journey. \nA volunteer, Roz Fabrotta, a longtime teacher and now a volunteer for \nHospice of the Western Reserve, spoke with passion about her work in \nthe bereavement camp that the hospice runs for 6- to 12-year-olds who \nhave lost loved ones. There is not any real revenue for that \nbereavement camp. That is what not-for-profit hospices often do.\n  Western Reserve's Elisabeth Severance Bereavement Center is funded by \nraising money and is dedicated to helping families through these heart-\nwrenching situations. Its staff, for instance, provided counseling to \nfamilies after the senseless shooting at Chardon High School in \nFebruary of 2012, where several students were killed, and their \npractices were used as a model by counselors after the tragic shooting \nat Sandy Hook.\n  Through all this work, these men and women maintain a positive \natmosphere for each other and for those they serve.\n  Keli Keyes is a nurse at the hospice. Her coworker and pet, Linus the \ntherapy dog, who was with us at our roundtable, is a beautiful golden \nretriever who accompanies her to work each day. All he has to do to \nbring a smile to patients and family members is to snuggle up to them \nor put his nose up to their hands.\n  Western Reserve has more than 3,000 volunteers. I think that tells \nyou all you need to know about this place--that so many Ohioans are \nwilling to take time out of their busy lives to be part of their \ncommunity and to care for their fellow citizens.\n  Alvin Fomby, who used to work at Quicken Loans Arena and used to know \nLeBron James, decided he would rather work at the hospice, where he \ncould make a real difference in preparing food for families and people \nin hospice care.\n  Janet Bildstein, who works at the Hospice of Western Reserve, grew up \nonly a few blocks from there and has spent many years working at the \nhospice.\n  Joe Tyler, who makes things work, reminded me of my father-in-law, \nwho was a maintenance worker at Electric Utility Company in Ashtabula, \nOH, and he could fix anything. He carried a 12-foot wrench around with \nhim at the powerplant and he could fix anything. Joe Tyler reminded me \nof that. He said he works under more pressure, which he loves, to fix \nsomething in a room immediately. If the air-conditioning or the heating \nor the electricity goes out or if something happens to a lamp, he needs \nto take care of these families right away.\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\n  The men and women at this hospice are an inspiration to all of us, \nbut they are not alone.\n\n\n                    Recognizing My Brother's Keeper\n\n  Mr. President, last year President Obama launched the My Brother's \nKeeper challenge to expand opportunities for a group that is far too \noften left behind in this country--African-American boys and young men.\n  The President reached out to cities across the country to find people \ncommitted to ensuring all Americans have access to the opportunities \nthey deserve. One of the cities that rose to the occasion is Dayton, \nOH.\n  I had the privilege last week of visiting one of America's great \ncities--Dayton--with its mayor, Nan Whaley, a young bright mayor. I \nalso visited with Broderick Johnson, who is the chair of the My \nBrother's Keeper Task Force, and works in the White House with the \nPresident. We held a roundtable with policymakers and activists and \ncitizens who had heeded this call to action.\n  Dayton already, with Mayor Whaley and others, has a number of \nsuccessful programs in place: Learn to Earn, City of Learners, and \nseveral mentorship programs. I heard the stories of mentors and their \nmentees, who make a real difference in the lives of so many.\n  I met Belmont High School senior Miles Tidd. Miles grew up with a \nsingle mother and had a tough time early in high school. He wanted to \ndrop out. Miles was matched with mentor Quinn Howard. Quinn wouldn't \nlet Miles drop out. He was the stable figure in Miles' life, who \nclearly loves him and cares about him, and he pushes him to do better. \nMiles is close to graduating. After 3 years of Junior ROTC, he wants to \njoin the Air Force Reserves and to go to the Citadel.\n  I met Miles and Quinn at our roundtable at the Dayton Boys \nPreparatory Academy. Miles said that ``the best way to make yourself \nfeel better is to look outside yourself, and go out of your way to help \nothers.''\n  That seemed to be the theme of these young men, ages 15 to 20, who \nhad been helped by a mentor. Their goal in life is to now turn around \nand help somebody younger than they are.\n  Also at the roundtable was Alexander Worthy, who wore a Dayton ``Live \nWith Honor'' T-shirt, referring to the campaign launched by the Dayton \nCommunity Police Council. The campaign asks Dayton residents to come \ntogether to combat a culture of violence and rethink what it means to \nlive with honor.\n  Alexander learned discipline and work ethic from his mentor, Bishop \nMark McGuire. Bishop McGuire worked with Alexander to help him keep his \nsummer job at their church, and Alexander now participates in the \nchurch's Young Life youth group.\n  We also heard from mentor Terry Purdue. Terry is a Dayton native. He \ngrew up with a lot of good folks around him, a strong father and \nmother, but still made plenty of mistakes. He now serves as a mentor \nand a police officer on Dayton's West Side. He formed a group called \nthe Unit. The Unit holds free work-out classes 3 days a week downtown. \nThousands have joined the Unit for a class, and at each one he asks \nparticipants to volunteer to help the Dayton community. The Unit takes \non a new project each month.\n  At one roundtable the mentors and mentees told their stories. One \nmiddle schooler, James Carr, was, at first, too shy to speak. Finally, \nafter seeing other boys speak up, James raised his hand and talked \nabout how he picks up trash around his school to keep it clean and \nhelps special ed students at school. There is a boy in his class who is \nblind, and he helps him walk to lunch and to the bathroom. James talked \nabout wanting to make good grades and most of all, he said, he just \nwants to ``stay normal.''\n  Think about that. This child wasn't even in high school yet, and for \nhim it is a struggle to stay normal. That is why the work of My \nBrother's Keeper is so important. Mentors can provide a steady \ninfluence in the lives of children for whom living a stable life--one \nthat those of us privileged enough to serve in this body would consider \n``normal''--is a daily struggle.\n  Frederick Douglass said that it is ``easier to build strong children \nthan repair broken men.'' We need a strategy to allow our children to \nreach their full potential, not one that accepts that an entire segment \nof our citizens will grow up with limited options. It means ending \ndisparities in our education system. It means continuing to work to \nreform our criminal justice system. It means working to rebuild the \nbroken relationship between police departments in far too many cities \nand the communities they serve. It means taking steps to address the \nemployment gap that exists between young men of color and other \nAmericans. It means working to end the scourge of gun violence in our \ncommunities. It means providing those in our society who have made \nmistakes a second chance.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support the work My Brother's \nKeeper is doing. We also have one in Columbus. We hope to see more of \nthose in Ohio. It is up to all of us to ensure that all of our \nchildren, regardless of their ZIP code or the color of their skin, have \nthe opportunity to succeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an important \npiece of legislation that I have introduced that would bring an end to \nthe dangerous existence of sanctuary cities--the Stop Sanctuary \nPolicies and Protect Americans Act.\n  The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n1996 included language that specifically prohibits State and local \ngovernments from enacting sanctuary policies. Despite this, cities \ncontinually violate that provision by having sanctuary policies in \nplace. If these cities and localities want to continue to blatantly \ndisregard Federal law, they should no longer receive certain Federal \nfunds.\n  Now, the sanctuary policies that we are talking about fall into two \ncategories: one, ordinances that bar city employees from asking about a \nperson's immigration status under any circumstances; and two, policies \nthat prevent them from reporting a suspected illegal alien to Federal \nimmigration law enforcement authorities. These sanctuary policies and \nsanctuary cities that enact them are dangerous and counterproductive to \nboth law enforcement efforts and reducing illegal immigration.\n  We know there are many instances in which an illegal alien is \nreleased by local authorities and then commits a very serious crime--\nsometimes a murder or a fatal crime. By now we all know of the tragic \nevent that renewed our focus on this issue back in July--the murder of \na 32-year-old woman named Kate Steinle in San Francisco.\n  Kate's suspected murderer was an illegal immigrant who had been \ndeported 5 times previously and was released this past April by local \nlaw enforcement, specifically citing San Francisco's sanctuary city \nlaws, defying a request by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficials to hold him for deportation proceedings. If this illegal \nimmigrant had been held for deportation proceedings instead of being \nset free, Kate Steinle would be alive today--period, end of story.\n  Unfortunately, San Francisco is far from the only city in the country \ncarrying out this dangerous policy, and Kate Steinle is far from being \nthe only victim of a serious crime committed by an illegal immigrant \nunder these sorts of circumstances.\n  On July 24, 2015, Marilyn Pharis was brutally raped, tortured, and \nmurdered in her home in Santa Maria, CA, by an illegal immigrant who \nwas released from custody because the county sheriff does not honor \ndetainment. Again, this is a clear instance that would be stopped but \nfor sanctuary policies.\n  On July 27, 2015, an illegal immigrant was arrested and accused of \nkilling 60-year-old Margaret Kostelnik in Ravenna Road, OH. Before \nmurdering Ms. Kostelnik, the man allegedly attempted to rape a 14-year-\nold girl and shoot a woman in a nearby park. The suspect also was \npreviously in the custody of law enforcement but was released because \nthe Department of Homeland Security refused to issue a detainer and \ntake custody of the suspect--a related problem.\n  On July 30, a 2-year-old girl was brutally beaten by an illegal \nimmigrant in San Luis Obispo County, CA. He was released from local \ncustody despite a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer and \nextensive criminal history.\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\n  Other cases include last year, when a Virginia man who killed a \nCatholic nun in a drunk-driving crash was revealed to be an illegal \nalien who had been previously arrested.\n  An illegal alien committed a shocking execution-style murder of three \ncollege students in the sanctuary city of Newark, NJ, several years \nago. He had been arrested twice before this grizzly crime. In the \naftermath of the murders, the attorney general of New Jersey \neffectively eliminated Newark's sanctuary city policy.\n  Now, according to documents uncovered by a Freedom of Information Act \nrequest by the Center for Immigration Studies, ICE lists at least 340 \ncities defying Federal law, providing safe haven to illegal immigrants, \nincluding my original hometown of New Orleans. These policies, again, \nare a direct infringement of Federal law, and it is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Worse still, these cities are actively releasing criminal illegal \nimmigrants back into our communities instead of working cooperatively \nwith Federal officials to deport them or lock them up. I firmly believe \nit is time to reverse these illegal policies, to bar them once and for \ngood. That is why I have joined on this crucial piece of legislation \nwith Senators Toomey, Grassley, Cruz, Johnson, Cornyn, Sullivan, \nPerdue, Isakson, Rubio, Barrasso, and Thune. We are introducing this \nlegislation and we are getting a vote tomorrow to end the practice of \nsanctuary cities violating existing Federal immigration law.\n\n  This legislation takes a commonsense approach to this problem, and \nthere are three key parts to the bill.\n  First, this bill changes the incentives for cities by creating \npenalties for States, local governments, and law enforcement entities \nthat choose to have these policies in place. These penalties come in \nthe form of the removal of certain streams of Federal funding for \nsanctuary jurisdictions, and the penalties apply to whatever government \nentity is actually making that bad decision.\n  In cases where a law enforcement entity, such as a jail or a police \ndepartment, has a policy or practice that refuses to comply with \nFederal immigration law, it will be prevented from receiving community-\noriented policing services grants or State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram grants. So that entity directly will be penalized; it is making \nthe bad decision. On the other hand, if a State or city council or \nexecutive passes a resolution or implements a policy or practice that \nrefuses to comply with Federal immigration law, then that city or \nentity will no longer be available for community development block \ngrant funds.\n  Again, we penalize the specific entity or public official involved. \nIt is important that Federal funds are withheld from the entity that \nmakes the dangerous decision to allow dangerous illegal immigrants to \nwalk free rather than turning them over to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Second, we have seen the willingness of jurisdictions to comply with \nimmigration detainers decrease in recent years due to litigation \npursued by the ACLU. We know dozens of jurisdictions that want to \ncooperate and were cooperating but became sanctuary cities in reaction \nto these lawsuits. Our legislation deals with this threat head-on and \ngrants local law enforcement the clear authority to always comply with \nICE detainers. However, it is important to note that we have been very \ncareful to protect individual rights and have preserved an individual's \nright to sue for a violation of their civil or constitutional rights. \nBut if the problem was with the detainer, then individuals sue ICE and \nnot the local law enforcement officials.\n  The third and final part of this legislation deals directly with \nthose who continue to cross our border illegally, and it establishes \nKate's Law--appropriately named after Kathryn Steinle, whom I mentioned \nearlier. Kate's Law increases mandatory minimum sentence requirements \nfor people who continue to cross the border illegally. Kate's Law will \nincrease the maximum penalty for illegal reentry from 2 years to 5 \nyears. It also creates a maximum penalty of 10 years for illegal \nimmigrants who have been denied admission, excluded, deported, or \nremoved three or more times and then illegally reenter the country.\n  In order to ensure appropriate treatment of criminal illegal \nimmigrants, Kate's Law creates a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years \nfor any illegal immigrant who illegally reenters the country and has \nbeen convicted of an aggravated felony prior to removal or has been \npreviously convicted twice of illegal reentry. Right now, there are \nnearly 170,000 convicted criminal aliens who have been ordered deported \nbut remain at large in our country. This is a direct result of \nnonenforcement policies and failed leadership.\n  Last year, ICE responded to a request, disclosing that it released \n169 convicted illegals from over 130 ZIP Codes in 2013. At least two of \nthe ZIP Codes mentioned are in Louisiana--Kenner and Baton Rouge--and \ndangerous criminals were released through the South Louisiana Detention \nCenter. This year alone, ICE reported releasing 30,558 unique criminal \nillegal immigrants from their custody. Some of the crimes committed by \nthese criminal aliens include arson, assault, burglary, kidnapping, \nlarceny, robbery, sexual assault, drunk driving, weapons offenses, and \n20 other serious crimes. Why would we ever want to provide safe harbor \nto these people? That is what sanctuary cities are doing.\n  This legislation is supported by a wide range of organizations to \ncrack down on this problem: the Remembrance Project, NumbersUSA, \nFederation for American Immigration Reform, the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association, the International Union of Police Associations, \nAFL-CIO, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National \nSheriffs' Association, America First Latinos, and letters from the \nMcCann, Rosenberg, Ronnebeck, Oliver, and Wilkerson families, all of \nwhom tragically had family members murdered by illegal aliens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    NumbersUSA\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, October 14, 2015.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: As President of NumbersUSA, a non-\n     partisan activist network of more than 3 million citizens, I \n     am writing to express our support for the Stop Sanctuary \n     Policies and Protect Americans Act.\n       Following the murder of Kate Steinle, the American people \n     became acutely aware that while many States and localities \n     blatantly violate Federal law and release criminal aliens \n     onto their streets, the Federal government does absolutely \n     nothing to stop them. Kate's death was far from the first \n     instance of a murder by a criminal alien that could have been \n     prevented, and more lives will be lost until Congress finally \n     acts. We believe that this piece of legislation, S. 2146, is \n     an appropriate and much needed first step.\n       According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), \n     there are currently 340 ``sanctuary jurisdictions'' in the \n     United States. Over a 9-month period last year, these \n     jurisdictions released 9,295 aliens that ICE was seeking to \n     deport. It is unconscionable that Congress would continue to \n     provide taxpayer money to these jurisdictions and subsidize \n     their willful disregard of the law and public safety.\n       The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act first \n     restricts funding from the State Criminal Alien Assistance \n     Program (SCAAP), from Community Oriented Policing Services \n     (COPS), and from Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) \n     for sanctuary jurisdictions. It reallocates those funds to \n     jurisdictions that cooperate with ICE. The bill also requires \n     the Department of Homeland Security (OHS) to publicly post a \n     list of sanctuary jurisdictions online, including the number \n     of ICE detainers ignored by each jurisdiction. These \n     provisions would appropriately punish sanctuary \n     jurisdictions, encourage further compliance with the law, \n     reward those jurisdictions already in compliance, and ensure \n     that the public knows where their local governments stand.\n       Another critical element of this legislation is that it \n     protects local officers while they carry out ICE detainers, \n     clarifying that they are acting as agents of ICE with all of \n     the necessary authority and protection from liability granted \n     to a Federal law enforcement officer. No law enforcement \n     officer should fear retribution for following the law.\n       Finally, this bill increases the maximum penalties for \n     aliens who illegally reenter the country following denial of \n     admission, exclusion, deportation, or removal, and creates a \n     mandatory minimum sentence for those who are convicted of an \n     aggravated felony or two instances of illegal reentry, all of \n     which would help protect the public from criminal aliens.\n       NumbersUSA applauds your leadership on this issue and \n     stands eager to assist you in\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\n     advancing the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans \n     Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Roy Beck,\n     President and Founder, NumbersUSA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federation for American\n\n\n                                           Immigration Reform,\n\n                                                 October 19, 2015.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: I am writing to thank you for your \n     efforts as a United States Senator to end ``sanctuary \n     cities''--State and local jurisdictions with policies that \n     obstruct immigration enforcement and compromise public \n     safety.\n       Your bill, the Stop Sanctuary Polices and Protect Americans \n     Act (S. 2146), is a commonsense measure that denies certain \n     federal grants to jurisdictions that obstruct efforts by the \n     Department of Homeland Security to identify and remove \n     illegal aliens, including criminal aliens. Jurisdictions that \n     interfere with immigration enforcement should not benefit \n     from federal funds. Additionally, your bill increases \n     penalties for illegal reentry and sends a message that we \n     take the enforcement of the nation's immigration laws \n     seriously.\n       The tragic death of Kate Steinle over the summer in the \n     sanctuary city of San Francisco illustrates the necessity of \n     your bill. As you know, the suspect, Francisco Sanchez, was \n     in San Francisco law enforcement custody but was released him \n     back onto the streets--ignoring an ICE detainer request in \n     the process--because of the sanctuary policy. Ms. Steinle's \n     death was preventable and the public expects the U.S. \n     Congress to hold these jurisdictions accountable.\n       Tuesday's vote on your bill is straightforward. A vote for \n     S. 2146 shows that Senators want to protect law-abiding \n     citizens. A vote against S. 2146 means they want to protect \n     criminal aliens--individuals who not only violate our \n     immigration laws but our criminal laws as well. I trust that \n     the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act will \n     enjoy broad bipartisan support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Dan Stein,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From the Federation for American Immigration Reform Press Release, \n                             Oct. 15, 2015]\n\n   FAIR Urges Senate To Pass the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \n                        Americans Act (S. 2146)\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The Federation for American Immigration \n     Reform (FAIR) is urging the U.S. Senate to act swiftly to \n     pass S. 2146, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \n     Americans Act. The bill would cutoff certain federal grants \n     to jurisdictions that defy federal immigration laws and \n     refuse to honor requests to detain illegal aliens who are \n     sought by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). There \n     are currently some 300 jurisdictions that harbor illegal \n     aliens.\n       ``Policies that protect people who are breaking U.S. \n     immigration laws, including criminal aliens who have been \n     arrested for other offenses, jeopardize the lives and safety \n     of Americans. They also violate federal law. It is essential \n     that Congress act immediately to end these policies,'' \n     declared Dan Stein, president of FAIR.\n       The House of Representatives already passed legislation in \n     July to cut off federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions. \n     While the Senate has delayed action, Americans continue to be \n     victimized by state and local policies that result in \n     deportable criminals being returned to our streets.\n       S. 2146 would take concrete steps to rein in local \n     jurisdictions that impede immigration enforcement. The bill:\n       --Creates a uniform national definition of what constitutes \n     a ``sanctuary jurisdiction.''\n       --Denies SCAAP, COPS and HUD grants to sanctuary \n     jurisdictions and redirects those funds to compliant \n     jurisdictions.\n       --Increases penalties against illegal aliens who reenter \n     the country after deportation.\n       --Protects individuals who are victims of crimes, or who \n     provide information to police. Such individuals cannot be \n     asked about immigration status or have their immigration \n     status investigated.\n       ``The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act is \n     commonsense legislation designed to deter local government \n     officials that actively shield illegal aliens from being \n     removed from the United States,'' Stein said. ``Jurisdictions \n     that thwart even the minimal immigration law enforcement \n     being carried out by the Obama administration should not \n     expect to be the beneficiaries of federal law enforcement \n     grants.\n       ``FAIR urges the Senate to act responsibly to protect the \n     safety of the American public by approving S. 2146 and to \n     work with the House to send a final bill to the president's \n     desk. If President Obama decides to veto the bill it is up to \n     him to explain to the American people why he is refusing to \n     act against reckless policies that have resulted in needless \n     deaths of innocent citizens,'' concluded Stein.\n\n\n                               ABOUT FAIR\n\n       Founded in 1979, FAIR is the country's largest immigration \n     reform group.

This sanctuary legislation is designed \n     to block state or local governments from enacting or \n     continuing sanctuary laws or policies that protect aliens \n     from the reach of federal immigration authorities, most \n     especially with regard to aliens arrested and convicted for \n     criminal offenses.\n       Recent data reveals an estimated 1,000 criminal aliens a \n     month are being released due to sanctuary policies, making \n     congressional action imperative. The bill seeks to \n     incentivize state and local governments to cooperate with \n     federal authorities by continuing existing grants to those \n     which exchange information and comply with detainers; cutting \n     federal funding to sanctuary governments which refuse to \n     cooperate, that is then distributed to jurisdictions that do \n     cooperate; and by providing immunity to officers when \n     engaging in cooperative efforts, including complying with \n     detainers or providing information.\n       View the entire report at: http://cis.org/Analysis-of-\nS2146-the-Stop-Sanctuary-Policies-and-Protect-Americans-Act\n       ``The Obama administration refuses to deal with the \n     sanctuary problem, which has led to crimes such as the murder \n     of Kate Steinle by a five-times-deported illegal-alien \n     felon,'' said Dan Cadman, a Center fellow and author of the \n     report. ``This bill addresses the sanctuary policies which \n     result in thousands of criminal aliens being released into \n     our communities to reoffend.

This legislation that will address the \n     reentry of illegal aliens, restrict federal funding of cities \n     that operate as ``sanctuary cities'', and also support and \n     protect our law enforcement officers is long overdue.\n       Quite frankly it is hard to believe that in a nation \n     founded on the rule of law this legislation is even \n     necessary. Since my son's death at least 25,000 people have \n     been killed by illegal aliens. Many have been killed by \n     illegal aliens who have been deported multiple times. Many \n     have been killed by illegal\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\n     aliens who are actually living and being protected by \n     sanctuary cities.\n       There are over 135,000 convicted illegal alien criminals \n     currently roaming our streets. That number is growing by \n     1,000 every week as so many of our cities are refusing to \n     honor detainers resulting in convicted illegal alien felons \n     first to be released into the general population and then \n     being protected by sanctuary cities. How many more Americans \n     have to die before our ``leaders'' put the safety of our \n     citizens above votes and cheap labor?\n       Nothing I can do will bring my son back to life. But I ask \n     you to do all that is possible to make sure no other American \n     family has to suffer the real separation of families and the \n     never ending nightmare of losing a loved one, I wonder every \n     day why our government has betrayed us and cares more about \n     illegal aliens than law abiding American citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Don Rosenberg,\n     Victim.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 16, 2015.\n     Subject: Support of ``Stop Sanctuary Cities and Protect \n         Americans Act''\n\n     Hon.

Pat Toomey,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On Behalf of the Ronnebeck Family, in memory \n     of our beloved family member Grant Ronnebeck, I thank you for \n     introducing and advancing the Stop Sanctuary Cities and \n     Protect Americans Act. We support this legislation that will \n     address the reentry of illegal aliens, restrict federal \n     funding of cities that operate as ``Sanctuary Cities'', and \n     that also supports and protects our law enforcement officers.\n       You might remember my testimony before the Judicial \n     Committee in July 2015, relating how my nephew Grant was \n     killed. He was working at his job when an illegal alien shot \n     him in the face, killing him, seemingly doing nothing more \n     than counting his change too slowly. You also heard the \n     compelling stories of Susan Oliver, Jim Steinle, Laura \n     Wilkerson, and Dennis McCann. We have all lost family members \n     due to illegal aliens.\n       Unfortunately, since that hearing, several more Americans \n     have been murdered at the hands of illegal aliens drawn to \n     sanctuary cities. Those include Margaret Kostelnik of Lake \n     County Ohio, and Marilyn Pharias of Santa Maria, California. \n     In fact, the Government Accountability Office data shows that \n     illegal aliens are committing murders of Americans at the \n     rate of over 5000 per year. Sanctuary cities can only create \n     an incentive for illegal aliens to enter our Country, and \n     stay with impunity from deportation. The Stop Sanctuary \n     Cities and Protect Americans Act will help save American \n     Lives, and send a message to all Americans that we are your \n     priority.\n       I ask each of you to do everything in your power to pass \n     this important legislation, for Grant, Kate, Josh, Brian, \n     Margaret, Maria, and the thousands of others who have lost \n     their lives due to this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Ronnebeck.\n                                  ____\n\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Committee Members: The legislation addressing \n     sanctuary cities and Kate's law are of paramount interest to \n     me because I am a widow of a law enforcement officer killed \n     by an illegal immigrant previously deported several times for \n     other felonious acts. This issue has directly affected my \n     life and the lives of my children.\n       I am primarily concerned about violent illegal immigrants \n     being allowed to return to our country with little \n     consequence. Every single day, law officers are forced to \n     release criminal aliens who pose a threat to community \n     safety--in violation of current laws that require \n     deportation. Additionally ICE released back onto the streets \n     76,000 convicted criminal aliens in the last few years. \n     Currently there are over 150,000 criminal aliens at large in \n     the United States who have criminal convictions and were \n     formally and lawfully ordered to be deported. The \n     Administration's tolerance of sanctuary cities has also \n     resulted in more arrested aliens being released by local law \n     agencies. And, more than 120 of the criminal aliens who've \n     been ordered deported in the last few years were released by \n     ICE have now been charged with additional homicide offenses. \n     The man that killed my husband, Deputy Danny Oliver, was \n     deported several times for various felonies. However, due to \n     the lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies, \n     his killer was allowed back into this country.\n       I have read reports of various positions on these matters, \n     and I realize that not all fully support the changes. \n     Therefore, I am asking for only one thing. I do not want your \n     sympathy, I want change so others will not have to endure the \n     grief we have in our lives every day.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my viewpoint on this \n     matter. I believe it is an important issue, and would like to \n     see the legislation passed to ensure felons are not allowed \n     to continue to commit serious felonies such as homicide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Susan T.

Ted Cruz,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pat Toomey,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf on Joshua Wilkerson, I want to \n     send my support of ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \n     Americans Act.\n       On November 16th, 2010, Joshua was brutally murdered and \n     then his body was set on Fire. Per the Medical Examiner it \n     was torture. He was murdered by an Illegal Alien, Hermilo \n     Moralez, brought to this country by his Illegal Alien \n     Parents, when he was 10 years old. He came to America from \n     Belize. Our Family has been crushed, overwhelmed, lost, and \n     irretrievably broken. As a mother I assure you there is \n     nothing like the pain of what I have been through.\n       This is just ``my'' story. There are so many families in \n     every state in America that have suffered loss of life just \n     as we have. Sanctuary City Policies invite the criminal \n     element of Illegals to that City.\n       I want to say Thank you for bringing this key legislation, \n     that will be beneficial to all American Families.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                  Laura Wilkerson.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in closing, I refuse to simply stand by \nand reward jurisdictions around the country with Federal funding, with \ntaxpayer funds, when they are in clear violation of the law and are \nactively making our communities more dangerous rather than safer. I \nhave offered similar versions of this legislation many times in the \npast. We cannot wait any longer to tackle this problem head-on.\n  While President Obama continues to let the world know he will not be \nenforcing the current immigration laws or taking action against these \njurisdictions, we here in Congress have an absolute duty to act \notherwise. I believe this legislation will absolutely benefit all \nAmericans by keeping us safe here at home. I strongly urge all of our \ncolleagues to support it in votes tomorrow on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to be voting on a \nvery important bill. We will have the opportunity to vote to proceed to \na bill that deals with sanctuary cities and immigration policies that \nare a serious threat to the public safety. We will move to take up the \nStop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act--a bill that should \nput an end to sanctuary jurisdictions, give law enforcement important \ntools they need to detain criminals, and increase penalties for \ndangerous and repeat offenders of our immigration laws.\n  Some of these sanctuary policies are created when a local government \nunit, such as a city or county executive body, passes an ordinance \nprohibiting their officers from communicating with Federal immigration \nand law enforcement officials. Now, there is another way: Some \nsanctuary policies come about simply because local law enforcement \ninitiates its own policies of providing safe harbor for undocumented \nimmigrants. And then another way: Some sanctuary policies develop \nbecause law enforcement officers are afraid they will be sued if they \nenforce immigration laws and detain an individual for their unlawful \nimmigration status.\n  In summation, these policies and practices have allowed thousands of \ndangerous criminals to be released back into the community, and the \neffects have been disastrous. I am going to speak about those effects. \nAmerica saw these policies play out in July when Kate Steinle was \ninnocently killed while walking along a San Francisco pier with her \nfather. The murderer, who was illegally in the country and actually \ndeported five times prior\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\nto that day, was released into the community by a sanctuary \njurisdiction that did not honor the detainer issued by Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement. The suspect in Kate's death admitted he was in San \nFrancisco because of its sanctuary policies. That sums up the problem \nour bill addresses.\n  Here is Kate--no longer with us--as one example. I have several other \nexamples because people tried to tell us you should not change policy \nbased upon one murder. Maybe so, maybe not, but 5 years of statistics \nshows about 121 people killed by people that have been deported for \ncriminal activities in this country and then come back in. I want to \ntell you what our bill does about that, but I want to first tell you \nabout some examples.\n  In July, our Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing called \n``Oversight of the Administration's Misdirected Immigration Enforcement \nPolicies: Examining the Impact on Public Safety and Honoring the \nVictims.'' That is the committee's hearing title. This hearing was an \nopportunity to hear the voices of Americans who have been impacted by \nthese very indefensible policies while also conducting oversight of the \nadministration's policies and tolerance toward sanctuary jurisdictions.\n  Jim Steinle, Kate's father, expressed his family's desire to see \nlegislation enacted to take undocumented felons off our streets. The \ncommittee was very moved by his presence and testimony--obviously \nsomething that wasn't very easy for him. He talked about how Kate ``had \na special soul, a kind and giving heart, the most contagious laugh, and \na smile that would light up a room.'' He told us how she died in his \narms that day, despite her plea in her dying words of ``Help me, Dad.'' \nThe suspect in Kate Steinle's murder had seven prior felony convictions \nand had been deported five times. Yet he was shielded--protected, in \nother words--by San Francisco's sanctuary policy.\n  The Kate Steinle story is not a singular case. Too many Americans \nhave lost their lives, and too many families have had to feel the real \nand devastating impact caused by sanctuary cities and lax enforcement \npolicies.\n  Our committee heard powerful testimony from families other than Kate \nSteinle's father. We heard from Mrs. Susan Oliver. She is the widow of \nDeputy Danny Oliver. This is the family. He was a police officer in \nSacramento, CA. Danny was killed while on duty by an illegal immigrant \nwho was previously arrested on two separate occasions for drug-related \ncharges and twice deported. Mrs. Oliver spoke of the daily loss she \nexperiences without her husband in everything from raising her children \nto the milestones he will miss, including their daughter's upcoming \nwedding.\n  We also heard from Michael Ronnebeck, the uncle of Grant Ronnebeck. \nYou are seeing Grant's picture here. Grant was a 21-year-old \nconvenience store clerk who was gunned down earlier this year by an \nundocumented immigrant. The Obama administration released Grant's \nalleged murderer, who was in removal proceedings. Grant was born in my \nState of Iowa but resided in Arizona. He had two brothers and a sister. \nMr. Ronnebeck expressed his family's desire to see Grant's legacy be a \nforce for change, imploring us as lawmakers to ``rise above political \ndifferences, to set aside personal interests, and to use your resources \nto make sensible immigration reform a reality in the coming months, \nwith the safety and security of American citizens first and foremost in \nmind.'' Think of that tomorrow and think of the Ronnebeck family losing \ntheir son. They are asking us to keep the safety and security of \nAmerican citizens first and foremost in our minds.\n  We also heard from Brian McCann. Mr. McCann's brother, Dennis McCann, \nwas killed in 2011 by a drunk driver who was in the country illegally \nand driving without a license. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nhad placed a detainer on the drunk driver, but he was released under \nCook County, IL, sanctuary city policies. Mr. McCann expressed his \nanger at the sanctuary city policies of Cook County, which allowed his \nbrother's killer to be free, and at a system that failed to communicate \nwith him and his family when the suspect was released by the locals.\n  We also heard from Laura Wilkerson of Pearland, TX, the mother of \nJosh Wilkerson. Josh was 18 years old when he was murdered by his high \nschool classmate, an undocumented immigrant, after Josh offered him a \nride home from school. Josh's murderer was sentenced to life in prison \nand will be eligible for parole in 30 years. Mrs. Wilkerson spoke of \nthe gentle soul of her son, the brutal torture that he endured, and \nactually watching an unapologetic 19-year-old brag about his killing \nskills during trial and talking about how things were done in his \ncountry.\n  These stories are heartbreaking, but nothing has changed. I want to \ntalk about what has happened since Kate's murder. We have seen more \nfall victim to sanctuary jurisdiction policies.\n  Shortly after Kate's death, Marilyn Pharis was brutally raped, \ntortured, and murdered in her home in Santa Maria, CA, by an \nundocumented immigrant who was released from custody because the county \nsheriff does not honor Federal enforcement detainers.\n  A 2-year-old girl was brutally beaten by an undocumented immigrant in \nSan Luis Obispo County, CA. He was released from local custody despite \na U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer and an extensive \ncriminal history, and he is still at large.\n  Margaret Kostelnik was killed by an undocumented immigrant who \nallegedly attempted to rape a 14-year-old girl and shoot a woman in a \nnearby park. He was released because Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement refused to issue a detainer and take custody of that \nsuspect.\n  These are a very few of the stories that could be told on this Senate \nfloor. There are many more families who are hurting today because of \nlax immigration policies and the lack of willingness by President \nObama's administration to do something about sanctuary cities.\n  But don't take it from just me. Even the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity acknowledges that sanctuary cities are ``counterproductive to \npublic safety.'' He said these policies were ``unacceptable.'' Yet this \nadministration has not taken demonstrable action to address the \nunwillingness of sanctuary jurisdictions to work with Federal \nimmigration authorities. More than 12,000 Federal detainer requests \nwere ignored by State and local jurisdictions in 2014.\n  Moreover, in June of this year, the administration rolled out a new \nprogram that reduces the enforcement priorities and announced it would \nnot seek the custody of many criminals who are in the country \nillegally. This is called the Priority Enforcement Program, PEP for \nshort. That program actually gives sanctuary jurisdictions permission \nto continue ignoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers. PEP \neven discourages compliant jurisdictions from further cooperation with \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement because it now only issues \ndetainers for individuals who are already convicted of certain crimes \ndeemed priorities by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Many local jurisdictions want to work with the Federal Government and \nprotect their communities but are frustrated when the administration \nrefuses to work with them. Think of Arizona trying to protect its own \ncitizens from the crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in that \nState. The State legislature passes laws. The administration goes to \ncourt and gets those laws declared contrary to the Constitution or our \nonly immigration laws. Why? Because under the Constitution, one of the \n18 powers of Congress happens to be the enforcement or the writing of \nthe immigration laws so they are uniform. So when this administration \nwill not enforce immigration laws in Arizona, and Arizona decides under \nthe Tenth Amendment, under the police powers of the State, to do it for \nthe Federal Government, then it is wrong for that State to do it. But \nthis administration will not take action against the sanctuary cities \nthat are violating the same immigration laws.\n  I want to continue with some examples where the administration \nrefuses to work with local officials. Sheriff Cummings in Cape Cod, MA, \nrecently explained his frustration with Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement when an immigrant who had overstayed his visa was arrested \nfor battery\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nwith a dangerous weapon and child pornography. Sheriff Cummings said \nthat when he learned that this individual who had a long criminal \nhistory was in the country illegally, he asked Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement for a Federal immigration detainer ``so that if someone \ncame up with a bail we could then turn him over to ICE and we wouldn't \nrelease him back into the community.'' So then what happened? ICE--\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement--never issued the detainer.\n\n  Sheriff Cummings noted that before PEP, immigration authorities would \nissue a detainer pretty quickly but not anymore. He commented:\n\n       It just shows how they've relaxed their policy so there are \n     more criminal illegal aliens in our communities right now. \n     Those are the ones I'm concerned with. I'm concerned with the \n     individuals that have committed crimes. They are here \n     illegally to begin with and they've committed crimes while \n     they're here. To me it makes no sense to allow these people \n     to stay in our communities.\n\n  I very much agree. It makes no sense that people who do not belong \nhere and commit crimes are allowed to return to our communities and \ncause further harm.\n  Getting back to the bill we will be voting on tomorrow, the Stop \nSanctuary Policies and Protect America Act addresses the problem of \nsanctuary jurisdictions in a very commonsense and balanced way. There \nseems to be consensus that sanctuary jurisdictions should be held \naccountable, and we do that with the power of the purse. And now I am \nbeginning to explain our bill.\n  This bill limits the availability of certain Federal grants to cities \nand States that have sanctuary policies. We limit funding through the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program. This is a grant program run by \nthe Department of Justice that is designed to reimburse part of the \ncost incurred by local jurisdictions that detain undocumented criminal \naliens. Sanctuary cities receive these funds despite their refusal to \ndetain suspects who are wanted by immigration authorities.\n  In this year alone, California received a total of $44 million in \nthese State Criminal Alien Assistance Program funds even though the \nState has a sanctuary law. New York City, a sanctuary city, received \n$11.6 million in taxpayer funding. To fund sanctuary cities with State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program money essentially subsidizes these \njurisdictions for their lack of cooperation.\n  As Former Assistant Secretary Morton stated in a letter to Cook \nCounty, a well-known sanctuary city, ``It is fundamentally inconsistent \nfor Cook County to request federal reimbursement for the cost of \ndetaining aliens who commit or are charged with crimes while at the \nsame time thwarting ICE's efforts to remove those very same aliens from \nthe United States.''\n  The bill that will be before us tomorrow morning when we vote \nresponds to this hypocrisy by making sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible \nfor the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. Another grant program \nlimited to sanctuary jurisdictions is the community-oriented policing \nservices or, as it is known around this town and locally, the COPS \nProgram. These grant dollars help fund community-oriented policing \nprograms for local law enforcement agencies. Our bill makes sanctuary \njurisdictions ineligible for these taxpayer dollars if they have a \npolicy or practice in place despite the lack of any statute, ordinance, \nor policy directive from their unit of local government. Finally, the \nbill limits taxpayer dollars through the community development block \ngrant for sanctuary jurisdictions when a county, city, or State has in \neffect a statute that clearly defies information sharing as required by \nFederal law or has a statute that prohibits any government official \nfrom complying with a detainer request issued by the Department of \nHomeland Security. Those are the funding parts of our bill.\n  In acknowledgement of the bill's fairness in targeting certain \ngrants, the National Sheriffs' Association writes:\n\n       The grant penalties you would impose also acknowledge that \n     our public safety entities should not be punished for the \n     actions of a state or local subdivision over which they may \n     not have control. I appreciate the careful consideration you \n     clearly gave that issue.\n\n  The second part of the bill deals with lawsuits that local law \nenforcement people might be faced with, so the second thing our bill \ndoes is provide protection for law enforcement officers who do want to \ncooperate and comply with detainer requests from the Federal \nGovernment. It would address the liability issue created by recent \ncourt decisions by providing liability protection to local law \nenforcement who honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association explains in a letter \nof support for the bill:\n\n       Unfortunately, at least four courts have ruled that local \n     law enforcement officers may be sued for violating the Fourth \n     Amendment if they comply with an immigration detainer, even \n     if the detainer was lawfully issued and the detention would \n     have been legal if carried out by DHS. This means that our \n     local counterparts are exposed to potential civil liability \n     and it disables their ability to detain dangerous criminals \n     scheduled for release. The Stop Sanctuary Policies and \n     Protect Americans Act solves this problem by explicitly \n     stating that local law enforcement officers have legal \n     authority to comply with immigration detainers.\n\n  While preventing restrictive liability to law enforcement, the bill \nalso ensures the protection of civil liberties and the rights of \nindividuals. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association noted \nthat ``the bill protects civil liberties, ensuring that someone who has \nhad their constitutional rights violated may sue.''\n  Finally, the bill addresses criminals attempting to reenter the \nUnited States and habitual offenders of our immigration laws. The bill \ncreates a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for any alien who is an \naggravated felon or has been twice convicted of illegal reentry. Thanks \nto many people, including TV's Bill O'Reilly, for keeping this issue \nconstantly before the people of this country. This part of the bill--\nnamed by Bill O'Reilly and commonly referred to as Kate's law--has \nbecome so important to many Americans. You can only imagine how \nimportant it is to the families of those who were killed by these \nmurderers, the people whose pictures I had up here. This bill is very \nimportant to those families. Kate's Law is necessary in order to take \nthose who are dangerous to our communities and have no respect for our \nlaw off our streets.\n  This bill has broad support from law enforcement groups. It also has \nthe support of groups who want enforcement of our immigration laws. It \nhas the support of the Remembrance Project, a group devoted to honoring \nand remembering Americans who have been killed by undocumented \nimmigrants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      The Remembrance Project,\n\n                                    Houston, TX, October 14, 2015.\n     Subject: Support of ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \n         Americans Act''\n\n     Hon.

We support this legislation that will \n     address the reentry of illegal aliens, restrict federal \n     funding of cities that operate as ``sanctuary cities'', and \n     that also supports and protects our law enforcement officers.\n       It is now known that approximately 1,000 criminal illegal \n     aliens are released back into our communities from our \n     prisons each month, of which over 60% have ``significant \n     prior criminal histories . . .'', most of which include \n     serious felonies! Add this to the rampant crime perpetrated \n     by other illegal aliens in our country, and we have a matter \n     of national urgency.\n       Violent illegal alien crimes resulting in the deaths of \n     American citizens, are unlike other killings. In every case, \n     Americans were killed by those persons who should never have \n     been in our country. This legislation will send a powerful \n     message that the safety of Americans is the priority. Most \n     importantly, this legislation will save American lives!\n       I ask that each of you do all humanly possible to end these \n     deliberate and unsafe community law enforcement practices \n     wherein\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\n     the killings of Americans is not only enabled but is also \n     well-known and documented.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Maria Espinoza,\n     Co-founder and National Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          AmericaFirstLatinos,\n\n                                    Houston, TX, October 16, 2015.\n     Subject: Support of ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \n         Americans Act''\n\n     Hon.

We are activating nationwide \n     to remind public servants that the safety and well-being of \n     Americans must be the priority in America. Enforcing laws is \n     not racist, in fact, it is offensive for anyone to think that \n     Latinos approve of illegal immigration. Illegal immigration \n     is wrong. Sanctuary city policies condone lawless behaviors \n     and encourages more of the same behaviors, which reaches \n     deeper into our communities.\n       Each day Americans are being killed and harmed by \n     individuals who should not be in our country. It is up to you \n     to stop this epidemic of killings and crimes against the \n     citizenry. I ask that each of you do all humanly possible to \n     end these dangerous sanctuary practices. Americans must be \n     the priority in America!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Pedro Rivera,\n     Texas State Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Sheriffs' Association,\n\n                                  Alexandria, VA, October 6, 2015.\n     Hon.

Ted Cruz,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter, Senator Toomey, Senator Grassley, \n     Senator Cruz, and Senator Johnson: On behalf of the National \n     Sheriffs' Association and the more than 3,000 sheriffs \n     nationwide, I write today in support of legislation you \n     intend to introduce, the ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and \n     Protect American Act.'' This bill takes an important step in \n     clarifying the definition of sanctuary jurisdictions while \n     also offering additional protections for state and local \n     officers.\n       As you all know, state and local law enforcement agencies \n     are critical partners in immigration and border security \n     efforts all across this country. For too long, however, those \n     officers had little to no liability protections when lawfully \n     enforcing Federal immigration detainers on behalf of the \n     Department of Homeland Security. Your bill takes the \n     important step of clarifying those protections so that \n     deputies acting within the bounds of the law will not be held \n     personally liability in future court actions. The grant \n     penalties you would impose also acknowledge that our public \n     safety entities should not be punished for the actions of a \n     state or local subdivision over which they may not have \n     control. I appreciate the careful consideration you clearly \n     gave that issue.\n       On behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, I applaud \n     your efforts on this important issue and look forward to \n     working with you on passage. If the National Sheriffs' \n     Association can be of assistance this or any other issue, \n     please don't hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jonathan F. Thompson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2015.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pat Toomey,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ted Cruz,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Vitter, Toomey, Grassley, Cruz, and Johnson: \n     On behalf of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association \n     (FLEOA), I thank you for introducing the Stop Sanctuary \n     Policies and Protect Americans Act, which will empower \n     federal and local law enforcement officers' cooperative \n     efforts to better protect our communities and our citizenry. \n     Your proposal will ensure we do not dishonor the memory of \n     Kate Steinle and the immeasurable grief her family is \n     enduring. It is critically important that all our law \n     enforcement assets are synchronized in pursuing our shared \n     responsibility of policing violent illegal aliens.\n       Federal law enforcement officers rely on their state and \n     local counterparts to assist in keeping America's borders \n     secure and keeping criminal illegal immigrants off of the \n     streets. It's one team, one fight, as we all took the same \n     sacred oath to protect and defend the Constitution and the \n     American citizenry. We've been relying upon immigration \n     detainers--requests from the Department of Homeland Security \n     (DHS) for local law enforcement to hold an illegal immigrant \n     temporarily, to give federal law enforcement an opportunity \n     to take the individual into custody.\n       Unfortunately, at least four courts have ruled that local \n     law enforcement officers may be sued for violating the Fourth \n     Amendment if they comply with an immigration detainer, even \n     if the detainer was lawfully issued and the detention would \n     have been legal if carried out by DHS. This means that our \n     local counterparts are exposed to potential civil liability \n     and it disables their ability to detain dangerous criminals \n     scheduled for release. The Stop Sanctuary Policies and \n     Protect Americans Act solves this problem by explicitly \n     stating that local law enforcement officers have legal \n     authority to comply with immigration detainers. The bill \n     protects civil liberties, ensuring that someone who has had \n     their constitutional rights violated may sue.\n       The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act takes \n     crucial steps to eliminating sanctuary jurisdictions, which \n     serve to shelter illegal aliens while posing real threats to \n     the American people. We must reassess our priorities and \n     remain committed to the unwavering premise of the safety of \n     the American citizenry is our top priority. The proper \n     response to Kate's tragic death is not to point fingers at \n     each other. Ms. Steinle was killed in San Francisco by an \n     illegal immigrant who had previously been deported from the \n     United States five times, and had been convicted of seven \n     felonies. The shooter chose to live in San Francisco because \n     he knew it was a sanctuary city that would shield him from \n     federal immigration law. Tragically, his ``sanctuary'' gambit \n     proved fatal for the Steinle family. Federal officials \n     requested that San Francisco detain the shooter until \n     immigration authorities could pick him up, but San Francisco \n     officials refused to cooperate and released Sanchez three \n     months before Kate's murder. We owe it to Kate and the \n     American citizenry to fix this critical community safety \n     issue now.\n       We commend you for preserving flexibility for law \n     enforcement, so that victims of crime and witnesses to crime \n     who are in the U.S. illegally may come forward and cooperate \n     with police. FLEOA especially recognizes and appreciates \n     Senator Toomey's leadership and unwavering support for all \n     law enforcement officers. Both Senator Toomey and Vitter \n     understand that in America, the safety of Americans comes \n     first!\n       FLEOA strongly supports the Stop Sanctuary Policies and \n     Protect Americans Act, and we look forward to working with \n     your offices to have this important legislation enacted into \n     law.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                        Jon Adler,\n     FLEOA National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     International Union of Police\n\n\n                                         Associations AFL-CIO,\n\n                                                  October 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Patrick Toomey,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Toomey: The International Union of Police \n     Associations is proud to add our name to the list of \n     supporters of the bill addressing ``Sanctuary Cities'' titled \n     Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act. As it now \n     stands, our officers can be held liable for sharing relevant \n     information and honoring immigration detainers, even when \n     they are from federal immigration officials. This legislation \n     remedies that.\n       Additionally, the bill provides a financial disincentive \n     for cities to become or remain ``sanctuary cities'' by \n     removing State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Funds which \n     were originally designated to provide financial assistance to \n     those counties and cities housing unlawful entrants. It also \n     restricts Community Block Grants. COPS grants are restricted \n     only if the law enforcement agency is the source of, and has \n     the power to change sanctuary city policy. It makes sense to \n     us that a political entity cannot expect finding from the \n     federal government when that city or county has made a \n     decision to ignore federal laws involving the very issues for \n     which these funds were prescribed.\n       Finally, this legislation will provide a five year \n     mandatory minimum sentence for those illegal aliens who have \n     aggravated felony convictions and at least two prior \n     convictions for unlawful reentry. It is long past time to end \n     the revolving door of criminal aliens, who, even though \n     convicted of felony criminal activity and deported, \n     unlawfully return to prey upon our citizens.\n       We both thank and applaud you for this thoughtful and \n     timely piece of legislation\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n     and we look forward to working with you and your staff to see \n     it signed into law.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                    Sam A.

Founded in 1978, \n     NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and \n     associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and \n     more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to \n     fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.\n       The system relies on local law enforcement complying with \n     immigration detainers--requests from the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) for local law enforcement to hold an \n     illegal immigrant temporarily, to give federal law \n     enforcement an opportunity to take the individual into \n     custody.\n       Unfortunately, several courts have ruled that local law \n     enforcement officers may be sued for violating the Fourth \n     Amendment if they comply with an immigration detainer, even \n     if the detainer was lawfully issued and the detention would \n     have been legal if carried out by DHS. This means that \n     dangerous criminals cannot be held and must be released. The \n     Stop Sanctuary Policies ad Protect Americans Act solves this \n     problem by explicitly stating that local law enforcement \n     officers have legal authority to comply with immigration \n     detainers. The bill also protects civil liberties, ensuring \n     that someone who has had their constitutional rights violated \n     may sue.\n       Furthermore, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect \n     Americans Act takes crucial steps to eliminating sanctuary \n     jurisdictions, which pose real threats to the American \n     people, and increases penalties for criminals who re-enter \n     the United States illegally, providing federal, state and \n     local law enforcement vital tools to help keep our \n     communities safe.\n       NAPO also commends you for preserving flexibility for law \n     enforcement, so that victims of crime and witnesses to crime \n     who are in the U.S. illegally may come forward and cooperate \n     with police.\n       We look forward to working with your offices to pass this \n     important legislation. If we can provide any assistance, \n     please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Some on the other side of the aisle are criticizing us \nfor politicizing these recent attacks by criminal aliens and releases \nby sanctuary jurisdictions. We are being accused of attacking \nimmigrants. However, I just want to note that the Democrats take no \nshame in politicizing the recent gun violence and promoting legislation \nthat would not have stopped some of the shootings, from Newtown, CT, to \nRoseburg, OR.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This bill protects law-abiding people \nand improves our public safety. Had it been enacted before July 1, \nindividuals like Kate Steinle might still be with us.\n  I would think we should all be able to agree that people who are in \nthe country illegally and committing crimes should not be released back \ninto the community.

Mr. President, for the first time in more than 2 years, \nthe Senate is turning its attention to an issue related to our broken \nimmigration system. But in stark contrast to the comprehensive, hopeful \nlegislation last reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, the \nmajority is simply scheduling a show vote today on a divisive, partisan \nproposal that has not even been considered in the Judiciary Committee. \nWhat a difference a change in leadership makes.\n  There are few topics more fundamental to who we are as a Nation than \nimmigration. A consistent thread through our history is the arrival of \nnew people to this country seeking a better life. Immigration has been \nan ongoing source of renewal for America--a renewal of our spirit, our \ncreativity, and our economic strength.\n  Two years ago, the Senate reaffirmed its commitment to these ideals \nwhen we approved S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and \nImmigration Modernization Act. That legislation, which was supported by \n68 Senators from both parties, would have meaningfully improved our \ngreat country by making our communities safer, strengthening our \neconomy, improving border security, and keeping families together. It \nwas a remarkable, bipartisan effort that was made better through the \nextensive amendment process in the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was \nan example of all that we can accomplish when we actually focus on the \nhard job of legislating.\n  The bill we are considering today could not be more different. This \nlegislation is not bipartisan. It does not reflect a desire to \nmeaningfully improve what we all agree is a broken immigration system. \nInstead, this bill is, as the New York Times editorialized on Saturday, \n``a class-action slander against an immigrant population that has been \nscapegoated for the crimes of a few, and left stranded by the failure \nof legislative reform that would open a path for them to live fully \nwithin the law.''\n  Those who support this bill point to a tragedy that captured our \nattention this summer. Any time an innocent person is killed, we have \nan obligation to understand what happened and try to prevent similar \ntragedies in the future. We all feel that way about the senseless and \nterribly cruel death of Kate Steinle. Her death was avoidable. Our \nsystem failed, period. And it is heart-wrenching that such a beautiful, \nyoung life was taken by a man who should never have been free on our \nstreets.\n  We are motivated to do something in the wake of her death. Just as we \nare motivated to act in the wake of the senseless killings of nine men \nand women attending a Bible study class in Charleston, SC. Or the nine \ninnocent people brutally murdered at an Oregon community college. These \nare moments that demand leadership. We should roll up our sleeves and \nstart to address the problems that led us here. We should address gun \nviolence and the criminals who threaten our safety instead of \ncharacterizing entire immigrant communities as criminals.\n  Unfortunately, it does not appear that we will be given that chance. \nRather than marking this legislation up in Committee with input and \namendments from both sides, the bill before us was yanked off of the \nJudiciary Committee agenda once the majority leader decided to bring it \nstraight to the floor. Others can speculate about what motivated the \ntiming of today's vote. What we know for sure is that this action goes \nagainst precisely what the majority leader promised last year when he \nsaid that ``[b]ills should go through Committee. And if Republicans are \nfortunate enough to gain the majority next year, they would.'' It is \ndisappointing that he has broken his promise on legislation of such \nimportance.\n  If this bill were to become law, it would create two new mandatory \nminimums and cost us millions of dollars that we do not have. This \nwould deny funding for critical services in local communities and do \nnothing to fix the broken immigration system we have today. At a time \nwhen the Judiciary Committee is engaged in a thoughtful, bipartisan \neffort to reform our criminal justice system and save taxpayers money \nin the process, it makes no sense to forgo that process for considering \nthis immigration bill.\n  If we are really trying to make our communities safer, we should \nlisten to the police officers and law enforcement officials who \ndedicate their lives to\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\nthat very mission. We should listen to domestic violence advocates who \nsay the approach in this partisan bill will have a dangerous effect on \nthe lives of women and children at risk. They are telling us this bill \nwill make our communities less safe. It will undermine the trust and \ncooperation between police officers and immigrant communities. It will \ndamage efforts to prevent crime and weaken their ability to apprehend \nthose who prey on the public. That is why the National Fraternal Order \nof Police is opposed to policies that would be implemented by this \nbill. It is why the National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic \nViolence Against Women opposes this bill. It is why the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors opposes this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic \nViolence Against Women be printed in the Record.\n  I agree with Senator Heller, who noted: ``For two years we haven't \nhad a discussion and so all the sudden we're going to bring up an \nimmigration issue and not talk about the bigger issue.'' The problems \nplaguing our immigration system demand that we respond thoughtfully and \nresponsibly. We can do better. We owe it to the American public to do \nbetter. I urge Senators to vote against cloture on this partisan bill \nthat will not make us safer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                National Fraternal\n\n\n                                              Order of Police,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John A. Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell, Mr. Speaker, Senator Reid and \n     Representative Pelosi: I am writing on behalf of the members \n     of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong \n     opposition to any amendment or piece of legislation that \n     would penalize law enforcement agencies by withholding \n     Federal funding or resources from law enforcement assistance \n     programs in an effort to coerce a policy change in so-called \n     ``sanctuary cities.'' This is not meant to be construed as a \n     position on ``sanctuary cities,'' but rather on the use of \n     Federal programs as an enforcement mechanism.\n       Local police departments answer to local civilian \n     government and it is the local government which enacts \n     statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement \n     officers have no more say in these matters than any other \n     citizen and, with laws like the Hatch Act in place, it can be \n     argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to \n     pick and choose which laws to enforce and must carry out \n     lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the \n     civilian government that employs them. It is wrong and a \n     gross unfairness to punish these brave men and women, or the \n     citizens they serve, because Congress disagrees with their \n     enforcement priorities with respect to our nation's \n     immigration laws.\n       The FOP believes very strongly that local police \n     departments should at all times endeavor to cooperate with \n     their Federal law enforcement colleagues but they also must \n     follow the laws and policies of the government that employs \n     them. It is critical to public safety and national security \n     that local, State, Federal and tribal law enforcement work \n     together and rely on the expertise and resources that each \n     agency brings to the mission. This cannot be achieved if the \n     Federal government is reducing the resources available to \n     local law enforcement nor will it aid in cooperative efforts \n     to address threats to public safety.\n       For these reasons, the FOP will vigorously oppose any \n     amendment, bill or other legislative effort which would \n     reduce or withhold funding or resources from any Federal \n     program for local and State law enforcement. If Congress \n     wishes to effect policy changes in these cities, it must find \n     another way to do so.\n       On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I want to thank you for your consideration \n     of our view on this issue. Please feel free to contact me or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can \n     be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Task Force To End Sexual and Domestic Violence \n           Against Women,\n                                                 October 14, 2015.\n       Dear Senator: As the Steering Committee of the National \n     Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), \n     comprising national leadership organizations advocating on \n     behalf of sexual and domestic violence victims and women's \n     rights, we represent hundreds of organizations across the \n     country dedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence \n     receive the protections they deserve. For this reason, we \n     write to express our deep concerns about the impact that S. \n     2146, the ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans \n     Act,'' will have on communities with ``sanctuary'' policies. \n     Such legislation will be dangerous for all victims of sexual \n     assault, domestic violence, and trafficking, and in \n     particular, for immigrant victims, and communities at large.\n       S. 2146 undermines policies that local jurisdictions have \n     determined are Constitutionally sound and appropriate for \n     their respective communities, and it decreases the ability of \n     law enforcement agencies to respond to violent crimes and \n     assist all victims of crime, U.S. Citizens, and immigrants \n     alike. As recognized in the bipartisan Violence Against Women \n     Act (VAWA), law enforcement plays a critical role in our \n     coordinated community response to domestic and sexual \n     violence. Law enforcement funds support critical training, \n     equipment, and agency staffing that assists domestic and \n     sexual violence victims. Provisions in S. 2146 that reduce \n     funding for law enforcement agencies will allow violent \n     crimes to go uninvestigated and leave victims without \n     redress.\n       In addition, provisions in S. 2146 seek to reduce Community \n     Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to communities with \n     ``sanctuary'' policies, which will harm communities by \n     reducing access to critical housing and community services \n     that are accessed by all victims, including both U.S. \n     Citizens and immigrants.\n       Community trust policies are critical tools for increasing \n     community safety. We recently celebrated the twenty-first \n     anniversary of VAWA, which has, since it was first enacted, \n     included critical protections for immigrant victims of \n     domestic and sexual violence. Laws that seek to intertwine \n     the immigration and law enforcement systems will undermine \n     the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA \n     and will have the chilling effect of pushing immigrant \n     victims into the shadows and allow criminals to walk on our \n     streets. As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent \n     crimes often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that \n     they will be deported. According to a study conducted by the \n     National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Latin@ \n     Network: Casa de Esperanza, 45% of the foreign-born callers \n     expressed fear of calling and/or seeking help from the police \n     or courts. Furthermore, 12% of US-Born callers expressed fear \n     of seeking help due to the current wave of anti-immigrant \n     policies. Immigrants are already afraid of contacting the \n     police and these policies will only exacerbate this fear.\n       Perpetrators use fear of deportation as abuse. Local \n     policies that minimize intertwining of local law enforcement \n     with ICE help bring the most vulnerable victims out of the \n     shadows by creating trust between law enforcement and the \n     immigrant community, which in turn help protect entire \n     communities. Abusers and traffickers use the fear of \n     deportation of their victims as a tool to silence and trap \n     them. Not only are the individual victims harmed, but their \n     fear of law enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting \n     violent perpetrators or coming forward, and, as a result, \n     dangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished. \n     These criminals remain on the streets and continue to be a \n     danger to our communities.\n       S. 2146's harsh criminal penalties will harm victims of \n     trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Immigrant \n     victims are vulnerable to being arrested and prosecuted for \n     crimes directly connected to their victimization. For \n     example, victims of domestic violence are arrested and \n     convicted of domestic violence related crimes, even when they \n     are not the primary perpetrator of violence in the \n     relationship, due to language and cultural barriers. In \n     addition, victims of sex trafficking are often arrested and \n     convicted of prostitution-related offenses. Often, victims \n     are desperate to be released, and in some cases, reunited \n     with their children upon arrest and/or during trial. These \n     factors--combined with poor legal counsel, particularly about \n     the immigration consequences of criminal pleas and \n     convictions--have in the past and will likely continue to \n     lead to the deportation of wrongly accused victims who may \n     have pled to or been unfairly convicted of domestic violence \n     charges.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to affirm the intent and \n     spirit of VAWA and oppose S. 2146 and other similar \n     legislative proposals that may be introduced. Thank you very \n     much for taking this important step to protect and support \n     immigrant survivors of domestic violence, trafficking, and \n     sexual assault.\n       For more information, please contact Grace Huang, \n     Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or \n     Andrea Carcamo, National Latin@ Network: Casa de Esperanza.\n           Sincerely,\n     The National Task Force To End Sexual and Domestic Violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/19/senate-section/article/S7302-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7302-S7303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FLAKE.

Mr. President, today, I wish to honor Tom Brennan--\na long-time reporter and editor at my hometown paper, the Mansfield \nNews Journal. This week, Tom will retire from the News Journal after a \n43-year career in journalism.\n  Tom and I are both natives of Richland County, OH. He has been with \nthe News Journal since 1972 in various roles, so we have known each \nother for pretty much our entire careers.\n  I have always had a bit of a soft spot for journalists--after all, I \nmarried one.\n  And as with any journalist, Tom and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye \non every issue, but I have always respected his integrity and the \nimportant service he provides to the Mansfield community.\n  He has always been fair and civic minded and has taken seriously one \nof his most important jobs: holding politicians like me accountable.\n  Through his leadership in the newsroom, Tom has not only demonstrated \na deep passion for serving our community, he has also been a coach and \nmentor to so many men and women who have worked at the News Journal for \nthe last 40 years. He has helped them to become accomplished writers \nand reporters and has helped ensure that the News Journal will continue \nhis legacy of thoughtful, quality journalism.\n  Over the past four decades, Tom has faced a changing news industry, \nand he has always responded with the best interest of his writers and \nthe community in mind. The evolution of this business has put too many \nlocal papers out of business.\n  But Tom and his team have been able to keep the News Journal in \nprint, while reaching new audiences online, and that is a great \naccomplishment.\n  Tom's impressive career in journalism isn't the only way he has \nserved the Mansfield community. He has been active in many local \norganizations, including the Mansfield Children's Theater Foundation, \nthe local chamber of commerce, the Richland County Economic Development \nCorporation, the North Central State College Foundation, and the \nMansfield Military Affairs Committee.\n  While he will be missed by many, I have little doubt that the end of \nhis career will not be the end of his community engagement.\n  I join his readers and newsroom staff in wishing him the best for a \nfulfilling retirement worthy of his honorable career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/19/senate-section/article/S7303-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LEON GORMAN\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, today we solemnly remember a dear \nfriend of Maine, the late Leon Gorman. Leon was president of L.L. Bean \nand a committed environmentalist, but more than that, he was a \nwonderful man and gifted leader. On September 3, 2015, Leon passed away \nat the age of 80. Throughout his life, he devoted endless attention and \ntime to the betterment of Maine, and he will be greatly missed.\n  Leon graduated cum laude from Bowdoin College before serving in the \nNavy for 3 years. When he stepped in to fill his grandfather's shoes as \npresident of L.L. Bean in 1967, Leon took the company from a $4.75 \nmillion corporation to $1 billion global label. In his memoir, Leon \nwrites that his proudest accomplishment was growing his grandfather's \ncompany from less than 100 workers into one that has employed tens of \nthousands of Mainers over several decades. Even with this impressive \ngrowth, Leon remained committed to the company's values and stayed true \nto the traditions and spirit of the State he loved. He was a true man \nof Maine in every way.\n  Leon was an extremely successful businessman, but also an active \nphilanthropist. He donated generously to the National Park Foundation \nand the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, as well as to numerous other \nenvironmental groups and State parks. He was also a very active Bowdoin \nalumnus, giving generously to the college and serving as both an \noverseer and trustee.\n  During his time as chairman of L.L. Bean, Leon focused the company's \ncharitable giving program on outdoor recreation and conservation. Not \nonly did Leon personally donate to environmental groups, but under his \nleadership, L.L. Bean, Inc., has contributed millions to conservation \ngroups and has provided funding for education, health and human \nservices, and the arts throughout Maine. Leon will be fondly remembered \nfor his unmatched generosity of heart, unwavering commitment to the \npeople of our State, and his deep and abiding love for all that is \nMaine.\n  Through his tireless efforts, Leon affected countless lives and \ncontributed greatly to the betterment of Maine. He will be remembered \nfor his firm devotion to protecting and enjoying nature and his \ndedication to the communities of our State. The State of Maine has lost \na man of true integrity, and he will be greatly missed. I would like to \njoin the people of Maine in remembering Leon Gorman and thanking him \nfor his immeasurable contributions to our State and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/19/senate-section/article/S7303-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 538.
