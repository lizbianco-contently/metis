It provides unprecedented support to domestic \nvictims of trafficking who are all too often invisible and underserved. \nThis group further said: ``As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-\nviolence, child welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and \nhuman rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical piece of \nlegislation.''\n  There have been good-faith negotiations to resolve the impasse that \nhas prevented the Senate from moving forward on this bill. I am glad \nthat we can now say there is a bipartisan proposal that would allow us \nto complete action on this important legislation so we can provide help \nto the victims who desperately need it.\n  As soon as we finish the trafficking bill, as I have indicated for \nsome time now, we will move to the President's nominee for Attorney \nGeneral--hopefully, in the next day or so.\n  I particularly want to thank the senior Senator from Texas for \nleading these negotiations and for his continued diligence on this \nimportant issue. There is really no stronger advocate for victims of \nhuman trafficking than Senator Cornyn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2281-7", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, after weeks of stalling a bipartisan human \ntrafficking bill, our Republican colleagues have now agreed not to \nexpand the scope of the Hyde language. Democrats and Republicans have \ncome to an agreement on a path forward out of this pointless contrived \nfight.\n  It also rejects an expansion of the Hyde language to any taxpayer \ndollars where it did not apply before. This is really good news. I \nthank the senior Senator from Washington, Patty Murray, for the work \nshe put into brokering this compromise. But I have to say and throw a \nbouquet to Amy Klobuchar, who has worked so hard on this for weeks and \nweeks. She has been very relentless in working toward an agreement on \nthis.\n  She has worked consistently to arrive at the conclusion that we have \narrived at. I express my appreciation to Senator Leahy on the Judiciary \nCommittee, who has been available for us at any given time to help us \nwork through these issues.\n  It was not easy, but their efforts--the Senators I have mentioned--\nhave been extremely important to fight human trafficking, which is \nreally very, very\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nimportant for us to do. But we also rejected efforts to further \nobstruct a woman's access to services they deserve and need and which \nwe believe are within the law.\n  I also want to say something about Senator Cornyn. John Cornyn--I \ntalked to him Thursday. We thought we had something worked out. He has \nbeen very reasonable in helping us arrive at a conclusion to this. I \nexpress my appreciation to him publicly for that. This compromise is \nevidence that when Democrats and Republicans sit down together and work \ntoward a solution, good things can happen. The Senate needs more of \nthis.\n  But let's hope that post-agreement amendments do not ruin the \nagreement that we have reached. Each side is going to have to be \ncautious in what they offer, because any one of those amendments, as we \nknow, can cause a minifilibuster or a maxifilibuster, according to how \nyou look at it.\n  We do not need to get involved in that. We need to move forward on \nthis legislation. We are going to have opportunities on other matters \nto offer amendments. I think we better be very, very careful on \namendments that are offered. I say to my Republican colleagues: Be very \ncareful that you do not destroy this human trafficking legislation that \nis so important. You can do it with--I have looked at some of the \namendments that are being talked about being offered.\n  My Senators are not going to sit back like shrinking violets and let \nthis stuff go forward without responding by action that will also cause \nsome difficult votes for my Republican colleagues. So let's get rid of \nthis quickly. Let's get Loretta Lynch confirmed quickly and move on to \nother matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2282-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on another subject, it is extremely \ndifficult to compare one Congress to another. Each Congress is unique--\nchanging times, shifting issues, and new administrations with which to \nwork. But one manner of gauging the success of a Congress is simply to \ntally the number of Presidential nominees who have been confirmed. \nAfter all, offering its advice and consent on nominees is the Senate's \nconstitutional duty.\n  If we were to use confirmations as a measuring stick, by all accounts \nthe majority leader and Senate Republicans are failing in a spectacular \nfashion. So far this year, the Senate has confirmed 21 nominees--4 \nmonths, 21 nominees. It is unheard of to have such a small, small \nnumber. If that trend continues, the Republican-led Congress will \nconfirm 63 nominees this year, 2015.\n  By contrast, in 2007, my first year as majority leader under the Bush \nadministration, the Senate confirmed 276 executive and judicial \nnominees. It did not matter that Democrats were working with a \nRepublican administration. My disagreements with President George W. \nBush have been well documented. That is an understatement.\n  But I worked with him on nominations because Democrats knew--and I \nknew--that it was only fair to give the President the team he needed to \nlead the country. Doesn't President Obama deserve the same? Of course \nhe does. In 2007, each Democratic committee chair worked to move \nPresident Bush's nominees through committees and the Senate floor in a \nreasonable amount of time.\n  Yet we are seeing the opposite from Republican chairmen this year. \nThey are refusing even to do hearings. Of course, if there are no \nhearings, there will be no nominations. In fact, Republicans have \ncommitted to holding up as many of the President's nominees as \npossible.\n  Here is what one senior Republican Senator said in the last few days: \n``I told them: You jam [nominees] through, it's going to be a long time \nbefore I approve of them.''\n  What I say to that is that if this is a tantrum that the Republicans \nare having for changing the Senate rules, as we were forced to do, then \nrevenge is not an effective way to govern. If it really is the case \nthat Republicans loathe the changes to the Senate rules, why do they \nnot do something about it? We are 4 months into this Congress, and the \nmajority leader had ample opportunity--which he has had--to undo the \nchanges we made. So change them if you do not like them.\n  It is clear the Republican plan for payback centers on allowing \nconsideration of Presidential nominations to a trickle. Throwing a \ntantrum is not what the American people expect from their leaders. It \nis not fair to the President or the American people who elected him or \nthe dedicated public servants who want to serve our country.\n  Ten years ago a young Senator from Texas said: ``I would hope no one \nin this body would feel it necessary to bring all the leftover angst of \nthe campaign season to bear against a bright and honorable nominee.'' \nYet this is what the senior Senator from Texas and his party are doing \ntoday--doing exactly what he said should not be done.\n  America continues to look on in disbelief as Republicans delay \nLoretta Lynch's confirmation because they can. This is outrageous. One \nonly needs to look at the CNN poll today to find out that the work done \nby the Republican Senate has been an absolute flop. So I certainly hope \nthis is not what we are to expect during the duration of President \nObama's term. I hope my Republican colleagues will demonstrate \nleadership and move the President's nominees.\n  Again, look at the CNN poll, I say to my Republican colleagues. It is \na disaster for you. It is not only fair to move forward on President \nObama's nominations, but it is a sworn duty Republicans have as Members \nof the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2282-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, from the very beginning of this \ndiscussion on the trafficking bill and the underlying issue, Members on \nboth sides of the aisle agreed that we need to get this bill back on \ntrack as the bipartisan effort it should be, because, without question, \nsurvivors of trafficking deserve our support.\n  Senator Klobuchar has done an amazing job in getting us to this point \nto get this bill done. I am pleased that we were able to reach a deal \nthat now gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on \nwomen's health to nontaxpayer dollars or to new programs and provides \nsurvivors with real, dedicated funds for the support and services they \nneed.\n  No compromise is perfect. I am sure that Senator Cornyn would say the \nsame thing. I believe there is more we can and must do when it comes to \nstrengthening women's access to quality health care. But I am very \npleased that Senator Cornyn and I, along with a number of other \nSenators on our side, including Senator Klobuchar, were able to work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to get this done.\n  I want to thank him and all his colleagues for their work to get us \nto this point. I hope we can now get this legislation passed very \nquickly for survivors and move on to continue working together on the \nmany challenges our country faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am very happy today that we have \nreached an agreement. I want to thank\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\nSenator Murray for her leadership, and Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, \nand Senator Cornyn. The two of us have worked on this issue for years. \nFinally, we are going to be able to move these really important bills \nforward.\n  What this compromise does is really set up two funds. The first uses \nSenator Cornyn's fund, which is fees on perpetrators, and it uses that \nfor things such as shelters and law enforcement, things that we had \nenvisioned would be used for people to combat sex trafficking. The \nsecond fund is a medical fund. It is really based on the same principle \nthat we used with the SGR fund that we just voted on.\n  That bill passed 92 to 8. The fund will receive a minimum of $5 \nmillion and would be matched up to $30 million, as funding in the \nCornyn fund goes up. It really is a parallel fund but serving the exact \nsame purpose.\n  This is the way we were able to eliminate extraneous provisions but \nstill keep the spirit of this really important bill and allow us to \nmove on to my bill, the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, \nwhich really is about not prosecuting kids under 18. There was huge \nbipartisan support over in the House. It passed unanimously through the \nJudiciary Committee and will be one of the amendments to this bill.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Murray for her leadership. We have \nbeen a team on this. We have been able to work with Senator Cornyn and \nour friends across the aisle to get this done. It is also time--I will \nend by saying--to confirm the next Attorney General of the United \nStates, Loretta Lynch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am pleased as well to hear that we have \nan agreement on the human trafficking legislation. It is something that \nshould be above politics. Unfortunately, anything around here, it \nseems, gets sucked into politics from time to time, but it is important \nthat we get an agreement that will allow us to advance this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2283-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2283-S2284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to hear of yet another \naccomplishment that has happened in the Senate since we have gotten \nthings opened up and functioning again.\n  I wish to say that last year when Republicans were running for \noffice, we promised that if we were reelected, we would get Washington \nworking again for American families. That wasn't a campaign slogan; \nthat was a commitment.\n  I am proud to report that after 100 days in office, Republicans are \nmaking significant progress. To start, Republicans have the Senate \nfunctioning again on a basic level.\n  From an operations standpoint day to day, over the past few years \nwhen the Democrats controlled the lawmaking process in the Senate, it \nlargely ground to a halt. Instead of bills being drafted in committee \nand then brought to the floor for open debate and amendment, bills were \ncrafted behind closed doors. Members in the minority party were shut \nout of the process, and so were many rank-and-file Democrats. Last \nyear, Democratic leadership allowed a total of 15 amendment votes--\nslightly over 1 amendment vote per month in the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, known for unlimited amendment and unlimited debate. \nContrast that with the first 100 days under Republican control. In the \nfirst 3\\1/2\\ months of the 114th Congress, the Republican-led Senate \nhas held more than 100 amendment rollcall votes. More than half of \nthose votes have been on Democratic amendments.\n  When you shut one party out of the legislative process in the Senate, \nyou shut out the voices of millions of Americans. Republicans \nexperienced that under Democratic control, and we were determined to \nmake sure things were different this year.\n  Since Republicans took control of the Senate, Members of both parties \nhave had the opportunity to make their voices heard, and we are seeing \na lot more bipartisan legislation as a result. In the past 3\\1/2\\ \nmonths, the Republican-led Senate has approved 12 bipartisan bills. We \nhave passed bipartisan legislation to approve the Keystone Pipeline. We \nhave passed a bipartisan bill to prevent suicides among veterans. We \nhave passed a bipartisan reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Program and a bipartisan bill to provide restitution for \nvictims of child pornography. Last week, we passed the first \nsignificant bipartisan reform of Medicare in years.\n  Mr. President, last week also brought the announcement of a new \nbipartisan agreement, a bill to reauthorize trade promotion authority.\n  With 96 percent of the world's population and consumers outside the \nborders of the United States, trade is essential to economic growth.\n  Since 2009, increasing exports have accounted for more than 1.6 \nmillion new jobs in the United States. Manufacturing jobs that depend \non exports pay on average 13 percent to 18 percent more.\n  U.S. farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers rely on access to foreign \nmarkets. In my home State of South Dakota alone, exports support more \nthan 15,000 jobs in industries ranging from farming and ranching to \nmachinery and electronics. Farmers and ranchers in South Dakota, where \nagriculture is the No. 1 industry, depend on exports for a substantial \npart of their income. Exports of major South Dakota crops, such as \nsoybeans and corn, have soared over the past few years. In fact, in \n2013, total agricultural exports from South Dakota totaled $3.8 \nbillion.\n  Previous free- and fair-trade agreements have been a boon to \nAmerica's farmers, ranchers, and workers. In 2013, countries with which \nour Nation has free-trade agreements purchased 12 times more goods per \ncapita from the United States than non-free-trade agreement countries.\n  Since 1934, almost all of the U.S free-trade agreements have been \nnegotiated using trade promotion authority or a similar streamlined \nprocess. Trade promotion authority is designed to put the United States \nin the strongest possible position when negotiating trade agreements.\n  Under TPA, Congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations and \noutlines the priorities the administration must follow. In return, \nCongress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade \nagreement instead of a long amendment process that could leave the \nfinal deal looking nothing like the original one. That simple up-or-\ndown vote is the key: It lets our negotiating partners know that \nCongress and trade negotiators are on the same page when it comes to \nthe content of trade agreements, which gives other countries the \nconfidence they need to put their best offers on the table. That, in \nturn, allows for a successful and timely conclusion of negotiations.\n  Currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade \nagreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for \nAmerican goods and services in the EU and in the Pacific.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of \nAsia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, \nSingapore, and currently Vietnam. Currently, American goods face heavy \ntariffs in many of these countries. Tariffs on consumer goods in Trans-\nPacific Partnership countries reach as high as 85 percent, while \ntariffs on agricultural products range even higher. Poultry tariffs in \nTrans-Pacific Partnership countries, for example, go up to 240 percent. \nThat is a tremendous burden on American producers.\n  American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and consumers would all \nbenefit from the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement \nand the United States-European Union trade agreement. These trade deals \nremove many of the barriers currently facing U.S. products in these \nregions, which would allow American goods to compete on a level playing \nfield with their foreign counterparts. Reauthorizing trade promotion \nauthority is essential to bringing these two agreements to a successful \nand timely conclusion.\n  The bipartisan trade promotion authority bill that was introduced \nlast week by the senior Senators from Utah and Oregon reauthorizes this \nkey tool and includes a number of important updates, such as provisions \nto strengthen\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\ntransparency of the negotiating process and ensure that the American \npeople stay informed. It also contains provisions I pushed for to \nrequire negotiators to ensure that trade agreements protect digital \ntrade as well as trade in physical goods and services. With the \nimportance of digital trade in the 21st-century economy, it is \nessential that any new trade promotion reauthorization include new \nguidelines specifically targeted at digital trade. I previously \nintroduced legislation to help ensure that the free flow of digital \ngoods and services is protected, and I am pleased that the bipartisan \ndeal that was reached includes many of the measures I have advocated.\n  The best way to solve the challenges facing our Nation is for \nDemocrats and Republicans to come together to develop solutions. We \nhave done a lot of that so far in the Republican-led Senate, and I look \nforward to doing a lot more of it.\n  I hope those Democrats who have opposed trade promotion authority in \nthe past will join the White House and Senate Republicans to pass this \nimportant bill for American workers and businesses and make the TPA \nreauthorization our next bipartisan achievement.\n  Mr. President, I wish to add that we also have a bill that would \nrequire Congress to approve any nuclear arms agreement with Iran--also \na very big bipartisan bill, as it was reported out of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  These are things which can be accomplishments for the American \npeople. It starts with getting the Senate functioning and operating \nagain, where people have the opportunity to come to the floor and \ndebate these issues, to offer amendments, and to get those amendments \nvoted on. That is what our commitment has been in the Senate. I argue--\nand I think the record bears this out--that it is making a very \nconsequential difference in terms of the things we are able to get done \nfor the American people. I certainly hope we can continue that pattern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2284-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2284-S2285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEVE GLEASON ACT\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 984, the \nSteve Gleason Act, to help thousands of victims of ALS and other \nrelated diseases all across the United States.\n  This bipartisan, straightforward bill would give immediate relief to \nthose folks with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, who are facing \nsignificant problems accessing necessary medical equipment as a result \nof three recent changes in Medicare that prohibit access on every \nlevel.\n  It is important to note that this wasn't a problem until the \nadministration governing Medicare made it a problem a few months ago. \nThey affirmatively changed policy, changed rules, and created these \nsignificant access problems. We are talking about devices that are \ncritical for patients who have lost their ability to speak, to \ncommunicate directly with friends, families, doctors, to call 911 in \ncase of emergency, to write letters to loved ones. These devices allow \nthese patients to speak and communicate in light of their loss of voice \nand other functions.\n  This issue was first brought before Congress last year when thousands \nof patients, patient advocates, and device manufacturers brought to our \nattention the devastating consequences of this new Medicare policy. \nPatients were actually having their devices taken away. Many were not \nallowed to own their devices or were not permitted to unlock their \ndevices in order to use all of the technological functions, all of \nwhich continue to be problems and to prevent patients from leading much \nmore independent lives. As a result, Members on both sides of the aisle \nwrote a letter with more than 220 Members advocating on behalf of this \npatient population to reverse the Medicare administration decision.\n  The Senate has that same opportunity for bipartisanship today, to \nsupport this legislation on a strong bipartisan basis. In that spirit, \nI thank Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator King of Maine, who \nhave been completely supportive and aggressive in getting this bill to \nthe finish line. They understand the importance of putting patients \nfirst and fixing this extremely misguided and harmful Medicare \nregulation that has had a truly devastating impact on the lives of ALS \npatients, as well as stroke victims and other folks facing significant \nparalysis.\n  On Tuesday evening, before the Senate overwhelmingly passed a \npermanent doc fix, the Senator from Oregon and I reached an agreement \nthat he would run the hotline on this legislation, the Steve Gleason \nAct, and pass this bill for our constituents. That is what we are \nworking on today, and that is what I absolutely hope to complete today \nto get this necessary, important, bipartisan language across the finish \nline.\n  Of course, the ALS Association, a national network group, is \ncompletely supportive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated January 27, 2015, on this topic from the ALS \nAssociation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative McMorris Rodgers and Senator Vitter: I \n     am writing on behalf of The ALS Association to express our \n     strong support for your legislation that would help preserve \n     access to speech generating devices (SGDs) and accessories \n     such as eye tracking technology that are needed to access \n     SGDs by people with ALS who have lost mobility. The \n     Association applauds your leadership on these critically \n     important issues and is committed to continuing to work with \n     you to enact this legislation as soon as possible.\n       As you know, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     (CMS) has taken a number of different actions that limit the \n     ability of people with ALS to access SGDs and eye tracking \n     technology. This includes: issuing a ``coverage reminder'' \n     that would have prohibited coverage for SGDs that include \n     non-speech technology such as email, internet access and \n     environmental controls; routine denials of coverage for eye \n     tracking; and implementing a ``capped rental'' payment system \n     that requires people with ALS to first rent SGDs for a period \n     of 13 months before owning the device. These policies have \n     created significant problems for people with ALS who rely on \n     SGDs for all of their communications needs. For example, \n     under capped rental if a person is admitted to hospice, a \n     hospital or a nursing facility during the rental period, \n     Medicare payment for the SGD will cease. Moreover, capped \n     rental also prohibits a person with ALS from upgrading their \n     SGD during the rental period, which means they are not able \n     to access email, the internet and environmental controls that \n     are so critical to the day-to-day lives of people with ALS.\n       The Association strongly supported your efforts and those \n     of nearly 200 of your colleagues who wrote to CMS expressing \n     concern about these issues last year and we have worked with \n     CMS and other stakeholders on these issues as well. We are \n     grateful that CMS did take action to rescind the coverage \n     reminder and initiate the process of revising the National \n     Coverage Determination for SGDs. However, we do not \n     anticipate that process to be completed until late July 2015 \n     and it may not address the problems created by capped rental \n     or denials of coverage for eye tracking. In short, these \n     policies are having a significant negative impact on the \n     lives of people living with ALS today and there is an urgent \n     need to take action now. People with ALS, who have been \n     robbed of the ability to speak and who will lose their life \n     to ALS in an average of just two to five years, simply do not \n     have time to wait.\n       Your legislation is a responsible approach to address an \n     immediate problem and would help ensure the Medicare program \n     meets the needs of the people it was created to serve. By \n     restoring a person's ability to purchase an SGD and ensuring \n     coverage for eye tracking technologies, your legislation will \n     enable people with ALS to access the SGDs they need when and \n     where they need them and ensure they also have access to the \n     technologies that are so vital to living with this disease. \n     We look forward to continuing to work with you in support of \n     people with ALS.\n       Thank you again for your efforts to champion these critical \n     issues and help ensure Medicare policies do not take away the \n     voice of people with ALS.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Steve Gibson,\n\n                          Chief Mission Strategy and Public Policy\n                                     Officer, The ALS Association.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. The association has reached out to members all across the \ncountry and put in very concrete terms what this means to their \nmembers.\n  I wish to give one brief but very moving and significant example. It \nhappens to be a woman from Oregon, the State of the ranking member of \nthe committee. She was diagnosed with ALS in\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\nJanuary 2014. Her disease, unfortunately, has progressed rapidly. She \nis now close to fully paralyzed and has very limited use of her arms \nand hands, requiring loved ones to be with her at all times. Her \nrespiratory system is also affected. She is struggling with the life-\nor-death decision of whether to have a tracheotomy procedure and go to \nmechanical ventilation or to enroll in hospice and essentially prepare \nto die. Her preference is to continue living, as she still enjoys life.\n  One important factor in the decision for her is that being able to \ncommunicate is a tremendous concern. While she still has some vocal \nability to speak and to be understood currently, she knows that going \non the vent will be the end of her spoken voice and her ability to \nvocalize, and she is very worried that if she decides to go on a vent \nand prolong her life, she may lose the ability to communicate with the \noutside world because of the changes in Medicare policy that prevent \nher from accessing email and Internet via this technology we are \ntalking about. She is also very concerned that Medicare will deny \ncoverage for the eye-tracking technology she will need in order to use \nthe SGD--this significant technology we are talking about.\n\n  So, bottom line, she is worried that if she decides to continue \nliving using mechanical ventilation, she will face the prospect of \nbeing locked up and having no means to communicate to help direct her \ncare. Because of the limitations of SGD coverage, she may actually \nchoose dying over living, because of that factor. It doesn't get more \ndirect than that. It doesn't get more stark than that as to why we need \nto give these patients access to important communication technology \nthrough the Steve Gleason Act and why we need to act today, why we \ncannot delay this any longer.\n  Of course, Steve Gleason, for whom this act is named, is a superb \nadvocate for the ALS community. He is the former New Orleans Saints \nplayer who famously blocked a punt in the Saints' first game back in \nthe Superdome after Hurricane Katrina. After that tremendous feat and \nhis NFL career, Steve was diagnosed with ALS. Just as he gave the city \nof New Orleans hope to rebuild after the devastating storm, through his \norganization Team Gleason, he gives the ALS community and their \nfamilies hope with his ``No White Flags'' message.\n  Steve was my guest at the State of the Union speech this past \nJanuary, and during his visit to Washington, we met with the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, and started to gain huge \nmomentum for the Steve Gleason Act.\n  This bill again reinstates long-standing Medicare policy--Medicare \npolicy that was solid and true to these patients until recently--to \noffer immediate relief for patients experiencing incredible difficulty \naccessing this important technology and equipment. The act expands \naccess to advancements in technology in a fiscally responsible way.\n  Michelle Gleason, Steve's wife, summed up the story of ALS patients \nand their loved ones this way:\n\n       What causes me the most pain is the loss of his voice. I \n     love hearing his voice. I want him to talk to me, and to our \n     son Rivers. This disease takes his body; to take his voice \n     just seems unfair.\n\n  We can offer a voice. It may not be the same voice but a voice for \nthese struggling patients. This was their lifeline. This was due them \nuntil recently, and now it is not because of this Medicare change.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to come together around this piece of \nbipartisan legislation. Let's pass this today and give a voice--a real \nvoice, a meaningful voice--to these struggling victims.\n  Mr. President, this will become law because we have assurances from \nHouse leadership that they are eager to bring the bill to the House \nfloor. They are eager to finish this important work to change the lives \nof patients across the country by giving them back their voice. So I \nurge us to come together to do this today, to not delay, to not wait \nlonger, and to reinstate the voice for ALS patients struggling in this \nway all around the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott).

Mr. President, it has been 165 days--5\\1/2\\ months--since \nthe nomination of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General was announced. \nMs. Lynch has been pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for nearly \n2 months. She was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a \nbipartisan vote--nine Democrats and three Republicans--on February 26. \nThis is a new record, sadly, in terms of delay in appointing an \nAttorney General. The last seven nominees to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States combined--combined--waited on the Senate floor 24 days--\nseven nominees, 24 days.\n  Sadly, Ms. Lynch has now been waiting over 50 days. Why? What is it \nabout this nominee that causes so much of a problem? Nothing came up at \nthe Judiciary Committee hearing to suggest a problem. Yes, she was \nappointed by Barack Obama. Yes, she has said she will serve this \nPresident. But when it came to her personally, there was nothing. In \nfact, we have this tradition that after the nominee has testified under \noath, then experts are brought in. Each party can bring an expert in to \ntestify for or against the Attorney General nominee. Senator Patrick \nLeahy, the ranking Democrat on Judiciary, said to the assembled group--\nI think there may have been 10 or 12 of these outside witnesses: Which \nof you, by show of hands, objects to the nomination of Loretta Lynch \nfor Attorney General? Not a single one raised his hand--none. So even \nthe witnesses that were brought to speak in negative terms all conceded \nthat she should be Attorney General.\n  That is rare. It is rare to have a nominee with that kind of \naffirmation come out of the Senate Judiciary Committee--and for good \nreason. When you look at her record, you can understand why. This young \nwoman has an extraordinary record of service. She grew up in North \nCarolina as the daughter of a minister and a school librarian. Her dad \nwas there at her hearing. Her father was smiling as she recalled those \ninstances when she was a very young girl, and he would sit her on his \nshoulders and take her to see the civil rights events that occurred \nwhen she was so young.\n  She received her undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard \nUniversity. She has private sector experience at prestigious law firms. \nShe has twice been confirmed unanimously by the Senate to serve as U.S. \nattorney for the Eastern District of New York. She served in that \nposition with distinction.\n  Her nomination has been endorsed by a wide range of groups, \nrepresenting law enforcement, prosecutors, bar associations, business \nleaders, civil rights organizations, and former Justice Department \nofficials from both Democratic and Republican administrations. In what \nmay be one of the most amazing ironies of this whole situation, Loretta \nLynch has been recognized as a leader when it comes to prosecuting \nhuman traffickers. Why is that significant? Because the Republican \nleader announced that he was holding up her nomination until we passed \na bill on human trafficking.\n  Here is a woman who, as a prosecutor and professional, has prosecuted \nthe\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\npeople guilty of that crime, and she is being delayed in her \nappointment as Attorney General of the United States of America because \nof a political debate on the floor of the Senate for almost 4 weeks \nover this bill.\n  Under Ms. Lynch's leadership, the U.S. Attorney's office in the \nEastern District of New York has brought many important prosecutions in \nhuman trafficking. In United States v. Lopez, three brothers were \nconvicted in 2014 for running a human trafficking ring involving 14- \nand 15-year-old girls. Ms. Lynch was also involved in the successful \nprosecution of the Granados-Hernandez sex trafficking ring, in which \nnumerous child trafficking victims were reunited with their mothers. In \nUnited States v. Johnson, Ms. Loretta Lynch was involved in a \nprosecution where a Queens man was convicted for trafficking and \nprostituting a 15-year-old girl out of his home.\n  Make no mistake, when it comes to the issue of human trafficking, \nthis nominee for Attorney General knows more about the subject than \nmost, and she has a record to prove it. Malika Saada Saar, the \nexecutive director of Rights4Girls, is one of the Nation's leading \nantitrafficking advocates. She said: ``It is clear that as the top \nprosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, Lynch has a strong record of being \ntough on crime and human trafficking.'' She has been held up on the \nfloor because of our failure to pass a bill on that same subject.\n  Here is what the President of the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, Michael Moore, said about Ms. Loretta Lynch when he wrote \nto express his organization's strong support for her: ``As prosecutors \nfacing challenges in the field from violent crime, to human \ntrafficking, to gangs and drug traffickers, our membership feels that \nMs. Lynch understands the operational nature of these challenges and \nwill be a strong independent voice at the helm of the Department.''\n  Calling a vote on Ms. Lynch and confirming her would be a big step \nforward in the fight against trafficking. It is time to end this delay \nand obstruction. This extraordinary woman nominated by the President of \nthe United States to be the first African-American woman to serve as \nAttorney General should have been approved by the Senate long ago. \nWhile she has been waiting patiently for a long, long time, we have \ninterrupted the business of the Senate to approve the President's \nappointments for Assistant Secretary of Transportation, Assistant \nSecretary of Commerce, Federal Mine Safety and Health Review \nCommissioners, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board Members, \nUndersecretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security, \nChairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission, and several Federal \njudges.\n  We have had more than adequate opportunity to call Ms. Lynch for \napproval. Let us not leave Washington this week without voting on \nLoretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General. I voted for her in \ncommittee and will proudly support her nomination in the hopes that it \nwill come to the floor this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize the devil is always in the \ndetails. I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the floor \nand I hope we are getting somewhere on trafficking.\n  I appreciate the fact that this body, when we were doing the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, voted for the anti-sex trafficking amendment I \nproposed. And the majority of the Senators at the time voted for the \nfinal version of the Violence Against Women Act, which included anti-\nsex trafficking language, and that bill has been signed into law. We \nshould continue on with this bill, which adds to what we did a couple \nof years ago. But I am concerned, as I have said many times, that we \nhave held up Loretta Lynch because of this. I cannot see what the \ncorollary is.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle told me, when they had to \nwait for 3 or 4 days for a Republican nominee on the floor to get \nconfirmed, that it was too long. They would warn us of national \nsecurity concerns. Well, Loretta Lynch has waited on the floor for a \nvote for 54 days. I want to put this in some context. Attorney General \nHolder waited 5 days. Attorney General Mukasey waited 2 days. Attorney \nGeneral Gonzales waited 8 days. Attorney General Ashcroft waited 2 \ndays. Attorney General Reno waited 1 day. Attorney General Barr waited \n5 days. Attorney General Thornburgh waited 1 day. If we take those \nseven most recent Attorneys General and take all the time that they \nwaited on the floor and add it all together, it comes to 24 days. \nLoretta Lynch has waited 54 days on the floor--more than twice as long \nas the seven most recent Attorneys General combined.\n  Then we still have the Deputy Attorney General nominee, whose \nbackground is virtually the same as Loretta Lynch's. Both are highly \nrespected prosecutors. Both have prosecuted matters involving the \nissues we are trying to stop here on the floor--terrorists, \ntraffickers, and white-collar criminals. Once we are done with Loretta \nLynch, we have to get her deputy confirmed. I hope both of these highly \nqualified women are confirmed soon. It has already taken too long.\n  These delays create a morale problem in the Department of Justice--\none of our first lines against terrorists and organized crime. We have \nsome superb men and women who work at the Department of Justice. Some \ncame during Republican administrations, and some came during Democratic \nadministrations. I have met many of these men and women, from both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, and I am so impressed by \nthem and their dedication. Most of them could leave, go to a law firm, \nand make a lot more money, but they are dedicated to this country. It \nis demoralizing to them when we hold the position of Attorney General \nin limbo. We should stop. The Department of Justice is something we \nshould, whenever possible, keep politics out of.\n  Remember, too, it is not the ``Secretary of Justice,'' like we have \nthe Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Agriculture and so on--a \nmember, as some might suggest, of the President's staff. This is the \nAttorney General of the United States. They represent you. They \nrepresent me. They represent everybody.\n  I have often told a story about when I was a young law student at \nGeorgetown. The then-Attorney General invited four or five students \nfrom different law schools to meet. He reviewed our grades, invited us \nin to actually spend an hour with him and encouraged us to come work \nwith the Department of Justice.\n  I remember one of the questions I asked that Attorney General. I \nsaid: If you are Attorney General of the United States and you are \nasked to prosecute somebody who is close to the President, what do you \ndo?\n  He said: Well, if they should be prosecuted, they would be treated \nthe same as anybody else, and we would prosecute them as such.\n  I declined the offer to go work at the Department of Justice. I was \nhomesick and wanted to get back to Vermont. Both my wife and I wanted \nto get back. I wanted to practice law there, which I did, and I \nactually became a prosecutor. But I often thought of what the Attorney \nGeneral said to me about his role. Subsequently a man in Illinois who \nwas critical to the election of the next President ran afoul of the law \nand the same Attorney General signed off\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\non his prosecution. When asked by some of his staff, ``Well, are you \nsure you are OK with this?'' he said, ``He committed a crime. He should \nbe prosecuted. Even though I probably won't go to many family reunions \nfor some time after doing this.'' This was, of course, Attorney General \nRobert Kennedy, and the man he prosecuted was critical to the election \nof his brother John Kennedy as President. I always admired that he was \nwilling to do that--that he put his duties as a prosecutor first ahead \nof any political duties. I believe Loretta Lynch will do the same.\n  Sometimes young law students can be very impressionable, but I have \nnever forgotten that time sitting there with Attorney General Kennedy. \nI have never forgotten how I had to wrestle with the decision to turn \ndown his offer, but it was a family decision and one I have never \nregretted. I went back to Vermont, and things turned out all right. I \nhave had the privilege of representing Vermont for over 40 years in \nthis body. But that conversation is something I will always remember. \nIt is one of the reasons I went on to the Judiciary Committee. It is \none of the reasons I took, when it was offered to me, the chairmanship \nof the Committee and it is one of the reasons why I am now ranking \nmember.\n  Incidentally, the men and women who work there, on both sides of the \naisle, are brilliant lawyers, hard-working people. Kristine Lucius is \nmy chief counsel, and I don't know a better lawyer anywhere than she is \nor anybody who works harder than she does.\n  We have a lot of issues before the Judiciary Committee. Senator \nGrassley is my friend. We have been friends for over 30 years. I won't \nspeak for him, but I suspect he would say we have things to get going \nto. So I hope we are able to get this trafficking matter taken care of \nand get the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General confirmed.\n  In the last 2 years of President Bush's second term, Democrats had \ncome back into the majority. I wanted to show that we would try to keep \npartisanship out, and as chairman, I had moved 15 of President Bush's \njudges through to confirmation by this time in his second term. We \nmoved them far more rapidly than Republicans had toward the end of \nPresident Clinton's term.\n  I am glad we have been able to confirm two judges this Congress. They \nwere both judges from Texas whom I supported. I complimented the two \nSenators from Texas because of their work in picking candidates who \nwould be judges first and foremost without reference to whatever \npolitical background they may have. I hope we can now start doing what \nwe did with President Bush and confirm more.\n  Let's stop making judges political. I am afraid that there could be \ngood men and women who will decline the cut in pay and everything else \nto become a Federal judge if they think they are going to have to put \ntheir life on hold for 6 months or a year to get there--even more so \nfor key positions such as Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, \nand others in the Department of Justice. We can fight over political \nissues but this should be outside of that.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Texas was a judge and has a \nprosecutorial background. He and I have worked closely together on a \nnumber of issues--the Freedom of Information Act being one of them. And \nI suspect we will work together on a number of issues to come. Let's \nget past this roadblock and onto other things.\n\n  I see him on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the work \nin the Senate and particularly the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct. But I would say to my colleague and friend, with whom I have \nworked on so many important issues, that I also look forward--once we \nget past today's business--to working together with him on patent \nreform, criminal justice reform, and also to continue our very \nproductive partnership on open government and transparency, \nparticularly the Freedom of Information Act legislation.\n\n\n                            San Jacinto Day\n\n  Mr. President, before I talk about the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, I have to note this: It is my responsibility, my duty, \nmy honor to note that today is a very important day in Texas. This is \nSan Jacinto Day. For those who do not know what that is, this is the \nofficial State holiday that honors Texas independence, where 910 \nsoldiers, led by General Sam Houston, won the decisive battle of the \nTexas Revolution.\n  So it is not the Battle of the Alamo that gave Texas its \nindependence. That is the one that people perhaps remember the most. \nMaybe it is because of the movies and books that have been written \nabout that. Actually, the Battle of the Alamo did not turn out too \nwell. Virtually, everybody was killed. But it gave rise to the \nopportunity for these 910 men, led by General Sam Houston, on San \nJacinto Day, to win the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Now, \nalmost 180 years later, I think it is only appropriate and fitting that \nwe recognize their bravery and their sacrifices in pursuit of our dream \nof freedom.\n  Mr. President, on the subject of the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act, this has been a strange experience, starting as we did \non something that passed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee, with \n30 cosponsors on a bipartisan basis, and all of a sudden to have this \nlegislation stuck here in the Senate. I will not relitigate the reasons \nfor that because, frankly, I think we have now found a way forward for \nthis legislation, as the majority leader, Senator McConnell, and the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid, announced this morning.\n  It is going to take a little bit more work by the Senate. There are \nperhaps a handful of amendments that we will have an opportunity to \nvote on. I know there is a desire by everyone for us to finish this \ntrafficking bill as soon as we can, and then we can address the \nconcerns that the ranking member from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has about \nthe Attorney General nomination.\n  Senator McConnell has made very clear that once we get trafficking \nresolved, which it appears we are on a path to doing, then we can turn \nto the Lynch nomination. I have actually been somewhat surprised and \nmore optimistic than I have been in a long time about how the Senate is \nbeginning to work again, from passing a budget to dealing with the \nbroken doc fix that had been the law of the land since 1997, which had \nrequired us to come back and patch--every 6 months to a year--and the \nreforms that actually were negotiated by Speaker Boehner and Leader \nPelosi in the House, which we passed by an overwhelming margin here in \nthe Senate.\n  Then, consider what happened in the Foreign Relations Committee on \nthe Iran sanctions issue with a unanimous vote and the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, with Senator Alexander and \nSenator Murray announcing an agreement to move forward on the \nreauthorization of early childhood education.\n  We have some very good progress that is being made on trade, for \nexample. I just came from the Senate Finance Committee. I think there \nis a path forward on trade promotion authority and consideration of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership.\n  The truth is that the United States has roughly 20 percent of the \nworld's purchasing power, which means 80 percent of the purchasing \npower in the world lies beyond our borders. We have 5 percent of the \nworld's population, meaning 95 percent of the world's population lies \nbeyond our borders.\n  The opportunities we have to grow our economy and to help small and \nmedium-sized businesses and the people--the middle-class families who \nwork at those businesses--are very exciting. So the point is that after \na long period of dysfunction in the Senate, we are starting to see the \nSenate work again the way it should work, the way it has historically \nworked--through the committees, to build consensus on legislation that \ncan then come to the floor, and then to have Senators, whether they be \nin the majority or minority, to offer constructive suggestions about \nhow to solve our Nation's biggest challenges, and then to work together \nto send these to the President and get his signature.\n  So there are a lot of positive things happening in the Senate. I hope \nfor even more positive things to occur in the near future.\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n  I have been focused like a laser for some time now on justice for the \nvictims of human trafficking. When I think for a minute about the fact \nthat the typical victim of human trafficking is a 12- to 13-year-old \ngirl, who has been sold essentially into sex slavery and who has lost \ncontrol over her life and perhaps, to her mind, to her future. I cannot \nthink of a more compelling need for the Senate than to try to offer a \nlifeline to these victims of human trafficking. That is what this \nlegislation that hopefully we will act on today--perhaps no later than \ntomorrow--is designed to do. It creates a fund that could be as high as \n$30 million--not from taxes but from fines and penalties paid by people \nwho commit sexual offenses and basically represents the demand side of \nthe human trafficking equation.\n  We have found a way now, on a bipartisan basis, to move this \nlegislation forward so we can offer a hand to rescue these victims of \nhuman trafficking, so we can give them an opportunity to heal and we \ncan provide them some hope for a better future.\n  I know all of us, by virtue of the privilege of the office that we \nserve in, have had stories from constituents about human trafficking. I \nremember quite clearly Brooke Axtell of Austin, TX, who now works with \na number of nonprofits, and has basically turned her tragic story into \nserving others who have likewise become victims of human trafficking. \nBrooke's story is really almost beyond belief. She says that at age 7 \nshe was sexually abused. She was literally held captive in a basement \nand sold to men who would pay money to have sex with her, a 7-year old \nchild.\n  Brooke has brought to light her pain and has begun to heal as a \nresult of having been rescued and been given a helping hand. But she \nhas now turned her tragic story into hope by honorably helping others \nfind a way out of a life that she herself experienced. She founded a \ngroup called Survivor Healing and Empowerment, which is a healing \ncommunity of survivors of rape, abuse, and sex trafficking.\n  There is another horrific story that I have heard--I am sure just as \nall the Members of the Senate have heard coming from their States, \nbecause this is not something isolated in one State. This is a \nnational--indeed, it is an international--phenomenon. Another woman I \nhave had the privilege of meeting with and who has shared her story \nwith me is Melissa Woodward from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Melissa \nwas 12 years old when she was sold into the sex trade by a family \nmember--unbelievable. Eventually, she was pulled out of school to be \ntrafficked full time when she was in the sixth grade. Her life, as she \ndescribes it, became a prison. She was literally chained to a bed in a \nwarehouse, she says, and endured regular beatings and obviously, sexual \nassaults.\n  There was even once an attempt to set her on fire by one of her \nabusers. All the while, she says, she was forced to serve between 5 and \n30 men every day. She said she wished she was dead.\n  As heartbreaking as Melissa's story is, just as sad is the way she \nwas treated after she escaped her captors. In one of the big changes in \nthe way we have approached victims of human trafficking--at one point \nwe claimed they were the criminal because they had engaged in \nprostitution. But the idea of a child prostitute is an oxymoron. A \nchild cannot consent to a life of prostitution.\n  What we find, in looking at the victims of human trafficking, is that \nmany of them are manipulated, coerced, and forced to engage in this sex \nactivity for the economic benefit of their johns or their pimps or \ntheir traffickers. This is all about money. This is about the face of \nevil that treats human beings as objects or as things, without the \nbasic dignity and respect which all human beings are entitled to. But \nas I said, one of the problems with the way we used to treat victims of \nhuman trafficking is that we treated them like criminals. That was all \ntoo common an outcome for trafficking victims who were labeled as \nprostitutes and left with very few options but to ultimately return to \na nightmare that, sadly, exists in our country.\n  That is beginning to change. It needs to change even more, which is \nanother reason why we need to pass this bill. This is the kind of \nlegislation that I think in many ways is unique, because it is a \nnonpartisan piece of legislation. All this legislation is designed to \ndo is to help the victims of human trafficking get rescued and then \nbegin to heal and to get on with their lives. It is designed to provide \nmuch-needed resources for victims of human trafficking--plain and \nsimple. It may be nothing more than a safe place to sleep, protected \nfrom the people who would continue to abuse them.\n  It is designed to help people such as Brooke, Melissa, and so many \nothers--the tens of thousands of victims of human trafficking. This \nlegislation would not only provide help for those victims, but it would \nensure that children such as Melissa are treated as victims and not \ncriminals.\n  It would also add law enforcement tools to help authorities rescue \nvictims and to take down human traffickers and the organized criminal \nnetworks who support them. That is an important point because human \ntrafficking is not a mom-and-pop business. This is run by organized \ncrime and criminal networks, some of them international or \ntransnational.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for caring--for caring about people \nsuch as Melissa and Brooke and the many examples of human trafficking \nthat we have all been introduced to.\n  I want to particularly express my gratitude for all of our colleagues \nfor working on this and not giving up until we found a pathway toward \nsuccess. This body's consideration of this bill has proven that \ncompromise and bipartisanship need not be relics of the past in today's \nWashington. They are very much alive and well, particularly when the \nneed is so very great, as it is in this area. So now for the sake of \nthese victims, let's get this important legislation passed and provide \ncrucial help for the children trapped in modern day slavery.\n  I want to just conclude by saying a few thank-you's. I know it is a \nlittle premature. But we would not have gotten this far if it were not \nfor the help of organizations such as Rights4Girls, Shared Hope \nInternational, Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, the End Child \nProstitution and Trafficking organization, the National Association to \nProtect Children, and members of our staff in the Senate who have \nworked so hard to get us where we are today.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Senator Klobuchar, Senator Murray, \nand Senator Reid, on the other side of the aisle, who have worked so \nclosely with us, and of course to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, and particularly I want to single out the \nmajority leader, Senator McConnell. He said we would not move to the \nnomination for Attorney General of the United States until we get this \ndone. And, indeed, today, I hope and believe that we will get this \ndone, and then we can turn to that nomination.\n\n  But there are others, perhaps too many to name: Senator Warner, \nSenator Heitkamp, and others on the Democratic side. There are those on \nthe Republican side. Senator Collins comes to mind, and there are \nothers who have worked so hard and so relentlessly and with such \ndetermination to get us where we are today. We need to get this over \nthe finish line so we can move on to other business.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake).

Mr. President, I was not going to be talking right now, \nbut I understand some of the people who are going to be reserving time \nare not yet here.\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n                        Pilot's Bill of Rights 2\n\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues on the floor that we \nhave a piece of legislation that is coming up that no one is really \nplugged into right now, but it is going to be coming before us in a \nvery short period of time.\n  Back in 2011, I introduced a bill and passed a bill called the \nPilot's Bill of Rights. It was something that was very meaningful to a \nrelatively small number of people, but these are single-issue people, \nand it strove to correct a problem in our justice system that existed \nfor as long as I could remember.\n  Having been an active commercial pilot for the last over 50 years--\nand there are not too many in the Senate; and in our delegation in \nOklahoma, I was the only one until a couple years ago--it is only \nnatural that I receive comments from a lot of people concerning \nproblems they have with the FAA.\n  There are a lot of great people in the FAA, and a lot of them I have \nworked with for many, many years. But there are also some--and this is \ntrue with any regulatory body, anyone who has authority over \nindividuals. I remember back many years ago when I was the mayor of \nTulsa. We had a great police force. But all it takes is two or three of \nthem who are the bad guys. We are seeing some of that around today, and \nthat gives a bad reputation to a lot of people. The same thing is true \nwith some of the people who are working with the FAA.\n  I can remember helping others, and I always did come to their aid \nwhen they felt they were not getting proper justice. But it really did \nnot register with me until it actually happened to me. Back about 3 \nyears ago, flying an airplane into a Texas airfield that is not a \ncontrolled airfield, there was an activity going on on the runway \nwithout any NOTAMs that had been advised--and nobody actually had any \nway of knowing this--and with permission I landed on that runway. This \nis a runway in far South Texas called the Cameron County Airport. It \nhas a 9,000-foot runway. They were working on just a couple thousand \nfeet of it, so it was very easy to come in.\n  Now, because of certain individuals who had some other reasons to be \ncritical of me, all kinds of things happened as a result of that. In \nfact, just recently they have even had some cartoons talking about how \nI landed on a runway and was chasing people off the runway. None of \nthat was true.\n  But this is what happened. They proposed to have a violation against \nme, and I was totally helpless, knowing--and many hundreds of others \nhave had this experience; I never had--that I could lose my license on \nthe whims of one individual in the field.\n  Now, it would not have been as critical for me. That is not how I \nmake my living. But look at some people who do make their living that \nway. They could lose their license just because of one individual who \ndid not like them. Bob Hoover is a good example. Bob Hoover, who I \nguess is in his nineties now, arguably was the most gifted pilot I can \never remember. He was the one, I say to the Presiding Officer, who \nwould put a glass of water up on his dash and do a barrel roll and not \nspill the water. I have been with him when that happened. Well, one guy \nin the field did not like him for some reason, and they staged a \nviolation. He could have and did lose his license.\n  Now, I had to come to this body--and it took a year and a half--to \npass a bill to allow Bob Hoover to get back in. That is an extreme \nexample, but nonetheless, that happened. And that is what was happening \nto me.\n  So anyway, we passed the Pilot's Bill of Rights. The main thing there \nand what we are trying to do is to extend to pilots the same \nprotections under the law that other people have. We have heard the \nphrase many times: You are guilty until proven innocent. Well, in one \narea in our society that is true--it has historically been true--and \nthat is for violations or alleged violations against pilots.\n  So anyway, we passed this. We corrected some things that have not \nreally come to fruition. For example, what is called a NOTAM is short \nfor a notice to airmen. A NOTAM is something that has to be published. \nIt is supposed to be published by the FAA if there is anything going on \nat an airport such as construction on a runway that would create a \nhazard.\n  So the pilots have to look up the NOTAMs. The problem with this is, \nthere are no guidelines as to where they can find a notice to airmen. \nSo we corrected this, we thought, in the Pilot's Bill of Rights. \nHowever, it was not as good of a correction as we thought it would be.\n  So now we are coming back with a Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. By the \nway, I have to tell you, Mr. President, I had 67 cosponsors out of 100 \nSenators. So this is something that was very popular and passed with \noverwhelming majorities.\n  So what we are doing now with the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 is about \nfour things.\n  First, the medical certification process is one that is kind of \ninteresting because there is no uniformity. Someone can have a physical \nproblem, a medical problem, and he might be in Chicago, IL, or he might \nbe in Tampa, FL, and they will have a completely different \ninterpretation by the medical examiner as to what should be the remedy \nof that person's problem. So this puts uniformity back in there.\n  Then it does something--and this is going to be something that people \nwho do not understand and are not listening to me right now might state \nthat this would be something that could be a hazard or might be some \nkind of a danger--and that is, we passed in 2004, a rule creating a \nmedical exemption for pilots of light ``sport pilot eligible'' \naircraft. That is for airplanes that weigh under 1,230 pounds and only \nhave 2 seats. There are about 34,000 of them around. It has been over \n10 years since FAA issued this exemption, and since then the medical \nsafety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with \nmedical certificates, which begs the question of the value of this \nexpensive and burdensome requirement for pilots who fly for recreation.\n  A joint study was done by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, \nthe AOPA, and the Experimental Aircraft Association, the EAA, on the \n46,976 aviation accidents that occurred from 2008 and 2012. Of those \n46,976, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one-\nquarter of 1 percent of all accidents. And of those 99, none would have \nbeen prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards \nand the medical certification process. So it does not offer any \nprotection. It does not serve any useful purpose.\n  Now, we are proposing in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 to extend that \nmedical exemption that is currently in place for light sport aircraft \nto include planes weighing up to 6,000 pounds with up to 6 total \npassengers, including the pilot. That would add airmen and aircraft to \nan existing FAA-approved medical standard without degrading or creating \nsubstandard safety.\n  What I am saying here is that of all these almost 47,000 aviation \naccidents, only 99 had a medical cause, and of those 99, not one would \nhave been prevented by the current third-class medical screening \nstandards and the medical certification process. So this is just \nanother burden on the public--not individuals, but specifically on \npilots, and it does not accomplish anything.\n  What we will do now is have consistency in the application of the \nmedical certification process, and it is something that is overdue. It \nshould not be a problem getting that bill passed, and yet it does need \nexplanation.\n  The second thing it does is extend the due process rights preserved \nin the original Pilot's Bill of Rights bill to all FAA certificate \nholders--not just those who are certificate holders who fly airplanes. \nThere are others who are examiners and work in other fields. They \nshould have the same benefits.\n  What it does is--and this is kind of hard to explain--but if someone \nis accused of a violation, that individual has a process that has been \nin law prior to the Pilot's Bill of Rights; and that is, you go through \nand the FAA makes a judgment. Then you can appeal it to the NTSB. The \nNTSB historically has been a rubber stamp for the FAA. So it does not \nreally qualify anything.\n  What we did in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1 is allow an individual \nthen to go into the court system and get what they call a de novo. A de \nnovo means they have a whole process that starts from scratch. They do \nnot just take what the FAA says, the NTSB says, but the courts treat it \nas a new case and look at it. This has not been happening. So we put \nsome teeth in that so\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nthat will be something that will be workable.\n  So I really feel we are going to be able to do this, and it is really \ngetting the things done that we tried to do in the Pilot's Bill of \nRights, but there have been some problems getting the courts to \nunderstand it. In fact, in two separate cases, the Federal district \ncourts ruled that my original bill did not require a full rehearing of \nthe facts. This legislation explicitly spells out the option to appeal \nan FAA enforcement action to the Federal district courts for a \nguaranteed de novo trial. But they have not been doing it. So this puts \nteeth in it so they are going to actually have to do it.\n  By the way, there are things that are in there that people are not \naware of. For example, in my case, I allegedly did something that was \nnot in compliance with FAA rules and regulations, but they did not say \nwhat it was. They did not give the evidence. So you did not have access \nto your evidence. The new bill ensures that is going to happen.\n  The third thing is on NOTAMs. A NOTAM is a notice to airmen. It is a \npilot's responsibility--this has been true for decades--to know if a \nNOTAM has been filed by the FAA. That is a notice to airmen. But there \nis not any way of knowing where to find that. In my case, they claimed \nthere was a NOTAM saying that the runway at Cameron County Airport was \nclosed. That was a lie. There wasn't. There was no NOTAM out there. \nFinally, we proved that was the case.\n  So now we are going to have it enforced so we know where these \nnotices to airmen are filed, and it is going to be the responsibility \nof the FAA to put them in a central location where they would have \naccess to them. This is something that was addressed in the Pilot's \nBill of Rights, but somehow it was not specific enough. The teeth we \nput in this bill is that in the event they do not have it, the NOTAM is \npublished where it can be found in a central location. Then the FAA \ncannot use that as an enforcement action. That will get the job done.\n  The fourth thing it does is to extend the liability protection to \nindividuals designated by the FAA as aviation medical examiners, pilot \nexaminers, and this type of thing. What this does also is address what \nwe call and most people would refer to as the Good Samaritan law. I \nhave a lot of pilots--and I have been in the same situation--who want \nto help. They want to get a patient to a doctor in an emergency \nsituation.\n  I can remember one time many years ago when a tornado went through \nand destroyed the island of Dominica, north of Caracas, Venezuela. I \ngot 12 pilots together with 12 of their airplanes, and they volunteered \nto take all the medical supplies down there. Now, if something had \nhappened in the meantime, they would have had no protection. Yet out of \nthe goodness of their hearts, at their own expense, they were out there \ntrying to save lives. I was there. I know.\n  So this actually is one that is going to give liability protection to \nindividuals other than just the pilots--other people who own FAA \ncertificates--and at the same time give protection to those people who \nare trying to help other people.\n  So I believe this bill should be coming up in the next couple of \nweeks. It will be going to the commerce committee. I would encourage \nMembers to--and particularly those 67 Members who were the cosponsors \nof the original Pilot's Bill of Rights should be on this one too. In \nfact, most of them are right now. I know Senators Manchin and Boozman \nwere the first two to get on. They happen to be the chairmen of the \nGeneral Aviation Caucus in the Senate. By the way, we have equal \nsupport over in the other body, in the House of Representatives.\n  Last summer, at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh fly-in convention--that is \nthe largest fly-in convention anywhere in the world--I hosted a public \nforum to solicit input for the legislation we are having, the Pilot's \nBill of Rights 2, and I received over 400 comments from \nindividuals. These are people who were present at the Oshkosh event.\n\n  So we have solicited their input, and we have all the organizations \nbehind it. I would say, insofar as the one that might become \ncontroversial; that is, the exemption on a third-class medical--doctors \nhave unanimously voted in favor of it--they are called the doctors in \naviation--and others.\n  This is one of these rare opportunities we have on a bipartisan basis \nto pass something that is going to offer legal protections to one class \nof people who currently don't have it and have not had it in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise again to speak in support of the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It is good legislation, drafted \nand introduced by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and also the \nSenator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar. They originally put this bill \ntogether in the last Congress, and I was pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthat bill. I am also very pleased to be an original cosponsor of the \nlegislation they introduced earlier this year, the legislation we have \non the floor now.\n  This bill has many important, strong points. I am going to go through \nsome--not all but a number of them.\n  For example, it makes sure victims get restitution and witnesses get \nrewards for cooperating with law enforcement before others and \nencourages prosecutors to get training on restitution in human \ntrafficking cases. It also gives law enforcement greater authority to \nseize the assets of convicted human traffickers, and it protects \nvictims and witnesses by requiring human traffickers to be treated as \nviolent criminals for purposes of pretrial release and detention \npending judicial proceedings.\n  It also ensures that Federal crime victims are informed of any plea \nbargain or deferred prosecution agreement in their case and clarifies \nthat the ordinary standard of appellate review applies in cases \nconcerning Federal crime victims' rights petitions.\n  It recognizes that child pornography production is a form of human \ntrafficking and ensures that victims have access to direct services at \nchild advocacy centers to help them heal.\n  It allows State and local human trafficking task forces to get \nwiretap warrants within their own State courts without Federal \napproval. That will help them to more effectively investigate crimes of \nchild pornography, child sexual exploitation, and human trafficking.\n  The bill also improves nationwide communications so law enforcement \ncan better track and capture traffickers and child pornographers. It \nensures regular reporting on the number of human trafficking crimes for \npurposes of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n  It also requires law enforcement to upload photos of missing \nindividuals into the National Criminal Information Center database and \nnotify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of any \nchild reported missing from foster care, and it strengthens current law \nto reduce demand for human trafficking by encouraging police, \nprosecutors, judges, and juries to target all persons involved in the \nbuying and selling of human trafficking victims. It is just wrong to \nprosecute victims and fail to prosecute those who prey on them.\n  This legislation will help for all of those reasons, but this \nlegislation is also very important because it creates a fund from fines \nand penalties imposed on those who would engage in human trafficking. \nThe fund is important because it not only compensates victims of human \ntrafficking and other crimes of exploitation for their injuries, but it \nalso provides resources to help law enforcement prevent such crimes in \nthe future.\n  As we work on this important issue, it is also very important that we \nunderstand that human trafficking is not just a big-State, big-city \nproblem. Every State in the country is facing this issue, including my \nhome State of North Dakota, but we currently have a challenge \naddressing this problem.\n  After consulting with the North Dakota attorney general's office, we \nlearned that North Dakota has been\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\ndiscouraged from applying for antihuman trafficking grants, because in \nits application, the Department of Justice asks for at least 2 years of \nlocal data on human trafficking victims. North Dakota, in recent years, \nhas been the fastest growing State in the country. So here we are, the \nfastest growing State both in terms of population and in terms of \nincome growth. Consequently, more so than many States, only recently we \nhave seen significant increases in human trafficking issues. So we \ndon't have that 2 years' worth of data that DOJ requires, but we very \nmuch need assistance with addressing the problem of human trafficking. \nIt is not unique to North Dakota. There are other States--typically \nfast-growing States, States that may have the same kind of energy \ndevelopment or other areas where they have seen a significant influx of \npeople and are continuing to see a significant influx of people. This \nis a national issue. It is not specific just to my State but to any \nState where we have seen rapid growth, influx of money, influx of \npeople from outside the State and where human trafficking is an issue.\n  To remedy that, I have offered an amendment to the current \nlegislation we have on the floor now, the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill, that \nclarifies that an eligibility entity with a worthy trafficking \ninitiative, in an effort to combat trafficking in its jurisdiction, \nwill not be disadvantaged in receiving funds under the Cornyn-Klobuchar \nbill because they, like North Dakota--be it a State or whatever--have \nonly recently begun collecting data on human trafficking. So in cases \nwhere they don't have 2 years of data, as long as they can demonstrate \na valid need and a valid solution to try to address this important \nissue and to reduce human trafficking, that is what will be required \nfor the application, and not having 2 years of data will not be an \nissue in terms of scoring or an issue that DOJ would hold against that \napplication for receipt of the funds for a worthy project.\n  This is important to make sure that all across the country, in every \nState, we are addressing human trafficking. We all need to be united, \nin every State across this great country, working to combat human \ntrafficking. That is why this amendment is very important.\n  There are few issues that as a governing body we can be more united \non than making sure we protect our children, that we prevent human \ntrafficking in any form, and that we do it on a national basis in every \nState. That is what my amendment is all about.\n  For this reason, I offer this amendment. I hope it will be included \nas part of the Cornyn-Klobuchar legislation, which, as I said earlier, \nI am only too pleased to cosponsor.\n  The value and importance of this legislation is reflected in the \nbroad coalition of victims' rights and law enforcement organizations \nthat support it. It has been endorsed by nearly 200 groups, from the \nFraternal Order of Police to the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children.\n  We need to pass this legislation. Crimes such as human trafficking \nand child pornography target the most vulnerable among us in a most \ndespicable way. I urge all of my colleagues to pass this bill, to put \nan end to modern-day slavery, and to help victims get the support they \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation that \nthis afternoon the Senate is finally getting back to legislating on the \nimportant issue of human trafficking. It is critical we pass this \nlegislation to combat one of the world's most heinous crimes and one \nthat threatens thousands of innocent people every year.\n  I am the cochair and cofounder of the human trafficking caucus. Our \nopportunity is not only to raise awareness of this issue but also to \npass important legislation to address the problem.\n  We learned that human trafficking is now a $32 billion worldwide \nindustry, leaving it only second in size to the drug trade for criminal \nactivity. Many view this as an international problem. They think, well, \nthis happens somewhere else or on another continent, such as Africa or \nAsia. The fact is it happens right here. Of course, every country \naround the world has a responsibility to fight back against traffickers \nand stop their acts of violence. But while this industry has a global \nreach, the reality is that human trafficking is a major problem not \nonly in my home State of Ohio, it is a problem in every State \nrepresented in the Senate. The Justice Department has told us that the \naverage age of victims getting involved in trafficking is 12 to 14 \nyears old. Think about that. These are children. These are kids. The \nnumber of American children at risk of sexual exploitation and human \ntrafficking is estimated to be about 300,000. These children represent \nthe most vulnerable among us, and we should make sure we are doing \neverything we possibly can to protect them. Every American life has \nvalue and every child deserves a chance to live a bright future.\n  Today, however, we can take comfort in knowing we are fighting back \nagainst human traffickers and making it harder for their criminal \nactivity to continue in a couple of different ways, both of which are \nvery important.\n  First, our legislation makes it easier to find some of these \nvulnerable children. Missing children are particularly vulnerable, and \nthe legislation I am about to talk about enables us to find those \nchildren more quickly and helps to get them into a nurturing \nenvironment. Second, it will strengthen law enforcement's ability to \nfind and punish those who are committing these crimes.\n  We accomplished the first goal with the Bringing Missing Children \nHome Act. It is a bill that I authored with Senator Chuck Schumer of \nNew York. We know there is a strong connection, unfortunately, between \nsex trafficking victims and children who have been in and out of the \nchild welfare system. We also understand that kids who are missing or \nwho have run away from home are the most vulnerable to trafficking, \nexploitation, and abuse. The FBI sting in 2014 recovered 168 sex \ntrafficking victims, and nearly all of them had spent time in the child \nwelfare or foster care system. While many of these children had been \nreported missing, the information obtained by authorities was not \nsufficient enough to be able to find them, and that is what this \nlegislation gets at.\n  The Bringing Missing Children Home Act will make it easier to find \nthese children in two different ways. First, it amends the Missing \nChildren's Assistance Act by replacing the term ``child prostitution'' \nwith ``child sex trafficking.'' This reinforces the fact that children \nwho are exploited are victims, not criminals. Secondly, the bill \nrequires law enforcement agencies to update their records of missing \nchildren within 30 days of an initial report with additional \ninformation that could include medical or dental records or even a \nphotograph. Having this new information, particularly a photograph, is \nincredibly important when searching for a missing child. I know this \nbecause this has been a big problem in my home State of Ohio.\n  We started looking at this legislation and considering this bill on \nthe floor on March 6. Since March 6, 60 children have been reported \nmissing in my home State of Ohio. Yet we only have photographs for 14 \nof them. It is hard to find these children, and not having that \ninformation makes it even more difficult. Our legislation will help to \nget those photographs and will help ensure that all of us can play a \nrole in helping to find these missing children.\n  The bill also makes it easier for law enforcement officials on the \nState and local level to coordinate with child welfare services, and it \nallows missing persons units and State law enforcement agencies to \nmodify and improve missing children's entries to include important \ninformation that was uncovered during an investigation. That is not \ncurrently the case. It just makes sense to be able to have better \nrecords.\n  While we are making it easier to find trafficking victims, we will \nalso make it easier to find and punish perpetrators of these crimes \nwith legislation I have authored with Senator Dianne\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\nFeinstein. It is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act and is part of \nthis underlying bill we will also be considering here on the floor. \nThis act focuses on those who commit these crimes. It increases the \npenalties for those who buy acts from sex trafficking victims. It \nrequires new training by the Justice Department on targeting. It \nexpands reporting on trafficking prosecutions and strengthens victims' \nrights. A lot of this comes out of what we have learned over the past \ndecade since we have really taken up this issue at the Federal level. \nIt improves Federal law to take into account the information we now \nknow. Through better enforcement of laws against buyers, we will be \nable to reduce the demand for sexual exploitation and ensure that \ncriminals are prosecuted to the full extent, preventing further \ntrafficking crimes from ever happening.\n  As the cochair of the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, it has \nbeen a priority of mine to get this legislation passed in an effort to \nhelp victims of trafficking and to prevent the number of victims from \nincreasing.\n  I also hope we can add an amendment I authored entitled ``Ensuring a \nBetter Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking.'' This amendment \ncontains a piece of legislation I authored last year with Senator Wyden \nof Oregon called the Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act. It will \nhelp improve the information law enforcement officials have about the \nscope of the trafficking problem. This was signed into law last year, \nbut there is additional information we would like to provide in terms \nof getting the response part of that bill passed.\n  The bills I have spoken about are important steps to one day ending \nhuman trafficking and putting this horrible industry out of business \naltogether. Trafficking deserves no place in America.\n  I thank Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others \nfor their hard work on this legislation I have talked about. I would \nalso like to express how grateful I am that Members of this Chamber \nwere able to put partisanship behind us, politics aside, and reach \ncommon ground to move forward on this important issue. Ending human \ntrafficking is clearly a bipartisan goal. It is a nonpartisan goal. It \nis something on which we should come together. The legislation we have \nbefore us today will make a profound impact on so many Americans, \nincluding some of the most vulnerable. I am happy to see we are a \nlittle closer to having these bills become law. I think they will \nbecome law once they pass this Chamber, go through the House, and are \nsigned by the President.\n  We still have a lot of work to do. This is just a start. After today, \nthe fight to combat human trafficking will be far from over. Somewhere \nin America, there will still be children looking to be found, wondering \nif anybody cares, despite our legislation. Today's legislation will \nmake it easier to find them, but it is still up to all of us. All of us \nhave a role in helping to keep these children from going missing in the \nfirst place and then finding and providing them with a nurturing \nsetting and a home where they are embraced and where they can be taken \naway from the stress of human trafficking and sex trafficking.\n  There will always be traffickers looking to exploit the vulnerable. \nWe know that. But today, if we pass this legislation, we will be \nsending a warning to those who commit these heinous crimes. As long as \nyou are a perpetrator or an accomplice to human trafficking--folks will \nknow that law enforcement is going to do what it takes to track them \ndown and to punish them.\n  I am glad we have been able to find common ground again and move a \nlittle closer to making these positive changes a reality. I am hopeful \nthat we will be able to vote on this today and tomorrow, move this to \nthe House, get it through to the President, and indeed begin to make a \ndifference to my constituents in Ohio and around the country.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I am here today to identify yet another \ninstallment of the ``Waste of the Week.'' We have been doing this now \nfor several weeks, trying to save taxpayers' dollars out of documented \nwaste of their dollars when they send them to Washington. In recent \nweeks, I have highlighted examples of waste, some big some small.\n  To date, we have documented over $47 billion of taxpayer funds that \nhave gone to duplication of effort, simply gone to things the Federal \nGovernment never should have been involved in in the first place, \nexamples of fraud, abuse--$47 billion and climbing on our tax savings \ngauge here which is approaching now $50 billion. Our goal is $100 \nbillion. We are going to keep going as we discover each week yet \nanother waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  This week's ``Waste of the Week'' involves the Federal Employees' \nCompensation Act, also known as FECA. This law was enacted in 1916--\nwell intended, I think, to provide workers' compensation benefits to \ncivilian Federal employees who sustained injuries while employed by the \nFederal Government and includes funds for vocational rehabilitation and \nmedical benefits.\n  As I said, it was well intended at the time, providing a lifeline for \npeople injured on the job to keep these people afloat financially until \nthey are ready to go back to work. ``Ready to go back to work'' has \nbecome somewhat of a major question in terms of how this 1916 law is \napplied, because you have to wonder, is someone 99 years old looking to \ngo back to work.\n  Well, in 1916, when this act was enacted, it treated them as if they \nwere and are able to go back to work. Let me explain. Both the FECA \ncompensation and medical benefits are payable for the duration of a \nperson's inability to work, which can extend well into their individual \ngolden years.\n  You say: How does that all happen? But under current law, there is no \nmaximum duration of benefits and no maximum age at which benefits must \nbe terminated. Thus, when beneficiaries become eligible for Federal \nretirement or disability annuities, they are given the choice as to \nwhether they want to remain in the FECA program or choose the Federal \nretirement program.\n  Well, it is not much of a choice. The choice is obvious because given \nthe level of benefits monthly, FECA benefits can be a much better deal \nthan what they would be paid under retirement benefit plans. The FECA \nbenefits are as high as 75 percent of the worker's predisability wage. \nThe annual cost-of-living-adjustment is applied each year, the COLA, to \nthe benefits.\n  Someone came up with a pretty interesting idea here. FECA benefits \nare not taxed. So, clearly, this ends up being a much better deal for \nbeneficiaries. But is it a better deal for taxpayers? That is the \nquestion. Let's take a closer look. This applies to all Federal \nagencies, but let's take one agency. The Department of Labor reports \nthat approximately 45,000 cases currently receive long-term disability \nbenefits under FECA, and 15,000 or one-third of these cases involve \nbeneficiaries aged 66 or older.\n  Clearly, it is time--actually it is past time--to reconsider and make \nreforms to the FECA. At a minimum, we should require workers, when they \nreach retirement age, to transition into the retirement plan as all \ntheir peers have had to do and not continue, throughout their lifetime, \nthe much more generous benefits of FECA.\n  As I said, the agency with the most FECA claims is the U.S. Postal \nService. I want to use this as an example of how this is applied. The \nPostal Service Office of Inspector General told us that FECA rolls \ninclude 9,554 postal workers aged 55 or older eligible for retirement; \n3,389 aged 65 and over; 928 aged 80 or older; and, yes, one postal \nworker at the age of 99.\n  So in 2013 the U.S. Postal Service paid about $1.3 billion in \nworkers' compensation claims and $67 million in administrative fees. In \naddition, as of June 30, 2014, the estimated workers' compensation \nliability totaled $17.8 billion. Now, while many of these benefits go \nto workers of a traditional working\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\nage, the U.S. Postal Service estimates that these higher than \nretirement benefits are resulting in an extra $37.8 million being paid \nout annually.\n  That comes to nearly $400 million over the next 10 years, and that is \njust from one agency, the U.S. Postal Service. Estimates as to the cost \nto the taxpayer when all of the Federal agencies are included show that \nmore than $1 billion will be spent over the next 10 years in extra \nworkers' compensation payments for those who would unlikely be working \nthroughout the Federal workforce.\n  As my colleague, Senator Susan Collins from Maine, has been \nhighlighting for years, FECA has become a gold-plated retirement system \ntainted by unfairness, perverse incentives, and the potential for abuse \nand fraud.\n  This program has become increasingly expensive and requires some \ncommonsense reforms--reforms that many States have already implemented \nin their own workers' compensation programs. Remember, these payments \nare designed as a bridge to help injured workers until they are able to \nreturn to work. That is the most important phrase here--``return to \nwork.'' This program was never intended to serve as a higher paying \nalternative to the Federal retirement system. Yet, under the law, it is \nused for that, and it has cost the taxpayers a significant amount of \ntheir tax dollars for unnecessary payments.\n  Let's not ignore ways we can improve our fiscal health and return our \nFederal programs, at a minimum, to their original intent. It is time we \nlook at this policy and restore integrity to the FECA, the Federal \nEmployees' Compensation Act.\n  Today, I am adding another $1 billion to the taxpayer savings gauge \nfor this week's waste of the week, and I look forward to discussing \nways we can eradicate this waste from our Federal budget so that we can \ngive hard-earned dollars back to the taxpayers--money that simply is \nnot used properly and is labeled, of course, a waste of their money.\n  So we have increased--we are approaching $50 billion, and we are \nshooting up to $100 billion by the end of this year. I am hoping we can \ngo significantly past that.\n  The next step, of course, is to take what we have identified and make \nsure that the law is changed, that it is reformed, and that we can \nproudly say to the taxpayer that we are doing our part in Washington. \nWhile the larger issues of debt and deficit need to be addressed and \nmust be addressed, if we cannot come to consensus on that, at least we \ncan come to consensus on eliminating these egregious abuses of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as Americans celebrate the 35th Earth \nDay this week, I rise for the 96th time--I seem to be coinciding with \nthe Presiding Officer's schedule so he has been treated to his share of \nthese speeches--to urge this body to wake up to the threat of climate \nchange. It is real, not a hoax. It is caused by carbon pollution, and \nit is already making changes that we are already seeing in the world \naround us. We must cut our carbon pollution to prevent even bigger \nclimate changes--changes in our atmosphere, oceans, and human habitat--\npotentially unprecedented in the history of our human habitation of \nthis planet.\n  Yet the polluters who are producing this problem would have us do \nnothing. They make money when we do nothing. So we do nothing. The \npolluters run a racket. They all float onto us the costs and damage \nfrom their fossil fuel product--the costs of heat waves, of sea level \nrise, of ocean acidification, of dying forests, and more. The polluters \nhappily dump those costs onto everybody else. And to keep this \nprofitable racket running, the polluters spend huge sums on lobbying \nand politics, particularly right here in the Congress.\n  As one author has written, ``rivers of money flowing from secret \nsources have turned our elections into silent auctions.'' And the \npolluters get what they pay for. The Republican Party in Congress has \nbecome the political arm of the fossil fuel industry. The polluters \nalso spend huge amounts on a big, complex PR machine to churn out doubt \nabout the real science and cook up some paid-for science.\n  Documents recently discovered by Greenpeace show that one scientist, \nwhose work consistently downplayed the role of carbon pollution and \nclimate change, received--get this--more than $1.2 million from oil and \ncoal interests over the last decade. Those nice people at the Charles \nG. Koch Charitable Foundation gave him at least $230,000. In recent \nyears, his grants came through Donors Trust, the front group that \nfunnels money from oil, coal, and other special interests.\n  Well, what do we know? We know that financial incentives affect \npeople's behavior. Does anyone doubt that? That is life. That is why \npoliticians have to disclose their political contributors, the gifts \nand benefits they receive, and even personal financial information. \nThat is why regulatory agencies and scientific journals require \nscientific submissions to make plain who funded the work. That is why \nexpert witnesses' funding sources are relevant in court proceedings. \nAnd that is why Upton Sinclair once said: ``It's difficult to get a man \nto understand something when his salary depends on his not \nunderstanding it.''\n  So we know that money talks. That is not news. What else do we know? \nWell, we also know about that industry playbook to keep safety \nregulation at bay by funding phony science and manufacturing doubt \nabout legitimate science. That is not news, either. That has been \naround for years.\n  The tobacco industry campaign to mislead the public about the health \neffects of cigarettes was so fraudulent it was determined in Federal \ncourt to be a racketeering enterprise. Think about that--an industry \ncampaign of deception about the risks of their product that persisted \nfor years and was ultimately determined in Federal court to have \nconstituted a racketeering enterprise. Does it sound familiar? And \ntobacco is not alone. The lead paint industry shut down its trade \nassociation, the Lead Industry Association, rather than answer \nquestions under oath in a court proceeding.\n  Entire books have been written documenting this industry's strategy, \nfor example, ``Merchants of Doubt,'' which has recently been made into \na documentary, or ``Doubt is Their Product,'' or ``Lead Wars,'' or \n``Deceit and Denial.'' So we know the strategy.\n  Finally, we know something else. We know that a network of front \norganizations with innocent-sounding names has emerged to propagate the \nbaloney science. This phenomenon has been well documented by Dr. Robert \nBrulle at Drexell University, among others. His follow-the-money \nanalysis diagrams the complex flow of cash to these front groups that \nindustry persistently tries to obscure. Well, here is what makes sense \nto me: If it is important enough for them to want to hide it, it is \nimportant enough for us to want to know about it.\n  So Senators Boxer, Markey, and I sent a letter to about 100 \ncompanies, trade groups, and other organizations affiliated with the \nfossil fuel industry. We asked whether they spent money to support \nclimate research. It sounds reasonable, based on those three things \nthat we know. Well, oh, my, what a fit of caterwauling that drew from \nthe rightwing PR machine. Today, I will give a recap of the outrage \nhighlights.\n  It is a ``witch hunt,'' said the far-right Heartland Institute, \n``what fascists do.'' We are ``ethically challenged . . . mental \nmidgets,'' said Heartland's president. He later called this little \nletter ``harassment . . . abuse of authority and misrepresentation of \nthe facts.'' Heartland, by the way, is that classy group that put up a \nbillboard comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber, just to give \nan idea of their credibility. Finally, ``[S]hame on you,'' read \nHeartland's response to our letter, which Heartland called a ``campaign \nto stigmatize and demonize.''\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\n  The rightwing John Locke Foundation said our letter was ``trying to \nMcCarthyite'' them. Rightwinger Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage \nFoundation said it was ``an abuse of power.'' Investor's Business Daily \ngot so excited they mixed up their metaphors to say we were both \n``inquisitors'' and ``stalk[ers],'' out to ``intimidate'' and \n``threatening peaceful citizens.'' They scoffed, ``as if it were any of \n[our] business'' to know if polluters are funding the science. Keeping \nthat Spanish Inquisition theme going, the Washington Times called us \n``climate change Torquemadas.''\n  So it looks as if we hit the full faux-outrage quadrifecta--witch \nhunts, fascism, McCarthyism, and even the Spanish Inquisition. But then \nthey got really serious, and they unlimbered the ultimate rightwing \nmalediction. We were accused by the Cato Institute of--cover your ears, \nyoung pages--having ``a widespread faith . . . in government's ability \nto solve problems.''\n  Well, Cato made its position on climate change clear, saying that for \nus ``to believe that man's emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the \nplanet'' was a ``bias'' and that the legitimate science endorsed by \neveryone from NASA to the Department of Defense to every legitimate \nscientific society--every major legitimate scientific society in the \ncountry--all of that was ``propaganda,'' and that we, of course, were \nclimate alarmists. Cato also sent us a letter in response to our \ninquiry, telling us we cannot ``use the awesome power of the federal \ngovernment to cow'' Cato and others. Cow?\n  According to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which sadly has \nbecome a front for the fossil fuel industry, we were ``trying to \nsilence'' the other side. Although, I have to confess, it is not clear \nhow the other side would be silenced by simply having to reveal whose \npayroll they are on, which is all we asked.\n  Let's be clear, our letter didn't suggest that industry scientists \nshould be silenced--just that the public should know if those \nscientists are being paid by the very industries with a big economic \nstake in the issue.\n  Let's test how much the rightwing front groups care about the \nsuppression of scientific information. Let's look at their outrage over \nthe reports of public employees in Florida being told--by the \ngovernment no less--not to talk about climate change.\n  Interviews by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting with \ncurrent and former employees, contractors, and volunteers at the \nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection revealed that the \nadministration of Republican Gov. Rick Scott issued an unwritten rule \nbanning official use of the phrases ``climate change'' or ``global \nwarming.'' Those reports have been corroborated by employees of other \nState agencies. We have heard stories of retribution against State \nemployees who dare discuss climate change, of climate change-related \nprojects being put on the back burner, and even of the term itself \nbeing edited out of official documents, including those produced by a \nuniversity scientist. It sounds like suppression of science. Where was \nthe outrage from the right? Where were the comparisons to fascism and \nMcCarthyism and the Spanish Inquisition for this actual government-\nsponsored suppression of scientific information? Guess what. There was \nnone.\n  It is not just Florida. Recently, the Republican members of \nWisconsin's Board of Commissioners of Public Lands voted to prohibit \nthe professional staff ``from engaging in global warming or climate \nchange work.'' The Wisconsin timber industry, as Senator Baldwin and I \nhave both pointed out, sees the threat climate change poses to \nWisconsin forests, including, among other things, the frozen winter \nroads that loggers use to move their equipment around that warmer \nweather melts and turns to impassable muck. But the Republicans in \ncharge of those lands have simply ordered State officials to ignore \nclimate change, suppressing the science--plain and simple.\n  Where was the outrage from the rightwing groups that had fits about \nour little request for some transparency about what scientist is on \nwhose payroll? Where was the outrage? There was none, which shows that \nthe real issue has nothing to do with scientific freedom. The real \nissue here of freedom is the freedom of big, dishonest special \ninterests to hide whose hand is in the puppet.\n  Here is where it really gets ironic. The enormous multibillion dollar \npolluting industries whose front groups accuse us of bullying--of being \nfascists and intimidators and Torquemadas--over our little letter are \nthe very ones pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into elections, \nmuch of it secretly, for the plainly avowed purpose of threatening and \npunishing elected officials who might dare to cross them and \nacknowledge the dangers of carbon-driven climate change--of all people \nto be complaining.\n  Americans for Prosperity, to give one example, a Koch brothers \nventure, has said that Republicans who support any action on climate \nchange will be put at a ``severe disadvantage'' in the 2016 elections. \nThat is a serious threat, given the Koch brothers' pledge to spend $900 \nmillion in this election cycle. Yet that same Americans for Prosperity \nFoundation blasted our little letter as ``an attempt to silence those \nwhose views do not meet with your approval.''\n  Please. Really? Against a $900 million campaign threat and a stable \nof paid-for scientists, against that massive screen of fossil fuel \nfront organizations spouting industry propaganda, our little effort at \ngetting a little transparency about who is funding the phony-baloney \nclimate denial science--that is a raindrop against a torrent. We do \nindeed need to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my prepared comments, I do want \nto thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his passion and his \nleadership in coming to the floor over and over again, ringing the \nalarm bells about what is happening not only to our country but our \nworld. We are paying the price in lives and in dollars. We are seeing \nour farmers pay the price because we have not effectively addressed \nwhat is happening to our world in terms of climate change.\n  I want to thank the Senator for his continued passion in reminding us \nover and over again why we need to act right now.\n\n\n                Selfridge Air National Guard Deployment\n\n  Mr. President, today 350 airmen from Michigan, along with 12 A-10 \nWarthog aircraft, are deploying to the Middle East to take part in \nOperation Inherent Resolve, our Nation's mission to eliminate the \nterrorist group known as ISIL. This deployment has special significance \nfor Michigan. Michigan is home to thousands of families and community \nleaders with loved ones living in the Middle East who have seen \nfirsthand the devastating effect of ISIL as it brutally murders \ninnocent people, drives them from their homes, and destabilizes the \nregion. For so many families in Michigan, the fight against ISIL is \ndeeply personal. Today, that fight is personal to many more families as \nthese airmen from Selfridge Air National Guard Base deploy to the \nregion.\n  The A-10 Warthogs are the very best close air support aircraft in the \nU.S. military. Known as a tankbuster, the A-10 is ideal against ISIL, \nwhich uses tanks stolen from the Iraqi Army. We in Michigan are proud \nof our fleet. We are proud of our people, their courage, their passion, \nand their hard work. We are proud for all they have done to protect our \nNation.\n  In 2011, the 127th Wing at Selfridge deployed 300 airmen and one \ndozen A-10s to Kandahar Airfield, a NATO base in southern Afghanistan. \nOver 120 days, the unit logged over 8,000 flight hours in 2,000 flight \nmissions in an extremely hostile environment.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep these 350 airmen in \nyour thoughts and prayers. We wish them Godspeed as they embark on this \nvery important mission, and we remember especially their families and \nfriends who will stay behind and support them with their prayers as \nwell.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of S. 178 on Wednesday, April 22, Senator \nCornyn or his designee be recognized to withdraw the pending Cornyn \namendment and offer amendments Nos. 1124 and 301. I further ask that \nthere then be 1 hour of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and \nthat following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the \nLeahy amendment No. 301, followed by a vote on amendment No. 1124, both \nwith a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption. I further ask that \nif the Cornyn-Murray-Klobuchar amendment is agreed to, the time until 2 \np.m. be equally divided in the usual form, and the Senate then vote on \nthe following amendments in the order listed, with 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided before each vote: Cornyn No. 1127; Leahy No. 290; Brown \nNo. 311; Burr No. 1121; and Kirk No. 273, as modified.\n  I further ask that amendments in the preceding list each be subject \nto a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption, and that following \ndisposition of these amendments, there then be 5 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form, followed by votes on the following \namendments, which have been cleared by the managers and should be \nadopted by voice vote: Klobuchar No. 296; Hoeven No. 299, as modified; \nSullivan No. 279; Wicker No. 1126; Flake No. 294; Cassidy No. 308; \nPortman No. 1128; Brown No. 310; Brown No. 312; Heller No. 1122; and \nShaheen No. 303.\n  I further ask that there be no second-degrees in order to any of the \namendments listed and that following disposition of the Shaheen \namendment, the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would the \nmajority leader consider at this time modifying his request to drop the \nKirk amendment No. 273?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I understand, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon is asking to amend the consent request. I would reserve the \nright to object to that request and make the simple point that the Kirk \namendment targets online child exploitation and sex trafficking, which \nis rampant. Given the fact that the Internet is now one of the \nprincipal tools used, on Web sites such as backpage.com, thousands of \nAmerican children and human trafficking victims are sold into slavery. \nIt is simply unconscionable for us to stand by and allow this to \ncontinue.\n  What Senator Kirk is asking for, which I support and believe we \nshould do, is a simple up-or-down vote on the Kirk amendment. So I \nreserve the right to object and ask our colleague to allow this up-or-\ndown vote on the Kirk amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the answer is no, but I think the \nSenator from Oregon wishes to respond.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, continuing my reservation, I don't take a \nbackseat to anyone when it comes to fighting for the victims of sex \ntrafficking. As the distinguished Senator from Texas knows, I was an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation, and much of it is based on \nbills I have written and advocated on behalf of for years, including \nwith the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Much of this sex trafficking legislation, colleagues, is based on \nmeetings and discussions I have had for years with young women who have \nbeen trafficked, law enforcement officials, and community leaders. I \nremember like it was yesterday how I was with the Portland police on \n82nd Avenue in East Portland, and we encountered young women in their \nearly teens who walked around with knives in their purses just hoping \nto survive the evening. The underlying legislation before us, in my \nview, is going to be a very valuable tool in helping women like those \nwhom I saw in Southeast Portland.\n\n  Unfortunately, an amendment that Senator Kirk seeks to offer has been \nattached to this request that undermines the legal foundation of every \nsocial media platform and attacks a basic cornerstone of Internet law. \nThe Kirk amendment will undermine the fight to help victims by \ndistracting the focus of prosecutors from the pimps and the Johns who \nprey on these young women.\n  The vague language in the Kirk amendment would mean any Web site that \nhosts user-generated contact--that means any social media platform, any \nnews sites with comments and classified sections and any e-commerce \nsites--could face felony charges based on a vague concept of knowing \nand a vague concept of advertising.\n  Instead of focusing resources on going after pimps and traffickers, \nthe Kirk amendment would enable prosecutors to go after Web sites \nmillions of Americans use for nonnefarious purposes, chilling \ninnovation. Under current law, prosecutors already have the ability to \ngo after any entity that knowingly profits from sex trafficking. Every \nminute our prosecutors are occupied going after legitimate businesses, \nin my view, is time not spent locking up the real criminals.\n  This amendment hurts America's innovative businesses and \nentrepreneurs and stifles free speech instead of getting tough on the \nsex traffickers whom Senator Cornyn and I have sought to target all \nthese years.\n  So I will close by simply saying I am for throwing the book at every \nsex trafficker and those who enable them. Our country absolutely must \ndo everything we can to prevent the next child from falling victim to \nthese predators. In my view, the Kirk amendment distracts from that \ngoal. I hope it will not ultimately be added to this important piece of \nlegislation. I hope Senators will vote no on the Kirk amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2295-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         NOMINATION OF LORETTA E.

BANGERTER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a loving \nfather,\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\na visionary leader, a committed public servant, and a cherished \nfriend--former Utah Governor Norman ``Norm'' Howard Bangerter. As \nUtah's 13th Governor, Norm established himself as one of the strongest \nleaders to ever hold public office in our State.\n  Norm's roots were deeply entrenched in the west side of the Salt Lake \nValley, and he often referred to himself as a ``humble farmer and \ncarpenter'' who learned the value of hard work from a young age. His \nparents, William and Isabelle Bangerter, instilled in their 11 children \na strong moral compass and a desire to help others--virtues he carried \nwith him throughout his life.\n  Norm first entered politics in 1974 when he ran for the Utah House of \nRepresentatives. He gained a surprise victory, which put him on a path \nof strong representation and leadership for his constituents. Norm \nserved 10 years as a State representative, including 4 years as the \nspeaker of the house.\n  During Norm's first term as Governor, Utah faced formidable \nchallenges. Never one to shrink from duty, Norm confronted these \nchallenges head-on, exhibiting the exceptional judgment and foresight \nthat would distinguish him as our State's chief executive. In making \nthese difficult decisions, Governor Bangerter always sought to do what \nwas right over what was politically expedient. He laid a strong \nframework for his governance, which included ``the three e's''--\neducation, economic development, and efficiency in government. Later in \nhis tenure, he added a fourth ``e''--the environment.\n  After Governor Bangerter won reelection in 1988, the difficult \ndecisions of his first term began to bear fruit. Utah had raised its \nprofile as a fiscally well-managed State, and the success of the \nGovernor's economic development projects encouraged several prominent \ncompanies to relocate or expand in Utah. The Bangerter administration \ncut budgets, created jobs, expanded the economy, and provided a \nfoundation for fiscal responsibility that still exists today.\n  Although public service was important to Norm, his family was always \nparamount. In 1953, he married Colleen Monson, who was his loyal friend \nand constant companion through nearly 58 years of marriage until she \npassed away in 2011. Together they raised 7 children and were \ngrandparents to 30 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren. In 2012, \nNorm married Judy Schiffman, who was a dear friend and support to Norm \nand his family. His daily life was always spent with family by his \nside. Family time was sacred and essential to Norm, and he firmly \nbelieved that family was the most important component of life.\n  Norm not only served willingly in the public arena, he also served \ndiligently in his church, assuming several important leadership \npositions in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served \nfor 18 years as a bishop and as a stake president, and later presided \nwith his wife, Colleen, over the Johannesburg, South Africa Mission \nfrom 1996 to 1999. After his missionary service, Norm spent many hours \neach week volunteering in the LDS Church's Jordan River Temple. His \nlife was an example of compassion and service, modeled after our \nSavior, Jesus Christ.\n  Throughout my years of public service, I have had the privilege of \nknowing, working with, and learning from Governor Norm Bangerter. We \nspoke often, and I could always count on him to share with me his no-\nnonsense wisdom and his passionate advice. Our conversations were \nalways spirited, and they played an indispensable role in my own public \nservice. He fought for what he believed in with great determination and \nfervor, and he was never afraid to express his opinions. I appreciated \nour conversations more than he probably knew, and I will miss his sage \nadvice and loyal friendship.\n  Elaine and I will greatly miss our dear friend, Governor Norm \nBangerter. The impact he made on Utah cannot be overstated. He led \nduring difficult times and was a steadfast anchor for our State. He was \nalso a noble servant of our Heavenly Father, and a strong, loving \nhusband, father, and grandfather to his cherished family. He left an \nindelible impression on me and on all those who had the privilege of \nknowing him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2296-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2296-S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague Senator Ron \nWyden in introducing the Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, Enhancement \nAct of 2015. This legislation would reauthorize trade adjustment \nassistance programs to help American workers who lose their jobs as a \nresult of foreign competition. These programs are an investment in the \nAmerican worker and are essential to helping those who are negatively \naffected by international trade to get the skills and training to \nprepare for jobs in other industries.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Enhancement Act of 2015 would cover \naffected workers in the manufacturing, service, and agricultural \nsectors. In addition to covering workers whose jobs shift to countries \nwith which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, the bill would \nalso extend to job losses from non-FTA countries, such as China or \nIndia. It would make eligible for assistance those who have been laid \noff due to unfair foreign subsidies or dumping practices, as long as \nthe layoff occurs within 1 year of an affirmative injury determination \nby the International Trade Commission.\n  Our bill would also authorize an investment of up to $575 million per \nyear to train workers in new, in-demand skills, thereby providing them \nwith the opportunity to find lasting employment that will ensure \ngreater economic stability in years to come. It would also provide \nextended unemployment insurance for those enrolled in an approved \ntraining program. For older workers seeking quick reemployment, our \nbill would provide wage insurance to cover up to 50 percent of the wage \ndifferential between the old job and the new job. It would also provide \nassistance to those who must commute a greater distance or relocate \naltogether to find new employment.\n  Under our bill, farmers, fishermen, and aquaculture producers would \nalso be eligible for targeted training and assistance programs designed \nto help increase their competitiveness. The bill would further clarify \nthat fishermen and aquaculture producers may receive TAA benefits \nwhether they are competing against farmed or wild-caught fish or \nseafood imports.\n  Small, rural communities in my home State of Maine have been hit hard \nby closures or partial shutdowns of mills, manufacturing plants, or \nother businesses that, in many cases, represent a large portion of jobs \nin the surrounding communities. In the past year, the communities of \nLincoln, Millinocket, and Bucksport have experienced such devastating \njob losses. Moreover, the second and third-order economic effects on \nother businesses is significant. When these jobs are abruptly lost on \nsuch a massive scale, entire communities and the surrounding area are \ndevastated. In times of such great upheaval, the laid off employees, \nwho lost their good jobs through no fault of their own, need the time, \nsupport, and resources to learn new skills and seek viable employment \nopportunities.\n  TAA programs have made a tremendous difference in the lives of those \nworking in trade-affected industries in Maine, such as the pulp and \npaper manufacturing, lobster, and blueberry industries. In fiscal year \n2013, more than 700 Mainers benefitted from these programs, which led \nto an employment retention rate of more than 90 percent. In the last \nyear alone, the Department of Labor approved TAA benefits for the \nhundreds of workers who lost their jobs with the closures of the Verso \nPaper mill in Bucksport, the Lincoln Paper and Tissue mill in Lincoln, \nthe Great Northern Paper mill in East Millinocket, and the UTC Fire and \nSecurity plant in Pittsfield. Previously, TAA benefited former \nemployees of the Great Northern Paper mill in Millinocket when it \nclosed, in addition to lobstermen and wild blueberry producers who \nneeded help increasing the competitiveness of their unique commodities. \nRecently, I had the opportunity to visit Eastern Maine Community \nCollege and tour its Fine Woodworking and Cabinet Making Shop. I met \nwith a group of students formerly employed at the Bucksport Verso Paper \nmill, who now have the opportunity to learn a new skill because of the \nfunds available through TAA.\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\n  TAA has been vitally important in helping Maine workers, and those \nacross the Nation, who have been harmed by trade get the skills and \ntraining they need to prepare for jobs in other industries. \nReauthorization of trade adjustment assistance programs must be a part \nof the national trade policy debate, and I am pleased that the Senate \nrecognized the importance of TAA by approving the bipartisan amendment \nthat I authored to the Budget Resolution related to reauthorizing TAA. \nI urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Enhancement Act of 2015 to continue crucial investments in \nthe American worker and protect them from unfair trade practices and \nincreased imports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2297-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  VOLUNTEER INCOME TAX ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I support the Volunteer Income Tax \nAssistance Act. Each year, tax payers across the country utilize \naccountants, tax software, and lawyers as they prepare their returns. \nFor millions of low-income families, high-cost, high-tech tax \nassistance is not an option. As a result, the families most in need of \ntax preparation assistance--low- and moderate-income families, \nincluding elderly and disabled taxpayers--will fail to file their taxes \nor miss out on valuable tax credits.\n  The IRS created the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, VITA program in \n1969 to assist individuals and families in submitting their Federal tax \nreturns. For decades, this program operated predominantly with the \nresources and facilities of community partners. In 2007, Congress \ncreated a demonstration program awarding matching grants to VITA sites \nto serve additional low-income individuals and families. Since 2008, \nthe VITA grant program has grown to over 200 grant recipients but is \nstill only able to fund about two-thirds of grant applicants.\n  During the 2014 Federal income tax filing season, VITA programs filed \napproximately 1.7 million tax returns. Of those 1.7 million returns, \nmore than 551,000 claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit as part of \nnearly $2.5 billion in tax refunds that went to VITA tax filers. In \naddition, VITA programs improve accuracy in the return process and \nreduce IRS costs by e-filing. In 2014, VITA program tax returns were e-\nfiled 96 percent of the time, compared to 86 percent for the rest of \nthe population.\n  Funding for the VITA program remains insufficient to meet demand and \nhas not been made permanent. The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Act \nwould ensure that volunteers and nonprofits across the country can \ncontinue to provide essential tax preparation services each spring by \ncreating a permanent matching grant program for VITA sites. The act \nwould also build on the success of the VITA program by creating a \nNational Center to Promote Quality, Excellence, and Evaluation in \nVolunteer Income Tax Assistance. Through the center, VITA's many sites \nwould have a mechanism to share best practices and create a more \nefficient and sustainable program to serve a large number of low- and \nmiddle-income families.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting working families by \ncosponsoring the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2297-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING SANOFI'S PENNSYLVANIA EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the contributions to \nglobal public health by the Pennsylvania employees of Sanofi. \nYesterday, at the White House, they were presented with the U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office's Patent for Humanity award, in recognition of the \ndevelopment of a patented chemical and industrial process for producing \nsemi-synthetic artemisinin, which is used in the creation of \ncombination therapies, ACTs, treating malaria.\n  Malaria is one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world, \nwith 200 million cases in almost 100 countries. In 2013, an estimated \n584,000 people died from malaria. This parasitic infection most \nsignificantly burdens countries with the highest rates of poverty. In \nAfrica, where 90 percent of all malaria cases occur, one child dies \nevery minute from the condition.\n  Artemisinin is an important antimalarial drug derived from the sweet \nwormwood plant in Asia and Africa, but weather and other factors can \nyield an uncertain supply of natural artemisinin, threatening patients' \naccess. Thus, developing semi-synthetic artemisinin will enable a \nstable supply of high-quality medication at affordable prices on a no-\nprofit, no-loss model, lead to a stronger supply chain, and place more \nACTs in the hands of the most vulnerable patients. Sanofi hopes to \nproduce annually an average of 50 to 60 tons of artemisinin, which will \nproduce 80 to 150 million ACT treatments.\n  This project to produce semi-synthetic artemisinin began in 2007, and \ninvolves a partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the \nUniversity of California Berkeley, the global health charity PATH, \nSanofi, and Amirys. I would like to commend in particular Alain Werner, \nRobert Sebbag, and Philippe Charreau of Sanofi who led the \norganization's work on this important project. Sanofi's achievement is \nonly one example of a rich history of dedicating its resources to \ncombat the world's most deadly diseases. Their work on malaria dates \nback to the 1930s. More recently, Sanofi, which has 112,000 employees \nand retains core strengths in human vaccines, animal health, consumer \nhealthcare, diabetes, and rare diseases, created its Access to \nMedicines program to improve access to healthcare in the poorest \ncountries.\n  As the Senate continues to work on legislation to speed the \ndevelopment of therapies, I ask my colleagues keep in mind the \nimportant incentives and intellectual property protections that \nencourage scientists, such as those responsible for this breakthrough, \nto create lifesaving medicines for patients worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2297-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2297-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2297-S2298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nPROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED \nSTATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \n           CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY--PM 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \npapers; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to subsections 123 \nb. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Agreement for \nCooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China Concerning Peaceful \nUses of Nuclear Energy (the ``Agreement''). I am also pleased to \ntransmit my written approval, authorization, and determination \nconcerning the Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement. (In accordance \nwith section 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), two \nclassified annexes to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing \nrelevant classified information, will be submitted to the Congress \nseparately.)

In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with China based on a mutual commitment to \nnuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of material, \nequipment (including reactors), components, information, and technology \nfor nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does not permit \ntransfers of any Restricted Data. Transfers of sensitive nuclear \ntechnology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical components \nof such facilities may only occur if the Agreement is amended to cover \nsuch transfers. In the event of termination, key nonproliferation \nconditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, \nand components subject to the Agreement.\n  The proposed Agreement would obligate the United States and China to \nwork together to enhance their efforts to familiarize commercial \nentities in their respective countries about the requirements of the \nAgreement as well as national export controls and policies applicable \nto exports and imports subject to the Agreement. It would have a term \nof 30 years from the date of its entry into force. Either party may \nterminate the proposed Agreement on at least 1 year's written notice to \nthe other party.\n  Since the 1980s, China has become a party to several nonproliferation \ntreaties and conventions and worked to bring its domestic export \ncontrol authorities in line with international standards. China joined \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1992 as a \nnuclear weapon state, brought into force an Additional Protocol to its \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement in 2002, and \njoined the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004. China is a party to the \nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which \nestablishes international standards of physical protection for use, \nstorage, and transport of nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 \nAmendment to the Convention. A more detailed discussion of China's \ncivil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and \npractices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is \nprovided in the NPAS and in two classified annexes to the NPAS \nsubmitted to you separately. As noted above, the Director of National \nIntelligence will provide an addendum to the NPAS containing a \ncomprehensive analysis of the export control system of China with \nrespect to nuclear-related matters.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \ndepartments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have \ndetermined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute \nan unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, \nI have approved the proposed Agreement and authorized its execution and \nurge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nbegin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session \nreview provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous \nsession review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 21, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2298-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 1035.

A bill to require notification of information security \nbreaches and to enhance penalties for cyber criminals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two bipartisan \nbills that would help to modernize the way this country approaches \ncyber security.\n  Congress needs to get with the times and realize that the Internet is \nno longer a new concept. Swiping a credit card, conducting online \nbanking, storing prescription records online--these are not new \nactivities. The cloud is no longer new. Hackers are no longer new. So \nwhy are we still so taken aback, in shock, every time we suffer another \nmajor cyber attack? Why are we still not requiring that consumers be \nnotified when their information has been stolen? Why aren't we \nunleashing law enforcement to go after cyber criminals?\n  If we want to defend against 21st-century threats, then we have to \nbring our laws into the 21st century. We have to get out of the mindset \nthat the only way we can be hurt is from an actual physical attack. \nHackers don't operate on battlefields; they operate in basements and in \ncubicles.\n  Our approach to cyber security so far has been certifiably wrong. We \nhave the largest defense budget in the world by far, but that hasn't \nstopped our hospitals and banks from falling victim to a near constant \nbarrage of attacks. Last year, data breaches in this country hit a \nrecord high; they were up more than 27 percent from the year before. In \nNew York State, between 2006 and 2013, we had nearly 5,000 individual \ndata breaches that were reported by businesses, not-for-profits, and \ngovernment entities. In the same period, 23 million personal records of \nNew Yorkers were exposed to criminals. And that is just my home State. \nImagine how big that number actually is nationwide.\n  We are long overdue for a new national approach to cyber security, \nand I am introducing two bills that would finally make this happen. The \nfirst is the Data Breach Notification and Punishing Cyber Criminals \nAct. It would set, for the first time, a national standard for how and \nwhen victims of cyber attacks will be informed. When an attack takes \nplace on a business, for example, one that has your financial data or \nmedical information, this law would require that you be informed \nquickly, with information about what was targeted, what was taken, and \nwhether you were personally affected. This bill would seriously \nincrease the penalties on people found guilty of hacking and cyber \ncrime. It would raise the allowable fines and imprisonment sentences \nfor many of the most common cyber crimes, including identity theft and \ntheft of personal information.\n  The second bill is the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Credit Act--\na bill that would incentivize America's businesses to share cyber \nsecurity information critical to preventing attacks, without having to \ninvolve their competitors. Instead, businesses would be encouraged, \nwith significant tax credits, to adopt the preferred, most efficient \nmethod for information sharing; that is, membership in private, sector-\nspecific cyber security networks designed to protect an industry, such \nas health care and hospitals, from attack. At the individual level, \ncompanies, hospitals, and banks can only do so much to protect us. Any \ngood cyber defense has to involve information sharing so that patterns \ncan be recognized, industries can bolster their defenses, and the same \nhacks aren't just repeated over and over again.\n  To modernize America's approach to cyber security, we as individuals \nhave to take action, companies have to take action, law enforcement has \nto take action, and local governments must take action. Most \nimportantly and most urgently, Congress has to take action. We \ndesperately need to modernize our cyber security laws. I urge my \ncolleagues to support these two bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Paul):\n  S. 1030. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for \nclarification as to the meaning of access without authorization, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Aaron's Law \nAct of 2015 to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a sweeping \nanti-hacking law that criminalizes many forms of common Internet and \ncomputer use. This overly broad law currently allows breathtaking \nlevels of prosecutorial discretion that invites serious overuse and \nabuse.\n  Together with Senator Rand Paul, and my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, we introduce legislation to fix the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act which is long overdue for reform. Aaron's Law would curb the \nabuses of this outdated law while still preserving the tools needed to \nprosecute malicious attacks.\n  Our bill, inspired by the late Internet innovator and activist Aaron \nSwartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison for an act of civil \ndisobedience, would reform the quarter-century-old law to better \nreflect computer and Internet activities in the digital age. Numerous \nand recent instances of heavy-handed prosecutions for non-malicious \ncomputer crimes have raised serious questions as to how the law treats \nviolations of terms of service, employer agreement or website notices.\n  Aaron's Law is smart legislation that keeps up with the constant \nevolution of the Internet, and honors the late Aaron Swartz.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the use of E-Verify, to hold employers \naccountable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1986, Congress made it unlawful for \nemployers to knowingly hire or employ individuals who are not eligible \nto work in the United States. Identity theft and counterfeit documents \nhave made a mockery of this law.\n  Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee \nreasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its \nobligation to review the worker's documents. This is why Congress \ncreated a pilot program, known as the Basic Pilot program, to help \nemployers verify the work eligibility of its new hires.\n  This program has allowed employers to check records maintained by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. \nIt was successful, and in 2003, Congress made the program available in \nall 50 States.\n  Now known as E-Verify, this nationwide program is free for employers \nand accessible via the internet. This program has been a valuable tool \nfor those who want to hire a legal workforce. Employers like it. In \nfact, according to Westat, a private statistical survey research \ncorporation that conducted a survey last year, 97 percent of employers \nfound E-Verify user-friendly, and 92 percent said the program was \neffective. Employers also reported that ``E-Verify takes the guess work \nout of determining the validity of documents, provides immediate \nresults, offers reassurance that the company is not hiring unauthorized \nworkers, and helps them to show a good faith effort to comply with the \nlaw.''\n  So, today, along with several colleagues, I am introducing \nlegislation to permanently authorize and expand the E-Verify program. \nMy bill, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act, will \nensure that employers can rely on this program while holding them \naccountable for their hiring practices.\n  My bill would make E-Verify a staple in every workplace. It would \npave the way to modify and simplify the I-9 process required today. It \nwould increase penalties on employers who hire people unauthorized to \nwork in the country. Employers would be required to check the status of \ncurrent employees within three years, and would allow employers to run \na check prior to offering a job, saving that employer valuable time and \nresources. Employers will also be required to re-check those workers \nwhose authorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the \nUnited States on temporary visas.\n  As Congress considers the reauthorization of E-Verify this year, I \nhope my bill will be a starting point for discussion. We need to \nenhance and expand the program so that our immigration laws are being \nupheld. I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in making E-\nVerify a permanent part of our immigration laws.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 1035.

Res. 142\n\n       Whereas May 27, 2007, marked the centennial of the birth of \n     Rachel Carson, a longtime Maryland resident, a noted author, \n     and an environmental visionary;\n       Whereas Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, in \n     Springdale, of western Pennsylvania, where she learned to \n     love nature while exploring the Allegheny River with her \n     family and friends;\n       Whereas Rachel Carson graduated magna cum laude from \n     Pennsylvania College for Women (now known as ``Chatham \n     University'') in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1928, and went \n     on to earn her master's degree in zoology from The Johns \n     Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1932;\n       Whereas Rachel Carson abandoned her pursuit of a doctorate \n     degree in 1935 when her father died so that she could provide \n     financial support for her aging mother by taking part-time \n     teaching positions at The Johns Hopkins University and the \n     University of Maryland as well as a position as a writer for \n     the United States Bureau of Fisheries (now known as the \n     ``United States Fish and Wildlife Service'');\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\n       Whereas Rachel Carson continued her writing career with \n     feature columns in the Baltimore Sun on the marine life of \n     the Chesapeake Bay until she was employed full-time in the \n     Federal Government where she rose to become the editor-in-\n     chief for all Fish and Wildlife Service publications;\n       Whereas Rachel Carson's first book, ``Under the Sea-Wind'', \n     published in 1941, gave readers across the country a chance \n     to enjoy her poetic style and her careful use of scientific \n     information for the first time;\n       Whereas Rachel Carson's second book, ``The Sea Around Us'', \n     earned the 1952 National Book Award and allowed her to fully \n     devote her time to her writing career;\n       Whereas Rachel Carson's guide to seashore life, ``The Edge \n     of the Sea'', was published in 1955 and became another best \n     seller;\n       Whereas in 1962, while a resident of Silver Spring, \n     Maryland, Rachel Carson wrote ``Silent Spring'', a book that \n     detailed how synthetic chemicals accumulate in water, soils, \n     fish, and animals, including birds;\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy convened an expert panel \n     of scientists that confirmed Rachel Carson's scientific \n     findings, leading to the domestic ban on the sale of the \n     chemical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (commonly known as \n     ``DDT'') in 1972, an action that many individuals credit with \n     saving the bald eagle from extinction;\n       Whereas in 2015, there are more bald eagles in the \n     Chesapeake Bay Watershed than there were in the entire lower \n     48 States in 1972; and\n       Whereas Rachel Carson passed away on April 14, 1964, at her \n     home in Silver Spring, Maryland, leaving behind a history of \n     tireless advocacy on behalf of the natural world, a legacy of \n     scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility, and a book \n     that helped launch the modern environmental movement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the life of Rachel Carson, \n     a scientist, writer, and pioneer of the environmental \n     movement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/21/senate-section/article/S2306-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 143--SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE \n                  ACCESS TO DEBT-FREE HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Warren, Mr. Reed of Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Murphy) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions:\n\n                              S.
