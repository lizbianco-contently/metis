Mr. President, both parties have long agreed that No \nChild Left Behind is broken and needs to be fixed. The House of \nRepresentatives passed reformist replacements for this law over the \npast few Congresses, but the Senate didn't consider legislation on the \nfloor for years--until now.\n  A new majority in Congress thought it was time to finally change that \ndynamic. So we have demonstrated how a functioning committee process \nand a functioning Senate could help break through the gridlock. We \nshowed how it could lead to important work across the aisle from a \nRepublican like Senator Alexander and a Democrat like Senator Murray, \nand in so doing, we not only proved that conservative reform was \npossible, we proved that it could pass by big bipartisan margins.\n  The version of the Every Student Succeeds Act the Senate considered \nthis summer passed 81 to 17. The Every Student Succeeds Act before us \njust passed the House 359 to 64, and soon we will have the opportunity \nto send it to the President for his signature.\n  The Wall Street Journal dubbed this bill ``the largest devolution of \nfederal control to the States in a quarter-century.'' It will stop \nWashington from imposing Common Core. It will strengthen the charter \nschool program. It will substitute one-size-fits-all Federal mandates \nfor greater State and local flexibility. In short, the Every Student \nSucceeds Act will put education back in the hands of those who know our \nkids best: parents, teachers, States, and school boards. It will help \nstudents succeed instead of helping Washington grow. That is something \nall of us can get behind because all of us represent different States \nwith different children who have different needs.\n  I know Kentucky's newly appointed education commissioner is \nenthusiastic about this landmark reform. He wrote me to say that this \nbill would be good for Kentucky because it would do things such as \nensure more flexibility, support rural schools, and help the \nCommonwealth provide for teacher development.\n  I thank the senior Senators from Tennessee and Washington for all \ntheir hard work on this bill. Some may have questioned whether \nWashington could ever agree on a replacement for No Child Left Behind, \nbut today we have the Every Student Succeeds Act before us. It is a \ngood replacement. It is a conservative reform with significant \nbipartisan support and one that will do right by those who matter most \nin the discussion: our children and our future.\n  Just days after the President signed an important bipartisan highway \nbill we passed, we soon expect to send him an important bipartisan \neducation bill to sign as well. We might even pass it as soon as today. \nPassing either of these bipartisan bills after years of inaction would \nhave represented a very big win for our country. What is more, it is \nnotable that both could now be signed into law within such a short \ntimeframe.\n  Passage of these bills follows Senate passage of many other \nachievements for the American people too, on issues ranging from cyber \nsecurity, to trade, to energy, to entitlement reform, even combatting \nmodern-day slavery.\n  Sometimes it was assumed that Washington could never come to an \nagreement on certain issues, but not only did we pass some long-stalled \npriorities for America, we often did so on a bipartisan basis. The \nquestion is, How do you achieve passage of important bills? One way is \nto foster an atmosphere where both parties can have more of a say on \nmore issues, starting at the committee level. Let me give an example. \nConsider what the American people saw in the debate over the Education \nbill. They saw Senators they sent to Washington having their voices \nheard again, regardless of party. They saw them making meaningful \ncontributions in committee. They saw them working across the aisle. \nThey saw them having more opportunities to offer amendments. The \nAmerican people actually saw the Senate take more\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\namendment rollcall votes on this single bill than the Senate took all \nof last year on all bills combined.\n  This is what Senator Murray, a Democrat, said when the Senate first \npassed this bill in July: ``I am very proud of the bipartisan work we \nhave done on the Senate floor--debating amendments, taking votes, and \nmaking this good bill even better.'' I know her Republican counterpart, \nSenator Alexander, feels exactly the same way, just like Senator \nInhofe, a Republican, agrees with Senator Boxer, a Democrat, when she \nrefers to the highway bill as ``a major accomplishment.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8446-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, Donald Trump is standing on the platform of \nhate--I am sorry to say hate that the Republican Party has built for \nhim.\n  It was just last week that I came to the floor of the Senate and said \nthe Republican Party is running on a platform of hate. Yesterday Donald \nTrump provided the strongest evidence yet that it is true. Trump's \nproposal to bar Muslims from entering this country is hateful, \ndespicable, and really vile. We are a country founded on religious \nliberty, not a country that imposes religious tests. Trump's statement \nis a slap in the face to the millions of peace-loving Muslims living \nhere and to those who want to travel and live here. We welcome them \nall, and to them I say: Donald Trump is not America.\n  Sadly, however, Donald Trump has become the Republican Party, because \nit is just not him--many of the leading candidates for the Republican \nnomination have said the same hateful things, especially about Muslims. \nJeb Bush and Ted Cruz proposed religious tests for refugees. You can't \ncondemn Trump when you want to impose a religious test on women and \nchildren fleeing death and persecution. Ben Carson has called Muslims \n``rabid dogs.'' Chris Christie said they should be tracked.\n  Today, Donald Trump offered the only true statement he has made for \nsome time, referring to some of his fellow Republicans, those running \nagainst him for President. He said:\n\n       They have been condemning almost everything I say and then \n     they come to my side.\n\n  That is disturbing, but it is true. Republican candidates condemn \nTrump's remarks and then adopt his racist policies as their own.\n  We shouldn't try to fool ourselves: This sort of racism has been \nprevalent in Republican politics for decades. Trump is just saying out \nloud what other Republicans merely suggest.\n  Political leaders must condemn these hateful, un-American statements \nwith their words and their actions. Silence only empowers bigots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8446-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8446-S8447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the year draws to an end, Republicans are \ndoing high fives and celebrating as if they hit a home run when they \nhaven't even singled.\n  Republicans are seeing a distorted image of reality. All their talk \nof productivity and progress overlooks many facts and ignores their \nconstitutional duty to provide advice and consent on President Obama's \nnominations--any President's nominations. Republicans are balking at \nfulfilling their constitutional role.\n  The job of Congress is to pass laws and to confirm nominations. By \nthat measure, this Congress has been the least productive ever. The \ntotal number of bills passed and nominations confirmed this Congress is \nlower than any Congress in decades. This Republican majority has \nconfirmed fewer nominations than any Congress in decades. Because of \nRepublicans' obstruction, qualified nominees are prevented from serving \nthe American people.\n\n  Yesterday the Senate skipped over the confirmation of Judge Luis \nFelipe Restrepo and confirmed just the 11th judge this session. There \nare 18 more judicial emergencies than when the Republicans took control \nof the Senate. What is a judicial emergency? It means they have more \nwork than the judge can do. Instead of making progress in judicial \nbacklogs across the Nation, we are falling even further behind and \ncreating more emergencies. One of those judicial emergencies is Judge \nRestrepo. He is a talented Federal district judge from the State of \nPennsylvania, and he is a talented Latino nominated for the Third \nCircuit.\n  The junior Senator from Pennsylvania--who is responsible for delaying \nthis good man for more than 6 months in the committee--finally engaged \non the nomination. On Monday the junior Senator said: I am sending a \nletter to Senator McConnell requesting a vote on his confirmation. I \ndon't know why he couldn't say to the Republican leader: Will you bring \nthis up for a vote? Why the letter? Where has Senator Toomey been since \nJuly when this nomination was first reported out of the committee 5 \nmonths ago? Why has this nomination been pending for more than a year? \nI wonder if it is because election time is here. Senate Democrats have \nwaited months to confirm this good man. He should be confirmed now, \ntoday. Sadly, though, Republicans are blocking every Latino judicial \nnominee currently being considered.\n  Here is a partial list: Judge Restrepo--I already talked about him; \nArmando Bonilla, who is the first Latino ever nominated to the Court of \nFederal Claims; John Michael Vazquez, nominated to the District of New \nJersey; Dax Eric Lopez, nominated to the Northern District of Georgia, \nwho would make history as the first Hispanic appointed Federal judge in \nthat State. Georgia has a large number of Hispanics in that State.\n  Because of this obstruction, last night the Senate skipped over Judge \nRestrepo--I mentioned that earlier--leaving another judicial emergency. \nInstead, the Senate confirmed Travis Randall McDonough as district \njudge for the Eastern District of Tennessee. After confirming Judge \nMcDonough, 19 judicial nominees remain on the Executive Calendar who \nwere all voted out of committee unanimously.\n  Yesterday's confirmation marks only the 11th judicial confirmation \nthis entire Congress. At this point in 2007, Democrats worked with \nPresident Bush to confirm 36 judicial nominees--11 compared to 36. It \nis obvious why they are doing it; they hope Donald Trump will be \nelected President and Hillary Clinton will not be. Yesterday's \nconfirmation marks the 11th judicial confirmation of this Congress. If \nthe Republican Senate keeps up this pace, many of their \nrecommendations--from Tennessee, Iowa, Georgia, and many other States--\nare at risk of not being confirmed. These are Republican selections. \nThe American people are paying the price.\n  Since the Republicans took control of the Senate, the number of \njudicial emergencies around the country has more than doubled. During \nthis session of Congress, we have only confirmed one circuit judge. \nBecause of the Republicans slow-walking, the Senate is currently on \npace to confirm the lowest number of judges in a comparable session in \nhalf a century.\n  As William Gladstone said, ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' \nThat is true. More than 30,000 people across the country have been \nwaiting for more than 3 years for a resolution to their court case.\n  Judge Lawrence O'Neill, who was nominated by President George W. Bush \nto the Eastern District of California, is fed up with the staggering \ndelays in his court. Here is what he said:\n\n       Over the years I've received several letters from people \n     indicating, ``Even if I win this case now, my business has \n     failed because of the delay. How is this justice?'' And the \n     simple answer, which I cannot give them, is this: It is not \n     justice. We know it.\n\n  The judge is right. What is happening with our judiciary is damaging \nour\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\ncountry and the litigants depending on a way to get to court to go to \ntrial.\n  The Republican leader has the power to alter the destructive path \nSenate Republicans have charted. Before we leave for the holidays, the \nSenate should act to schedule votes on the dozens of judges who have \nbeen denied a vote. Where we have the judicial emergencies, the \ncriminal cases are allowed to go forward but not the civil cases, \ninvolving people's businesses. They can't have their day in court. \nThere are too few judges who have to take care of all of the criminal \ncases first. The civil cases wait--damaging to our economy and \ncertainly damaging to people's lives. Thousands of Americans waiting \nfor years deserve their day in court without further delay by \nRepublicans, which is outrageous.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Religious Freedom\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Founding Fathers took great care when \nit came to the issue of religion in our Constitution. Many of the \npeople who had come to the United States and became its earliest White \nsettlers came for religious freedom. They had witnessed discrimination. \nThey had witnessed government religion. They had witnessed the type of \nconduct which not only offended their conscience but motivated them to \ncome to this great Nation. So when the Founding Fathers sat down to \ncraft our Constitution, they made three hard-and-fast rules when it \ncame to religion in this United States of America. The first was our \nfreedom to believe as we choose or not to believe, a personal freedom \nwhen it came to religion embodied in the civil rights. The second was \nprohibition against any Government of the United States establishing a \nstate or government religion. Third, the prohibition of any litmus test \nbefore anyone could run for public office when it came to religion.\n  For over 200 years now, those fundamental principles have guided the \nUnited States and have kept us away from some of the terrible conflicts \nwhich have occurred in other nations across history when it came to the \nclash of religious belief. It is hard to imagine that in this 21st \ncentury, more than 200 years after the Constitution was written, that \nin the midst of this Presidential campaign, we would once again be \nreflecting on religion in America, but we are.\n  Statements that were made over the last several months, and \nespecially a statement made yesterday by a Republican candidate for \nPresident, have called into question again the policy and values of the \nUnited States when it comes to the practice of religion. Mr. Donald \nTrump, Republican candidate for President, has proposed excluding \npeople of the Muslim religion from the United States. He said we need \nto do that until our government figures out what to do with terrorism. \nMr. Trump's statements have been condemned, roundly condemned by most \nof the other Republican Presidential nominees, as well as former Vice \nPresident Richard Cheney. It is an indication that he has gone too far. \nI hope it is an indication that we in America will reaffirm fundamental \nvalues, when it comes to religious beliefs, that have guided this \nNation for more than two centuries. I might add, this is just the \nlatest chapter in this story.\n\n\n                                Refugees\n\n  Mr. President, it was only a few weeks ago when there was a conscious \neffort promoted by the Republican Presidential candidates to exclude \nSyrian refugees from the United States. They called it a pause. They \nsaid we needed to assess whether or not we ought to change our system \nfor refugees coming to this country, and, in so doing, they required \nthe certification by the heads of our national security agencies of \neach individual refugee before they could come to the United States.\n  Each year, the United States allows about 70,000 refugees to come to \nour shores from all across the world. They come from far-flung nations. \nThe largest contributor last year was Burma--those who were escaping \npersecution in Burma. The second largest group was those coming from \nIraq. They included, incidentally, those Iraqis who had served and \nhelped the United States and its military during our period of \noccupation. Many of them risked their lives for our soldiers, and now \nthey are worried about retribution and have asked for asylum refuge in \nthe United States.\n  The proposal was made by the Republican side that we should limit--in \nfact, should delay and then limit--Syrian and Iraqi refugees. One has \nto wonder whether or not it has anything to do with the fact that the \nvast majority of people living in those two countries are of the Muslim \nfaith.\n  I have met some of these refugees in the city of Chicago. Some of \nthem waited up to 2 years after they were being investigated and \ninterviewed and fingerprinted--up to 2 years--before they could come to \nthe United States. Their stories of what they and their families have \nbeen through are tragic. They come here simply to start a new life in a \nsafe place and to raise their children. It truly is what has motivated \npeople across the span of history to come to this great Nation, and \nthese refugees are no different.\n  The fact that the Republicans would start by excluding refugees--and \nnow, Mr. Trump takes it to the extreme of excluding people of a \nreligious faith, the Muslim religion--is an indication of a \nconversation in American politics that needs to stop. We need to \nreflect once again on the fundamental principles of this country and \nthe fundamental values of this country as well. I hope this is the \nbeginning of a reevaluation.\n  It wasn't but 2 weeks ago that the House of Representatives passed \nthe measure, the so-called pause in accepting refugees. It is \ninteresting what has happened since. More than half of Democrats who \nvoted for this--47 of them--have said they don't want to include this \nmeasure in any final appropriations bill considered by Congress. They \nare obviously having second thoughts about their votes. At least one \nRepublican Congressman from the State of Oklahoma said he made a \nmistake; he never should have voted for this policy when it came to \nSyrian refugees. So perhaps, as tempers cool and as we reflect on who \nwe are as a Nation and what we want to be, we will have second thoughts \nabout this question of refugees.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. President, there was another vote last week which I noted on the \nfloor yesterday and which I still find hard to believe. A measure was \noffered by Senator Feinstein of California. What it basically said is: \nIf you are on a no-fly list--if you have been identified by our \ngovernment as a suspected\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\nterrorist--you cannot purchase firearms. That, to me, is not a radical \nsuggestion. It is a commonsense suggestion. The two killers in San \nBernardino had AR-15s, weapons that can be used to fire many rounds in \na hurry. The net result: 14 people died and another 18 or so were \nseriously injured. So when someone is put on the no-fly list, the \nsuspected terrorist list, I don't think it is unreasonable to say: You \ncan't purchase a firearm as long as you are on that list.\n  Senator Feinstein addressed the question raised by the Republican \nSenator from Texas: What if the government is wrong? What if your name \nshould not be on the list? She included in her bill a process to \nchallenge any name on the list and to do it in an orderly way with due \nprocess. Apparently, Republicans felt that wasn't enough.\n  Overwhelmingly, Republicans voted against the Feinstein amendment. \nOverwhelmingly, they voted against a proposal to ban suspected \nterrorists from buying firearms in America.\n  Now, I know there are many people who are skeptical--maybe even \ncynical--when it comes to the role of our government. But if we are not \ngoing to take the government's information and advice when it comes to \nsuspected terrorists, where will we be?\n  Our government--through our military, our intelligence agency, the \nFBI, and law enforcement--gathers information about individuals and \nwarns us if those individuals could be a danger to our families and to \nour communities. The vote by the Republicans rejected that warning and \nsaid: We will err on the side of giving people firearms even if they \nare suspected terrorists. That makes no sense whatsoever. It shows you \nthe extremes you can reach when you listen closely to the gun lobby and \nnot to the vast majority of Americans who simply want to live in a safe \ncountry. It shows what happens when your opposition to this President \nand this government has reached the point where you question even the \nbasic conclusion that someone has been engaged in suspicious, if not \noutright, terrorist activity. That vote was defeated. The amendment by \nSenator Feinstein was defeated.\n  She also offered an amendment originally penned by Senator \nLautenberg--the late Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey--related to \nterrorists, but the Senate also considered an amendment that related to \nbackground checks for those who want to purchase firearms. That \namendment came to the floor under the sponsorship of Senator Manchin, a \nDemocrat from West Virginia, and Senator Toomey, a Republican from \nPennsylvania. What it said is very basic: If we are going to sell \nfirearms in America, we are going to make every reasonable effort not \nto sell them to convicted felons or people who are mentally unstable. \nThat makes sense. In fact, it should be a standard we all accept. The \nvast majority of gun owners accept that standard. They don't want guns \nin the hands of people who would use them in crime or people who are \nmentally unstable and can't manage a firearm. That amendment came to \nthe floor; again, it was defeated by the Republicans in the Senate. \nThat is unfortunate.\n  In the State of Illinois, too many crime guns cross the border from \nnorthwest Indiana into the city of Chicago, coming into that city where \nthey are traced to gun shows in Indiana where there are no background \nchecks, where people can fill up the trunks of their cars with firearms \nand ammunition, cross the border into Illinois and into Chicago, and \nengage in deadly, violent contact. We should have that come to an end.\n  The people who own and use guns responsibly and legally have no fear. \nBut those who would buy them for criminal purposes or those who would \nbuy them when they don't have the faculties to truly maintain a firearm \nor use it should be stopped.\n  The Republicans disagree. They are listening to the gun lobby when \nthey should be listening to the people of this country.\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. President, last month, the Department of Justice, along with the \nDepartment of Education and a group of State attorneys general, \nannounced an agreement to settle litigation against Education \nManagement Corporation, the second largest for-profit college chain in \nAmerica.\n  EDMC was found to have been engaged in fraud and deception when it \ntold the Federal Government it was complying with Federal laws that \nprohibited incentive compensation to be paid to recruiters. For EDMC \nrecruiters, students essentially had a bounty on their heads. The more \nstudents they signed up for their for-profit colleges, the more bonuses \nand perks the recruiters could receive, such as trips to places like \nCancun and Las Vegas, Starbucks gift cards, expensive candies, and \ntickets to sporting events.\n  To tell the whole story, the same EDMC recruiters--as they were \nrecruiting young people to attend these for-profit colleges--needed \nonly to find students with a ``pulse and a Pell'' to sign up. What they \nare referring to, of course, is low-income students eligible for over \n$5,000 in Pell grants--$5,000 that would flow to this for-profit \ncollege, regardless of whether the students were getting a good \neducation.\n  U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch referred to this school as a \n``recruitment mill.'' What was the result of this recruitment mill? \nWhile these illegal practices were taking place, EDMC reportedly took \nin--listen to this--$11 billion in Federal funds, $11 billion in \ntaxpayer funds. Under the settlement, the company was fined $90 \nmillion--$11 billion; $90 million.\n  Well, how about the executives who masterminded the scheme to sign up \nyoung people so that their Pell grants and government loans would flow \nto the for-profit college, regardless of whether they ever finished \nschool or ended up with a diploma that was worth anything? What \nhappened to these people who engineered this scheme that cost Federal \ntaxpayers $11 billion--students almost $11 billion in debt--and a fine \nby the government of $90 million? So far, they are getting off scot-\nfree.\n  Todd Nelson, CEO of EDMC until 2012, personally received over $25 \nmillion in total compensation during his 5 years. The settlement didn't \ninclude any accountability for him. Now Mr. Nelson is the CEO of the \nCareer Education Corporation, another for-profit education company that \nis under massive State and Federal scrutiny.\n  What about the students who were lured by EDMC's illegal recruitment \nmill, pressured by the company's high-pressure, boiler-room tactics \ninto mountains of student debt? They can't find jobs many times, and \nthey certainly can't repay their loans.\n  Attorney General Lynch called EDMC's tactics a violation of the trust \nplaced in them by the students. More than 40 State attorneys general \naccused the company of deception and misleading recruitment.\n  So let's be clear. This was not just a case of EDMC lying to the \nFederal Government. Students were the victims.\n  I encourage the Department of Education to use the evidence the \nDepartment of Justice and States attorneys general have in this case to \nprovide Federal student loan relief to students who were harmed by \nEducation Management Corporation. But make no mistake. If the students \nare spared the student debt from these fly-by-night for-profit \ncolleges, ultimately the taxpayers will be the losers as well. We \nprovided the money to the students that flowed to the schools, and now \neveryone is a loser, including the taxpayers--oh, not the officers of \nthe company. They walked away with millions of dollars in compensation.\n  There is one thing I always say at this point to make my case, and I \nhave never, ever heard a rebuttal from the for-profit colleges. For-\nprofit colleges educate about 10 percent of all the high school \ngraduates in America. Who are the major for-profit colleges? The \nbiggest one is the University of Phoenix, Kaplan is another large one, \nand DeVry University is out of the city of Chicago. These are for-\nprofit schools.\n  About 10 percent of high school grants go to these for-profit \ncolleges. The for-profit colleges as an industry receive 20 percent of \nall the Federal aid to education--10 percent of the students, 20 \npercent of the Federal aid. Their tuition is so high that students have \nto go deeper into debt than if they had chosen a community college or a \npublic university. But here is the No. 1 number: 10 percent of the \nstudents--44 percent of student loan defaults occur with students who \nattend for-profit colleges and universities. Almost half\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nof the students who end up going to these for-profit schools default on \ntheir student loans.\n  Don't forget that student loans, student debt is not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. A 19- or 20-year-old student and their parents who sign up \nfor these student loans have signed up for debt for life. It cannot be \ndischarged. They will take it to the grave. When the student defaults, \nwe actually have seen efforts to secure Social Security payments from \nthe parents who cosigned for these loans. For 10 percent of the \nstudents in for-profit schools, there are 44 percent of the student \nloan defaults.\n  Well, the EDMC news came on the heels of a major announcement by \nWestwood College, one of the worst actors in the for-profit college \nindustry. Westwood announced it would stop enrolling students in \ncampuses nationwide, including the four that operate in the Chicago \narea. Praise the Lord.\n  Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued Westwood for engaging in \ndeceptive practices. Madigan's suit focused specifically on Westwood's \ncriminal justice program, one of the first that I have heard about that \nraised my interest in this for-profit college industry. In order to \nlure students into their criminal justice program, Westwood College \nconvinced students they could get jobs with the Chicago Police \nDepartment and the Illinois State Police. What happened when the \nstudents actually graduated from Westwood College, this for-profit \nschool, and took their degrees to the employers? The employers laughed \nat them. They didn't recognize the Westwood degree. In fact, it reached \na point where they told the students they would be better off if they \ndidn't include Westwood College on their resumes. Just say you didn't \ngo to school, and you will have a better chance.\n\n  The Attorney General recently reached a settlement with Westwood \nunder which it would forgive $15 million in private student loans for \nIllinois students. Now it appears the company as a whole may be on its \nway out. That is the trend in this industry. As students and parents \nacross America are starting to realize these for-profit schools are bad \nnews and State and Federal regulators are shining a light on their \nillegal tactics, enrollment is declining. At one point, I believe the \nUniversity of Phoenix had over 500,000 students. Now they are down to \nless than half of that amount. Along with the decline in enrollment, \nstock prices on these private corporations are plummeting.\n  Years of bad behavior is starting to catch up with these companies, \nbut the damage is done for these students. Many of their lives have \nbeen harmed, if not ruined, by this debt. And, of course, there has \nbeen damage to the Federal Treasury, which shells out billions--that is \nwith a ``b''--of dollars to the for-profit colleges that the taxpayers \nwill never get back. Yet the other party continues to come to the aid \nof the for-profit college industry, attempting to block any steps to \nensure that for-profit colleges are following the law and held \naccountable. We saw it earlier this year. The junior Senator from \nFlorida came to the aid of the disreputable Corinthian Colleges. While \nCorinthian was lying to students about its job-placement rates, \nsuckering them into enrolling, and saddling them with debt, the junior \nSenator from Florida was writing to the Department of Education asking \nthem to demonstrate leniency to Corinthian--leniency to a company that \nmade misrepresentations to the students, lied to the government, and \nswindled taxpayers out of billions of dollars. That is the answer from \nthe junior Senator from Florida.\n  If Republicans are willing to defend Corinthian, it shouldn't be a \nsurprise that they want to shield for-profit colleges from what is \nknown as the gainful employment rule. The Department of Education has \ndeveloped responsible criteria for determining whether career education \nprograms really do prepare students for gainful employment. That is \nrequired by law. The gainful employment rule ensures that students who \ngraduate from a covered program of study are able to get a job that \nallows them to manage the student debt they take on in the process. The \npoint is to protect students from worthless postsecondary programs that \nleave them saddled with debt and unable to get a good job. The point is \nto also protect Federal taxpayers by cutting off Federal funding to \nprograms of study that don't really prepare students for a job. But the \nfor-profit college industry and their friends in Congress--they hate \nthis rule. Why? As an industry, for-profit colleges, as I mentioned \nearlier, enroll 10 percent of the students and account for more than 40 \npercent of the student loan defaults. They take in $25 billion in title \nIV dollars annually. If they were a Federal agency, the for-profit \ncolleges and universities would be the ninth largest Federal agency in \nAmerica.\n  Is this the private sector, is this the free market, or is this crony \ncapitalism that survives on massive Federal subsidies? The for-profit \ncolleges and universities are the most heavily subsidized private \nindustry in America. Their business model depends on easy access to \nFederal funds and the ability to spend as little as possible on quality \neducation. They spend more money on advertising than they do on \nteaching.\n  Earlier this year, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia dealt a devastating blow to this industry's attempt to block \nthe gainful employment rule. The court upheld the rule in its entirety. \nThis was the second U.S. district court to do so. Having been \nembarrassed in Federal court, the for-profit college industry has \nturned to my friends on the other side of the aisle to protect them. \nThey attached a rider to the appropriations bills that fund education \nprograms and are pushing to include it in the final spending bill this \nyear to stop the Department of Education from enforcing the existing \nlaw on gainful employment.\n  How can we as Members of Congress block implementation of this \ncommonsense rule in light of what just happened with Corinthian? This \ncompany was inflating its job-placement rates to lure students, \ndefrauding the students and taxpayers, and lying to creditors and the \nFederal Government. When it collapsed, when Corinthian went down, more \nthan 70,000 students were left in peril. Many were left with more debt \nthan they could ever possibly repay and a Corinthian education that is \nworthless.\n  Now is not the time for Congress to meddle in the Department of \nEducation's efforts to protect taxpayers, students, and their families, \nand to prevent another Corinthian collapse. The Department estimates \nthat of the nearly 1,400 programs of study, 99 percent of them at for-\nprofit colleges will fail under this basic rule. That is why the \nindustry is in a mad dash to find political sponsors to save them from \naccountability. Programs have to fail the rule 2 out of 3 consecutive \nyears to be cut out of Federal funding, so the institutions do have an \nopportunity to improve. If they don't, we shouldn't just continue to \nblindly send billions of Federal taxpayer dollars to these companies.\n  With all we know about the for-profit college industry and their \nfraudulent and deceptive practices, I can't believe my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle are prepared to fight a rule that is \nnothing more than a way to protect students and taxpayers. But here we \nare facing the prospect of a policy rider, substantive legislation in a \nspending bill to shield for-profit colleges from being held accountable \nand delivering on their promises to students. Well, I am going to \nresist that, and I hope my colleagues will join me. It isn't just a \nmatter of making certain that these schools follow the law; it is a \nmatter of protecting students and families from being exploited--going \nin for an education and ending up with nothing other than debt--and \nprotecting taxpayers who are sending $25 billion a year to this \nindustry.\n  We have had some heated debates on the floor about people receiving \nfood stamps--perhaps $180 a month in food stamps--and whether they are \ndeserving or whether it is a rip-off for taxpayers, but when it comes \nto $25 billion for an industry that has shown over and over again that \nit is the source of 44 percent of student loan defaults, to the misery \nof the students and families who are victims of it, some of these same \npeople who are critical of food stamp fraud turn a blind eye. They say: \nOh, this is just business. Don't be afraid of making a profit.\n  I salute businesses that make a profit if they do it honestly, \nhonorably, and do it with competition. This industry is taking \nadvantage of Federal tax dollars in a way that no other industry is.\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Terrorist Watch List\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I will be brief. I wish to respond to \nwhat I heard earlier this morning from the Democratic leader and what \nwe heard from the President on Sunday night.\n  The Democrats would have us believe that any person on a watch list \ncan go and buy a firearm without any notice whatsoever. That is simply \nfalse. The background check system that federally licensed firearm \ndealers use includes a terrorist watch list, and the FBI \ncounterterrorism division is notified when that occurs. Of course, the \nlist is notoriously inaccurate. A Department of Justice IG report just \na few years ago said half of the names on the list are incorrect. The \nNew York Times, which continues its proselytizing for gun control, used \nto be strongly opposed to the use of this list. Most famously, Ted \nKennedy, a U.S. Senator from America's leading political dynasty, was \non the list and couldn't get off for weeks, having his flights \ndisrupted time after time. Stephen Hayes, a well-known conservative \njournalist who I admit looks a little suspicious, also found himself on \nthe list. It took him months of public commentary, and he was only \nremoved from the list when Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson \nwas challenged on the news about him being on the list.\n  If it took Ted Kennedy and Stephen Hayes weeks or months to get off \nthat list, how long would it take the little guy in Arkansas? For that \nmatter, how long do we think it would take patriotic Muslim Americans \nwho are on the list--most likely because of confusion about their names \nwith suspected terrorists--to get off that list?\n  Moreover, what other rights would Democrats like to deprive American \ncitizens of without notice and due process? Their right to free speech? \nTheir right to practice their religion? Their right to petition their \ngovernment? Their right to enlist unreasonable search and seizures? \nTheir right to a trial by jury? Their right to confront their accusers? \nTheir right to get just compensation when their property is taken?\n  Democrats should quit being so politically correct. They should focus \non winning the war against radical Islam. If they did, maybe fewer \nAmericans would feel the need to buy firearms to protect themselves \nfrom terrorist attacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this is a day for opportunity in the \nSenate. We have an opportunity today to reverse the trend of the last \nseveral years toward a national school board. We have an opportunity to \nmake clear that in the future, the path to higher standards, better \nteaching, and real accountability will be through States, communities, \nand classrooms and not through Washington, DC.\n  We have an opportunity to vote in favor of what the Wall Street \nJournal has called ``the largest devolution of Federal control to \nStates in a quarter century.''\n  We have an opportunity to inaugurate a new era of innovation and \nexcellence in student achievement by restoring responsibility to States \nand classroom teachers. Tennessee, after all, was the first State that \npaid teachers more for teaching well. Minnesota educators created the \nfirst charter schools. The real advances in higher standards and \naccountability and appropriate testing have come from classroom \nteachers and from Governors, not from Washington, DC, and I believe \nthat is where those advances will come from in the future.\n  We have an opportunity today to provide much needed stability and \ncertainty to Federal education policy from some very important people \nwho are counting on us: 50 million children, 3.4 million teachers, and \n100,000 public schools.\n  Newsweek magazine recently reminded us what we already know very \nwell: No Child Left Behind is a law everybody wants fixed. Governors, \nteachers, superintendents, parents, Republicans, Democrats, and \nstudents all want the law fixed. There is a consensus about that and \nfortunately there is a consensus about how to fix it. That consensus is \nthis: continue the law's important measurements of academic progress of \nstudents--disaggregate and report the results of those measurements--so \nteachers, parents, and the community can know what is going on in the \nschools but restore to States, school districts, classroom teachers, \nand parents the responsibility for deciding what to do about those \ntests and about what to do about improving student achievement.\n  In our Senate hearings, I suppose we heard more about over-testing \nthan any other subject. I believe this new law will result in fewer and \nbetter tests because States and classroom teachers will be deciding \nwhat to do about the results of the tests.\n  Building on the consensus I have just described is why the Senate--\nour Senate education committee--passed our bill 22 to 0 and why it \npassed on the floor 81 to 17. That is why conferees from the Senate and \nthe House were able to agree 38 to 1, and that is why last Thursday the \nHouse of Representatives approved the conference report 359 to 64. That \nis why the National Governors Association gave our conference report \nits first full endorsement that the NGA has given to any legislation in \nnearly 20 years. That is why the Chief State School Officers, the \nschool superintendents, the National Education Association, and the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers all have supported our result.\n  This consensus will end the waivers through which the U.S. Department \nof Education has become in effect a national school board for more than \n80,000 schools in 42 States. Governors have been forced to come to \nWashington, DC, and play ``Mother, May I'' in order for a State to put \nin a plan to evaluate teachers, for example, or to help a low-\nperforming school.\n  Our consensus will end the Federal common core mandate. It explicitly \nprohibits Washington from mandating or even incentivizing common core \nor any other specific academic standards. That is exclusively the \nresponsibility of the State. It moves decisions about whether schools, \nteachers, and students are succeeding or failing out of Washington, DC, \nand back to States and communities and classroom teachers where those \ndecisions belong.\n  I am grateful to Senator Murray, who is here today, and \nRepresentatives Kline and Scott, and to all of the members of our \nSenate education committee, for the leadership they have shown and the \nbipartisan way in which they have worked on this legislation. I am \ngrateful to both the Democratic and Republican staffs in the Senate and \nin the House for their ingenuity and hard work. Fixing No Child Left \nBehind has not been easy. Everyone is an expert on education. This has \nbeen a lot like being in a football stadium with 100,000 fans, all of \nwhom know exactly which play to call and usually each one of them says \nso.\n  Some Republicans would like even more local control of schools than \nour consensus provides, and I am one of them, but my Scholarship for \nKids proposal, which would have given States the option to allow \nFederal dollars to follow children to the school their parents choose, \nonly received 45 votes in the Senate. It needed 60.\n  So I have decided, as a President named Reagan once advised, that I \nwill take 80 percent of what I want and fight for the other 20 percent \non another day. Besides, if I were to vote no, I would be voting to \nleave in place the common core mandate--and I would be voting to leave \nin place the waivers that permit the U.S. Department of Education to \nact as a national school board for 80,000 students and 42 states--and I \nwould be voting against the largest step toward locally-controlled \nschools in 25 years. Let me repeat that. Voting no today is voting to \nleave in place the common core mandate and the national school board \nand voting against the largest step toward local control of schools in \n25 years.\n  I say to my friends, especially on the Republican side, many of whom, \nas I do, would like more local control: That is not the choice. The \nchoice is whether\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nwe want to leave in place common core, the national school board, and \nthe largest step toward local control in 25 years. I don't want to do \nthat.\n  This law expired 8 years ago. It has become unworkable. If it were \nstrictly applied, it would label nearly every school in America a \nfailing school. So States, teachers, and parents have been waiting 8 \nyears for us to reauthorize this law. If this were homework, they would \ngive Congress an F for being tardy, but I hope they will give us a good \ngrade for the result we have today.\n  It is a great privilege to serve in the U.S. Senate, but there is no \nneed for us to have that privilege if all we do is announce our \ndifferent opinions or vote no if we don't get 100 percent of our way. \nWe can do that at home or on the radio or in the newspaper or on a \nstreet corner. As U.S. Senators, after we have had our say, our job is \nto get a principled result. Today we have that opportunity.\n  I hope today will demonstrate that we understand the privilege we \nhave as Senators and show that we cherish our children by building upon \nthis consensus and vote yes to fix the law that everybody wants fixed \nand yes for the consensus that restores responsibility for our schools \nto States, communities, and classroom teachers.\n  Before Senator Murray speaks, I would like to do two things, briefly. \nThe first vote--the vote we are having today at 11:30--is a vote about \nwhether to cut off debate on fixing No Child Left Behind. I hope no \nSenator thinks we have not had enough debate. We have been at this for \n7 years. We failed in the last two Congresses. We have been working in \nour committee since January. We have had innumerable hearings, more \nthan 50 amendments in committee, more than 70 amendments were dealt \nwith on the floor, a dozen or so amendments in the conference report. \nEvery Senator has had this in his or her office since last Monday--at \nleast for a week. So the question today at 11:30 is, Is it time to cut \noff debate and move to a final vote? I hope every Senator will vote \nyes.\n  Finally, I mentioned Senator Murray and her role in this, which has \nbeen indispensable in terms of our ability to come to a result. I would \nlike to extend my deep thanks and appreciation to her staff and our \nstaff, the committee staff, that worked on fixing No Child Left Behind. \nMany of them have been working on this effort for nearly 5 years. They \nhave been ingenious. They have worked hard. They have been \nunderstanding, they have been tireless, and they have been \nindispensable in creating this important bipartisan, bicameral bill. \nThat includes the staffs of Representative Kline and Representative \nScott in the House\n  On Senator Murray's exceptional staff I would like to thank \nespecially Evan Schatz, Sarah Bolton, Amanda Beaumont, John Righter, \nJake Cornett, Leanne Hotek, Allie Kimmel, and Aissa Canchola. All of \nthose people were very important. For my hard-working and dedicated \nstaff, I would especially like to thank our staff director, David \nCleary, Peter Oppenheim, Lindsay Fryer, Bill Knudsen, Jordan Hynes, \nHillary Knudson, Jake Baker, Lindsey Seidman, Allison Martin, Bobby \nMcMillan, Jim Jeffries, Liz Wolgemuth, Margaret Atkinson, and Taylor \nHaulsee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson \nrushed to the old elementary school he had once attended and with him \nhe had a piece of major legislation. At a picnic table on the lawn of \nthe school, President Johnson signed into law the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act--or ESEA. He said that with this law, he \nenvisioned ``full educational opportunity as our first national goal.''\n\n  Our Nation has always held the ideal of education for all, but in \n1965 ESEA put that idea into action. It aimed to close the education \ngaps between rich and poor, Black and White, kids from rural areas and \nkids from big cities. In doing so, ESEA took a step forward for civil \nrights.\n  Today we have a chance to reauthorize that civil rights law to \ncontinue what President Johnson called our ``first national goal.'' We \nhave a chance to finally move away from the No Child Left Behind Act, \nand we have a chance to send the Every Student Succeeds Act to the \nPresident's desk to help ensure all kids have access to a quality \neducation regardless of where they live, how they learn, or how much \nmoney their parents make.\n  I appreciate the tireless work of Chairman John Kline and Ranking \nMember Bobby Scott in the House and their staffs. I especially want to \nthank my partner here in the Senate, the chairman of the HELP Committee \nand senior Senator from Tennessee, Senator Lamar Alexander. The \nchairman had an opportunity to go down a partisan road, but instead he \ncommitted to work with me earlier this year to get this important bill \ndone. I was very proud to work with him and with many of our colleagues \nto break through the gridlock and keep this bill moving forward. \nTogether we passed our bill through the HELP Committee with strong \nbipartisan support. We passed our bill in the Senate with strong \nbipartisan support. We got approval from our bicameral conference \ncommittee with strong bipartisan support. Last week the House passed \nthis final legislation with strong bipartisan support. And today I hope \nour colleagues will approve this final bill with the same bipartisan \nspirit that has guided our progress this far.\n  Nearly everyone agrees that No Child Left Behind is badly broken. I \nhave heard from parent after parent and teacher after teacher about how \nthe law overemphasized testing and how oftentimes those tests are \nredundant or unnecessary. I have seen firsthand how this law is not \nworking for my home State of Washington. No Child Left Behind issued \none-size-fits-all mandates but failed to give the schools the resources \nthey needed to meet those standards.\n  These mandates were so unworkable that the Obama administration began \ngiving States waivers from the law's requirements. My State lost its \nwaiver last year. Parents across the State got a letter in the mail \nsaying their child's school was failing, and teachers were left working \nas hard as ever, knowing their ``failing'' label didn't reflect the \nreality in their classrooms.\n  A few months ago, I heard from a teacher in Seattle named Lyon Terry. \nHe has taught school for more than 17 years and pours his energy into \nengaging with his students. He starts the morning by playing songs on \nhis guitar, keeps his students laughing with jokes, and every day he \ntries to create an environment where kids want to come to school. \nDespite Mr. Terry and his fellow teachers' hard work, his school was \nlabeled as failing. That is not fair to teachers like Mr. Terry, it is \nnot fair to the parents who need confidence in the education their kids \nget at public schools, and it is not fair to students who should never \nhave to bear the consequences of this broken law.\n  Fixing No Child Left Behind has been one of my top priorities for \nstudents, families, and communities back home in Washington State and \nacross the country. Back in January we didn't know there would be a \npath to compromise on a bill to reauthorize the Nation's K-12 law, but \nI started out with several principles and Washington State priorities \nthat I would be fighting for.\n  First, I knew we needed to ensure that schools and States provided a \nquality education to all our students because we already know what \nhappens when we don't hold them accountable for every child. \nInevitably, it is the kids of color or kids with disabilities or kids \nlearning English who too often fall through the cracks. I said back in \nJanuary and I will repeat that true accountability means holding up our \nschools to our Nation's promise of equality and justice.\n  I knew we had to give schools and teachers resources they need so \nthey can help their schools reach full potential because in some \nschools students don't have the same opportunity to graduate ready for \ncollege and careers in the 21st-century economy like other students do.\n  I knew we should only pass an education bill that would help expand \naccess to early childhood education because giving more students the \nchance to start kindergarten ready to learn is one of the smartest \ninvestments our country can make.\n  I am proud to report that our bill, the Every Student Succeeds Act, \ntakes major strides on those priorities and\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nmuch more. The Every Student Succeeds Act will put an end to the one-\nsize-fits-all mandates of No Child Left Behind. It will end the era of \nState waivers. That will give teachers and parents in my State of \nWashington and across the country some much needed certainty.\n  Our bipartisan bill will also reduce reliance on high-stakes testing \nso teachers and students can spend less time on test prep and more time \non learning. I know that is going to be a major relief for teachers and \nprincipals, such as high school principal Lori Wyborney in Spokane, WA. \nShe told me she wants to see some commonsense policies for testing. \nThat is what our bill will help to do.\n  While the Every Student Succeeds Act gives States more flexibility, \nit also includes strong Federal guardrails to hold schools and States \naccountable. Our bill will make sure schools work to close achievement \ngaps that too often hurt kids from low-income backgrounds, students of \ncolor, those learning English, or those with disabilities. For schools \nthat struggle the most to help students succeed and for high schools \nwhere more than a third of their students fail to earn a diploma, our \nbill will take steps to make sure they improve.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I met a parent named Duncan. He has a son in \nsecond grade in the Highland public schools, and Duncan is active in \ntheir PTA. Many of the kids in his school district struggle with \npoverty. Duncan has said he has seen firsthand how, in districts like \nthis, ``every dollar matters.''\n  In the Every Student Succeeds Act, I fought hard to make sure that \nFederal resources go to the schools and districts that need them the \nmost by rejecting a proposal known as portability. If enacted, \nportability would have siphoned off money from the schools with the \nhighest concentration of students in poverty and sent it to more \naffluent schools. Our bill protects schools with students in low-income \nareas and upholds our responsibility to invest Federal resources where \nthey are needed the most.\n  Even so, many schools and districts don't get equal access to the \nresources they need to help students learn, grow, and thrive. These are \nthings such as offering AP classes, how much funding districts spend on \neach student, access to preschool, and many more. Our bill will require \nall schools to report on these issues to help shine a light on resource \ninequality.\n  Our bipartisan bill will help improve and expand access to preschool \nprograms. Before I ever thought about running for elected office, I \ntaught preschool in a small community in my home State of Washington. I \nremember that the first day with new students would always start the \nsame way: Some kids wouldn't know how to hold a pencil or crayon or how \nto turn a page in a book. But over the first few months, they would \nstart to catch on. They learned how to listen at story time. They \nlearned how to stand in line for recess. By the time they left for \nkindergarten, they had those basic skills and many more, so they were \nready to tackle a full curriculum in school.\n  I have seen firsthand the kind of transformation early learning can \ninspire in a child, and I am so glad that for the first time, our \nNation's primary education law will invest in early childhood \neducation. I fought hard for this because I know that investing now in \npreschool will payoff for years to come.\n  Strong Federal guardrails for accountability, shining a light on \nresource inequity, reducing the reliance on high-stakes testing, and \nincreasing access to preschool are some of the great things in this \nbill, but almost as important is what this bill represents. Gridlock \nand dysfunction have come to define Congress over the past several \nyears, but on an issue as important as education and on a law as broken \nas No Child Left Behind, we worked together and found a way to find \ncommon ground.\n  It is not the bill I would have written on my own. I know it isn't \nthe bill Republicans would have written on their own. That is the \nnature of compromise. We put partisanship aside and proved that \nCongress can get results for the American people, and that kind of \nbipartisanship is what we need more of here in Congress.\n  With the legislative process for this bill coming to an end, I am \nlooking ahead to the future. When all students have the chance to \nlearn, we strengthen our workforce, our Nation grows stronger, and our \neconomy grows from the middle out, not from the top down. We empower \nthe next generation of Americans to lead the world.\n  As proud as I am that we have come this far on the Every Student \nSucceeds Act, we always have to keep improving educational \nopportunities. I am going to see to it that this bill is implemented \neffectively, that schools and teachers get the resources they need, and \nthat students have access to the programs that help them succeed in the \nclassroom and beyond. I am going to keep pushing to build on the \nprogress we have made in this bill and make sure more students start \nschool on a strong footing. I am going to keep fighting to make college \nmore affordable and reduce the crushing burden of student debt. I am \ngoing to keep working every single day to make sure our government is \ndoing everything possible to help students in Washington State and \nacross the country. Reauthorizing ESEA isn't the finish line; for me, \nit is more of a milestone in an ongoing commitment to swing open more \ndoors for Americans.\n  I am asking all of my colleagues here today to join me. Let's fix \nthis No Child Left Behind law. Let's show teachers and principals that \nwe are on their side. And let's help instill educational opportunity as \nour first national goal and grow our Nation stronger for generations to \ncome.\n  In a few minutes, as the chairman said, we will be voting on cloture \nto end debate so that we can move to passage of this bill. Along with \nhim, I thank all of our staff. When we get to the final bill, I want to \nname them as well. They have put in an incredible amount of time, work, \nand hours to help get to this agreement. Again, I thank all of our \nstaffs on both sides of the aisle and in the House. I will say more \nabout that later, but I truly want to thank Chairman Alexander for \ntaking the time to be thoughtful, to work with us, and to find a path \nforward for compromise on a law that was broken that needed to be fixed \nand that we are about to pass.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have said many times but I would \nlike to say again that at the beginning of this discussion, when the \nSenator from Washington and I talked about how we had been stuck for \ntwo Congresses on this, I started in one direction and she suggested a \ndifferent direction. As it turned out, she gave me good advice. I took \nit, and as a result, we have a result. So I thank her for that, and I \nlook forward to working with her on other important issues in the same \nway.\n  The Senator from Georgia would like to speak before we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, as the last surviving person who served \non the committee who wrote the original No Child Left Behind Act for \nthe Congress, I am delighted to be here on this day.\n  I think this Senator speaks for every superintendent, every Governor, \nevery parent, and every child to say thank you to Senator Alexander and \nSenator Murray. We knew when we wrote No Child Left Behind that if it \nworked, by the time the sixth year came, we would have to reauthorize \nit or else it would go from a net positive to a negative. We didn't \nreauthorize it, and AYP became a problem, good schools became needs-\nimprovement schools, and the law worked backward. In fact, we have run \neducation by waivers the last 6 years.\n  The leadership of these two great Members of Congress. Seeing this \nbill through in the committee is a great testimony to working together, \nto finding common ground, and to our collective purpose of seeing to it \nthat our children are the best educated children in the world.\n  Senator Alexander, thank you. Senator Murray, thank you for what you \nhave done.\n  To the Members of Congress, the Senate will vote in a few minutes. We \nneed a vote for cloture and a vote for final\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\npassage to see to it that we end a chapter in education and open a new \nchapter--a chapter that focuses on student improvement, student \nachievement, leaves No Child Left Behind but also sees that every child \ncan succeed and makes sure we disaggregate so we can focus on children \nas they perform within their own group and we can focus on every child \nin every school in America.\n  I am honored to have been a member of the committee that worked hard \non this bill, and I am honored to serve with Senators Alexander and \nMurray.\n  I appreciate the time to speak on behalf of not just myself but for \nevery student, teacher, and parent in America.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, and \nI salute him. The Senator from Georgia is a former chairman of the \nGeorgia State Board of Education. His experience there, his work with \nSenator Murray on early childhood education, and his insistence on an \namendment that gives States the right to allow parents to opt out of \nfederally required tests all were major contributions to this \nlegislation. I think it is fair to say that we could not have fixed No \nChild Left Behind without Johnny Isakson's experience and leadership, \nand I am deeply grateful to him for that.\n  We yield back all time on our side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we yield back all our time as well.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany S. 1177, an act to reauthorize the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that \n     every child achieves.\n         Mitch McConnell, Lamar Alexander, Mike Rounds, Deb \n           Fischer, Dan Sullivan, Lisa Murkowski, Orrin G.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nconference report to accompany S. 1177, an original bill to reauthorize \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every \nchild achieves, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Indiana (Mr. Coats), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 84, the nays are \n12.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, on behalf of the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nthe provisions of rule XXII, the vote on adoption of the conference \nreport to accompany S. 1177 occur at 10:45 a.m., on Wednesday, December \n9, which is tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, that sets the final vote on our bill \nto fix No Child Left Behind tomorrow morning at 10:45 a.m. I don't \nthink there is any doubt what the result will be. We have had a series \nof votes that give a pretty clear indication of where the Senate is. \nThe vote today was 84 to 12 to cut off debate and move to the final \nvote. Senators who wish to speak between now and then can do that.\n  Senator Murray, in her remarks, mentioned how good this process has \nbeen, and I wish to call that to the attention of Senators as well. The \nSenate can operate pretty well under the rules that it has if Senators \nwill agree to cooperate with one another. I said before that I think \none reason Senator Murray works so well toward a result, even though \nshe is a partisan leader in the Democratic conference, is because she \nused to be a preschool teacher, and in kindergarten you learn how to \nwork well with others and that is true in her case. That is actually \ntrue with all of the members of our committee. We have as much \ndivergence on our committee, with 22 members, as does any committee. I \nwill not name the names of the Senators, but there is almost no one who \ncan dispute that. Yet we went through a process, which Senator Murray \nand I agreed on at her suggestion, and this is what happened: We had 22 \nmembers in the committee vote yes to move the bill to the floor. That \nis every single member of the committee. Several of those members \nagreed to withhold amendments that might have been damaging to the bill \nso we could deal with them on the floor.\n  In the committee we considered 58 amendments and 29 were adopted. \nTwenty-four of the adopted amendments were offered by Democrats and \nfive amendments were offered by Republicans. Then we went to the floor. \nWhen we moved to the floor, the vote was 81 to 17--not quite as good as \ntoday, but it was a very good vote. We had 52 Member priorities \nincorporated into a substitute amendment. In other words, 52 Senators \nmade suggestions about the final bill. Forty-four of these were \npriorities requested by Democrats and eight were priorities requested \nby Republicans. On the Senate floor, 177 amendments were filed and 78 \nwere considered--23 by rollcall vote and 65 amendments were agreed to. \nForty of the adopted amendments were offered by Democrats, 25 by \nRepublicans.\n  Sometimes I have heard it said that we don't have time to deal with \namendments. We dealt with 177 amendments on the floor in less than a \nweek. The practice of going around to our colleagues and talking them \nout of amendments takes more time than it does to actually vote on them \nand to give them a chance to participate. In conference 17 more \namendments were filed, 10 from the House, 7 from the Senate. Of those \n17 amendments, 9 were considered and 7 were agreed to--4 Democrats, 3 \nRepublicans.\n  I suggest to the Senate and President that it is not a secret why we \nwere able to succeed this year in fixing a bill that is very difficult \nto fix. We know that because we have tried very hard in each of the \nlast two Congresses, working with the Secretary of Education, House \nRepublicans and Democrats, and the Senate Republicans and Democrats. We \nspent a lot of hours working on a bill, but we failed.\n  Why did we have more success this time? I think it is because \neverybody had a part in the process, everybody had a chance to have \ntheir say. We had amendments in committee, we had\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\namendments on the floor, and we had amendments in the conference. If \nyou are convinced that you had a chance to have your say, then it is \neasier to say: Ok. Let's vote. I might win or lose, but at least I had \nmy say and we need to get a result. I would like to see more of that \nhere. We can do that fairly easily, and the key to it is allowing \namendments.\n  It is possible, under the Senate rules, for Senator Murray to offer \nan amendment and to try to make it pending, and I can object. If I then \noffer an amendment, she might object, and then the whole process \ncollapses. So any one of us can keep the Senate functioning as it \nshould, but in this case--an issue when there are alligators lurking in \nevery corner of the pond that could have brought this to a halt and \nnearly did several times--we were able to go through the process and \nget a result for the benefit of 50 million children and 3.4 million \nteachers in 100,000 public schools.\n  Someone asked me earlier yesterday what it would take to have the \nAmerican people have a higher opinion of the U.S. Congress. My answer \nis actions such as this, where we take an issue that affects real \nAmericans in the schools they attend, the homes where they are doing \ntheir homework, and the teachers who are working every day--this \naffects every single one of them. This empowers them to do their job. \nThis creates an opportunity for a new era of innovation and excellence \nin student achievement. When we work together to get this result, I \nthink people think better of the process here.\n  As I said earlier, it is possible to just stand here and say: Here is \nmy opinion, and if I don't get 100 percent, I will vote no. If that \nwere all I wanted to do, I would stay home. I would stand on the street \ncorner or get my own radio show or column, offer my opinion for about 5 \nminutes, and then go do something else, but I wouldn't waste my time \ntrying to be a U.S. Senator. It is hard to get here, and then it is \nhard to stay here. So while you are here, you might as well amount to \nsomething, and amounting to something as a U.S. Senator is getting a \nprincipled result on issues that are important to the American people.\n  We have done that this year more than most people might think. \nSenator Murray has a well-known reputation in this body, not just for \nbeing a Democratic leader but for being someone who is interested in a \nresult. Senator Wyden is working with Senator Hatch on tax extenders \nand Senator Udall worked with Senator Vitter on chemical safety. The \nEnergy bill that came out of committee depended upon Senator Cantwell \nas well as Senator Murkowski. The mental health bill that came out of \nour committee came from Senators Murray and Alexander. The cyber \nsecurity bill that passed the Senate was the work of Senator Feinstein \nas well as Senator Burr. The trafficking victims law came from Senators \nMcCaskill and Cornyn. The terrorism risk insurance was the result of \nSenators Brown and Shelby working together. The Iran Nuclear Review \nAct, which is a pretty extraordinary bill, started with Senator \nMenendez, then Senator Cardin, along with Senator Corker. The Veterans \nSuicide Prevention Act came from Senators Durbin and McCain.\n  I haven't even mentioned all of the important legislation that came \nthrough the Senate this year. So it is perfectly possible for us to \ndeal with very important pieces of legislation if we work together, and \nboth Democratic and Republican Senators have all shown they can work \ntogether.\n  I look forward to the vote tomorrow at 10:45 a.m.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nnext 20 minutes I be given 4 minutes, Senator Shaheen be given 4 \nminutes, Senator Blumenthal be given 4 minutes, Senator Feinstein be \ngiven 4 minutes, and Senator Murphy be given 4 minutes, concluding in a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 551\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, like so many Americans, my thoughts are \nwith the families and friends of those affected by the terror in San \nBernardino last week. Our hearts go out to the victims and their \nfamilies.\n  As we learn more about the suspects, it is becoming clear that San \nBernardino will serve as a sad--but also shocking--reminder of what \nneeds to be done to address what has become known as the terror gap.\n  I rise to support that most commonsense proposal to bar individuals \non the terrorist watch list from being able to legally get a gun. The \nGAO found that between 2004 and 2014 suspected terrorists attempted to \nexploit this loophole. People say: Well, this never happens. Listen to \nthis. Those on the terror watch list tried to purchase guns 2,233 times \nand succeeded in 2,043 of those--or 91 percent.\n  It is absolute insanity that this is not already a restriction we \nhave in place. Given what happened in San Bernardino, it is extra \ninsanity that we are not going to move on this and that we haven't \nmoved on this already. It makes no sense. We can't let a small group--\nan influential, powerful lobbying group--make America less safe. Yet \nmany of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are doing just \nthat. Because the NRA says no, they say no, even though terrorism is a \nscourge that we have to deal with on many fronts.\n  I appreciate my friend from Texas. He says there are certain people \non the terrorist watch list who don't belong there. There are a few, \nbut this newly found sympathy for the civil liberties of those who \nmight be causing trouble is surprising. We don't say abolish the \ncriminal justice system because not every single person we convict is \nguilty--although 99 percent probably are or some large percentage. Why \nare we doing it here? Are we saying if there are two or three people on \nthis terrorist watch list--20 or 30 who shouldn't be there and they \nhave the right to appeal and correct it; I have done it for \nconstituents--then we should let the other thousands who belong on that \nwatch list and who present a danger to America buy guns? It makes no \nsense.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle: Why should \nterrorists like the ones who perpetrated the heinous attack in Paris or \nthe ones who did in San Bernardino be allowed to buy a gun? No red \nherring argument will work. This is plain common sense at a time when \nwe need common sense, and it should not be a partisan measure. Guess \nwho introduced this idea originally? Not Barack H. Obama but George W. \nBush in 2007.\n  The vast majority of gun owners may have a right to have a gun, and I \nwould protect their right to have a gun if they are not felons or \nadjudicated mentally ill or spousal abusers; therefore, everyone is for \nit. The other side says no. So I hope now that it has become--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now that it has become clear since our last vote that \nthe two in San Bernardino have terrorist ties, I hope when Senator \nMurray propounds the unanimous consent request, the other side will \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my \ncolleagues because I also believe we should keep guns out of the hands \nof terrorists. I don't think that applies to law-abiding citizens, but \nI think it does apply to terrorists.\n  I have been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. In New \nHampshire, we have a rich tradition of safe and legal firearm \nownership. We have a rich tradition of hunting and sportsman's \nactivities. But like most Granite Staters, I also support pragmatic and \nsensible ways to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people who \nwould threaten this country, while also protecting the rights of law-\nabiding citizens. That is what we are discussing here today.\n  We have put forward commonsense legislation that adheres to a pretty \nsimple principle: If you are not allowed on a plane because you are on \na no-fly list, because you are suspected of threatening the country, \nthen you should not be allowed to buy a gun.\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\n  I want to repeat what Senator Schumer said because I think people \ndon't think that is real. They think: Oh, well, if you are on the no-\nfly list, you are not going to be able to buy a gun. But according to \nthe Government Accountability Office, between 2004 and 2014, suspected \nterrorists attempted to purchase guns from American dealers at least \n2,233 times that we know of. In 2,043 of those cases--2,043--91 percent \nof the time, those suspected terrorists succeeded. That is \nunacceptable, and it is time we close the loophole that allows \nsuspected terrorists to purchase guns.\n  After the horrific tragedy last week that was carried out by \nradicalized individuals in San Bernardino, it is clear that we need to \nbe doing more to prevent violent attacks inspired by ISIS here at home. \nClosing this loophole in our gun laws is a commonsense thing that we \ncan do today.\n  I have heard concerns that the legislation we have proposed doesn't \nallow for adequate due process for those on the list, but that is just \nnot correct. The Department of Homeland Security has a process in place \nfor removing a name from the no-fly list. As Senator Feinstein, the \nauthor of the legislation, has noted, the FBI office that handles the \nfirearm background check system must provide a reason for a denial upon \nrequest. Individuals who are listed then have a right to correct any \ninaccurate records in the background check system. So there is a \nprocess in place for people who are wrongfully on that no-fly list to \nbe able to remove their names.\n  I would ask those who oppose this bill: If the no-fly list is not \ngood enough for keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists, why is it \nworthwhile for protecting commercial airline flights from terrorists? \nThe reasoning is inconsistent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is time to come together in the \ninterests of national security to pass this bill to close this loophole \nin our Nation's gun laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we talk in this Chamber every day \nabout the threat of terrorism and many associated terrorist threats \nwith airplanes and explosives, but we have seen in recent horrifying \nevents in Paris and in San Bernardino how much tragic carnage can be \nwrought by a small number of people using firearms designed for war. \nThey are using assault weapons that have the purpose to kill and maim \nhuman beings--no other purpose. For me and for the American people, \ncommon sense says a person too dangerous to be permitted on a plane is \ntoo dangerous to be permitted a gun. No fly, no gun. No check, no gun. \nThat ought to be the rule. It is a commonsense rule.\n  When I talk to people in Connecticut and they say to me ``Why didn't \nthe Senate approve that rule?'' there is no commonsense explanation. \nThe reason given by colleagues on the other side that there is some due \nprocess violation is nonsense. I hesitate to say it is that frivolous, \nbut it is because, No. 1, there is a right to challenge the designation \non the no-fly list through the Department of Homeland Security, which \nhas to provide reasons and an opportunity to challenge it. Also, under \nSenator Feinstein's bill, there is an additional safeguard to \nconstitutional rights because it can be challenged through the \nDepartment of Justice, which is required to establish an administrative \nprocess and then an appeal--a right of appeal to the Federal courts. \nAnybody denied permission to buy a gun has a right of appeal. So the \nrule no-fly, no gun is based on common sense and legal, constitutional \nrights.\n  No right, in fact, is absolute. Whether it is the First Amendment or \nany other right, there is the guarantee in the Constitution that there \nwill be reasonable restrictions, when necessary, to protect the public \ninterests, and here is a case of the public interests clearly deserving \nthis protection. If there are problems with any individual being on the \nlist, challenge it, but clearly having to wait 72 hours for that check \nand for the denial of permission to go forward is unreasonable.\n  I urge that we move forward with this commonsense protection for the \npublic. I am hard-pressed to think of a more clear and staggering \nexample of the gun lobby's influence than the defeat of this bill.\n  Plainly, the vote last week showed that the gun lobby unfortunately \nstill has a staggering stranglehold on this process. When it comes to \nlaw enforcement, they are on our side.\n  I urge our colleagues to heed this reasonable request: No fly, no \ngun. If you are on that no-fly list, if you are too dangerous to fly \nand to board a plane, the Constitution says this reasonable restriction \nshould be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 \nminutes. I understand that wasn't in the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, when I was a prosecutor, we had one \nstraightforward goal: Convict the guilty and protect the innocent. To \nme, that simple mission still holds true. We must make our world safer \nby rooting out evil in our midst, while still protecting the rights of \npeople who mean no harm. Those 14 people in San Bernardino, that \nAmerican aid worker killed in Mali, those innocent families whose plane \nexploded over Egypt, and those young people killed and maimed in Paris \ndeserve nothing less.\n  That means, of course, taking out evil at its roots, increasing our \nefforts, and leading an international coalition against ISIS, and it \nmeans keeping our homeland safe. Part of that is tightening the Visa \nWaiver Program, and some of it is the work that must be done on \nencryption. But there is one commonsense way to get at this terror that \nI join my colleagues in supporting today--commonsense action to close a \ndangerous loophole that allows suspected terrorists to illegally buy \nguns in the United States.\n  Incredibly, current U.S. law does not prevent individuals who are on \nterror watch lists from purchasing guns. A total of 2,233 people on the \nwatch list tried to buy guns in our country between 2004 and 2014, and \nmore than 2,000--or 91 percent of them--cleared a background check \naccording to the information from the Government Accountability Office.\n  I am a cosponsor--and have been before these tragic events of the \nlast few weeks--of Senator Feinstein's bill to close this loophole. \nDuring last week's budget debate, I joined 25 of my Senate colleagues \nin offering an amendment that would also have stopped these dangerous \nindividuals from buying firearms and explosives.\n  Passing legislation to ensure that suspected terrorists cannot buy \nguns has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, where \nRepublican Congressman Peter King of New York has long advocated for \nthis change.\n  As we work to fight terrorists abroad, as we work to stop the \nrecruitment in our own country--which I know well from my own State of \nMinnesota, where we have over a dozen cases and indictments against \nthose who were trying to go to fight with ISIS and others who were \ngoing to fight with al-Shabaab--we have been very aggressive in going \nafter those cases as well as working to prevent recruitment from \noccurring in the first place.\n  This is all a piece of a very difficult puzzle, but to close our eyes \nand say that people on a terror watch list can go out and buy a gun is \nwrong. We need to do everything we can to ensure that those suspected \nof terrorist activities cannot buy guns in the United States. I am \nhopeful the Senate can come together to advance this commonsense \nnational security measure to keep lethal weapons out of the wrong \nhands.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am here to join my colleagues in our \ncall to bring for debate and vote on the Senate floor a measure that is \nsupported, I would argue, by probably 95 to 99 percent of my \nconstituents, and that is the simple idea that if you are on a \nterrorist watch list, if you are suspected of being involved in \nterrorist activities, you shouldn't be able to purchase a gun. I will \nbe asking for a unanimous consent agreement in order to move this \ndebate to the floor.\n  Here is why it matters. What we know right now is that over the last \n12\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\nmonths ISIS has lost about 25 percent of their territory in Iraq and \nSyria. That is not good enough, and hopefully we will be able to join \ntogether to put even more pressure on the so-called caliphate, to \nshrink it down eventually to elimination. But the growth of ISIS is \ndependent on two narratives. One is a narrative that the so-called \ncaliphate is growing, and second, the narrative that the East is at war \nwith the West, that the Muslim world is at war with the Christian \nworld. As the first narrative becomes less powerful, the second one \nbecomes even more important. So, as shocking as Paris was, as shocking \nas San Bernardino was, it is not surprising in the respect that these \nattacks outside of Syria and Iraq are now becoming more important, more \nnecessary to this terror organization in order to perpetuate this \nsecond set of mythology around the Islamic world being at war with the \nChristian world.\n  Now is the moment that Republicans and Democrats have to come \ntogether around hardening our country from potential attackers and \npotential attacks and recognize that because these attacks may be more \nimportant than ever before to the future expansion of ISIS, we have to \ntake steps to make sure they don't occur. One of the simplest ways we \ncan do that is embodied in Senator Feinstein's piece of legislation. \nLet's just say together that those who are on the terrorist watch \nlist--and this is a list you get on if you have reason for the FBI or \nother law enforcement to believe you are affiliated in some way, shape, \nor form with a terrorist organization. You may not have committed a \ncrime yet, but you have had communications or affiliations with \nterrorist organizations. Let's just agree that people on that list \nshould by default be prohibited from buying guns.\n  Importantly, the bill has in it provisions that would allow for those \nindividuals to get off that list, to be able to say that they were put \non it mistakenly. But let's say as a default premise that if you are on \na terrorist watch list, you shouldn't be able to purchase a gun.\n  Recent polling tells us that the vast overwhelming majority of \nAmericans support this law. In addition, the vast overwhelming majority \nof American gun owners support this law, in part because they have seen \nstatistics. It bears repeating. My colleagues have talked about these \nnumbers, but they really are stunning.\n  Over the last 10 years, someone on the terrorist watch list has \nattempted to purchase a weapon 2,223 times. In 2,043 of those \ninstances, they were successful in purchasing the weapon, taking it \nhome. That is a 91-percent success rate. It may be that 1 or 2 of those \n2,000 shouldn't have been on that list, but this legislation gives them \nthe power to contest that and to get off that list eventually, as it \nshould. But let's not live in a fantasy world in which the majority of \npeople on that list shouldn't be there. The list isn't foolproof, but \nthe vast majority--95 percent, 99 percent--of those on the terrorist \nwatch list are there with reason, and they shouldn't be able to walk \nout of a store with a weapon. That is why three-quarters of gun owners \nand 90 percent of Americans support this legislation.\n  While today it has become partisan--Republicans are standing almost \nin lockstep against a bill that stops terrorists from getting guns--\nhistorically this has been bipartisan. This was initially proposed by \nPresident Bush and then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Let's make \nit bipartisan again. Today on the floor of the Senate, let's decide \nthat we are going to have a debate on this and that we are going to \nbring it for a vote because that is where the majority of our \nconstituents are. They want us to take steps together to stop \nterrorists from getting guns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 551 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; I further ask that the \nbill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would the \nSenator modify the request to include the Cornyn substitute amendment \nwhich is at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that this substitute would require the Federal Government \nto go to court in order to stop someone on the terrorist watch list \nfrom purchasing a weapon. As a default, we should all agree that if you \nare on the terrorist watch list, you can't walk out of a gun store with \na gun and that it simply shouldn't be incumbent on the Federal \nGovernment to go through a court process in order to stop you from \ndoing that. If you shouldn't be on the list, there are ways you can get \noff the list. But there is absolutely no reason to delay the process of \nstopping one of these would-be terrorists from getting a gun by \nrequiring a complicated court process every time someone on the \nterrorist watch list walks into a gun store. For that reason, Mr. \nPresident, I object to the motion to modify.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am astonished by the proposition of our \nfriend the Senator from Connecticut that you can be on a secret watch \nlist by the Federal Government, and just by virtue of this secret \nlisting of an individual on a government watch list, you can be denied \nsome of your core constitutional rights without any necessity of the \ngovernment establishing probable cause or producing any evidence that \nwould justify the denial of a core constitutional right. I guess if it \nis good enough to take the government's word by this list without proof \nor showing of probable cause to deny a citizen their constitutional \nrights under the Second Amendment, then I guess that is good enough to \ndeny a citizen's right to worship according to the dictates of their \nconscience, freedom of speech, freedom of association, and all of the \nother rights enumerated in the Constitution. It is an outrageous \nproposition.\n  I would say to my friend, if these people on this government watch \nlist are truly dangerous, why isn't the Obama administration and the \nObama Justice Department indicting them, taking them to court, trying \nthem, and convicting them of crimes? Instead, you have this secret \nwatch list, without any proof, without any evidence.\n  I would just say that the Senator has mischaracterized the amendment \nwhich I proposed last week and which I have now offered by unanimous \nconsent.\n  What would happen is, if an individual on the watch list goes in to \npurchase a gun, there would be the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System, which would then access the watch list. If the Department \nof Justice was worried, based on that notice, that somebody was \nattempting to buy a gun, they could intervene for 72 hours to stop the \nindividual from purchasing the gun. If they were further worried about \nthis individual, they could go to court and, before a Federal judge, \nproduce evidence to justify the detention of that individual to take \nthem off the street. This is a complete response to the concerns raised \nby our friends across the aisle.\n  But I will tell you what is really motivating all of this. First of \nall, the Feinstein amendment which was offered last week was a complete \nsubstitute to the ObamaCare repeal bill that we voted on and passed \nlast week. As such, this was a surreptitious means to try to defeat our \nability to repeal the abomination known as ObamaCare, which has only a \n37-percent approval rating, and our colleagues across the aisle knew \nthat. Under the Senate procedures, a complete substitute to the \nreconciliation bill that we passed last week would have been \naccomplished if the Feinstein amendment had been agreed to.\n  But they went even further and are trying to distract the American \npeople from the fact that the President of the United States and \nCommander in Chief has absolutely no strategy to deal with the threat \nof ISIS here in the United States. I presume the immediate motivation \nwas what happened in San Bernardino, the terrible tragedy, but our \ncolleagues across the aisle are trying to capitalize on that particular\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\ntragedy in order to justify this unconstitutional attempt to deny \nAmerican citizens their core constitutional rights without any proof \nand without any evidence.\n  I would just add that if our friends across the aisle think this \nwatch list is so perfect and so infallible, they ought to read an \neditorial that was produced by the New York Times in 2014 where the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union and others objected to the watch list as \nbeing a secret government list without any evidence or any proof. They \ncited a 2007 audit of the 71,000 people on the government watch list \nand noted that half of those 71,000 were erroneously included in the \nwatch list.\n  So we all understand what is going on here. This isn't about finding \nsolutions to real problems; this is about trying to change the subject \nand to distract the American people from the fact that the President \nand this administration have absolutely no strategy to deal with the \nthreat of ISIS and the President tells us merely to stay the course. So \nI understand what is going on.\n  I also would say that the other main purpose of our friends across \nthe aisle, other than to defeat our ability to repeal ObamaCare, which \nwe successfully did in the Senate last week, is to create a ``gotcha'' \nmoment for Senators and candidates who are running in 2016. Already, \nthe Senator from Connecticut has appeared on national news shows, the \nPresident of the United States in his weekly speech to the Nation, and \nthe Senate Democratic leader have already misrepresented what was in \nthe Cornyn substitute to the Feinstein amendment last week to suggest \nthat people who voted against the Feinstein amendment really, really \nwanted to make sure that terrorists got guns. That is an outrageous \naccusation, and it is as false as it is outrageous.\n  So I think it is pretty obvious what is going on here. This is an \neffort to undermine our ability to repeal ObamaCare. It is an effort to \ndistract from the fact that the President of the United States, the \nCommander in Chief, has no strategy to defeat ISIS. In fact, the \nDemocratic leader said yesterday that really what we need is an ISIS \nczar. An ISIS czar? I thought that is the job of the Commander in \nChief, the President of the United States, to fight and win the \nNation's wars and to keep us safe here at home. Give me a break. Then \nthis foolish idea that we ought to simply take the Federal Government's \nword without any proof or any necessity of producing evidence in a \ncourt of law and meeting some basic minimal legal standard before we \ndeny American citizens their core constitutional rights is just \noutrageous.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is pretty obvious what is going on \nhere, and I am happy to have the American people render their judgment. \nFor that reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The Senator is correct that last week Senate Democrats thought that \nit was more important to talk about terrorism than it was to talk about \nthe repeal of the Affordable Care Act for the 16th time in the U.S. \nSenate, 55, 60 times in the House of Representatives. We did think it \nwas more important last week to talk about stopping terrorists from \ngetting weapons. I am sorry we didn't find that bipartisan consensus \nlast week.\n  What we are talking about here today is a different threat than we \nhave ever seen before, and what we want to do is to stop terrorism \nbefore it happens.\n  The Senator from Texas is right that many of the individuals on the \nterrorist watch list have not committed a crime, but in order to get on \nthe terrorist watch list, you have to have been in communication with \nthose who are trying to create radical jihad here in the United States. \nBy denying those individuals from getting a weapon, you are serving to \nprevent a terrorist attack from happening.\n  Why would we wait until after the terrorist attack has occurred in \norder to stop that individual from buying a gun? It is too late at that \npoint.\n  This bill includes provisions to get off that list if you are not on \nit, so it is perfectly observant of our tradition of supporting the \nrights of law-abiding citizens to buy and purchase a weapon. But to \nsuggest that the only pathway to stopping an individual from buying a \nweapon is a criminal prosecution when we know there are people right \nnow in the United States who are in contact with radical ideologies and \nmay be contemplating attacks against the United States misunderstands \nthe way in which we are going to prevent future terrorist attacks from \nhappening in this country.\n  This notion that those of us who want to change the law in order to \nbetter protect Americans are capitalizing on a tragedy is ridiculous \nand it is insulting, frankly. There are a lot of people who say: Well, \nwhen it comes to guns, you can't talk about policy changes right after \na mass shooting.\n  On average, there has been a mass shooting every single day in this \ncountry. If you had to wait 24 hours or 48 hours to talk about \nstrategies--such as preventing terrorists from buying guns--that would \nkeep this country safe after a mass shooting, then you would never talk \nabout ways to keep this country safe because every day there are mass \nshootings separate and aside from the 80 people who die each day from \nthe drip, drip, drip of gun violence all across this country.\n  I don't think any of us mean to suggest, as the Senator from Texas \nsaid, that those who oppose this bill, which is supported by three-\nquarters of American gun owners and 90 percent of Americans, are \nrooting for terrorists to get guns. That is not what I am saying. What \nI am saying is that those who oppose this are more concerned with \nprotecting the rights of potential terrorists than they are with \nprotecting this country. That is what we are talking about.\n  We are worried about the rights of people on the terrorist watch list \nmore than we are about taking steps to protect this country. What we \nare talking about is a temporary inconvenience. If somebody is on this \nwatch list who shouldn't be--and it is a very small number--then \nthrough this legislation they have a means to get off that list. They \nhave to wait a couple of days, maybe a couple of weeks, in order to buy \na weapon. A tiny number of people who are inconvenienced is the cost; \nprotecting the country from a potential terrorist attack is the \nbenefit. That is a trade that my constituents would take in a \nheartbeat.\n  I am sorry that we aren't able to proceed with debate on this bill, \nbut I think I can speak for my colleagues that we will be back on the \nfloor in the days, the weeks, and the months to come to continue to ask \nfor a vote on simple legislation to make sure that potential terrorists \ncannot get their hands on dangerous life-ending weapons.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8457-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of the \nbipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act. I commend Chairman Alexander, \nRanking Member Murray, and their counterparts in the House, Chairman \nKline and Ranking Member Scott, for their commitment to finding common \nground and a path forward on this critical legislation.\n  When President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct into law 50 years ago, he noted that ``from our very beginnings as \na nation, we have felt a fierce commitment to the ideal of education \nfor everyone. It fixed itself into our democratic creed.''\n  Yet many communities today across the Nation, including my home State \nof Rhode Island, are still wrestling with how to address large \nachievement\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\ngaps based on wealth, race, ethnicity, and disability status. \nUnderlying the achievement gaps we see are gaps in opportunity. We need \nto ensure our students have access to critical resources for learning, \nstrong teachers, counselors, and principals, a well-balanced program of \nstudy that includes arts, humanities, and environmental education, and \nsafe, healthy schools equipped with libraries, technology, and science \nlabs. We also need to support and promote greater parental engagement. \nThese are the issues I have focused on for many years, and I am very \npleased that the Every Student Succeeds Act makes important \nimprovements in all of these areas.\n  This legislation will replace the badly flawed and increasingly \nunworkable No Child Left Behind Act with a new framework--one that \nstays true to the transparency and focus on closing achievement gaps \nthat were the hallmarks of No Child Left Behind while eliminating the \none-size-fits-all approach to school improvement and allowing States to \ndevelop more holistic and robust accountability systems that move \nbeyond test scores as the sole measure of school success.\n  Increasing accountability for resource equity was the goal of the \nfirst bill I introduced this Congress--the Core Opportunity Resources \nfor Equity and Excellence Act. I worked with Senators Baldwin, Brown, \nand Kirk to push for its provisions on the Senate floor, and I am \npleased the conference report includes stronger measures to require \nthat school districts address resource inequities in schools identified \nfor comprehensive support and improvement than were even in the bill we \npassed initially in the Senate.\n  The original Elementary and Secondary Education Act recognized the \nvital role school libraries play in supporting student success, and \nthis is an area I have worked on during several of the past \nreauthorizations of this law. Senator Cochran and I introduced the \nStrengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries--or SKILLS--Act \nto ensure that Federal resources continue to support student access to \neffective school library programs. The Every Student Succeeds Act \nincludes key provisions from our legislation, including authorizing \ngrants for high-need school districts to support effective school \nlibrary programs and including support for such programs in school \ndistrict level title I and professional development plans.\n  In addition to school libraries, children need to have access to \nbooks in their homes from a very early age. Senator Grassley and I \nintroduced the Prescribe A Book Act to help address this issue, and I \nam glad key provisions of that legislation are included here.\n  We know teachers and principals are two of the most important in-\nschool factors related to student achievement. It is essential that \nteachers, principals, and other educators have a comprehensive system \nthat supports their professional growth and development, starting on \nday one and continuing throughout their careers. Senator Casey and I \nintroduced the Better Education Support and Training Act to create such \na system. Again, I am pleased that the Every Student Succeeds Act \nincludes many of the provisions of our legislation, particularly the \nfocus on equitable access to experienced and effective educators.\n  However, I remain concerned that the failure in this legislation to \ndefine ``inexperienced teacher'' could mask inequities and limit the \nusefulness of the reporting and that some of the provisions related to \neducator preparation could lower standards in our highest need schools. \nSoon I will be introducing legislation to strengthen educator \npreparation and ensure that teachers in our high-need schools are \nprofession-ready.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act also supports access for all children \nto a well-rounded education, including environmental literacy, as I \nproposed in the No Child Left Inside Act. Family engagement is another \ncritical area this bill addresses. This legislation will support more \nmeaningful, evidence-based family engagement, encourage school \ndistricts to dedicate more resources to these activities, and provide a \nstatewide system of technical assistance for family engagement--similar \nto the Family Engagement in Education Act I introduced with Senators \nCoons and Whitehouse.\n  Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray have demonstrated extraordinary \nleadership in crafting this legislation and steering it through an open \nand inclusive process. This bill is an important step forward, and I \nencourage all my colleagues to support it. Moreover, I hope this spirit \nof bipartisanship and compromise will also translate to the \nappropriations process and result in robust resources to implement the \nnew and vastly improved law.\n  Mr. President, I also thank Senator Collins for graciously letting me \ngo ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan Every \nStudent Succeeds Act. This is landmark legislation that would reform \nand reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known \nas No Child Left Behind. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, and as a member of the conference committee \nthat resolved the differences between the two bodies' versions of their \neducation reform bills, I want to particularly applaud the leadership \nof Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for doing a truly \nextraordinary job in putting together the bipartisan, bicameral reform \nbill that is before us today.\n  Congressional action to fix the serious flaws with No Child Left \nBehind, while preserving the valuable parts of the law, is long \noverdue, but that day has finally arrived. NCLB was well-intentioned, \nand its focus on the education of every child and greater transparency \nin the performance of our schools were welcomed reforms, but some of \nthe law's provisions were simply unachievable and thus discouraging to \nteachers, parents, administrators, and students alike.\n  The current system of unattainable standards and a patchwork of State \nwaivers has led to confusion about Federal requirements. High-stakes \ntesting and unrealistic 100 percent proficiency goals do not raise \naspirations; instead, they dispirit those who are committed to a high-\nquality education for our students.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act returns much needed flexibility to the \nState departments of education and to local school districts. The bill \nwould remove the high-stakes accountability system that was simply \nproven to be unworkable under No Child Left Behind. Instead, the bill \nwould empower States to set the goals for their schools and students \nand design ways to improve student achievement. The bill would also \neliminate the burdensome, overly prescriptive parts of No Child Left \nBehind, such as the definition of a ``highly qualified teacher,'' which \nis a perfect example of something that sounds great but in fact proved \nunworkable in many of the small and rural schools in my State where \nteachers are called upon to teach a wide range of subjects.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act would also reauthorize the Rural \nEducation Achievement Program, known as REAP. I coauthored this law \nwith former Senator Kent Conrad back in 2002. Students in rural America \nshould have the same access to Federal grant dollars as those who \nattend schools in larger urban and suburban communities. Most Federal \ncompetitive grant programs, however, favor larger school districts \nbecause they are the ones that have the ability to hire grant writers \nto apply for those grants, even though that extra money may be needed \nmore by a small rural school. As a result, rural school districts often \nhad to forgo funding because they simply lacked the capacity to apply \nfor the grants. That is the problem the Rural Education Achievement \nProgram Act was intended to solve, and it has provided financial \nassistance to both schools and districts to help them address their \nunique local needs.\n  This program has helped to support new technology in classrooms, \ndistance learning opportunities, and professional development programs, \nas well as an array of other activities that benefit students and \nteachers in rural schools. Since the law was enacted in 2002, at least \n120 Maine school districts have collectively received more than $42 \nmillion from the REAP program. When I talk to those small Maine school \ndistricts, they have been enormously creative in using REAP money\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nto improve the education of their students. They have told me that \nwithout the law that Senator Kent Conrad and I authored back in 2002, \nin many cases they would not have been able to introduce technology \ninto the classroom, to further professional development for their \nteachers or to provide special enrichment activities for their \nstudents. That law has been a real success, and I am delighted that \nthis bill reauthorizes it.\n  I also want to highlight that the final version retains a Senate \nprovision authorizing a pilot program that I worked on with several of \nmy colleagues to require the Secretary of Education to allow seven \nStates to designate alternative assessment systems based on student \nproficiency and not just on traditional tests. Such systems can give \nteachers, parents, and students a much fuller understanding of each \nstudent's abilities and better prepares them for the college or career \npath of their choice. The Federal Government should cooperate with \nStates and school districts that are designing brand new assessment \nsystems, and this pilot program is an important step in that direction.\n  Providing a good education for every child must remain a national \npriority so each child fulfills his or her full potential, has a wide \nrange of opportunities, and can succeed in an increasingly competitive \neconomy.\n  From having visited more than 200 schools in my State, I know this \nlegislation will be welcomed indeed. The Every Student Succeeds Act \nhonors these guiding principles while returning greater control and \nflexibility to States and local school districts, where it belongs. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this landmark legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President in the opening scene of ``Star Wars: Return \nof the Jedi,'' Darth Vader pays an unexpected visit to the construction \nsite of the new Death Star. Of course it was behind schedule and \nprobably overbudget. The commander in charge first claimed that there \nwas no delay, and then he said to Darth Vader that it would be \nimpossible to meet the schedule without more resources. Darth Vader \nwarned the commander that the emperor was ``much displeased'' with the \napparent lack of progress, noting that ``the emperor is not as \nforgiving as I am.''\n  Government projects being overbudget and behind schedule or just out \nof this world are not just a problem for the emperor in that galaxy \nfar, far away; they are a problem right here on Earth.\n  Our own space agency, NASA, can no longer even launch astronauts into \norbit, yet NASA is spending $1.2 million to study the impact of \nmicrogravity on sheep. NASA is also spending $280,000 to develop plans \nto build a cloud city on Venus. It is strikingly similar to the cloud \ncity that was featured in ``Star Wars: The Emperor Strikes Back'' where \nHan Solo was captured in carbonite.\n  The National Science Foundation is spending $2.6 million in part to \ndesign sculptures that would raise awareness of drought and harvest \ndew, much like the moisture vaporizers on Luke Skywalker's home planet \nof Tatooine.\n  The Pentagon is spending $2 million to teach robots how to play jazz \nand $2.5 million in part to create a robot lobby greeter. These are not \nthe droids taxpayers were looking for.\n  These are just a few of the examples of projects featured in \n``Wastebook: The Farce Awakens,'' which I will release today. This is a \nspoiler alert, so if you don't want the plot to be ruined, you may want \nto tune out right now.\n  Let's walk through some of these other ``Wastebook'' entries. They \ninclude $1 million to put monkeys in hamster balls on a treadmill. A \ncouple of years ago, Senator Tom Coburn famously found the example of \nthe study of shrimp on treadmills underwater, but I think this outdoes \nit. Now we have monkeys not only on a treadmill but monkeys in a \nhamster ball on a treadmill--$1 million for that study.\n  We are spending $5 million to throw parties for hipsters. These \nparties for hipsters are an attempt--and how we define a hipster is \nquite a work of art as well--to try to keep them from smoking. They \nadmit that it didn't succeed very well, so they ended up just giving \nout cash to try to induce hipsters to stop smoking. Good work if you \ncan get it, I guess.\n  Another $43 million went to build a single gas station in Afghanistan \nthat dispenses a type of fuel--natural gas in this case--that very few \nautomobiles in the country can even run on.\n  Despite all of the public ballyhooing over budget austerity, \nWashington didn't come up short on outlandish ways to spend and waste \nmoney in 2015. All of the examples in the ``Wastebook'' we have here \nhad to have money spent during 2015.\n  Unfortunately, there is a lot of talk about the gridlock in \nWashington, but no matter how bad the gridlock gets or how bad it \nappears, there is always one area of agreement here between the \nparties, and that is to spend more money. For example, at the end of \nOctober Congress passed a budget deal that cut $3 billion in taxpayer-\nfunded subsidies to private insurance companies that service Federal \ncrop insurance policies. That deal was sold, in part, on the savings \ngenerated through the spending cut. Last week, this body voted \noverwhelmingly to restore all $3 billion of those crop insurance \nsubsidies, which, again, only go to private insurance companies. This \nwas part of the highway bill that came to the floor. So spending that \nwe had cut just a month ago in the budget deal was reversed 36 days \nlater in an agreement that passed even before we passed the original \nbill to obliterate these savings. So it took Congress only 36 days to \ngo back on these cuts. I am not sure that the Millennium Falcon can \npull a 360 with that kind of ease.\n  Washington equates caring with the amount of dollars spent, but no \namount of dollars and cents can make up for the lack of common sense in \nhow millions of dollars of taxpayer money is being spent.\n  Consider this: We outline in the ``Wastebook'' more than $2 million \nspent this year by the Agency for International Development, USAID, to \npromote tourism in Lebanon. Lebanon is the same country that our State \nDepartment has warned American tourists not to go to. We are spending \n$2 million in one agency to promote tourism to a country that another \nagency, the State Department, says: Please don't go there for tourism. \nWhat kind of sense does that make? Suicide bombers have killed more \nthan 60 people and injured hundreds more in the last 2 years there. It \nis no wonder the State Department is saying don't go, but the Agency \nfor International Development is spending $2 million to say: Please go \nthere for tourism.\n  The Department of Homeland Security spent $3 million on party buses \nand luxury coaches to go to the playground of the rich and famous. \nTaxpayer money is being spent on buses and luxury coaches to go to the \nplayground of the rich and famous by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. How does that make sense?\n  This one puzzles me. The Department of Housing and Urban Development \nis spending more than $104 million a year subsidizing the rent of the \nwell-off, including those who make better than six-figure incomes and \nhave millions of dollars in assets, while 300,000 low-income families \nare on waiting lists for housing assistance. So we are spending $104 \nmillion to subsidize those with six-figure incomes to live in public \nhousing while 300,000 people who are truly low income wait on a waiting \nlist. Somebody at one of the local housing authorities was asked why we \ndon't just kick out the people who have incomes far too high to \nqualify. The answer was revealing. He said: We can't do that because \nthey serve as role models for those who are truly low income in those \nfacilities. Think about that. Those who are fleecing the taxpayers are \nrole models for those in public housing who actually have low income.\n  As I mentioned before, the Pentagon is spending $2 million to teach \nrobots how to play jazz music. The Department of Agriculture spent \n$68,000 in foreign food aid to send a group to the Great American Beer \nFestival to promote beer in Vietnam. So we spent\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\n$68,000 in foreign food aid to have a bunch of people go to the Great \nAmerican Beer Festival.\n  The National Institutes of Health spent about $1 million, as I \nmentioned, on the monkey-on-a-treadmill study. The purpose of this \nresearch was to determine if other studies could be conducted of \nmonkeys on treadmills. I think everybody will have to agree that this \nis totally bananas. I mean, we can't continue to spend money like this.\n  Many other taxpayer-funded science projects sounded like they were \nconcocted in a frat house rather than a government research agency, \nlike the next example. The National Science Foundation spent $103 \nmillion to study if koozies really keep a cool drink in a can cool or \nif it is just wishful thinking. I think we have had plenty of studies \non evaporation and condensation to know what really happens, but these \nstudies were conducted with a koozie in somebody's bathroom or laundry \nroom somewhere. It doesn't really qualify as serious science. Yet we \nspent $1.3 million on a grant to do just that. You have to watch the \nvideo. You have to see it.\n  The National Institute for Drug Abuse spent nearly $1 million to \nprove that pizza is as addictive as crack. The result of the study will \nbe a surprise to no one.\n  The NSF is spending over $1 million on dating studies, including why \nattractive people date those who are not attractive and what makes \nthose looking for love online ``swipe right'' and pursue a romantic \nrelationship. Why in the world we are allowing the NSF to spend money \non dating studies in order to find out why people, like my wife, would \ndate somebody less attractive, like me--I mean, some of these things we \nwill just have to let go and not spend taxpayer money on them.\n  These price tags are pocket change to the big spenders in Washington \nwho collectively burn through $7 million a minute, as we all know. \nNobody can really keep track of how or why some of this money is spent. \nThe purpose for ``Wastebook'' this year--it was created to do our best \nto hold those accountable who are spending this money.\n  In his farewell address a year ago, Senator Tom Coburn, who created \n``Wastebook,'' challenged every Member of Congress to produce their own \n``Wastebook'' and start a real debate about national spending and \nbudget priorities. While it is impossible to emulate or replace Dr. \nCoburn, he has given us a great example to follow.\n  As a longtime admirer, former colleague, and friend of Dr. Coburn, I \nfeel it is a great and heavy responsibility to join others, like \nSenator James Lankford and John McCain, in carrying forward the Coburn \nlegacy of stopping wasteful Washington spending and bringing some kind \nof oversight to this. Colleagues can find the full list of 100 \n``Wastebook'' entries on my Web site as well.\n  As you glance through it, ask yourself if the Federal Government is \nreally being as frugal and as underfunded as it claims to be. Ask \nyourself: Are we really cutting to the bone? Is there no more fat left \nto cut? We hear that continually. Sequester-level spending has brought \nus to the brink so there is just nowhere else to cut.\n  It is my hope--my only hope--that this report gives Congress \nsomething to Chewie on--and the end of bad puns, too, I hope--before \ndebt- and deficit-saddled taxpayers finally strike back at this lunacy.\n  I commend this ``Wastebook'' to all who will read it. As I mentioned, \nyou can reach it on our Web site as well.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Every Student \nSucceeds Act. I know we have had one vote on this today already, and we \nwill have another vote tomorrow.\n  I will begin by applauding Senators Murray and Alexander and \nCongressmen Klein and Scott for reaching across the aisle and working \nwith their committee colleagues and the Members of both bodies to \nfixing a long expired and broken law. I think we all understand that \neducation is key to both individual success and to our economic \nsuccess.\n  ESSA gives parents, school districts, and States flexibility to close \nthe achievement gaps that the No Child Left Behind helped us explore. \nESSA maintains critical assessment requirements, but it also requires \nschools to track the progress of every child while also allowing States \nand school districts to set their own goals for improvement and \ndetermine what interventions are best when these achievement gaps \npersist. It invests in early childhood education, it permanently \nauthorizes the Preschool Development Grant Program, and Virginia was \none of the first States to receive a challenge grant. The bill \nrecognizes there are factors other than test scores that describe \nstudents' success, and that is a significant advance past No Child Left \nBehind.\n  I rise particularly because I am proud that a number of provisions \nthat I worked on and that the Presiding Officer worked on were included \nin the final bill. Let me talk about two of them: Teach safe \nrelationships and career and technical education.\n  Senator McCaskill and I introduced a bill called the Teach Safe \nRelationships Act that came out of a conversation that I had with \nstudents a year ago at the University of Virginia. These students were \nmembers of a student organization called One Less, which advocates for \nsurvivors of campus rape and sexual assault.\n  There had been a story in the Rolling Stone magazine about the \nscourge of campus sexual assault. Many of the statistics were correct, \nbut the story was controversial because it focused on a particular \nallegation of sexual assault that was later discredited, and Rolling \nStone retracted the article.\n  I sat down with a group of about 30 students--no press, no faculty, \nno administrators--to talk about the problem of campus sexual assault. \nIt has been a long time since I was a college student, and I wanted to \nhear them talk about the challenges they face. It was a robust \ndiscussion. These students didn't all agree with each other about \nvarious points. But the goal was to get a sense from them about what we \nin Congress could do that would be helpful and what were things that we \nmight want to do that would make us feel good but that wouldn't be \nhelpful.\n  Many great ideas came out of that discussion, but there was one in \nparticular that grabbed my attention. Students talked about the fact \nthat they wished when they came to college, living away from home for \nthe first time in their lives, that they knew more about issues such as \ncoercion or consent to intimate behavior or especially where to go for \nhelp or what to do if you felt like somebody was pressuring you. I kind \nof naively said to the students: Well, don't you have an orientation \nabout sexual assault? And they said: We do. Here is what it is. It is \n15 minutes about campus sexual assault, and it is 15 minutes about not \ngetting too many credit cards, and it is 15 minutes about not drinking \ntoo much. Basically, we are new on campus, and it is just not enough.\n  Then I asked a follow up question: Don't you learn about this in sex \ned classes in high school? One of the young ladies in the room said: We \nget a sex ed curriculum in high school, but it is about reproductive \nbiology, not about behaviors and relationships and strategies and sort \nof the right and wrong issues. I thought that was really interesting.\n  So I came back after hearing from them--and, again, I honor these \nstudents, because from the idea to the passage, hopefully tomorrow, it \nhas been a year from hearing from them, and now, because of them, there \nis going to be an important advance in public safety.\n  What the students basically forced me to do was to come back and \nanalyze the problem of sexual assault. We have been dealing with it in \nthe military. We deal with it on college campuses. We deal with it in \nthe society at large. We can either have strategies that are specific \nto the military or college campuses or the workplace or society, or we \ncan actually acknowledge campus sexual assault.\n  Instead of focusing on where it happens, let's focus on when it \nhappens. If you are a young person--let me put it differently. The most \nlikely time in your life when you will be a victim of a sexual assault \nis age 16 to 24. It doesn't make a difference whether you are in the \nmilitary or on a college campus or anywhere else. It is at a time in \nyour life when you are kind of new to\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\nadult sexuality issues and kind of grappling with it that you are most \nlikely to be a victim of sexual assaults, and also many perpetrators of \nsexual assaults are in the same age range.\n  The students said: What if we had better education in the K-12 space. \nIn February, Senator McCaskill and I introduced a bill taking the \ncampus sexual assault problem and trying to do something about it \nduring the K-12 educational timeframe, and we called it the Teach Safe \nRelationships Act. The bill was rolled into the Senate version of the \nrewrite of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the final \ncompromise conference report includes it. Provisions are included so \nthat title IV Federal educational funding can now be used specifically \nfor instruction and training on safe relationship behavior among \nstudents, and this should help us deal with the issue of sexual \nassault.\n  I want to thank the conference committee for including it in the \nbill. It is my hope that school systems will now take advantage of this \ntitle IV funding--most school systems receive it--to prevent sexual \nassault not just on college campuses but for anybody in that age 16 to \n24 age range that is vulnerable.\n  Second, the Presiding Officer, Senator Baldwin, and I introduced a \nnumber of pieces of legislation dealing with career and technical \neducation that have been included in the bill. The provisions include \nencouragement to States to use more career readiness indicators in \ntheir accountability systems to define what educational success is. \nThis gives the States the opportunity to recognize schools that are \nsuccessfully preparing students for postsecondary education and \nworkforce tools such as technical skills and college credits. It \nshouldn't be just about performance on multiple choice tests. If you \nare getting a validated industry certificate or other measure of \nsuccess, that should count.\n  We encourage States and school districts to support the development \nof a specialized teacher core to help teachers integrate career and \ntechnical education into their normal academic subjects. We allow \nschools to use title IV funds for career counseling, programming, and \ntraining on local workforce needs, and for options for postsecondary \nand career pathways.\n  Finally, we include CTE in the definition of a well-rounded \neducation. Traditionally, under No Child Left Behind, it was just math, \nEnglish, social studies, and science. Career and technical education \nand some other subjects ought to be included in the definition of a \nwell-rounded education.\n  CTE is an important pathway for students to prepare for the workforce \nby integrating practical, applied purposes with work-based knowledge \nand hands-on learning experiences. I am the son of an iron worker and \nwelder. I ran a school in Honduras that taught kids to be carpenters \nand welders. I believe deeply in the power of CTE. In fact, I see it \nevery day across the Commonwealth of Virginia, just as I know the \nPresiding Officer sees it every day in the State of Ohio. Carroll \nCounty in rural, southern Virginia, right on the border with North \nCarolina, has a state-of-the-art agriculture CTE program, which I \nvisited this summer, set up with Virginia Tech, as good as any college \ncampus. It not only helps students who want to be farmers, but those \nstudents who want to be farmers suddenly find that when they are \nstudying soil chemistry in a CTE lab, their chemistry grades go up as \nwell.\n  In Ashburn I saw a robotics program in Loudoun County that was \nsuccessful. In Virginia Beach a CTE program helps students learn how to \nbuild houses, training them for construction careers, and the houses \nthey build are pretty impressive.\n  In closing, this year marks the 50th anniversary that President \nJohnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act into law. Our \nNation's prosperity is dependent upon students' educational success, \nand this rewrite is incredibly important. I am excited about the \nreauthorization and these provisions.\n  Again, I thank Senators Murray and Alexander and their staffs, and \nlet me extend thanks to my staff, two of whom are here. Let me extend \nthanks to my wife, who is the Secretary of Education in Virginia. She \nsat down with the committee staffs in the Senate to share some Virginia \nexperiences that then factored into the rewrite of the ultimate bill.\n  It is my hope that this is going to pass with a big bipartisan margin \ntomorrow. This is a tough, complicated area that was 8 years overdue to \nbe reauthorized because it is so controversial. Yet we found a path \nforward that is bipartisan, and that tells me we can do it not only on \nthis issue but on other issues as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Senate Accomplishments\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday I spent a few minutes talking \nabout the accomplishments of the 114th Congress, and what I have \ndiscovered is that if we don't talk about them, nobody else does. \nPeople have become so cynical about Washington and very distressed in \nso many ways--and I can certainly understand why--that it is important \nfor us to point out a few of the simple facts. It is not that we have \ncompletely turned this battleship around, but we have made this \nincremental progress under the leadership the American people put in \ncharge last November--the Republican leadership in the House and in the \nSenate, obviously, with a President of the opposite party.\n  Under the Constitution, the President still has a vote, he has a veto \npen, and he is not irrelevant. But notwithstanding the fact that we \nhave some well-publicized differences with the President, and even \namong Republicans and Democrats, I think in fairness we have to \nacknowledge that we have had a pretty good run in the last 11 months or \nso. I don't want to make this a partisan issue because frankly you \ncan't get anything done in the U.S. Senate or in the U.S. Congress or \nin the U.S. Government without bipartisan cooperation.\n\n  So on the bill we are working on today, the fix for No Child Left \nBehind, there is the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Murray, who has worked hand-in-\nglove with the chairman, Senator Alexander. We also had the pleasure of \nworking with Senator Murray on trade promotion authority and on the \nfirst human trafficking reform we have seen in about a quarter of a \ncentury. Those are all important pieces of legislation.\n  I think about the Intelligence Committee and the work that has been \ndone in this Congress on cyber attacks and cyber protection by Senator \nFeinstein from California, the ranking member, working hand-in-glove \nwith the chairman, Senator Burr from North Carolina.\n  On the first multiyear highway bill we have had in 10 years, that \nwould not have happened without the leadership of Chairman Inhofe and \nChairman Hatch on the Finance Committee but also, I would say, Barbara \nBoxer, the Senator from California, and Ron Wyden, the ranking member \non the Finance Committee.\n  We worked together on a number of other things that have not yet gone \nto the President's desk, such as criminal justice reform. I was invited \nto come to the White House, along with an ideological spectrum of \nSenators from the right to the left, to talk about criminal justice \nreform and how we can find consensus to deal with our criminal justice \nsystem and make our prison system no longer just a warehouse for human \nbeings but, rather, a place where, if people want the chance, want the \nopportunity to turn their lives around, they can begin that by \nparticipating in programs that will help them learn a skill, perhaps \ndeal with their drug or alcohol addiction or otherwise prepare them for \nreentry into civilized society.\n  So while leadership is important, and this agenda of trade promotion \nauthority, anti-human trafficking, cyber security, the highway bill, \ncriminal justice reform, and now education reform--none of this would \nhave necessarily been on the agenda if our friends across the aisle had \nbeen in charge. The fact is, leadership is important, and thanks to the \nmajority\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\nleader and the leadership he has provided, he has set the agenda. But, \nagain, nothing happens here in Washington on cyber security, on human \ntrafficking, on trade promotion authority, on education, on highways or \ncriminal justice reform without working together to find bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  So it is important that we acknowledge--and in fairness--what has \nbeen accomplished. That is not to say we are breaking our arm by \npatting ourselves on the back or that we think we have solved all the \nproblems. Certainly many of the major differences that existed last \nyear still exist, and we, frankly, have big disagreements with some of \nour friends across the aisle and with this President on things such as \nnational security, on the effectiveness--or I should say \nineffectiveness of the war to destroy ISIS and to deal with the terror \nthreat both abroad and back home. But we also ought to pause and say \nthat where we can find common ground, we are trying to do this on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  So tomorrow at about 10:45 a.m. we will be voting on an impressive \npiece of legislation that will bring effective education reform to help \nour Nation's children, their parents, and teachers. But it is not just \nabout education; as we frequently like to say, it is about an \ninvestment in the future of our country because we are talking about \nequipping the next generation with what they need to succeed in an \never-changing and ever-challenging world.\n  Back home in Texas, I have repeatedly seen how schools have created \ngroundbreaking, innovative programs for their students to thrive and \nbenefit everyone involved. I know I mentioned some of these programs \nbefore, like a camp for middle school students that focuses on science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math--what we frequently refer to as the \nSTEM fields--and it included building robots. In other words, learning \nscience can be fun too. I actually think that is what the best teachers \ndo--they make learning fun.\n  I saw a cutting-edge program at the United High School in Laredo, TX, \nwhich took advantage of the proximity of Laredo to the shale gas plays \nin South Texas. Actually, ninth grade students who were taking science \ncourses were learning the basics of petroleum geology so they would be \nequipped after they graduated from high school to get jobs in that \nfield, jobs that pay far more than minimum wage. They do that by \nstarting their education and by exposing them to this field in high \nschool and through internships and other training programs.\n  These programs are good examples of how the local community and some \nof the differences in the local economy--for example, the proximity of \nLaredo to the Eagle Ford Shale--can shape education in a way that \nbenefits students and the community, our States, and our country. The \nimportant thing to realize is that not all good ideas emanate from \nWashington, DC. In fact, the contrary is true.\n  Louis Brandeis, in an often-quoted statement, once called the States \nthe ``laboratories of democracy.'' The fact is, that is true. The \nStates are the place where innovation can occur. You can succeed or \nfail, as the case may be, and from that we can learn as a nation what \nthe best practices are in education and a whole raft of subjects.\n  Actually, the work we are doing in criminal justice reform is based \non successful reform done in places such as Texas and other States \naround the country. To my mind, that is the way we ought to legislate \nin Washington. We ought to try people's ideas out at the State and \nlocal level, and if they work, great. Then we may decide they may need \nto be scaled up and applied more broadly.\n  What we have seen and the mistake we have seen in the current \nadministration is to make experiments nationwide with a one-size-fits-\nall. We have seen that in ObamaCare, for example, where all of a sudden \nthe majority and the administration decided to transform one-sixth of \nthe American economy, of course making extravagant promises on what \nwould work, only to find that it couldn't work and didn't work, and \nthus those promises and selling points ended up not being true.\n  Again, on the topic of education, many of the things we realize do \nwork have been created with the help of local teachers, leaders, and \nparents. These communities were able to create programs that flourished \nbecause they weren't operating under a Federal Government mandate. In \nfact, they were freed of Federal interference in developing that \ncurriculum and coming up with something that works.\n  The bottom line is that this local ingenuity and response to \neducational needs can often trump ideas coming out of Washington, DC. \nFrankly, the ideas emanating from here prove to be impractical or \nideological in nature. The bureaucracy in Washington, despite even \ntheir best intentions, cannot meet the local educational needs of \nmillions of children across a vast and diverse country such as ours.\n  Our country is simply too big and too diverse to have a one-size-\nfits-all approach to anything, including education. That is why I am \ngrateful to Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, and everybody \nwho has participated in producing this conference report to a bill that \npassed the Senate this summer with more than 80 votes. It is called the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act and returns control of education decisions \nto States and local communities and to parents and to teachers. It does \na pretty good job--not a perfect job but a pretty good job--of keeping \nthe Federal Government out of the way.\n  I would add parenthetically that I think it is important to make the \npoints I am trying to make in these remarks today because I happen to \nhave a social media habit on Twitter and elsewhere, and I see a lot of \ninformation being spread that simply is not true about this legislation \nand other things. That is why I think it is important to stick with the \nfacts and explain to the American people and my constituents back home \nwhy I intend to enthusiastically support this legislation.\n  First of all, this bill allows States to decide the academic \nstandards and curriculum for their own children. This bill ends Federal \ntest-based accountability. It kills the national school board. It keeps \nthe opinions of the bureaucrats--even the well-meaning opinions that \nare misguided--out of our children's classrooms. Common core has proved \nto be a very controversial topic. This legislation ends common core and \naffirms that the States have the responsibility to decide what academic \nstandards they want to adopt and how to measure success.\n  By giving responsibility back to local communities and the States and \nparents and teachers, the Every Student Succeeds Act will allow each \nState and their school districts the flexibility they need to design \nand implement their own programs and systems according to the needs of \ntheir students and to innovate and to help us and the rest of the \ncountry learn from their experience.\n  States such as Texas can decide how to use federally mandated test \nresults to understand how a student performs. This not only relieves \nthe phenomenon known as teaching to the test, but it gives States the \nadded freedom to provide their students with the well-rounded education \nthey need to compete in an increasingly competitive and globalized \nworld.\n  Put simply, with this legislation, States can decide for themselves \nwhat standards, what curriculum, and what accountability measures they \nwant to adopt. I think we will see, as Justice Brandeis said, how those \nlaboratories of democracy work. I daresay those States, school \ndistricts, and students who prosper and do well will raise the bar for \neveryone else because they will have demonstrated what is possible \ngiven the freedom and the flexibility to innovate.\n  Another important element of this bill is that it rightfully limits \nthe power of the Secretary of Education. With this legislation, a \nSecretary of Education cannot mandate, cannot direct, and cannot \ncontrol a State or local education agency or require them to change \nwhat they teach in the classroom. That is up to the States and up to \nlocal school districts, parents, and teachers.\n  This bill will replace a law in need of reform, it will stop \nWashington from imposing common core on our classrooms, and it will let \nthose closest to our country's greatest asset--our children--decide how \nbest to provide for their education.\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\n  This bill passed the House of Representatives last week with a \ntremendous bipartisan vote. I hope to see a similar level of bipartisan \nenthusiasm here in the Senate as well when we vote to pass this \nconference report tomorrow morning, and I suspect we will.\n  As I said, this is the product of a lot of hard work by the chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--better known as \nthe HELP Committee--here in the Senate. Senator Alexander, the senior \nSenator from Tennessee, has been the navigator and leader in this \nlegislation, working closely, as I said earlier, with Senator Murray \nfrom Washington in a bipartisan way to find consensus on an often \ncontentious subject. I know he looks forward to passage of this \nlegislation tomorrow, as I do too, and to having the President sign it \nshortly thereafter.\n  As I said at the beginning, you can't do anything here in Congress or \nin Washington without bipartisan cooperation, but leadership does \nmatter because leaders set the agenda, they set the tone, and they hold \npeople accountable. I would say that under the leadership of Senator \nMcConnell, the senior Senator from Kentucky, the Senate has been able \nto begin the process once again of solving real problems for the \nAmerican people, from dealing with human trafficking, to our children's \neducation. I look forward to continuing this progress for the rest of \nthe week and for the rest of the year as well.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to offer \na few remarks on the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  To be honest, I wasn't sure we would ever reach this point, given the \noften contentious and sensitive nature of the educational debate, but \nit is only fitting that we have spent so much time and energy trying to \nget the best bill we can. After all, the future of our Nation depends \non it, our States depend on it, our schools depend on it, and our \nfamilies and children depend on it.\n  I credit the success of this bill to the diligent work of the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee, as well as \nthe chairman and ranking member of the House Education and the \nWorkforce Committee. As a former chairman of this committee myself, I \nknow how difficult it can be to strike a deal that is agreeable to both \nsides, but our committee leaders have done an outstanding job. I wish \nto thank them for helping us to reach out and reach a compromise. That \nis exactly what this bill is, a compromise. While neither side \nconsiders it perfect, both parties can agree that this bipartisan \nlegislation will significantly improve the quality of education in our \ncountry.\n  I have met with a wide variety of local education leaders in Utah, \nand each one I have spoken to supports this bill. This legislation \nhelps fix a broken system that is failing our students. Once we have \npassed this reauthorization, our work will be far from over, but we \nwill once again be moving in the right direction.\n  For the past several years, my home State of Utah has sought relief \nfrom unworkable provisions in No Child Left Behind through the waiver \nprocess, but the waiver process is dysfunctional. It forces States to \nappeal to the Federal Government to fix a problem created by the \nFederal Government. As our State superintendent in Utah said, ``Results \nof the waiver process have not been salutary for education, for \ndevelopments in administrative law, or for the health of our republic. \nReforming and revising this deeply flawed statute has and must be the \nprimary work of our federal delegates with respect to education.'' \nToday we are answering his plea and the plea of many State and local \nleaders throughout the country.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to work on this bill. I \nam also grateful for the opportunity I have had to help write many of \nits provisions, including the Education Innovation and Research \nProgram, which will allow schools, districts, nonprofits, and small \nbusinesses to develop proposals based on specific local needs. Funding \nfor this program will be awarded based on demonstrated, successful \noutcomes flowing from the project. This initiative will help us find \nother incubators of success. It will also remove limitations on \nflexibility in exchange for demonstrated outcomes. Money should not be \ntied to what the Senate or the Federal Department of Energy thinks are \ngood, prescriptive ideas. It should be tied to local innovation and \ntangible results.\n  Through this bill, I have also worked to expand technology usage in \nthe classrooms and to equip our teachers with the professional \ndevelopment they need to use technology successfully. Too many of our \nschools are using outdated or ineffective technological methods and \nmodels that are missing critical components of teacher participation \nand support. Educational technology allows us to personalize learning \nfor students, target where students are struggling, and provide real-\ntime, valuable feedback to teachers so they may adapt their instruction \nmost effectively. I hope we can provide every child access to the same \ntools and resources and create the individualized learning experiences \nthat we know are critical to success. This bill equips both educators \nand students with resources they need to succeed.\n  As the president and CEO of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce said, \n``This bill empowers willing states to achieve [through] improved early \nlearning and high quality preschool experiences. It also invests in our \nhardworking teachers with more preparation programs, including those \ndesigned to improve literacy, civics education, and STEM education.''\n  This legislation is a victory both for Utah and for our Nation. The \nsooner we send this bill to the President and the sooner we can empower \nour States to help our students achieve their full potential, the \nbetter off we are all going to be. I have to say that I think this \nwould be a major watershed bill. Hopefully, we will pass it tomorrow \nand our elementary and secondary education will greatly benefit from \nit.\n  Again, I particularly compliment the distinguished chairman and \nranking member for the work they have done on this bill--the hard and \neffective work they have done on this bill. I am grateful to have the \nprivilege of working with them on the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n  I wish to thank everybody who has played a role on this difficult \nbill. It is difficult for me to see why anybody would vote against this \nbill because it repairs what has been a very pitiful system under No \nChild Left Behind.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act--a bill that reauthorizes the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, or ESEA, which is the legislation governing \nFederal K-12 education policy.\n  By all accounts, the Senate is expected to pass this bill with a \nbipartisan majority, and President Obama is of course expected to sign \nit into law. This would be a serious setback for America's schools, \nteachers, and students, one that will have sweeping consequences for \ndecades to come, because when we get educational policy wrong, as this \nbill does and as we have done at the Federal level for so many years, \nit affects not just the quality of education students receive as \nchildren but the quality of life that will be available to them as \nadults down the road.\n  The problem is not just the particular provisions of this particular \nbill but the dysfunctional and outdated model of education on which it \nis built--a model that concentrates authority over education decisions \nin the hands of politicians and bureaucrats, instead of in the hands of \nparents, teachers, principals, local school boards, and State \nofficials.\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\n  For the past 50 years, this model has defined and guided the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the \nbill before us today is unfortunately no exception. Not coincidentally, \nthis central planning model has also failed to produce any meaningful \nimprovements in academic achievement, especially for students from low-\nincome communities. In fact, since 1969, test scores in reading and \nmath have hardly budged for public school students of all ages, even \nwhile per-pupil spending has nearly doubled and school staff has \nincreased by more than 80 percent. Yet here we are once again on the \nverge of passing another ESEA reauthorization bill built on the same K-\n12 education model that has trapped so many kids across America in \nfailing schools and confined America's education system to a state of \nstagnant mediocrity for half a century. This is not simply a failure of \npolicy, it is a failure of imagination.\n  Our 1960s-era, top-down model of elementary and secondary schooling \nhas endured, essentially unchanged and unchallenged, for so many \ndecades that the education establishment has come to take it for \ngranted. For many policymakers and education officials in Washington \nand in State capitals around this great country, the status quo isn't \njust seen as the best way but is seen as the only way to design a K-12 \neducation policy today. Even the most creative policy thinking is \nconfined within the narrow boundaries of the centrally planned status \nquo. The only reform proposals that are given the time of day are those \nthat seek to standardize America's classrooms, enforce uniformity \nacross school districts, and systematize the way teachers teach and the \nway their students learn in the classroom at every step along the way. \nSo we insist that the most important teaching decisions--about what to \nteach, when to teach it, and how to assess learning--are made by \nindividuals outside of the classroom and are uniformly applied and \nreapplied regardless of the particular character and composition of a \nclass in question.\n  We expect students of the same age to progress through their \ncurriculum and master each subject at exactly the same pace. We assign \nstudents to their school according to their ZIP Codes. We allocate \npublic education funds to education agencies and schools--never \ndirectly to parents--and manage their use through bureaucratic \nrestrictions and mandates. We evaluate teachers and determine their \ncompensation not on the basis of job performance in the classroom but \naccording to standards that can be quantified, such as the number of \nyears on the job. Student learning is assessed in much the same way, \nusing standardized tests and age-based benchmarks. We never let \nstagnant educational outcomes or a persistent achievement gap shake our \nfaith in the ability of central planners to engineer and superintend \nthe education of tens of millions of students in America.\n  These are the fundamental pillars of the status quo model for \nelementary and secondary education, and the Every Student Succeeds Act \nleaves them wholly, entirely intact, but schools are not factories, \neducation can't be systematized, and learning can't be centrally \nplanned. Good teachers are successful not because they are following \nsome magic formula concocted by experts in Washington, DC, but because \nthey do what good teachers everywhere have always done in order to \nadvance the learning of their students: They work harder than just \nabout anyone, and they know their class material--the material they \nteach their students--inside and out. They communicate early and often \nwith each student's parents so they and their students can be held \naccountable. They observe and they listen to their students in order to \nunderstand their unique learning needs and goals and tailor each day's \nlesson plans accordingly. They evaluate students honestly and \ncomprehensively, assessing whether they have mastered the material, not \njust figured out how to take a test.\n  So instead of imposing an obsolete conformity on an invariably varied \nenvironment, we should be empowering teachers and parents with the \ntools they need to meet the unique educational needs of their students \nand children. Instead of continuing to standardize and systematize \neducation across the entire country, we should be trying to customize \nand personalize education for every single student.\n  The good news is, we don't need to start from scratch. We know local \ncontrol over K-12 and even pre-K education is more effective than the \nprescriptive, heavy-handed approach of Washington, DC, because we have \nseen it work in communities all over the country.\n  For years education entrepreneurs in the States--including my home \nState of Utah--have been implementing and refining policies that put \nparents, teachers, principals, and school boards back in charge of \neducation policy, back in charge of curriculum, and back in charge of \nteaching and testing standards. Perhaps the most popular State-\ninitiated reform is the movement toward school choice, which overturns \nthe embarrassingly outdated and manifestly unfair practice of assigning \nschools rigidly based on ZIP Codes.\n  We know a good education starting at a young age is an essential \ningredient for economic opportunity and democratic citizenship later in \nlife for each child. We also know America has always aspired to be a \nplace to where the condition of your birth doesn't determine your path \nin life. So why on Earth would we want to prohibit parents from \nchoosing the school that is best for their children, especially if, as \nis far too common, their local school is underperforming at the moment.\n  School choice is one of the most important, locally driven reforms \naimed at resolving this fundamental injustice that our current \nassignment by ZIP Code system has attached to it, but it is not the \nonly one. There are also education savings accounts--or ESAs--which \ngive parents control over the per-pupil education dollars that would \nhave been spent on their child by the school system. There is the \nrecent innovation of course choice, pioneered within my home State of \nUtah, which brings the same kind of education customization and a la \ncarte choice that have spread on college campuses to elementary and \nsecondary schools. Of course, there is the distinctively American \nnotion that parents, principals, school districts, and State officials \nhave the right and should have the ability to opt out of the most \nonerous, restrictive, and misguided Federal commands. Whether it is \nparents who don't want their children wasting dozens of hours each year \ntaking standardized tests or State policymakers who develop local \neducation reforms that are more effective and less expensive than the \nFederal one-size-fits-all policies, we should support the rights of all \nAmericans to have a say in the education of their children.\n  The point isn't that there is a better way to improve America's \nschools, but it is rather that there are 50 better ways or even \nthousands of better ways. In our increasingly decentralized world, in \nour increasingly decentralized and complex American economy, there are \nas many ideal education policies as there are children and teachers, \ncommunities and schools. But Washington is standing in the way, \ninherently, if irrationally, distrustful of any alternative to the top-\ndown education status quo. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, \nWashington's outdated, conformist policies will continue to be in the \nway, which is why I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting \nagainst this bill.\n  Even if most Senators vote in favor of the failed status quo, I am \nconfident I have the majority of moms and dads in America on my side. I \noften hear from Utah parents, calling or writing my office to express \ntheir support for local control over education. I recently received an \nemail from Kierston, a proud mother of four and the PTA president at \nher local school, who urged me to vote against this ESEA \nreauthorization. I thought I would let her have the last word today.\n  Based on years of experience with the public schools in her \ncommunity, Kierston warns that maintaining Washington, DC's, monopoly \nover America's public schools will ``force my three incredibly \ndifferent children who learn in very different ways into a box where my \ndaughter will be forced to learn things she isn't ready to learn . . . \nmy oldest who is ahead of his peers will be forced to slow down or help \nteach his peers in a way they don't understand . . . and my third will \nconstantly be in trouble for not sitting still and pestering his peers \nbecause he understands quickly and is bored.''\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\n  ``We need standards, we need benchmarks,'' Kierston wrote, ``but we \nalso need to allow children to learn at their own pace. . . . We need \nchild centered education where children have the ability to go as fast \nor as slow as they need. . . . Please think about the children of Utah. \nVote against [the ESEA reauthorization]. Allow our kids the freedom to \nlearn.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, we have been living under No Child Left \nBehind, or NCLB, for 13 years, and during that time we have learned \nwhat about NCLB works and a lot more about what doesn't work. Students, \nteachers, and parents across the country have been waiting for a long \ntime for us to fix this law. As a member of the ESEA conference \ncommittee, I am proud to work on the legislation before us today, the \nEvery Student Succeeds Act, and to have helped to get it this far. I \nthank Representatives John Kline and Bobby Scott and Senators Lamar \nAlexander and Patty Murray for building the bipartisan foundation that \ngot this bill done and will help to reform our national education \nsystem.\n  The bill, of course, is not perfect, but it is a huge improvement \nover NCLB. Over the last 13 years, we learned that the one-size-fits-\nall approach to fixing failing schools just wasn't working. That is why \nthis bill is designed to find a balance between giving States more \nflexibility while at the same time still making sure States intervene \nand fix schools where students are not learning.\n  Over the last several years, starting when I got here, I have met \nwith principals, teachers, students, parents, school superintendents, \nand other school administrators in Minnesota. These conversations have \nhelped me to develop my education priorities to help improve our \nschools, our communities, and our Nation's future because that is what \nthis is about. I worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nfind common ground.\n  I am pleased that many of my priorities to improve student outcomes \nand close the achievement gap are reflected in the legislation that is \nbefore us today. These priorities include things such as strengthening \nSTEM education, expanding student mental health services, increasing \naccess to courses that help high school students earn college credit, \nand improving the preparation and recruitment of principals for high-\nneed schools.\n  I also successfully fought to renew the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers Program, which provides critical afterschool learning \nactivities for students.\n  Another one of my priorities helps increase the number of counselors \nand social workers in our schools.\n  My provision to allow States to use computer adaptive tests will go a \nlong way toward improving the quality of assessments used in our \nschools, will give teachers and parents more accurate and timely \ninformation on their students' progress, and will measure their growth \ninstead of what NCLB did. In the beginning, NCLB just measured the \npercentage of kids who exceeded a certain arbitrary line of \nproficiency. This will measure every kid and how far they have come \nbecause I always thought that a sixth grade teacher who takes a kid \nfrom a third grade level of reading to a fifth grade level of reading \nis a hero and not a goat, as that teacher was in No Child Left Behind.\n  I was also able to include a new Native language immersion program \nbecause I believe language is critical to maintaining cultural heritage \nand helping Native American students succeed.\n  In addition, I wrote a provision to provide foster children who get \nnew foster parents to stay in their same school district, when that is \nin their best interest, and not have to move to another school because \nvery often the one essential and stable thing in their lives as foster \nchildren is their friends and teachers at school.\n  I am very pleased that these priorities have been included in the \nlegislation we are considering today, and I thank my colleagues for \nworking with me on them. These provisions will help hundreds of \nthousands of students in Minnesota and millions of students across the \ncountry reach their full potential.\n  At the same time, I do have to express my deep disappointment that my \nmeasure to help protect LGBT students from bullying and discrimination \nwas not included in the final bill. I will keep fighting to get this \ncritical measure passed into law because I think it is our \nresponsibility here in the Senate, as adults, to protect children.\n  Finally, I want to note that the Every Student Succeeds Act makes \ncritical investments in early childhood education, which has been a \npriority of mine for a long time. A quality early childhood education \ndoesn't just start kids off on the right foot, it is also good for our \nbudget. Study after study has shown that for every $1 we spend, we get \nup to $16 back in the long run. A kid who has had a quality early \nchildhood education is less likely to be in special education, less \nlikely to be left back a grade, and has better health outcomes. The \ngirls are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to graduate from \nhigh school, go to college, and get a good job so they can pay taxes, \nand are much less likely to go to prison. That is why it is such a \ngreat investment. It is also a great investment because a 3-year-old \nchild is a beautiful thing.\n  After working on a bill to replace NCLB for years, I am very pleased \nthat we have gotten this reform effort finished. I thank my dedicated \nstaff, both present and past, who has worked hard to move education \npriorities forward--Sherry Lachman, Amanda Beaumont, Gohar Sedighi.\n  Thanks, Gohar.\n  Once the President signs the Every Student Succeeds Act into law, I \nlook forward to making sure the new law is implemented in a way that \nwill benefit students, teachers, and parents in Minnesota.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor S. 1177, the Every Student Succeeds Act. This legislation sends the \nresponsibility of educating our Nation's students back to where it \nbelongs--with States and local communities.\n  I wish to commend Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for \ntheir work to advance this legislation through a very ideologically \ndiverse HELP Committee, which they did with a unanimous vote. The full \nSenate then had a vote. That vote was 81 to 17. Then we had a \nconference committee. We haven't had many conference committees. It was \nthere that we met with the House of Representatives to iron out \ndifferences between the two bills, and that passed by a vote of 38 to \n1.\n  It has been a long time since we have had numbers like that record. \nIn fact, it has been a long time since bills went to committee and had \nthe opportunity to be amended in committee, and then went to the floor \nof the Senate and had the opportunity to be amended on the floor. Of \ncourse, it is even more unusual to have a conference committee--because \nit passed both Chambers--and come up with a 38-to-1 approval of the \nconference report, which is what is now before us. This is one of those \ninstances where we get to vote for it or we get to vote against it. I \nam hoping that almost everybody votes for it, just as in these previous \nvotes.\n  We in Wyoming are very proud of our school system. We are proud of \nthe way we support our students. We are proud of the way we support our \neducators. We are proud of the way we support our staff. In fact, the \nConstitution of Wyoming says there will be equal education for every \nchild. We carry that to an extreme. In Wyoming, that means there has to \nbe equal buildings, as well as opportunities, facilities, and teachers. \nThat is run through the courts every once in a while just to make sure \nit is observed, and it is, and we are proud of our students, our \nbuildings, and the education we provide. We are very proud of the way \nit helps to prepare our students for what is next and ensures they have \nthe tools necessary to succeed in a rapidly evolving society.\n  This bill, the Every Student Succeeds Act, ensures that Wyoming \nteachers and school leaders have the power to\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\ntailor education to meet the needs of all students, even in the most \nrural and remote communities. Wyoming is the least populated State in \nthe Nation, and we have probably some of the smallest schools. We \nbelieve kids shouldn't have to ride a bus to or from school for more \nthan an hour, and as a result, we have some schools that have one \nstudent or two students or three students. That is a little different \nkind of school than most of the Nation has.\n  For too long now, I have heard stories from teachers, from students, \nand from parents across Wyoming about the harm inflicted by the prep-\nfor-the-test system that has been in place. That ends with the signing \nof this bill.\n  Our Nation's students deserve the opportunity to learn in innovative \nand creative ways that will stimulate their minds and open their eyes \nto the countless opportunities we have in this great country. Our \nNation's teachers and school leaders deserve the highest levels of \nsupport and training to help our students recognize those opportunities \nand help prepare the next generation. Our Nation's parents deserve the \noption to choose what educational opportunities are best for their \nchild. This act ensures that all of that can occur by empowering States \nand local communities to make the decisions they think are best. This \nis a diverse country. There are a lot of differences among our States. \nWe have some common policies, we have some common laws, but there are \nstill differences.\n  I am always a little riled when we are compared with some of the \nother countries around the world on how our students are doing. I have \nbeen the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee before and I did some research into that; I visited some \ncountries to see what their education was like. One of the ways they \nget better scores on their tests is they kick kids out of school. In \nIndia, they guarantee a sixth grade education. They say they guarantee \na sixth grade education. They do a cleansing of the schools in fourth \ngrade. They say ``These kids are not participating in their education \nenough,'' and they kick them out of school. Those kids will make brooms \nby day and sweep streets at night, and they will earn $1 a day for the \nrest of their lives. That is it--no opportunity for any advancement. \nThat is in fourth grade, even though they are guaranteed a sixth grade \neducation.\n  In sixth grade, they have another purge. In fact, those kids will \nwind up in jobs where they make $2 a day for the rest of their lives, \nwith no opportunity for change. They allow only 7 percent of the kids \nto go to college. There is tremendous competition that probably makes \nsome difference in their scores. But weeding out kids makes a \ndifference. Thank goodness in this country we don't believe in that. We \nbelieve every kid should have an opportunity, and we give them an \nopportunity as long as we can.\n  Local school boards are a terrific example of democracy at its \nfinest. In those meetings, individuals in the community can come \ntogether to discuss and debate issues related to the education of their \nyouth. It is in those meetings that students can voice their opinions \nand have a say in their own educational experiences. It is in those \nmeetings that teachers and student leaders can put forth what they \nthink is the best course of action to teach the content in a way that \nbest meets the needs of that community. It is in those meetings that \nall of those parties can decide how they want to spend educational \nfunds within the budget that the members of that community voted on.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act that we will vote on tomorrow gives \nthat power back to the local school boards. It allows issues to be \ndebated and decisions to be made in a room of parents, students, \nteachers, school leaders, and community members who know best what \nworks for the students. It is one of the purest forms of democracy I \ncan think of, and certainly it is something I think our Founders had in \nmind in their idea of America and, in particular, their idea of \neducating our students.\n  I know there are some people who are going to vote against this bill, \nand I have asked why. The most common answer is it doesn't go far \nenough. It goes further than anything that has been done in this \nChamber since the Department of Education was founded. This reverses \nthings back to States' rights.\n  I work around here under the 80-percent rule. I have found that we \ncan talk civilly about 80 percent of the issues. If we stick to that 80 \npercent, we can be productive. If we go to the other 20 percent--it is \n10 percent on each side, Republicans and Democrats--we both have \ncertain things that we would like to see and that we think are right, \nand we have been fighting over them for decades. But if we stick to \nthat 80 percent, we can be productive. We can find something that we \ncan have some common ground on. I have found that we usually only have \n80 percent common ground on any of the issues because, again, there is \nthat 10 percent that each side feels is right and that we would like to \ndo. So the best way to get some legislation done is to leave out some \nof those things and go ahead and get what we can. This bill does that.\n  I think it goes beyond 80 percent, incidentally, but we can get the \nwhole 100 percent. The way to do it is to get both sides together and \nkeep them out of the weeds long enough--the old rhetoric they have been \narguing about, where they hear a key word and know the answer to it \nimmediately and don't have to listen. If you can get them to sit down \nand listen and think of a new way to do it, we would get 100 percent \nbecause when we come up with that new idea that both sides can grab on \nto, they both claim it is their idea, and we move on. We are not at \nthat point yet on education.\n  I commend the Chairman of the committee, Senator Alexander, and the \nRanking Member, Senator Murray, for coming together on 80 percent of \nwhat can get done and working to get it done. The alternative is to get \nnothing done. We need to get something done. People have been \ncomplaining that this law has been unauthorized for years. This is the \nfirst chance we have had to actually move forward with education, to \nmove it back to the States where it will be most effective, where those \ndiverse States can make up their minds on what will work best with \ntheir students.\n  Incidentally, most of our States are as big as any of those countries \nwe compete with, with the exception of China, Russia, and India. They \nare making decisions for their State when they are making their \neducation decisions. That is what this bill will do.\n  There aren't any perfect bills. I particularly don't like \ncomprehensive bills. ObamaCare was a comprehensive bill. But my idea of \na comprehensive bill is that it is so big that people can't understand \nit, and it is so big that stuff can get shoved in there that nobody \nwill even notice when it is being done. This is one of those bills that \nhas been worked on for a long time. It has been taken carefully in \nsteps and put together so that we can move forward with it.\n  The question is, Will it work? Yes, it will work. Will it do \neverything that everybody wants? Hardly anything ever does. This bill \nwill come as close to doing something--as I said, I believe it is the \nmost progress we have had since we got a Department of Education, which \nis a whole other debate.\n  I have been proud to support this legislation from its very early \nstages, and I will continue to support it tomorrow. The responsibility \nof the education of our Nation's students belongs to States and local \ncommunities. The Every Student Succeeds Act ensures that responsibility \nis given to those entities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, an improvement in \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the conference agreement to replace No \nChild Left Behind, the Every Student Succeeds Act, takes unprecedented \nsteps to rein in the Secretary of Education and put the power for \neducation decisions back in the hands of parents and State and local \nofficials. By passing this legislation, it clearly becomes Congress' \nintent that States be solely responsible for the development and \nimplementation of, and decisions regarding, all aspects of their State \naccountability systems. This is an intentional and deliberate act to \neliminate the ability of the Secretary of Education to use regulatory \npower or guidance to add new requirements or conditions to State \nsystems that are outside of the specific language in statute.\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\n  The legislation prevents the Secretary from influencing, forcing, or \ncoercing a State to adopt specific standards in many ways, including \nthe following:\n  First, officers and employees of the Federal Government--including \nthe Secretary of Education--are prohibited from conditioning the \nreceipt of any funds, through grants, contracts, or agreements on the \nadoption of any academic standards, including Common Core.\n  Second, States do not have to submit their standards to the Secretary \nfor review or approval.\n  Third, the Secretary is prohibited from exercising any direction or \nsupervision over a State's academic standards.\n  The Secretary is also prevented from using executive authority to \ncreate terms and conditions that should be done through the legislative \nprocess, including the following:\n  First, the Secretary is prohibited from adding new requirements \nthrough regulations.\n  Second, the Secretary is prohibited from adding new requirements as a \ncondition of approval of a State plan.\n  Third, the Secretary is prohibited from dictating what should happen \nin early education.\n  Fourth, the Secretary is prohibited from creating new policies \nthrough redefining terms or phrases in the law.\n  Furthermore, the legislation protects States' rights to control their \neducation system by ensuring the Secretary is prohibited from: coercing \na State to adopt any particular curriculum or program of instruction; \nprescribing the long-term goals or measurements of interim progress, or \nthe weights of State-determined indicators, or the methodology for \nidentifying low-performing schools, in the State's accountability \nsystem; requiring any specific assessments be used by a State; \ndictating any particular school support or improvement strategies or \ninterventions; or requiring any measures of teacher, principal, or \nother school leader effectiveness.\n  Section 1111(e) clearly states the Secretary may not add any \nrequirements or criteria outside the scope of this act and further says \nthe Secretary may not take any action that would ``be in excess of \nstatutory authority given to the Secretary.'' This section goes on to \nlay out specific terms the Secretary cannot prescribe, sets clear \nlimits on the guidance the Secretary may offer, and also clearly states \nthat the Secretary is prohibited from defining terms that are \ninconsistent with or outside the scope of this Act.\n  There are also provisions in titles I and VIII that ensure standards \nand curriculum are left to the discretion of States without Federal \ncontrol or mandates, and the same is true for assessments.\n  The legislation also clearly lays out congressional intent by \nincluding a sense of Congress that States and local educational \nagencies retain the right and responsibility of determining educational \ncurriculum, programs of instruction, and assessments.\n  The legislation makes it clear the Secretary is not to put any undue \nlimits on the ability of States to determine their accountability \nsystems, their standards, or what tests they give their students. The \nclear intent of this legislation restores responsibility for the \nauthority over education decisions back to the States and severely \nlimits the Secretary's ability to interfere in any way.\n  Ensuring a limited role for the U.S. Secretary of Education was a \ncritically important priority throughout the reauthorization process \nand this legislation meets that priority. For example, the Secretary \nmay not limit the ability of States to determine how the measures of \nstudent performance are weighted within State accountability systems. \nThe legislation does not authorize the Secretary to issue regulations \nthat specify a specific weight or a range of weights that any indicator \nmust fall within when States setting up their system. Any weights or \nranges of weight of each indicator will be determined by the State. The \nSecretary also cannot prescribe school support or improvement \nstrategies, any aspect of a State's teacher evaluation system, or the \nmethodology used to differentiate schools in a State.\n  Also, the Secretary may not create new policy and requirements by \ncreatively defining terms in the law. Definitively, this new law reins \nin the Secretary and ensures it is State and local education officials \nmaking decisions about their schools.\n  Under current law, the current Secretary and previous Education \nofficials have exceeded their authority by placing conditions on \nwaivers to States and local educational agencies outside the scope of \nthe legislative language or congressional intent. This legislation \nprevents the Secretary from applying any new conditions on waivers or \nthe State plans required in the law. The language clearly states the \nSecretary may not add any new conditions for the approval of waivers or \nState plans that are outside the scope of the law. This means if the \nlaw does not give the Secretary the authority to require something, \nthen the Secretary may not unilaterally create an ability to do that \nthrough regulation, approval or disapproval of State plans, binding \nguidance, or any other means of enforcement.\n  Finally, this legislation sets up a more inclusive and transparent \nnegotiated rulemaking process, particularly for any regulations related \nto standards, assessments, or supplement, not supplant requirements in \nthe law. All regulations, if any, issued on these items must adhere to \nagreements reached by negotiators in negotiated rulemaking. The \nSecretary may not ignore agreements reached. The legislation also \nrequires an alternative process for regulations if consensus is not \nreached through negotiated rulemaking, including a review of the time, \ncosts, and paperwork burden of any proposed regulations. Congress will \nalso be given an opportunity to review any proposed regulations for 15 \ndays prior to submission to the Federal Register. Additionally, the \npublic will have 60 days to comment on any proposed regulations. The \npurpose of these new requirements is for the Department of Education to \nbe more transparent in what burden new regulations will place on \nStates, school districts, and schools. Additionally, by giving Congress \nand the public the opportunity to explicitly weigh in on proposed \nregulations, the intent is that the Department will listen to thoughts \nfrom people on the ground regarding how they will be impacted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will approve landmark \nlegislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965.\n  Since 2001, the failed policies of No Child Left Behind have unfairly \nburdened students, families, educators, and administrators by holding \nstudents accountable for snap-shot academic progress. The overwhelming \nsupport in Congress for these reforms will reverse the one-size-fits-\nall approach to education that did not work for Vermont and so many \nschools across the Nation. This bill gives States more flexibility to \nensure that schools are supporting every student, while maintaining the \nFederal Government's responsibility to ensure that students everywhere \nhave access to the resources they need for lasting academic success.\n  Since 2001, I have heard from parents, teachers, students, \npolicymakers, and administrators about the negative impacts of No Child \nLeft Behind. I voted against the legislation as I did not agree--and \nstill do not agree--with a one-size-fits-all approach to education. I \nwas also disappointed with the bill's rigid Federal accountability \nmeasures, as I truly believe States and local education agencies \ndeserve flexibility when it comes to how schools operate.\n  The conference report we will consider today reflects the positive \nchanges to the law that the Senate overwhelmingly supported in July. \nThe agreement restores educational flexibility to the States, while \nsafeguarding student access to resources, regardless of race, gender, \nfinancial status, and learning level. I am pleased that the bill takes \ninto account the greater needs of students in rural areas, increases \nfunding for early childhood education programs, and improves school \nsafety measures.\n  I am especially pleased with the bill's innovative assessment and \naccountability demonstration authority provision, which will allow \nVermont to adopt competency and performance-based assessments that \nprove far more than how well a student can perform on a test on one \ngiven day. And while\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\nStates will design their own system to improve struggling schools, the \nconference agreement also includes Federal safeguards to protect civil \nrights and to provide resources for students at the greatest risk.\n  We are 8 years overdue for a rewrite of No Child Left Behind. I am \npleased that we have come together, Members on both sides of the aisle, \nto support the Every Student Succeeds Act. This bill truly reflects the \nneeds of all students, educators, parents, and administrators; and I \nurge all Senators to support its passage.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to express my \nstrong support for the Every Student Succeeds Act. This legislation is \na major step forward in taking the responsibility of educating our \nchildren back from Washington and giving it to the States. Senator \nAlexander and the Republican majorities in Congress have been \nsuccessful working in with parents, teachers, and school districts in \nputting together a bipartisan elementary education reform bill that \nwould restore the role of States in creating accountability standards, \ntesting requirements, and other education policies that best fit the \nneeds of students in local public and charter schools.\n  One of the most important pieces of this bill is that it would \neffectively end Common Core once and for all by allowing States to \ndevelop their own education standards. For far too long, Federal \nbureaucrats in Washington have tied the hands of States and parents by \nmandating one-size-fits-all education policies such as Common Core that \nhave failed America's students. Let me be clear: I strongly support \neducation standards that make Arizona students prepared to compete in \nthis global economy. But these standards should be developed by \nArizona's State and local education officials in consultation with \nparents of Arizona schoolchildren. This bill would do just that.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act would also end the Federal test-based \naccountability system that was established by the No Child Left Behind \nAct. No longer would these required Federal tests be the sole measure \nof educational success. States will now be allowed to use testing along \nwith other measures of accountability such as attendance, teacher \nperformance, and other student achievement and school performance \nmetrics when developing accountability systems.\n  In addition to helping take control of elementary education back from \nWashington, this bill includes provisions that would strengthen charter \nschools. I am proud of the fact that Arizona is home to some of the \nbest charter schools in the Nation. According to the Arizona Charter \nSchool Association, over 190,000 Arizona students have access to more \nthan 600 charter schools, giving Arizona parents more educational \nchoices for their children. I am also proud of the fact that BASIS \nCharter Schools in Scottsdale and Tucson are the first and third-ranked \ncharter schools in America, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n  I am also pleased that the Every Student Succeeds Act includes \nlanguage I offered on the Senate floor in July that would enhance \neducational choice and expand access to high-performing schools for \nstudent in Arizona and across the nation.\n  Specifically, this provision would let Arizona and other States \npropose how they could use limited Federal education funds to replicate \nand expand access to high-performing charter, magnet, and traditional \npublic schools for low-income students--in other words, education \noptions that are proven to provide the best-quality learning \nenvironments for Arizona children.\n  Right now, public funds meant to help low-income students are largely \nreserved for poor-performing schools, failing the children who are most \nin need. We must give Arizona and other States the ability to direct \nthese funds to develop high-performing charter, magnet and traditional \npublic schools which have been proven to be successful.\n  The provisions I offered give Arizona the ability to show how they \ncan do just that, while paving the way to give parents the freedom to \nchoose which schools are best for their kids.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act also includes measures that would \noffer additional support for rural schools in Arizona by providing more \nflexible use of Federal funding and maintaining the authorization of \nthe Small, Rural School Achievement Program, SRSA, and the Rural and \nLow Income School, RLIS, program. The bill also helps States support \nEnglish learners by providing resources to establish strong English \nproficiency programs to enable these students to meet high education \nstandards.\n  I am proud of the strong progress that Arizona students are making in \nthe classroom. According to the most recent National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, NAEP, Arizona students are making significant \nprogress compared to students in other States. In a recent op-ed in the \nArizona Republic, former Arizona Superintendent Lisa Graham Keegan and \nthe Foundation for Excellence in Education's Matthew Lander wrote, \n``[w]hile the national NAEP news this week was grim, with flat scores \nin fourth grade reading and declining scores in all three subjects, \nArizona students bucked that trend by notching gains in three of the \nfour tests.'' They went on to highlight Arizona's success, stating \n``Arizona's charter-school students . . . matched the scores for the \nhighest-scoring states on the 2015 NAEP. On eighth grade mathematics, \nfor instance, Arizona charter students scored in a statistical dead \nheat with Massachusetts, the highest scoring of the 50 states.''\n  I am extremely proud of the success we are seeing in Arizona \nelementary education, but more needs to be done to ensure our students \nhave the best opportunities by increasing educational choice and \nenabling States and school districts to expand and replicate high-\nperforming schools. Every American has an obligation to help prepare \nthe next generation for the future, and this bill is a step in the \nright direction. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act.\n  I want to thank Chairmen Kline and Alexander and Ranking Members \nScott and Murray for their work in putting together a bipartisan, \nbicameral framework to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, ESEA. I know that it was not easy, especially in this \npolitical climate, but politics were put aside; and children, teachers, \nand schools were put first.\n  I am really pleased how this process played out--it was truly a \nbipartisan effort. I have always believed that one of the pathways to \nsuccess is restoring regular order, and they did just that. While this \nbill is not perfect--it is not one that Democrats nor Republicans would \nhave written--it is a step in the right direction towards overhauling \nand improving the failed tenets of No Child Left Behind.\n  ESEA was passed 50 years ago to ensure that kids living in poverty \nwould receive the extra help they needed in order to succeed. It was a \npart of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty. It was the first \ntime that the Federal Government really got involved in education. \nBefore then, education was considered a local responsibility, not \nsomething for the Feds to meddle in; but President Johnson's vision \nchanged that. He wanted to lift kids out of poverty and give them their \nfair shot to excel.\n  Since then, we passed the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act of \n2001, NCLB. While done with the best of intentions, it was deeply \nflawed. With NCLB, instead of us ``racing to the top,'' we ended up \nwith ``racing to the test'' and excessive testing. NCLB is also bad \nbecause it gave us a one-size-fits-all approach out of Washington, \ndespite whether you lived in a big city like Baltimore or in a rural \ncounty like Somerset County on the Eastern Shore.\n  We wanted to get rid of ``race to the test,'' understanding that one \nsize does not fit all, and implement a system that understands we must \nhave Federal guidelines with local solutions and initiatives; then we \nneeded to back up our guidelines with money because school districts \nwere struggling to meet their bottom line.\n  So I went to work on a bipartisan basis to try and deal with that. My \nfirst rule was: do no harm. That is why I beat back the Southern \nstrategy that was going to change the title I formula for funding. \nMaryland would have lost $40 million--that means every single\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nschool district in Maryland would have lost money. I couldn't let that \nhappen, so I put together a coalition of other Senators to beat that \nback, and we did just that. Maryland will keep its $40 million. For \nBaltimore City, they won't lose $6 million. For Baltimore County, they \nwon't lose $6 million. For places like Prince George's County, they \nwon't lose $7 million.\n  The bill before us--the Every Student Succeeds Act--is good for all \nof Maryland's 874,514 students. It supports at-risk populations; \nempowers high quality choice for parents; and strengthens critical \nprograms such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, \nSTEM, education, accelerated learning, and afterschool programming.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act is good for all of Maryland's 59,315 \nteachers. Our teachers have to deal with children who have so many \nproblems--whether suffering from a peanut allergy or asthma--and need \nso much help. That is why I fought to make sure that Federal funds can \nbe used to provide for the coordination of integrated services like \nvision and hearing screenings and other support services to help \nimprove student academic achievement.\n  The Every Student Succeeds Act helps all of 1,446 Maryland public \nschools. While we maintain annual statewide assessments in reading and \nmath, we allow States to develop and implement other mechanisms that \nreduces overtesting and ``racing to the test.''\n  In addition to supporting the large-scale changes in the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act, I am especially proud to see that this compromise \nincludes other provisions I fought for. This bill ensures that States \ncontinue to measure how students are performing at each level of \nachievement. This bill will make sure that States find ways to assist \nschool districts in addressing the needs of gifted and talented \nstudents. It will also make sure that teachers get the professional \ndevelopment they need and deserve in order to better identify gifted \nkids.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us also recognizes the vital role \nthat school nurses play. They truly are a valuable member of a school's \neducation team and should be recognized as such. Because of this bill, \nschools nurses will now be eligible to receive ESEA professional \ndevelopment funds.\n  This bill, the Every Student Succeeds Act, ensures that at-risk kids \nget the support they need in order to succeed. It supports teachers and \nprincipals in providing high quality instruction. It supports States \nand school districts in turning around low-performing schools and \nclosing achievement gaps. This bill is a down payment on our children's \nfuture and on our Nation's future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan progress that has been \nmade here and vote to send a strong bill to the President's desk that \nwill improve our schools and put all of our children on a path to \nsuccess.\n\n\n                          Assessment Security\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nSenator Alexander, to clarify questions that have arisen since S. 1177 \nwas introduced.\n  Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, pursuant to section 1201, we \nauthorized Federal funding to provide grant opportunities for States to \nadminister academic assessments and to carry out activities that ensure \n``the continued validity and reliability of state assessments.'' \nFurthermore, under the same provision, we authorized funds to allow \nStates to collaborate with organizations to provide services that will \n``improve the quality, reliability, validity, and reliability of State \nacademic assessments.''\n  I ask the chairman, is it your understanding that the references in \nsection 1201 to activities and services that ensure and improve the \n``validity and reliability of state assessments'' were intended to \nallow funds to be used for test security activities and services \ndesigned and utilized to prevent, detect, and respond to testing \nirregularities and incidents that threaten the validity of assessment \nresults?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. Student \nassessments must be designed and administered with a high degree of \nquality assurance. State assessment results can be used as the basis \nfor critical decisions affecting the lives of students and the funding \nand operation of schools, and given the significant taxpayer investment \nfor statewide assessments, we must provide States with the flexibility \nto use funds to preserve and maintain the integrity and validity of \nthese important assessments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                         Senate Accomplishment\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments this \nafternoon to talk about where we are at the end of this year, 2015. \nThere has been a lot of talk about wrap-up, a lot of talk about how we \nknitted together the outstanding issues before us as a Congress. There \nis much yet to be done, but I do think it is significant to recognize \nthat there has been good work, there has been substantial and \nsubstantive work that has come out of the U.S. Senate this year as the \nRepublicans have led the Senate in the majority.\n  As we think back at year-end on a series of accomplishments, I think \nit is important to recognize that the business of the Congress has been \nproductive. Sometimes we get so busy around here that we don't stop to \neven recall what we did yesterday, much less last week or the week \nbefore.\n  Today we have had an opportunity to almost bring to a close the \neducation reform measure that Senator Alexander from Tennessee and \nSenator Murray from Washington have been working so hard on over this \npast year. As a member of the HELP Committee, I have been very pleased \nto work with them as we have attempted to advance meaningful and long-\noverdue education reforms.\n  Before I speak specifically to the Every Student Succeeds Act, I \nwould like to rattle off a few of the measures.\n  Of course we recognize that it was just last week that the highway \nreauthorization bill moved successfully not only through the Senate but \nthrough the House, through the full bodies ready to be signed into law \nby the President. The 5-year highway reauthorization bill is the \nlongest highway reauthorization bill we have seen in 17 years. That is \nsignificant. For a State such as mine that is looking for some level of \ncertainty for projects around the State, that is considerable, and that \nis a good accomplishment to look back to as a marker of success.\n  The vote we had last week would roll back some of the many harmful \neffects of the Affordable Care Act--the Not-So-Affordable Care Act, as \nI mentioned on the floor last week, saying that for far too many \nAlaskans, the Affordable Care Act was simply not affordable.\n  There have been other measures we can look to and acknowledge that we \nare doing the work of the Congress--moving forward the national defense \nauthorization bill, which the President chose not to deal with the \nfirst time around but signed it the second time around.\n  We were able to move forward several measures related to the \nregulatory environment we are dealing with, whether it was the Clean \nPower Plan or the waters of the United States, being able to push back \non those very burdensome regulations that I think we recognized--the \ngoals for clean air and clean water are something we all want. We need \nto make sure that we move in this direction in a way that doesn't \nburden or weigh down our economy.\n  The first appropriations stand-alone bill that we have seen move \nthrough the Senate in 5 years when we advanced the MILCON \nappropriations measure--that was also significant.\n  The committees have been doing great work. In our energy committee, \nwe moved forward an energy reform bill that would help to modernize our \nenergy grid, access to all areas of energy, not only by night but our \nrenewable resources as well. That was an effort which was very \nbipartisan and enjoyed good, strong support within the committee. We \nmoved it out 18 to 4 and hope to have an energy reform bill before the \nSenate for consideration early in this next calendar year. We haven't \nseen energy modernization or an energy reform bill since 2007. Again, \nit is long overdue but is now teed up.\n  We have a sportsmen's bill that we moved through committee. The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee is working to advance their \nportion of those very significant measures that will allow for greater \naccess to our sports men and women and our families\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\nwho seek to recreate on our public lands.\n  These are good things that we are seeing coming out of committees and \ncoming to the floor and moving forward. This is a level of governance \nthat has been good for the body and, even better, will be good for the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak very briefly about the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act. I know several of my colleagues have come down to \nthe floor. Just a couple minutes ago, the Senator from Wyoming came to \ntalk about the good things we have seen in this education reform bill \nand celebrate how it ends the national school board by putting more \ncontrol of our schools in our States' and locals' hands. I think that \nis worthy of note. For the schools, administrators, teachers, and the \nparents, that is worthy of celebration.\n  I am more than pleased that the Every Student Succeeds Act will \nfinally allow our States to judge our schools by more than just the \ntest results and allow our teachers to do what they want to do to teach \nour kids and engage them in the art and love of learning and not just \nprepare for tests. We all know our children are more than what can be \ndescribed in some of these fill-in-the-bubble exercise tests, and our \nteachers are certainly more than robots that stand in front of a class \nand follow a script that has been orchestrated from elsewhere.\n  I tell many Alaskans that I got my political start, if you will, as \nthe president of my son's PTA, our parent teacher association in our \nlocal neighborhood school. I came to understand firsthand and in a very \nupfront and personal way what No Child Left Behind meant not only for \nmy son's school but for the schools across Alaska, an area where you \nhave a lot of geography and not a lot of numbers in terms of \npopulation.\n  NCLB did not work for us as a very rural State. The one-size-fits-all \ndid not work. My son's public school was deemed a failing school in the \nfirst year that adequate yearly progress was the standard of \nmeasurement. We were dubbed a failing school because we had one \nsubcategory of students where the numbers were so small, but we didn't \nhave enough students show up to take the test on that day. So we all \nknow there were 31 different ways to fail AYP, and little Government \nHill Elementary in Anchorage, AK, failed that first year. That is tough \nas a neighborhood. They were saying: What is wrong with our school? \nWhat is wrong with our neighborhood?\n  Really, there was nothing wrong with our school. There was nothing \nwrong with our neighborhood. What we had was a directive that came out \nof Washington, DC--some 4,000 miles away--and it didn't work for us.\n  I am more than pleased to join with superintendents, principals, and \nschool board members who celebrate Federal bureaucrats being prohibited \nfrom dictating standards, assessments, and school ability plans. No \nmore Federal control. No more waivers with strings. No more one-size-\nfits-all education mandates that never ever fit us in Alaska.\n  I also place a high value on the fact that this bill recognizes the \nrights of our American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian \npeoples throughout the country. It makes sure they have a greater say \nin how public schools will serve their children. Also, this bill will \nsupport the revitalization of Native languages by supporting Native \nlanguage immersion schools. This has always been one of my priorities, \nand I am pleased we see this in the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n  I am grateful for the support of colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. Senator Boxer worked with me on this to make sure we maintained \nFederal support for afterschool programs that allow parents to remain \nat work if they need to after the school day ends, knowing their \nchildren are going to be safe and engaged in good, enriching activities \nthat help them learn in a fun way. Making sure we had that critical \npiece in the bill was important.\n  I am also grateful for the support for the number of Alaska-specific \nprovisions that will ensure that this bill, unlike the No Child Left \nBehind Act, will truly fit Alaska's needs. I appreciate a great deal \nthe work Senator Alexander put into working through some of these \nissues with us, understanding the Alaska piece, recognizing that \nsometimes we have entities that are different from what you have in the \nlower 48. How you translate that when you are drafting language to make \nsure it works is key. His staff worked with mine to make sure we didn't \ndrop the ball in these areas.\n  Those of us who are parents realize that this legislation will give \nus a stronger voice in our children's education and encourage parents \nto take the lead in helping our schools communicate better with parents \nrather than the other way around. Again, coming into the politics of \nschools, knowing that your parents have a voice in what is happening at \nthe school is critically important.\n  Over the years, we have all met with teachers, school board members, \nparents, principals, superintendents, and students from our States who \nwere so discouraged, very discouraged, sometimes just plain old fed up \nwith the No Child Left Behind top-down control over every decision. The \nEvery Student Succeeds Act guarantees that our parents, teachers, \ntribes, community leaders, and principals have a seat at the table to \ndesign how our schools serve our children. It even guarantees our \nGovernors a voice while drastically reducing the role of the Secretary \nof Education here in Washington, DC.\n  I want to acknowledge the good work of the members of the Senate HELP \nCommittee and their staffs. We all know their staffs put in amazing \nhours to get the bill to this point, working together, compromising, \nnegotiating, making their case for the priorities of their \nconstituents.\n  This bill is one of the great examples--a poster child, if you will--\nof how Congress should be working around here. It is hard work, but it \nrequires compromise. It requires an open amendment process in \ncommittee, which we absolutely had. We had days of process on the \ncommittee and then here on the floor but also within the conference \ncommittee. We had a real, live, old-fashioned conference committee, and \nit was an absolute pleasure to be part of a process where you could go \nin with your colleagues from the House on the other side of the table \nand go back and forth in further perfecting a bill.\n  In just a few days, the baton on education reform will be handed off \nto the people of our States. I look forward to this. I am encouraging \nfolks back home to get involved, be aware, know what is going on. It \nwill be a responsibility every one of our constituents must take \nseriously. No matter what role they play in a student's life, what \nhappens next in each of our States will be determined by the people who \nshow up, who share their perspectives with their States, with their \ndepartments of education, with their school boards. And I believe that \ncoming together in this way at the local and State level--together it \nwill be a good job for Alaska's children and for all of our Nation's \nchildren.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I am so pleased that the Senate is \ntaking the last few legislative steps to reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act or ESEA.\n  Our bipartisan bill, the Every Student Succeeds Act, will end the \none-size-fits-all mandates of No Child Left Behind. It will reduce \nreliance on high-stakes testing, and it will help ensure that all \nstudents have access to a quality education regardless of where they \nlive, how they learn or how much money their parents make. One of the \nbest ways to help students succeed in school is by offering high-\nquality early learning opportunities for kids.\n  I am proud our bipartisan bill will also improve and expand access to \npreschool programs for more of our Nation's youngest learners. \nPreschool is actually how I got my start in politics in the mid-1980s. \nAt the time I wasn't thinking about running for the U.S. Senate or even \nthe State legislature in\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\nWashington. I just had one specific goal in mind. The State legislature \nat the time was going to close down preschools in my small community \nbecause of budget cuts. I knew the impact that would have on my own \nkids and on the kids I saw in the classroom, but when I went to talk to \nState legislators about it with my kids, they wouldn't listen. They \ndidn't think our voices mattered, and they didn't think preschool \nshould be a priority.\n  So I picked up the phone and started calling other parents. We held \nrallies, we wrote letters, and when it was all said and done, we won. \nThe legislature reinstated the funding for the preschool program and \nmore kids in my State were able to finally start school ready to learn.\n  I still believe early childhood education is one of the best \ninvestments we can make in our country. It is why I fought so hard to \nimprove and expand the preschool program throughout this process to fix \nNo Child Left Behind. It is why I worked across the aisle with Senator \nIsakson and many other colleagues in the HELP Committee to design a \npreschool program in our bipartisan Senate bill, and it is one of the \nreasons this final legislation that we will vote on tomorrow will be \nsuch a strong step for students in the years to come.\n  I hope our colleagues join me and everyone in passing the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act for students, for parents, for teachers, and for \ncommunities across the country. Early childhood education is so \nimportant for our children's future and for the future of our country. \nLet's go through the research.\n  Before children ever set foot in kindergarten, studies show they have \nalready developed a foundation that will determine all of the learning, \nhealth, and behavior that follows. High-quality early learning programs \ncan strengthen that foundation. Preschool is especially important for \nkids from low-income backgrounds. By the time an average child growing \nup in poverty turns 3 years old, she will have heard 30 million fewer \nwords compared to a child from a middle-income or high-income family, \naccording to researchers at the University of Kansas. That is a serious \ndisadvantage.\n  By the time she starts kindergarten a few years later, the deck will \nalready be stacked against her and her future success. Many families \nacross the country don't have the option of sending their youngest \nlearners to preschool. Today, in fact, just 14 percent of 3-year-olds \nin America are enrolled in federally or State-funded preschool programs \nand 41 percent of our 4-year-olds are enrolled.\n  If we are serious about closing the achievement gap in elementary and \nsecondary education and if we are truly committed to making sure every \nstudent has the chance to succeed, we have to invest in quality early \nchildhood education.\n  On the Senate floor in January, I said we should only pass a bill to \nreauthorize the ESEA if it expands access to preschool programs. I am \nvery pleased our bill follows through on that commitment. The Every \nStudent Succeeds Act will mark the first time that the Nation's \nprimary, elementary, and secondary education law includes dedicated \nfunding to make sure kids start kindergarten ready to learn. It does so \nby establishing a competitive grant program for States that proposes to \nimprove coordination, quality, and access to early childhood education \nfor kids from low-income and disadvantaged families. Those grants will \nhelp States such as Washington build on the progress it has already \nmade to improve quality and increase access to high-quality preschool \nprograms.\n  I am very proud of the bipartisan bill we have on the floor and all \nit does to improve and expand access to preschool, but we still have \nwork to do. I will continue to work to do even more for kids and \nfamilies in Washington State and across the country. I will continue \nfighting hard to make sure that if a family wants to send their child \nto a quality preschool program, there will be an open slot for them, \nbecause when all students have the chance to learn, we strengthen our \nfuture workforce, our Nation grows strong, our economy grows from the \nmiddle out, not the top down, and we empower the next generation of \nAmericans to lead the world.\n  As a former preschool teacher myself, I saw firsthand the kind of \ntransformation that early learning can inspire in a child. It is \nsomething I have never forgotten. On my very last day of teaching \npreschool, before I left to serve in our Washington State Senate, my \nstudents gave me this great big, large, blue quilt. Each square was \ndecorated by a student in my preschool class and that quilt now hangs \nin my U.S. Senate office. It reminds me every single day that investing \nin young children is one of the most important things we can do to help \nthem succeed.\n  Tomorrow the Senate will have the chance to vote in favor of helping \nmore kids start school on a strong footing. We have the chance to fix \nNo Child Left Behind with a bill that recognizes the importance of \nearly learning, and we have a chance to make sure one of the smartest \ninvestments we can make in our Nation's youngest learners has begun.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill for their future and the \nfuture of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to talk about an issue that \nwhile we are riveted in our attention, yes, about a good education \nbill--which I intend to support--and about the challenge of ISIL and \nterrorism both abroad and at home, I am concerned that in the midst of \nall of those challenges, Iran is well on its way to once again defy the \ninternational community in a way that I think is incredibly dangerous.\n  We are told that Iran is to be considered a trustworthy member of the \ninternational community and that we should be able to count on it to \nabide by the international commitments they have made and by U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n  On October 11 of this year, Iran tested a precision-guided, long-\nrange ballistic missile in violation of U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, and now Iran has carried out a new medium-range ballistic \nmissile test in breach of two U.N. Security Council resolutions. We are \ntold by Western intelligence that test was held November 21. The first \none was October 11; now a second one on November 21 near Chabahar, a \nport city in southeast Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province near the \nborder with Pakistan. The launch took place from a known missile test \nsite along the Gulf of Oman. The missile, which is known as a Ghadr-\n110, has a range of anywhere between 1,800 and 2,000 kilometers or \nabout 1,200 miles and is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.\n  The missile fired in November is an improved version of the Shahab-3 \nand is similar to the precision-guided missile tested by Iran on \nOctober 10, which elicited strong condemnation by members of the U.N. \nSecurity Council, but those condemnations were in word but not in \nactions--because what has happened as a result of Iran violating the \nU.N. Security Council resolutions as it relates to missile testing? \nAbsolutely nothing.\n  At the Security Council we are still debating how to respond to \nIran's last test in October, and I truly believe actions speak louder \nthan words. American and U.N. actions demonstrate to me that with no \nactivity that is visible to anyone as it relates to finding some \nconsequence for Iran violating U.N. Security Council resolutions, Iran \ncan support terror, Iran can develop its nuclear program, Iran can \nfoment sectarian conflict across the Middle East, it can support Assad \nin its deadly regime against its people, it can test ballistic \nmissiles, it can tell Iraq not to accept U.S. special forces in our \nfight against ISIL, and yet it will be rewarded with a multimillion-\ndollar sanctions relief this coming year. Something is wrong because \nthe silence is so deafening.\n  In October of this year after Iran launched its first missile test in \nviolation of Security Council resolutions, I wrote to the Secretary of \nState. I wish to read excerpts of that letter because they are still \nmore poignant today in view of the second test that has taken place \nagainst international will.\n  I said:\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary,\n       The recent test launch of a precision-guided, long-range \n     ballistic missile by Iran was a violation of the United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1929. . . . As we \n     discussed during your July 23 appearance before the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, [that resolution] stipulates \n     that Iran\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\n     cannot presently engage in activities related to ballistic \n     missiles.\n       But, with the October 11 launch, Iran has done so--on \n     several levels--whether it is through research, development, \n     planning, concealing or launching this reportedly new \n     technology. And as some of my colleagues on the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee have pointed out in separate \n     correspondence to you, Iran's violations of UNSCR 1929 have \n     become common. The Iranian regime is drawing a line in the \n     sand that demonstrates [I believe] with malice that it will \n     only selectively meet its obligations with respect to \n     internationally sanctioned weapons programs. What meaningful \n     steps will the Administration take to respond to the latest \n     Iranian provocations?\n       As Iran is prone to do, [I view] this is a test of American \n     commitment and resolve, which, I believe, must be met with a \n     decisive response in the language that Iran understands--for \n     every action there is a consequence.\n\n  I went on in that letter to say:\n\n       I write to recommend to you that you use the \n     Administration's discretionary authority to tighten the full \n     range of sanctions available to you to penalize Iran for \n     violating UNSCR 1929. From your responses at the July 23 \n     [Senate Foreign Relations Committee] hearing, I understand \n     that tightening sanctions for non-nuclear related infractions \n     would not violate the terms of the Iran Nuclear Agreement, \n     even if it were presently in its full implementation phase.\n\n  Which it is not.\n\n       The Administration should also encourage P5+1 partners to \n     respond with similar measures. Does the Administration plan \n     to use its current authority to tighten available sanctions \n     against Iran?\n       Iran is not only testing the Administration, it is also \n     testing our international partners. The launch, coordinated \n     on the same day that Iran's Parliament approved the general \n     outline of the Iran Nuclear Agreement should send a clear \n     signal to the United States, the P5+1, and the United Nations \n     Security Council that Iran's nuclear program and its weapons \n     programs are linked--and that the Iranian regime has every \n     intention of maintaining this status quo. The Administration \n     should lead the P5+1 and the UNSC to respond swiftly, \n     decisively, and unapologetically.\n       The series of test launches of Iranian ballistic missiles \n     that have led us to this point are part of a larger weapons \n     development program, that when taken together with Iran's \n     history of deception, its opaque nuclear capabilities, past \n     violations of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, its fiery \n     rhetoric, destabilizing activities throughout the region, and \n     well-documented malign intent, requires a strong \n     international response.\n\n  And particularly, I note: The time to act was then and now again--\ncertainly now--before Iran can exploit U.N. Security Council resolution \n2231 because that particular resolution failed to incorporate the same \nmandatory language that U.N. Security Council resolution 1929 has.\n  In 1929, the world said: You cannot conduct ballistic missile tests \nand work on the development of ballistic missiles. When we struck the \ndeal with Iran, we went through a different language where we strongly \ncalled upon Iran not to do so for the next 8 years. But strongly \ncalling upon a country--from the Security Council--not to do something \nis not prohibiting those threatening activities.\n  We do have sanctions that are in place and a Security Council \nresolution that is in place, because the deal has not gone into full \neffect until implementation takes place, where Iran is already \nviolating the international will as expressed by those Security Council \nresolutions.\n  I would argue that in addition to the fact that they are defying the \nwill of the international community as it relates to their missile \nweapons program--which can carry a nuclear warhead--I think they are \ntesting the will of the international community when it comes to the \nquestion of how serious we will be about violations of the nuclear \nagreement. And the sooner that we are stronger in our response to their \nviolations of the Security Council resolutions on missile technology \nand the missile weapons systems, the sooner they will understand we \nwill not allow them to ultimately violate the agreement we struck with \nthem as it relates to their nuclear program, and if they do, there are \nserious consequences.\n  Iran has tested the world. I have followed Iran since I first was in \nthe House of Representatives and it came to my knowledge that the \nUnited States was sending voluntary contributions to the International \nAtomic Energy Agency above and beyond our membership dues. When I \ninquired as to what it was for, it ended up that it was to help the \nIAEA, help Iran create operational capacity at the Bushehr nuclear \nfacility. Well, that wasn't in the national interests of the United \nStates and certainly not in the national and security interests of our \nally the State of Israel. I led a successful drive to stop those \nvoluntary contributions in the House.\n  From that day, in the beginning of my House career, I followed Iran, \nbecause I said: Why does a country that has such huge--I think it is \nthe fourth largest--oil reserves--and right up there as relates to gas \nreserves--need nuclear power for domestic energy consumption? It \ndoesn't. I have followed Iran since then, and I have seen that by \ntesting the international community's will at every step of the way, \nthey advanced their nuclear program to where it came to the point--\nalmost like our too-big-to-fail banks--well, this was too big to stop, \nso we tried to manage it. Now they are testing the world as it relates \nto their missile technology and missile weapons program. Again, we see \na lack of response.\n  My letter to the Secretary of State on October 19--also, separate \nfrom that, there was a series of letters from other colleagues about \nthe same issue--has not been responded to. We are going on 2 months \nsince this action took place, and there is silence. As a matter of \nfact, the only things I have read are press reports about the latest \nviolation, but I haven't seen the administration say a word about it.\n  So as the Iranians get the sense that they can go ahead and violate \nthe international will as expressed through Security Council \nresolutions and face no consequence as a result thereof, then based \nupon history we are going to face an Iran that is going to test the \ninternational community as it relates to its commitments in the Iran \nnuclear program. If we do not send a strong message now, we are only \ninviting attempts to violate that agreement.\n  I am very much of the belief that once you violate international \nagreements, you have to have a consequence just on that basis. When we \nwere having the great debate about the Iran deal, we were told that \nthis is just about the nuclear program; that human rights violations, \nweapons violations, and violations in terms of their activities to \ndestabilize the region and their hegemonic interests--that we are going \nto push back on all of those things. Well, I haven't seen that. I \nhaven't seen that. And that, to me, invites a great risk.\n  So I urge the administration to act decisively, to pursue both in the \nSecurity Council and apart from the Security Council, with our P5+1 \nallies, sanctionable items that can be outside of the nuclear \nportfolio, that can send a very strong message to Iran that ``Don't \nthink you can get away with these types of actions and have no \nconsequence.''\n  Secondly, I seriously believe this is another example of why the Iran \nsanctions act, which I helped author and which was passed \noverwhelmingly in the Senate and expires this coming year, needs to be \nreauthorized, because if there is a belief that there will be no \nsanctions in place as a result of any violations that take place, what \nare we snapping back to? What are we snapping back to? I believe there \nis nothing wrong with at least having those sanctions reauthorized and \nthe Iranians having an understanding that if they violate the \nagreement, there are sanctions to snap back to.\n  What they are doing in their violations of the Security Council \nresolutions as it relates to missile weapons programs is already a \nbellwether of what I believe their actions will be if we cannot \nultimately meet the test of their challenge. And they are testing us. \nThis is the same Iran that I saw for years test the international will, \nbeing told they cannot advance their nuclear program, to the point that \nit got to such an extent that we struck a deal. That is the risk we \nface here.\n  So I look forward to pursuing a robust response to Iran. For all of \nmy colleagues who supported the agreement, this is actually something \nwe should be in chorus together on to ensure that Iran has a very clear \nmessage that ``We intend to push back on you. You cannot violate the \ninternational law.'' By doing so, hopefully we will see the performance \nof an agreement that is supposed to control their nuclear program in a \nway that does not risk the world security. That is what is at stake in \nthis regard.\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\n  I will close by simply saying that if you pass by the Archives \nBuilding, over its portal there is this statement: ``What is past is \nprologue.'' I hope that statement isn't a reality as we face the \nchallenge of an Iran that feels strongly within the region, that \ncreates greater instability through its support of Hezbollah, that \nsupports Assad and continues a civil war in which thousands and \nthousands are dying, creating the rise of ISIS at the end of the day by \na state that is virtually a failed state at this point in time and \nputting undue influence on its neighbor, Iraq, a country for which we \nhave shed so many lives and national treasure. Something is wrong in \nthat equation, and I hope my colleagues will wake up to it and will \njoin us in an effort to try to make sure we push back in a way that is \nnot only appropriate and within the international order but necessary \nif we truly do not want Iran to achieve nuclear power for nuclear \nweapons.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank my colleague who just spoke \nfor his vigilance in reminding us how we have to pay attention every \nsingle day to what is happening in Iran and to be smart and strategic \nand let them know we are very serious about pushing back.\n\n\n                           Religious Freedom\n\n  Madam President, in this country one of our core values is that you \ncan come here and build a better life for yourself and for your family. \nThat is the American dream. Our Nation was founded by people who had \nthat dream, people who dreamt of religious freedom. Many of our \nancestors followed that dream to these shores, from the early Puritans \nand Quakers, Irish and German immigrants, Italian and Jewish \nimmigrants, and so many others. Life was not easy for them. They faced \ndiscrimination and even violence by those who were suspicious of them, \nwho saw them as different, who challenged their right to have the \nAmerican dream. But those Americans worked very hard and built a life \nfor themselves. They raised families and became successful. They opened \nsmall businesses and large businesses. They became doctors and lawyers. \nThey served in our armed services. They served as police officers and \nfirefighters. They ran for office. They made amazing contributions to \nour Nation's economy and culture. They helped make America great.\n  That core value, our American dream, is being challenged today. \nDonald Trump, who is running for President of the United States of \nAmerica, has suggested that we ban all Muslims from coming into our \ncountry based purely on their faith, on their religion. As someone who \nrepresents the most densely populated Muslim population in America, I \nfind this suggestion, this statement, to be outrageous and absolutely \nun-American because I know the rich history that people of Muslim faith \nhave created in my State and the contributions they make every single \nday to our economy, to our wonderfully diverse culture, and the quality \nof life in our communities.\n  Hundreds of thousands of people from Muslim countries came to \nsoutheastern Michigan in the early part of the last century, like so \nmany others from the South and around the country and the world, after \nHenry Ford offered a $5-a-day wage to work in America's first \nautomobile factories. Those Muslim Americans were still working in \nthose plants during World War II, building the so-called arsenal of \ndemocracy--the planes, the ships, the tanks that won the war and \ndefeated the enemies of democracy.\n  Many thousands of Muslim Americans have served our Nation during \ntimes of war, and many thousands are serving our country right now, at \nthis very moment. They are putting their lives on the line right now \nfor the freedoms we all hold dear. Take a walk through Arlington \nNational Cemetery, and you will see many graves bearing the crescent \nand star. How can anyone question the patriotism of those Americans who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for our country? They helped make America \ngreat. Those men and women who defended us in the Armed Forces loved \nAmerica, and they died for America because America is their home, their \nfamily's home. So of course they see ISIS as the enemy, just as every \nnon-Muslim American does as well. Their families are the ones who are \non the front lines of the violence in the Middle East. Their families \nhave lost their homes, their businesses, and in many cases their lives \nbecause of the brutality and violence of ISIS. Their families are the \nones fleeing the violence to save their children. Muslim Americans \nunderstand that ISIS does not represent Islam.\n\n  Within every religion, there are violent individuals who twist the \nmeaning of sacred texts and symbols to justify acts of violence and \nmurder--every religion. The KKK used blessed symbols of Christianity \nwhile terrorizing and murdering African Americans. Just as the Ku Klux \nKlan does not speak for Christians, ISIS does not speak for Muslims.\n  Furthermore, we must recognize that our culture of inclusion and our \ntradition of welcoming people of different faiths since the beginning \nof our country are our greatest weapons in defeating ISIS.\n  What ISIS desires more than anything else is to see our country \ndiscriminate against Muslim Americans so they can use that as a \nrecruiting tool all over social media, which we know they are very \neffective at doing. They want Muslim Americans to believe that America \nis not their home, that we do not value their leadership and \ncontributions in our communities, that America does not welcome their \nfaith, and that America hates them. They want that. That cannot be who \nwe are. That is not who we are.\n  All of us were shaken by the violence in Paris and San Bernardino, \nbut we know that fear cannot be our guide in America. President \nFranklin Roosevelt understood that fear makes America weak. America is \ngreat when America is united and not pitting neighbor against neighbor, \nwhich is happening in too many places in my State and across the \ncountry. When we are united and dedicated to our principals of freedom \nand liberty, we are great. The first liberty of our Constitution's \nFirst Amendment is the freedom of worship.\n  When I think about the Muslim American children in Michigan who were \nafraid to go to school today because of what might happen to them after \nhearing what Donald Trump was saying about them and their families, it \nmakes me sick to my stomach. I want those children to know that his \nwords are not what America stands for. It is not what makes America \ngreat. It is not. It is those children--Muslim and Christian and \nJewish--all of whom are full of hope and promise for the future who \nwill make America great again, and I stand with them.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                         Senate Accomplishments\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, just a few days ago on the Senate floor, \nthe Senate Democratic leader said:\n\n       One of the newspapers here has a Pinocchio check, and they \n     look at the facts and analyze them and then they can give up \n     to four Pinocchios meaning people simply didn't tell the \n     truth. . . . So, this is the most unproductive Senate in the \n     history of the country, and there are facts and figures to \n     show that.\n\n  That was said by the Senate Democratic leader on December 2 on the \nfloor of the Senate. Well, unfortunately for him, the Washington Post, \nwhich runs the fact checker, fact checked his statement and it came \nback with three Pinocchios. The most you can get is four Pinocchios, \nand they gave him three Pinocchios. There are degrees of falsehood, and \nI think three Pinocchios denotes a pretty big whopper. The Senate \nDemocratic leader, by suggesting that this is one of the most \nunproductive Senates in the history of the country, was busted by the \nfact checker with three Pinocchios for making what was a false \nstatement.\n  The truth of the matter is, contrary to the assertions of the Senate \nDemocratic leader, it has been a very busy year here in the Senate--\nfrom voting to repeal ObamaCare to passing the first long-term \nTransportation bill in a decade and, I might add, the first balanced \nbudget bill in 14 years. Republicans have been working hard to fulfill \nour promise to get Washington working again for American families.\n  If you listen to the media, sometimes they would have you believe \nthat nothing ever gets done in Washington, but the truth is that we \nhave been able to make progress on a number of important issues this \nyear. One accomplishment I am particularly proud of is the\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\nlong-term Transportation bill that Congress passed this last week. It \nis the first long-term Transportation bill in a decade.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has made a habit of passing \nnumerous short-term funding extensions for Federal transportation \nprograms. In fact, I think prior to the passage last week of this long-\nterm highway bill, there have been no fewer than 37 short-term \nextensions. That is an incredibly inefficient way to manage our \nNation's infrastructure needs, and it wasted an incredible amount of \nmoney. It also put a lot of transportation jobs in jeopardy. Hundreds \nof thousands of jobs around the country depend on the funding contained \nin Transportation bills. When Congress fails to provide certainty about \nthe way transportation funding will be allocated, States and local \ngovernments are left without the certainty they need to authorize \nprojects or to make long-term plans for addressing various \ntransportation infrastructure needs. That means essential construction \nprojects get deferred, necessary repairs may not get made, and jobs \nthat depend upon transportation get put in jeopardy.\n  The Transportation bill we passed last week changes all of that. It \nreauthorizes transportation programs for the long term and provides 5 \nyears of guaranteed funding. That means States and local governments \nwill have the certainty they need to invest in big transportation \nprojects and the jobs that they create, and that in turn means a \nstronger economy and a more reliable, safe, and effective \ntransportation system.\n  This new Transportation bill will also provide much needed \naccountability and transparency about where taxpayer dollars are spent. \nAs chairman of the commerce committee, I spent a lot of time working \nwith committee members on both sides of the aisle to develop the bill's \nsafety provisions.\n  One portion of the bill includes a host of important safety \nimprovements, including enhancements to the notification process to \nensure consumers are informed of auto-related recalls and important \nreforms of the government agency responsible for overseeing safety in \nour Nation's cars and trucks.\n  Another important bill we passed this year is the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act. Cyber attacks are increasing, and it seems \nthat every week we hear of a new breach putting Americans' private \ninformation at risk. According to the security firm Symantec, last year \nalone more than 300 million new types of malicious software or computer \nviruses were introduced on the Web. That is nearly 1 million new \nthreats every single day.\n  In October, the Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing \nAct, which will help keep Americans' data safe from hackers by \nincreasing the exchange of cyber threat information between the public \nand private sectors.\n  As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure we are \nmeeting the needs of our men and women in uniform and of our Nation's \nveterans. This year, under the new Republican majority and the \nleadership of Chairman Isakson, the Senate has worked in a bipartisan \nmanner to advance numerous bills to serve our veterans. We passed the \nClay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which provides \nadditional resources to help combat the tragedy of veteran suicides.\n  We have improved the Veterans Choice Act to better realize the intent \nof Congress, and that was to make sure veterans don't have to face \nsignificant wait times or travel distances over 40 miles to receive the \ncare they need. We expanded eligibility to permit more veterans to seek \ncare close to home and increase the number of non-VA providers in our \ncommunities that can deliver that care.\n  Congress also continues to examine the issue of VA accountability to \nmake sure our veterans never again have to suffer delays in treatment, \nas we saw with the national embarrassment of falsified wait times that \nthe VA revealed last year. I believe this oversight by Congress is an \nimportant first step in making sure the VA works for our veterans and \nnot for the VA bureaucracy.\n  Congress also passed the Defense authorization bill this year, which \nincorporated a number of critical reforms that will expand the \nresources available to our military men and women and strengthen our \nnational security.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act for 2016 tackles waste and \ninefficiency at the Department of Defense and focuses funding on our \nwar fighters rather than on the Pentagon bureaucracy. This bill also \noverhauls our military retirement system. Before this bill, the system \nlimited retirement benefits to soldiers who had served for 20 years or \nmore, which means there were huge numbers of soldiers, including many \nveterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, who retired after years \nof service without having accrued any retirement benefits. The National \nDefense Authorization Act replaces this system with a new retirement \nsystem that would ensure the majority of our Nation's soldiers receive \nretirement benefits for their years of service to our country, even if \nthey have not reached the 20-year mark.\n  One thing Republicans were determined to do this year as well was to \nsend legislation repealing ObamaCare to the President's desk. Five and \na half years after the so-called Affordable Care Act was signed into \nlaw, it has become abundantly clear that the law is not working. It is \nnot lowering premiums. Premiums are going up. It is not reducing health \ncare costs. Health care costs are going up dramatically. It costs \n$4,000 for the average family. It is not protecting access to doctors \nor to hospitals. In fact, for some Americans, ObamaCare has driven up \nthe cost of health care to unimaginable levels. I heard from 1 \nconstituent in Hill City, SD, whose family's 2016 health care bill will \nbe $25,653--$25,653. In the words of this constituent: How can a yearly \nbill of $25,653 be affordable to a retired couple? The answer, of \ncourse, is that it can't be; $25,653 or $2,137 a month is approximately \ndouble the average family's monthly mortgage payment. People are paying \ntwice as much for their health insurance as they are paying for their \nmortgage.\n  The ObamaCare repeal bill that the Senate passed last week starts the \nprocess of moving away from ObamaCare and toward the kind of real \nhealth care reform that Americans are looking for--an affordable, \naccountable, patient-focused system that gives individuals control of \ntheir health care decisions.\n  I am also pleased that the ObamaCare repeal bill protects unborn \nAmericans by redirecting funding for Planned Parenthood, an \norganization that performs well over a quarter million abortions each \nyear. It shifts that funding to organizations like community health \ncenters, which provide affordable, essential health services to women \nacross the country, and funding them is a far better use of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  In my State of South Dakota, these centers are in more than two dozen \nrural communities and in towns where there is no Planned Parenthood, so \nredirecting these funds makes it easier for women across my State to \nhave access to affordable, essential health care services.\n  While all Americans agree that we should protect our air and water \nand use our natural resources responsibly, under President Obama the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has run amok. During the course of the \nObama administration, this Agency has implemented one damaging rule \nafter another, from a massive national backdoor energy tax that would \nhurt poor and working families the most to a new rule that would \nsubject ponds and puddles in America's backyards to a complex array of \nexpensive and burdensome regulatory requirements. Containing this out-\nof-control government bureaucracy is a priority for Republicans, and we \nhave taken up multiple pieces of legislation this year to check the \nEPA's overreach. While the President may have blocked our efforts for \nnow, we are going to keep working to protect Americans from damaging \nrules like the waters of the United States rule and the national energy \ntax.\n  Over the course of the Obama administration, our national debt has \ngone from $10.6 trillion to a staggering $18.8 trillion. Meanwhile, \nentitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security are heading \nrapidly toward bankruptcy. If action isn't taken soon, our financial \nsituation could end up crippling our economy.\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\n  While there is a lot more work left to do, this year's Senate \nRepublicans took steps toward improving our Nation's fiscal health. In \nthe spring, we passed a balanced budget--the first joint House-Senate \nbalanced budget in 14 years. Every American family has to stick to a \nbudget and Congress should be no different. This year's balanced budget \nneeds to be the first of many going forward.\n  Entitlement reform is also essential if we want to protect Americans' \nentitlement security. This year we began the process of putting both \nSocial Security and Medicare on a more stable financial footing so \nthese programs will continue to be available to current and future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I could go on and talk about the Education bill that we are \nconsidering right now that will return power to States and local school \nboards or the legislation that we passed to give law enforcement new \ntools to fight human trafficking and expand the resources available to \nvictims or the bill that we passed to expand opportunities for American \nworkers and open new markets for goods marked ``Made in the USA.''\n  I want to stop here and say, while Republicans are proud of what we \nhave accomplished this year, we know there is a lot left to do. Wages \nare still stagnant, our economy is still sluggish, and too many \nfamilies are still struggling under huge health care bills.\n  In addition to the challenges facing Americans at home, we face a \nnumber of challenges abroad, foremost among them the threat posed by \nISIS, which is responsible for the deadly attacks in Paris last month, \nas well as a campaign of havoc and bloodshed throughout the Middle \nEast. Even here at home we received a grim reminder of the global \ninfluence of ISIS's twisted ideology last week with what appears to be \na terrorist-inspired attack that took 14 American lives in San \nBernardino. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and the \nfamilies.\n  While the President should be playing the leading role in building a \ncoalition to destroy this terrorist organization, unfortunately his \nspeech Sunday night demonstrated that he has little to offer beyond the \nsame failed strategy that has helped us end up where we are right now--\nwith an emboldened terrorist organization carrying out and inspiring \nmass casualty attacks far beyond Iraq and Syria.\n  We are at a tipping point in the fight against ISIS, and if we don't \ncome up with an effective political military response in the very near \nfuture, we will be facing the prospect of even greater bloodshed in the \nMiddle East and more terrorist attacks here in the homeland.\n  While we succeeded in having a number of bills become law this year, \nunfortunately many others were stopped by the President. Still others, \nsuch as our efforts to protect unborn children capable of feeling pain \nfrom being killed by abortion, were stopped by Democrats in the Senate. \nWhile we have temporarily lost some of these battles, the debate will \ncontinue. Republicans will not give up. Whether it is protecting \nfamilies from the President's national energy tax or repealing \nObamaCare, we will redouble our efforts to make sure Washington is \nmeeting the needs of American families and addressing the American \npeople's priorities.\n  We plan to spend the second year of the 114th Congress the way we \nspent the first: fighting to make our economy stronger, our government \nmore efficient and more accountable, and our Nation and our world safer \nand more secure.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                       Paris Climate Change Talks\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to share a little bit of details \nabout the climate talks that are going on in Paris at this very moment. \nA number of us in the Senate were able to go to Paris last weekend and \nto be engaged in that dialogue.\n  What I was terrifically struck by was that 150 heads of state had \ncome together to kick off these climate talks. That is the largest \ngathering of heads of state in human history. Why did that landmark \nevent occur? It occurred because the challenge of global warming is the \nmost grave concern facing human civilization on this planet, so heads \nof state wanted to be there to acknowledge the fact that we must come \ntogether as a community of nations across this globe and work together \nto take this on for the good of our stewardship of this planet. A \nlarger number of nations have put forward pledges on the efforts they \nare going to make to reduce global warming gases, and 186 nations have \nput forward those pledges.\n  One of the issues that is embedded in these climate talks is how \nambitious the international community should be. There is this broad \ngoal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees centigrade over the course \nof this century. We have already gone up to 0.9. We are almost halfway \nto that level that has been identified by scientists as a catastrophic \nlevel, but the pledges that are being made in Paris are not sufficient \nto keep us to 2 degrees. So that is one of the points of discussion--\nhow can the community of nations be more ambitious.\n  One of the points being made is that we should come back together \nevery 5 years to keep redoubling our efforts; that we know the pledges \nbeing made in Paris will not be enough, so we have to keep coming back \nto this challenge.\n  We also have observed how dramatically the amount of information has \nchanged over the last 5 years. We know that in another 25 years we will \nhave a lot more information about what is occurring in the world and \nhow successful the initial efforts have been.\n  Then there is a group that is saying we need to go even further and \nwork to reduce the amount of damage that could be done, and that means \nlimiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, which would take an even faster \ntransition from a fossil fuel energy economy to a renewable energy \neconomy. So that is an area of conversation--how ambitious can we be as \nan international community at this point and how can we improve on the \nefforts being put forward in Paris in the years to come.\n  A second point is that there is a profound need for working together \nbetween developed nations and developing nations, between richer \nnations and poorer nations. Poorer nations are saying: We have a lot of \nfolks who have never had access to electricity, and we need to provide \nthe cheapest pathway to provide that electricity. Often, that is coal. \nWell, then, how do we make renewable, clean energy as inexpensive as \ncoal energy so that nations can bypass establishing that utility-scale \nfossil fuel infrastructure. So that is a key piece of conversation.\n  A third point is about reporting requirements. In order for us to \nhave good policy now and in the future, we have to have good numbers on \nwhat is happening around the world, nation to nation. Nations feel a \nlittle sensitive about this idea of having an international community \nkind of working to double check the way they evaluate what is going on \nat home, but we need to convey the notion that these numbers--good \nnumbers coming from each nation--are essential for nations to be able \nto participate in this international effort that will lead to success \nin curbing runaway global warming.\n  I think it is enormously clear that Paris is a tremendous step \nforward. The number of heads of state that have attended, the number of \nnations that have put forward pledges, the intensity of the \nconversation at this very moment--people are recognizing that we are \nthe first generation that has been impacted by global warming, and we \nare the last that can do something significant about it because, \nunfortunately, as we go forward a generation from now, we have not \nsucceeded in curbing global warming gases. The carbon dioxide and \nmethane gas will have such a profound feedback mechanism that it will \nbe much harder to address this issue.\n  I am pleased the administration has taken this so seriously and that \nnations throughout the world are taking it so seriously.\n\n\n                               H.R. 1599\n\n  Also, Madam President, I want to turn to the budget and spending \nnegotiations underway right now. I came to the floor last week to note \nthat there were conversations occurring about possibly taking away \nStates' rights to be able to pass laws labeling food that is GE or GMO \nfood; that is, genetically engineered or genetically modified food. To \ndo so would simply be wrong--wrong in the absence of a cohesive, \ncoherent, easy-to-use system of labeling at the Federal level, which we \ndo not\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\nhave. It would be an intrusion on States' rights in one of the most \nsensitive areas to citizens, and that is the food they put in their \nmouth.\n  This act of taking away States' rights and citizens' rights to know \nwhat is in their food is known as the DARK Act, the Deny Americans the \nRight to Know Act--the acronym DARK. Isn't it ironic that there are \nlegislators here who are not only pursuing the DARK Act, but they are \npursuing it in the dark of night. They are afraid to have a \nconversation in the relevant policy committee to address it. Whenever \nlegislators fear public reaction, fear addressing the pros and cons in \na public forum, you can bet there is something wrong with what they are \nup to. So that is why we must all be vigilant in these coming days to \nmake sure this DARK Act is not inserted into the must-pass spending \nbill in the dark of night.\n\n\n                        Embracing All Religions\n\n  Madam President, I want to close, to follow up on the comments I made \nyesterday about the proposal from Donald Trump to bar Muslims from \nentering our country under any avenue--not as refugees, not as business \nmen and women, not as tourists, not as students--and again say how \nabsolutely wrong it would be. This is the single worst idea I have \nheard from a Presidential candidate, ever.\n  We should all recognize that right now our men and women in uniform \nof every religion--Christian and Protestant and Catholic and Jewish and \nMuslim and Buddhist and who knows what other religions--they are \nworking together to take on the terrorist threat known as ISIS. Islam \nis not our enemy. ISIS is our enemy. Right now we are working in \npartnership with nations that are Islamic nations, and those leaders \nare Islamic. We are saying to them: We will work in partnership with \nyou because Islam is not our enemy. ISIS is our enemy.\n  I can tell my colleagues that ISIS has a strategy. Their strategy has \nbeen to create their mission as the United States against Islam, and \nthe comments of Donald Trump played right into the playbook of the \nterrorists, making our Nation less safe, increasing the radicalization \nof folks around the world who have been listening to the message from \nISIS and now have some reason to believe it might have some \nfoundation--that America is against Islam. We are not, and we have been \nhearing that from Democratic voices and we have been hearing that from \nRepublican voices. We have been hearing it from Senators and from House \nMembers across Capitol Hill. We have been hearing it from legislators \nand we have been hearing it from citizens, Americans standing up and \nsaying that Donald Trump is wrong. That is certainly something to be \napplauded. I praise my colleagues of both parties. I praise our \ncitizens of both parties who have stood up to say we stand shoulder to \nshoulder with all patriotic Americans regardless of their religion, and \nwe are united in taking on ISIS.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the education \nreform conference report that we will be voting on tomorrow, which I \nthink is a good bill for two big reasons. First, it restores a \nsignificant level of decisionmaking power to the States and local \nschool districts, which is where decisions about things like curriculum \nshould occur. It diminishes the ability of the administration to \npressure school districts and States into adopting the Common Core \ncurriculum, for instance, leaving it to the discretion of the States \nand school districts to decide exactly what their curriculum will be. I \nthink that is a sensible and appropriate approach.\n  There is another big reason I think this education reform bill is an \nimportant bipartisan victory for kids, and that is for the first time I \nam aware of, the Congress is acting to protect our kids from pedophiles \nwho infiltrate our schools and who have sexually abused children in the \nclassroom.\n  I know you are actively supportive of this effort, as many of our \ncolleagues are, and I am delighted we were able to make it through the \nentire process, as painful and slow as it was. This important provision \nsurvived this process, and we will be voting tomorrow on the overall \nbill.\n  I want to talk about this a little bit, but let me make it clear \nright up front that I understand--as I assume we all do--that the vast, \noverwhelming majority of teachers and school employees would never harm \nchildren in their care. They would never hurt them. They would never do \nit. They care deeply about the kids, and that is probably a big part of \nthe reason they pursued a career in education. But it is also a fact \nthat schools are where the children are and pedophiles in our midst are \nvery aware of that, and they are attracted to schools for exactly that \nreason. The number of pedophiles who are succeeding in abusing children \nin schools is absolutely shocking; it is to me. Last year there were \n459 school employees, mostly teachers--not all teachers but employees \nin schools--arrested for sexual misconduct with the children they are \nsupposed to be taking care of. That is more than one a day, and \nunfortunately 26 of them were in Pennsylvania.\n  So far, 2015 is almost over. We have already exceeded the number from \n2014. We are on a path to have well over 460 teachers and other school \nemployees arrested for sexual misconduct with kids. Let's be honest; an \narrest occurs only when there is sufficient evidence to press charges, \nto make a criminal case in a court of law. How many more cases are \noccurring where we haven't had sufficient evidence to prosecute?\n  The story that put this need on my radar is the absolutely horrendous \nstory of a child named Jeremy Bell. This story begins in Delaware \nCounty, PA. One of the schoolteachers was molesting young boys. In \ntime, the school administrators discovered what was going on. The local \ndistrict attorney didn't feel there was enough evidence to actually \nprosecute a case. You know, it is hard to fire a teacher, so what the \nschool did is it sat the teacher down and said: Here's the deal. You \nneed to leave, but don't worry. We will give you a letter of \nrecommendation so you can get a job somewhere else. That is exactly \nwhat happened.\n  This monster went to West Virginia, got hired as a teacher, and \neventually became a principal. Of course along the way he continued to \nabuse children. In the end he raped and murdered a 12-year-old boy \nnamed Jeremy Bell. Justice finally caught up with this monster. He is \nserving a life sentence in prison as we speak, but it was too late for \nJeremy Bell.\n  As a father of three young children, I find this whole idea so \nappalling that it is hard to talk about it and hard to think about it. \nWe would all like to think that a story like the story of Jeremy Bell \nis a freak occurrence, a once-in-a-million-years kind of thing, but \nthat is not the case. It is just not true. In fact, it has happened so \nfrequently that it has its own name. It is called passing the trash. \nThe people who spend their lives serving and helping the victims of \nthese horrendous crimes to cope with them know about this phenomenon \nall too well.\n  I will give you more recent examples. Just this year, WUSA News 9 \nreported that the school district of Montgomery County, MD, had a \nrecord of passing the trash. An elementary school teacher named Daniel \nPicca abused children for 17 years. The Maryland school district knew \nwhat was going on. What did they do? The teacher's punishment was to be \nmoved from school to school to school, reassigning him every time a \nproblem emerged, as though the problem was the school and not the \npedophile. For 17 years they were passing a known child molester from \none group of victims to another.\n  Consider a case of the Las Vegas, NV, kindergarten teacher who was \nrecently arrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting her \nwith a sexually transmitted disease in the course of abusing her. That \nsame teacher had molested six children--all fourth and fifth grade \nchildren--just a few years before when he was working in the Los \nAngeles school district. The Los Angeles school district knew about the \nallegations, but when the Nevada school specifically asked if there \nwere any criminal concerns regarding this teacher when he was applying \nfor a job there, the Los Angeles school district not only hid the \ntruth, it provided three references for the teacher--so strong was \ntheir interest in making him become someone else's problem.\n  These are examples that are all the more disturbing when you consider\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\nthat, according to a study by the GAO--Government Accountability \nOffice--the average pedophile working at a school victimizes 73 \nchildren over the course of a lifetime.\n  We have an opportunity tomorrow to say enough is enough. This is \nenough. This has been way too much--no more children falling prey to \nthese monsters who have been able to infiltrate our classrooms, no more \nchildhoods shattered, no more families devastated with grief, no more \nJeremy Bells.\n  The amendment itself is just common sense--really just common \ndecency. It simply holds that if a State accepts Federal education \nfunds, it has to have a law that bans the practice of knowingly \nrecommending a pedophile to another school. Is there anybody in \nPennsylvania or Colorado who thinks that is unreasonable? I don't think \nso.\n  I am delighted that we have gotten to this point. There are a lot of \npeople I would like to thank for their help. I have to start with \nSenator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who joined me at the very \nbeginning. We introduced this legislation over 2 years ago as a \nfreestanding bill. In addition to banning passing the trash, it would \nrequire thorough and rigorous background checks for any school worker \nwho has unsupervised access to children. That part was not included in \nthis. I am not giving up on that. We will have that fight again. The \npart that bans passing the trash did succeed and demonstrates that with \nperseverance the right outcome can occur.\n  I would like to thank the other cosponsors of this legislation, \nSenators McConnell, Alexander, Capito, Cotton, Gardner, Heller, Inhofe, \nJohnson, McCain, Roberts, Vitter, and Wicker. I would particularly like \nto thank the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Alexander, and \nSenator Murray, the ranking member. We talked about how we could make \nthis work mechanically and make sure that we have legislation that will \nin fact achieve the desired outcome.\n  I also need to send out a huge thank-you to all the child advocates \nand the law enforcement folks around the country, especially in \nPennsylvania, who worked so hard to make this legislation happen. They \nwere invaluable. I hope they realize how much of a difference they made \nin helping to persuade our colleagues to get this done.\n  I thank Terri Miller and John Seryak of S.E.S.A.M.E., who have been \nfighting to protect children in the classroom for decades. I also thank \nthe National Children's Alliance and the many child advocacy centers \nacross Pennsylvania, most of which I have been able to visit, for the \nwonderful work they do for kids who need it badly; the Pennsylvania \nCoalition Against Rape; the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren; the Center For Children's Justice; MassKids; the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics; the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys; the \nNational District Attorneys Association; the Pennsylvania District \nAttorney's Association; the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation; the National Sheriffs' Association; and the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations. Every one of these groups weighed \nin on this legislation and helped us to get this over the goal line \nover the course of a long, protracted series of negotiations.\n  Tomorrow I think we are going to have an important victory in our \nongoing effort to protect children from sexual abuse. It is the first \ntime that the U.S. Congress has acted to protect children in this way. \nThere is more that needs to be done. I still think we need to revisit \nthe state of the background checks that are applied. There are States \nthat do not have an adequate background check system in place, and if \nthey are taking Federal funding--which they are--they ought to have an \nadequate background check system.\n  The truth is that this is a big step forward, and I am delighted we \nwere able to get here. I am grateful for the help of every Senator who \nhelped us get to this point. For this reason, for the sake of this \namendment as well as the general thrust of the legislation, which is to \nmove decisionmaking power back to the States and school districts where \nit belongs, I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the \nconference report tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, thank you very much. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Paris Climate Change Negotiations\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Ben Cardin, led a delegation of 10 \nSenators to Paris this past weekend. We went to support the ``high-\nambition coalition'' on the international climate agreement. It was \ntruly impressive to see so many nations represented at the meeting, \nactive and trying to help. All of us in the codel came away from Paris \nwith a good feeling about the prospects for a strong climate agreement.\n  I had the chance to speak at Oceans Day, where people were keenly \naware that the effects of carbon pollution on our oceans are \nundeniable. You can measure the warming oceans with thermometers. You \nmeasure sea level rise with basically a yardstick. You can measure \nacidification of the seas with simple pH tests. You can replicate what \nexcess CO2 does to seawater in a basic high school science \nlab. That is why the big, phony climate denial apparatus the fossil \nfuel industry is running never talks about oceans. It is undeniable \nthere.\n  I also had a chance in Paris to cheer on our bright, young \nnegotiating team staff, who worked late hours in their windowless \ncommon workspace but were very enthusiastic and made me very proud.\n  The delegation also met with Todd Stern, who was leading the U.S. \nnegotiating team, and we visited the NOAA scientists who were at the \nU.S. Pavilion. The U.S. presence there was great.\n  One thing was sad, and that is that our Senate delegation of 10 \nSenators was all Democrats. The last political bastian of the fossil \nfuel industry worldwide is now the American Republican Party. No \nRepublican was able to come with us. The fossil fuel industry would \nnever let them.\n  I will say the fossil fuel industry is behaving reprehensibly. The \npower it exerts over Congress is polluting American democracy. The spin \nand propaganda it emits through a vast array of front groups are \npolluting our public discourse. Of course, its carbon emissions are \npolluting our atmosphere and oceans.\n  These fossil fuel companies are sinning, and on a monumental scale. \nRemember what Pope Francis said in his encyclical: ``Today . . . sin is \nmanifest in . . . attacks on nature. . . . [A] sin against ourselves \nand a sin against God.''\n  Their behavior is truly reprehensible. They have a lot to atone for.\n  But this is not exactly the American Republican party's finest hour, \neither. It is the world's only major political party so in tow to the \nfossil fuel industry that it cannot face up to the realities of carbon \npollution and climate change. Some ``city on a hill'' that leaves us.\n  Notwithstanding all the Republican intransigence, we were able to \ntell the world that we would have the President's back, and we will. We \nwill protect the Clean Power Plan, we will protect the Clean Air Act, \nand we will protect any agreement that comes out of Paris.\n  One nice thing in Paris was the presence of American companies, such \nas PG of California, VF Corporation of North Carolina--one of our \nbiggest apparel manufacturers--Citigroup of New York, Kellogg of \nMichigan, Ben and Jerry's of Vermont, and Facebook of basically \neverywhere. They were there to cheer on a good deal, and so was the \nAmerican Sustainable Business Council. And they have been doing this \nfor a long while.\n  Some of America's leading food companies took out this ad in the \nWashington Post and Financial Times on October 1 urging a strong \nagreement in Paris. The companies that have signed it include Mars--if \nyou like M, you know about Mars--General Mills, Nestle USA, Unilever \nCorporation, Kellogg Company, Stonyfield Farm, and Dannon USA. On \nNovember 24, it was updated with new signatories, including PepsiCo, \nCoca-Cola, and Hershey.\n  Quoting from the ad:\n\n       Dear US and Global Leaders:\n       Now is the time to meaningfully address the reality of \n     climate change. We are asking\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\n     you to embrace the opportunity presented to you in Paris. . . \n     . We are ready to meet the climate challenges that face our \n     businesses. Please join us in meeting the climate challenges \n     that face the world.\n\n  This is an ad taken out in Politico by another group of well-known \napparel companies, including Levi's--if you know blue jeans, you know \nLevi's; Gap; Eileen Fischer, VF Corporation, which makes Timberland, \nNorth Face, and a number of other well-known brands, urging a strong \nagreement in Paris. This ad ran during talks on Thursday, November 3:\n\n       To US and Global Leaders:\n       As the world gathers in Paris this week for the 2015 United \n     Nations Conference of the Parties, we come together, as some \n     of the largest, best known global apparel companies, to \n     acknowledge that climate change is harming the world in which \n     we operate. . . . We recognize that human-produced greenhouse \n     gas emissions are a key contributor to climate change. . . . \n     We support a strong global deal that will accelerate the \n     transition to a low carbon economy.\n\n  Those industries are not alone. Here is an ad from a coalition of \nabout 70 major American corporations again urging a strong agreement in \nParis. They include Coca-Cola, Adidas, Intel, Colgate Palmolive, the \nHartford Insurance Company, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, \nNational Grid, DuPont, the Outdoor Industry Association, and others. \nThey say:\n\n       Failure to tackle climate change could put America's \n     economic prosperity at risk. But the right action now would \n     create jobs and boost competitiveness. We encourage our \n     government to . . . seek a strong and fair global climate \n     deal in Paris.\n\n  Seventy major American corporations, every single one whose name you \nknow, are saying: We seek a fair climate deal in Paris.\n  Finally, this is a financial sector statement on climate change from \nthe financial giants: Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan \nChase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo, again calling for a robust \nglobal agreement out of Paris. They state:\n\n       We call for leadership and cooperation among governments \n     for commitments leading to a strong global climate agreement.\n\n  They want frameworks ``that recognize the costs of carbon.''\n  They say:\n\n       We are aligned on the importance of policies to address the \n     climate challenge.\n\n  It is time people started listening.\n  And let's not forget the more than 150 American companies that have \nsigned on to the White House's American Business Act on Climate Pledge, \njoining that call for a strong outcome on the Paris climate \nnegotiations. Those companies on the White House American Business Act \non Climate Pledge have operations in all 50 States, employ nearly 11 \nmillion people, represent more than $4.2 trillion in annual revenue, \nand have a combined market capitalization of over $7 trillion. Yet, if \nyou believe some of my friends on the other side, they are all just \npart of a big old hoax trying to fool everybody. Really?\n  Unfortunately, while the world is listening to these strong corporate \nvoices for a strong Paris agreement, these companies' own home State \nRepublican Senators are right here in Congress trying to undercut their \nhome State companies' work. But the world listens to the companies, not \nthe deniers.\n  One of their best voices is Unilever, whose CEO Paul Polman met with \nour delegation to express the growing support in the corporate \ncommunity for climate action and to describe Unilever's work to \ncatalyze that support.\n  We met with Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, and \nheard about a meeting scheduled for May here in Washington, DC, for \ncorporate CEOs to come to Congress and let us know they want climate \naction.\n  The grip of the fossil fuel companies on Congress will slip, as other \ncorporate leaders come forward to urge strong climate action. Pretty \nsoon, there is going to be a very small island of denial and \nobstruction left in a rising sea of reality. Pretty soon, there will be \nnobody left on the shrinking Denial Island but the fossil fuel \nindustry, the Koch brothers and their front groups, and the Republican \nMembers of Congress--oh yes, of course, can't forget the Republican \nPresidential candidates who are so desperate to toady up to the fossil \nfuel industry that they won't acknowledge this issue. Mark my words: As \nthe rest of corporate America stands up, the fossil fuel industry's \nfortress of denial and deceit will tumble down.\n  Paris sends a strong message of hope that echoes Pope Francis's \nstrong encyclical on climate change. Governments, corporations, and \ncivil society groups are a gathering force behind that message.\n  Vice President Gore, who has labored long in these vineyards, met \nwith us in Paris and had a strong message of hope. Against the gloomy \nfalsehoods the fossil fuel industry propagates, hope burns bright for \nthis gathering force.\n  The Vice President observed to us that ``things take longer to happen \nthan you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought \nthey could.'' From a man who has been through--uniquely--this all \ntaking a long, his confidence in fast happenings was heartening.\n  So not only is it time to wake up, but the world is waking up. \nCorporate America is waking up outside of the narrow, selfish confines \nof the fossil fuel industry. Wise Republicans are starting to stir--and \nthe sooner the better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmaterials I referred to during my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Dear US and Global Leaders:\n\n       This could be a turning point.\n       When you convene in Paris later this year for climate \n     negotiations, you will have an opportunity to take action \n     that could significantly change our world for the better.\n       As heads of some of the world's largest food companies, we \n     have come together today to call out that opportunity.\n       Climate change is bad for farmers and for agriculture. \n     Drought, flooding and hotter growing conditions threaten the \n     world's food supply and contribute to food insecurity.\n       By 2050, it is estimated that the world's population will \n     exceed nine billion, with two-thirds of all people living in \n     urban areas. This increase in population and urbanization \n     will require more water, energy and food, all of which are \n     compromised by warming temperatures.\n       The challenge presented by climate change will require all \n     of us--government, civil society and business--to do more \n     with less. For companies like ours, that means producing more \n     food on less land using fewer natural resources. If we don't \n     take action now, we risk not only today's livelihoods, but \n     also those of future generations.\n       We want the women and men who work to grow the food on our \n     tables to have enough to eat themselves, and to be able to \n     provide properly for their families.\n       We want the farms where crops are grown to be as productive \n     and resilient as possible, while building the communities and \n     protecting the water supplies around them.\n       We want to see only the most energy-efficient modes of \n     transport shipping products and ingredients around the world.\n       We want the facilities where we make our products to be \n     powered by renewable energy, with nothing going to waste.\n       As corporate leaders, we have been working hard toward \n     these ends, but we can and must do more.\n       Today, we are making three commitments--to each other, to \n     you as our political leaders, and to the world.\n       We will:\n       Re-energize our companies' continued efforts to ensure that \n     our supply chain becomes more sustainable, based on our own \n     specific targets;\n       Talk transparently about our efforts and share our best \n     practices so that other companies and other industries are \n     encouraged to join us in this critically important work;\n       Use our voices to advocate for governments to set clear, \n     achievable, measurable and enforceable science-based targets \n     for carbon emissions reductions.\n       That's where you come in.\n       Now is the time to meaningfully address the reality of \n     climate change. We are asking you to embrace the opportunity \n     presented to you in Paris, and to come back with a sound \n     agreement, properly financed, that can affect real change.\n       We are ready to meet the climate challenges that face our \n     businesses.

Mr. President, last week, a distinct honor was bestowed \nupon Vermont Army National Guard\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nSpecialist Skylar Anderson and, by extension, the Vermont National \nGuard. I want to recognize this milestone.\n  After graduating from a rigorous program at the 164th Regimental \nTraining Institute in North Dakota, Specialist Anderson became the \nfirst female soldier in the country to be awarded a military occupation \nspecialty as a combat engineer. In this position, she will enrich the \ncapabilities of our Guard, bringing new skills and expertise to her \nwork. While this is an impressive honor on its own, she did this while \nmanaging a full workload. While serving in the Vermont National Guard, \nshe is a student at the University of Vermont. Specialist Anderson has \nclearly earned this recognition through her hard work and dedication.\n  Opportunities to serve in our military, whether soldier or sailor, \nairman, or marine, should be available to the best and brightest, \nregardless of gender, and Specialist Anderson has shown young women \naround the country that gender integration in the military is very \nreal. Just last week, the Secretary of Defense declared all positions \nin the U.S. armed services open to females, removing artificial \nrestrictions so that the United States can have the very best serving, \nlike Specialist Anderson.\n  As a Vermonter, I am especially proud of her achievements, and I am \nalso appreciative of the members of the Vermont National Guard who \nsupported her throughout the process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article about Specialist Skylar \nAnderson published by National Guard Online be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the National Guard Online, Nov. 27, 2015]\n\n    Vermont Guard Member Becomes USA's First Female Combat Engineer\n\n       Colchester, VT.--Spc. Skylar Anderson, a member of the \n     Vermont Army National Guard, became the first female Soldier \n     in the nation to be awarded the 12B Military Occupation \n     Specialty (MOS) code as a combat engineer.\n       Anderson was previously a Multiple Launch Rocket System \n     Operations/Fire Direction Specialist (13P) prior to re-\n     classing to a combat engineer.\n       She graduated Aug. 31 from the 164th Regimental Training \n     Institute (RTI) in Devils Lake, North Dakota.\n       Goarmy.com says that combat engineers primarily supervise, \n     serve or assist as a member of a team when they are tackling \n     rough terrain in combat situations. They provide their \n     expertise in areas such as mobility, counter-mobility, \n     survivability and general engineering. They construct \n     fighting positions, fixed/floating bridges, obstacles and \n     defensive positions, place and detonate explosives, conduct \n     operations that include route clearance of obstacles and \n     rivers, prepare and install firing systems for demolition and \n     explosives, and detect mines visually or with mine detectors.\n       ``I knew that I would be one of the first females to go, \n     but not the first to graduate,'' Anderson said. ``I knew that \n     the MOS had just opened up a few months ago and having \n     previously been field artillery, I wanted to do it.''\n       Originally enlisting in the New Hampshire National Guard, \n     Anderson interstate transferred to the Vermont Army National \n     Guard (VTARNG) in February of 2014, while pursuing a degree \n     at the University of Vermont. Currently a junior, she is \n     studying Animal Science, Equine Studies, in the pre-\n     Veterinary program.\n       ``I was floating around for a bit in Vermont,'' Anderson \n     said in reference to how she became interested in becoming a \n     12B. Since the VTARNG didn't have 13Ps, Anderson briefly \n     thought about joining the military police or working in \n     supply. It wasn't until annual training this summer that she \n     found out that the 12B MOS had opened up to women and decided \n     that's what she wanted to do.\n       ``Vermont is incredibly proud of Spc. Anderson and her \n     accomplishments and achievements,'' said Maj. Gen. Steven A. \n     Cray, the adjutant general, Vermont National Guard. ``This is \n     an important milestone not only for Spc. Anderson, but for \n     all women in the integration of females into combat roles.''\n       According to the 164th Regiment RTIs website, the 12B10 \n     Combat Engineer MOS-T course provides reclassification \n     training for military personnel with prior military \n     experience, so that they may obtain the skills necessary to \n     perform as a Combat Engineer.\n       There, Soldiers are provided technical training in basic \n     demolitions, wire obstacles, explosive hazards, fixed \n     bridging and urban operations.\n       ``Spc. Anderson displayed tremendous personal courage in \n     seeking out MOS reclassification to a specialty previously \n     closed to women,'' said Capt. Eugene Enriquez, Commander, \n     Headquarters, Headquarters Company, 86th Brigade Special \n     Troop Battalion, 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team \n     (Mountain).\n       ``The training at the school was awesome,'' Anderson said. \n     ``By the third day we were out in the field and at the range, \n     using TNT, dynamite and det cord, blowing stuff up! This \n     class was really hands on and that's what I loved about it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8480-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8480-S8482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ELECTIONS IN VENEZUELA\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to express my outrage and horror \nat the out-of-control electoral situation in Venezuela--at the \nintimidation, violence, manipulation, and corruption by the Maduro \ngovernment to manipulate election results in their favor.\n  For weeks, President Maduro has said that his party will do whatever \nit takes to stay in power, and I have no doubt that he will do \neverything he can to stay in power. In recent days, Maduro said: ``If \non December 6th the political-right wins, prepare to see a country in \nchaos, in violence. I will not turn over nor will I betray the \nrevolution''--a clear statement of what's to come, but the world is \nwatching.\n  In October, he gave a public speech in which he said that if the \nopposition wins, the country would enter into one of its ``most \nturbulent periods'' because he will not turn over the revolution, and \nif necessary, he would rule through what he called ``a civic military \nunion.'' Maduro's cronies have also made alarming, ominous statements \nin recent weeks warning the public that the ruling party will not lose \ncontrol. The government has already denied international election \nobservers, so, clearly, we know what is about to happen.\n  Maduro's term is not yet up, but it is only a matter of time, and \nthis election will be a demonstration of his complete failure. The fact \nis numbers don't lie, and the crushing poll numbers coming out are \nfurther proof the country is ready for fundamental change from a failed \neconomic model that has run its course and needs to be done away with. \nAll of this against a backdrop of continued deceit, repression, and \nviolence.\n  Last week, in broad daylight, armed supporters of the government \nassassinated Luiz Manuel Diaz, the state-level head of the Accion \nDemocratica, or Democratic Action Party, at an open-air rally in the \nstate of Guarico--clearly a politically targeted assassination designed \nto terrorize opposition parties and their supporters. Luiz Manuel Diaz \nwas standing 6 feet away from Lilian Tintori, whom I have met several \ntimes, the wife of the high-profile political prisoner, Leopoldo Lopez.\n  This level of unacceptable, blatant violence is appalling and has \nbeen condemned by OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro, the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, and by countless \nhuman rights organizations. Again, the world is clearly watching and \ndemanding that the rule of law in Venezuela be reestablished.\n  The fact is the government is engaged in clear election manipulation. \nThe government-controlled National Electoral Council has disqualified \nseven leading opposition figures from participating in the elections--\ndisqualifications without justification and without a process to \nappeal. The disqualifications have targeted only members of the \nopposition: Maria Corina Machado, the diputada--assembly member--that \nreceived the single highest number of votes in the 2010 elections; \nManuel Rosales, the former governor of Zulia state and a former \nPresidential candidate for the opposition; Leopoldo Lopez, currently \nbeing held in a military prison, the most high-profile political \nprisoner in the Americas.\n  The government has also fabricated a border crisis with neighboring \nColombia as a pretext to declare a state of emergency, in 23 \nmunicipalities in 3 states along the Colombian-Venezuelan border. This \nallows the government to arbitrarily suspend the fundamental rights of \ncitizens in these municipalities to a right to assembly, right to \npeaceful demonstrations--and, guess what, it just so happens that these \nmunicipalities are either swing districts or ones where the opposition \nwon handily in the 2010 legislative elections. In these same three \nstates, the opposition won 18 of the 27 seats contested. The government \nis even resorting to political tricks.\n  In one district, in the city of Maracay, the leading opposition \ncandidate is named Ismael Garcia, a lifelong political veteran. The \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\nmanaged to find a 28-year-old parking attendant named Ismael Garcia, \nwho is running under a party name similar to the opposition candidate, \nwith a logo nearly identical.\n  In another area in the capital of Caracas, the National Statistics \nInstitute and National Electoral Council have determined that, by the \nend of the year, 128,000 voters are scheduled to move out of a district \nlargely supportive of the opposition to a district supportive of the \ngovernment. This move is large enough to decrease by one the number of \ndeputies that the opposition district will elect and enough to increase \nby one the number of deputies that the pro-government district will \nelect.\n  The National Statistics Institute and National Electoral Council \nacknowledge that 134,000 votes will move back to the pro-opposition \ndistrict by the middle of next year, which means 130,000 people are \nmoving for a period of 6 to 9 months.\n  The Maduro government can't believe they can hide from these obvious \ntactics of political tricks to rob the people of Venezuela of their \nright to a free and fair election. They can't be so naive to think that \nthese ridiculous tactics are going unnoticed. We are not blind to it. \nWe are watching. And I come to the floor of the Senate to send a clear \nmessage that makes it clear that the world is watching and waiting for \nthe results of the election and the aftermath.\n  Against this backdrop of violence, intimidation, corruption, and \nelection fraud, the Venezuelan Government has routinely denied the \npresence of credible international election observers. If the \nVenezuelan Government was interested in guaranteeing the transparency, \nobjectivity, and credibility of the elections, it would have invited \nthe OAS--the region's preeminent multilateral body--to observe the \nelections.\n  Since 1989, the OAS has conducted more than 160 election observation \nmissions in 24 countries. The OAS Secretary General has repeatedly \noffered to observe, but Maduro has turned him down. The EU has also \noffered to observe--also rejected by the government. Instead, the \nVenezuelan Government has opted for a mission from Union de Naciones \nSuramericanas, UNASUR, which conducts ``electoral accompaniment'' \nrather than ``election observation.'' The technical rigor of the UNASUR \nmission has been called into question by many members of the \ninternational community. Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court banned \nBrazil's participation in the UNASUR mission. Chile and Uruguay also \nwill not participate in the UNASUR mission. As a Washington Post \nheadline put it this week, ``Venezuela [is heading] to a pivotal \nelection; without a referee.''\n  As Venezuela heads into this election, nationwide polls are showing a \nstrong and sustained trend in favor of the opposition. National polling \nshows opposition candidates leading by 28 points. This growing \nadvantage is the result of an increasingly dire outlook that reflects \nthe state of the nation. The people of Venezuela have and are suffering \neconomic hardship. They are subjected to increased societal violence. \nThey have seen more and more evidence that senior government officials \nare personally and deeply involved in drug trafficking, deeply involved \nin money laundering. In fact, his own family members have been arrested \nfor drug trafficking.\n  And, to make matters worse, as President Maduro, a former bus driver, \nhas driven his country's economy off a cliff, there have been shortages \nof beef and milk, chicken and eggs, rice and pasta; there have been \nshortages of soap for bathing and diapers for small children. And this \ntrend will likely get worse. This year, the IMF predicts that \nVenezuela's GDP will contract by 10 percent--the single largest \neconomic contraction in the world this year. The country is also \nsuffering from the highest levels of inflation in the entire world, \nmore than 150 percent in 2015 according to the IMF, and expected to \nsurpass 200 percent in 2016.\n  As economic hardship grows, it shouldn't be a complete surprise that \ncriminality in the country has worsened--the murder rate more than \ndoubling over the past decade. According to the Venezuela Violence \nObservatory, the per capita murder rate in Venezuela was 37 per 100,000 \nin 2005, 54 per 100,000 in 2010, and 82 per 100,000 in 2014. And things \nare even worse in the capital Caracas, where the per capita murder rate \nis approaching 125 per 100,000 residents. This puts Caracas among the \ntop five most violent cities in the world and on par with the carnage \ngenerally seen only in war zones.\n  On top of this widespread societal violence, in 2014, the world bore \nwitness to Venezuelan security forces violently deployed on the streets \nto suppress peaceful protests occurring throughout the country that has \nleft 43 people dead on both sides of the political divide, more than 50 \ndocumented cases of torture of opposition activists, and thousands of \narrests. Throughout this violence, respected international human rights \norganization Human Rights Watch found that human rights abuses were a \n``systematic practice'' committed by Venezuelan security forces.\n  To make matters worse, a darker and more sinister narrative has \nemerged from Venezuela in 2015. In March of this year, the Treasury \nDepartment's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network--known as FinCEN--\nannounced the Private Bank of Andorra is a ``foreign financial \ninstitution of primary money laundering concern.'' Among other \nconcerns, FinCEN found that the bank had been involved in a scheme that \nsiphoned off roughly $2 billion from Venezuelan state oil company \nPDVSA, a scheme that surely included widespread involvement and \nknowledge of Venezuelan Government officials. The world is watching.\n  In May of this year, in a Wall Street Journal exclusive, the world \nwas informed that the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement \nAgency, and several Federal prosecutors' offices are investigating \nDiosdado Cabello for involvement in drug trafficking, a man who serves \nas the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and someone generally \nregarded as the second most powerful figure in the government's \ncoalition. And now he is apparently wanted for turning Venezuela into a \nglobal cocaine hub.\n  And in October, in another incredibly well-documented piece, the Wall \nStreet Journal revealed how money laundering and embezzlement inside \nVenezuelan state oil giant Venezuela was directed from the highest \nlevels, including by former PDVSA president Rafael Ramirez. These two \nincidents are part of a long and troubling series of disturbing \nrevelations about how the highest levels of the power are directly \nresponsible for the Venezuelan state becoming penetrated by drug \ntrafficking and criminality.\n  With such sinister trends becoming commonplace in Venezuela, it is \nimportant to recognize that a sea change of opinion is taking place in \nLatin America, and increasingly, key political leaders are speaking out \nforcefully against what they are seeing in Venezuela.\n  In September of this year, 34 former Presidents and heads of state \nfrom across Latin America and the Caribbean met in Bogota and issued a \ndeclaration calling for international election observation, greater \nsafeguards for Venezuelan voters, and the release of political \nprisoners in the country.\n  Last month, the secretary general of the OAS Luis Almagro released a \nscathing letter to the head of Venezuela's National Electoral Council, \nlaying out all of his concerns with the process running up to the \nDecember 6 elections and calling for an immediate course correction.\n  Also, last month, I was proud to join with 17 of my colleagues here \nin the U.S. Senate, 32 Brazilian senators, 57 Colombian senators, 12 \nChilean senators, 26 Costa Rica Assembly members, and 13 Peruvian \nmembers of Congress--more than 150 legislators from across the \nAmericas--in an unprecedented showing of unity to call for election \nobservation, speak out against the disqualification of opposition \ncandidates, and call for the release of political prisoners. And just \nlast week, it was important to see Argentina's President-elect Mauricio \nMacri calling for the South American trade block Mercosur to review \nwhether Venezuela should be suspended from the block for violating its \ndemocracy clause and failing to uphold human rights.\n  The question then remains, what can we do? What can the United States \ndo? As elections are held in Venezuela this weekend, it is imperative \nthat we all remain clear-eyed about the challenges at hand in the \ncountry. For 15 years,\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\nwe have watched as President Maduro and former-President Chavez have \nsystematically dismantled democracy in the country. They have removed \nchecks on the executive. They have corrupted the judiciary and the rule \nof law. They have usurped the powers of the legislature. They have \npoliticized the military. And they have suppressed freedom of the \npress.\n  No one should be surprised that 15 years of democratic deterioration \nhas led to economic ruin, to rampant criminality, and to an \nincreasingly dangerous political polarization. But the first step to \ncorrect course and help Venezuelans back from the brink of being a \nfailed state is the exercise this weekend of that most fundamental \ndemocratic right with a huge voter turnout that could help move the \ncountry back toward democracy and the rule of law.\n  We should take note that Latin America is speaking out forcefully \nabout the situation in Venezuela, but we in the United States should be \npreparing our own response. Last week, the Washington Post Editorial \nBoard noted that should the vote be disrupted in Venezuela, the ``U.S. \nshould be ready to respond with censure and sanctions.'' I couldn't \nagree more.\n  In December of 2014, the U.S. Congress, with the unanimous consent of \nboth Chambers, approved the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil \nSociety Act--legislation which I authored and introduced with Senators \nNelson, Rubio, Kirk, and McCain. This bipartisan bill called for \nmandatory sanctions against violations of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms and provided the administration with the authorities it needs. \nThe administration has used these sanctions once, but we should be \nprepared, if necessary, to use them again.\n  We know what is happening in Venezuela: subversion of democracy \nthrough state-sponsored violence; repression; hundreds of thousands of \nVenezuelans in the streets earlier this year protesting alarming levels \nof violence and crime; sky-high inflation rates; the scarcity of food \nand basic consumer goods. That is today's Venezuela. The question is: \nCan we make tomorrow better for the people of Venezuela?\n  The world watched as President Maduro and his government responded to \nprotests with a brutal display of force not seen in our hemisphere in \nover a decade. The results: more than 40 deaths, more than 50 \ndocumented cases of torture, and thousands of unlawful detentions. In \nMay, Human Rights Watch released a devastating report that said \nVenezuelan human rights violations ``were part of a systematic practice \nby Venezuelan security forces'' and that these abuses were intended to \n``punish people for their political views.''\n  As I have said repeatedly and as is the case today, not one \nVenezuelan Government official or member of the security forces has \nbeen held accountable for their role in beating, shooting, jailing, or \ntorturing peaceful protesters--not one. Now they threaten to highjack \nthe electoral process, and they must know that the world is watching \nand that there will be consequences to their actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8482-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT DICK DOUGLAS, JR.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nmy constituent Robert Dick Douglas, Jr. Mr. Douglas earned Eagle Scout \nrank 90 years ago today, making him the longest serving Eagle alive.\n  The Boy Scouts of America recently highlighted Mr. Douglas' life in \ntheir magazine, which I think would impress anyone who reads it. I am \npleased to highlight some of the points in the article.\n  A native of Greensboro, Mr. Douglas eagerly joined the Boy Scouts the \nvery same day that he celebrated his 12th birthday. After earning his \nEagle Scout award on December 8, 1925, Mr. Douglas was one of three \nscouts selected for an African safari with famed photographers and \nadventurers Martin and Osa Johnson. Upon his return from this journey, \nDouglas coauthored the best selling documentary ``Three Boy Scouts in \nAfrica,'' which went on to sell 125,000 copies in its first year of \npublication. The book afforded Douglas the opportunity to tour the \nNation speaking with the likes of Amelia Earhart at school and civic \nassemblies.\n  The publisher was evidently so impressed with Douglas' work that he \nsent the young Eagle Scout to Alaska to write another adventure book \ntitled ``A Boy Scout in the Grizzly Country.'' From that experience, \nDouglas became an advocate of land and wildlife conservation and, when \nhe returned home, began sharing his newfound knowledge with the Nation \nthrough public appearances.\n  Douglas' successes continued well into adulthood, going on to \ngraduate from law school at Georgetown University and to become a labor \nand employment law attorney at his father's legal practice. Mr. Douglas \nserved as a lawyer for over 70 years and managed to make his way before \nthe Supreme Court. Douglas also served in the FBI, where he had the \nchance to work under J. Edgar Hoover for a time. Mr. Douglas retired at \nthe age of 96.\n  In recognition of his longevity and commitment to scouting and his \ncommunity, the 103-year-old Douglas was presented with the \nDistinguished Eagle Scout Award on September 24, 2015. During the \nceremony, Mr. Douglas extolled scouting as a significant influence on \nhis life. He insists to this day that scouting taught him that he could \ndo just about anything that he wanted to undertake. It is with great \npleasure that I pay tribute to Robert Dick Douglas, Jr., today on his \n90th anniversary of attaining Eagle Scout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8482-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING MURDOCK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ndistinguished career of a great South Dakotan, Mr. Jim Smith.\n  Jim was born in Aberdeen, SD, in 1930, and was raised in Pierre. He \nreceived his Bachelor of Science degree from the South Dakota School of \nMines and Technology in 1952 before attending law school at George \nWashington University. While still in law school, Jim worked as an \nelevator operator in the U.S. Capitol until he became a legislative \nassistant to South Dakota Senator Karl Mundt. He eventually served as \nminority counsel to the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Intergovernmental \nRelations. Upon graduation from law school, Jim became the associate \nFederal legislative counsel at the American Bankers Association from \n1963 to 1968.\n  From 1969 to 1973, Jim headed the Treasury Department's Office of \nCongressional Relations, completing his tenure as Deputy Undersecretary \nof the Department under three separate Secretaries. In 1971, Jim was \nawarded the Alexander Hamilton Award, the highest honor bestowed by the \nTreasury Department. He was appointed by President Nixon as the 23rd \nU.S. Comptroller of the Currency in 1973, where he served until the end \nof the Ford Administration. Jim returned to the Midwest in 1977 to \nserve as the Executive Vice President of the First Chicago Corporation.\n  In 1980, Jim reconnected with his old friend, Charls E. Walker, from \ntheir days at the American Bankers Association. Jim joined Mr. Walker's \nconsulting firm, Charls Walker Associates, later renamed Walker/Free \nAssociates, until he formed The Smith-Free Group with Jim Free in 1995. \nFor the past 35 years, Jim has advocated for a diverse range of issues \nbefore the Federal Government, including pro bono efforts on behalf of \nvictims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.\n  Jim came to Washington during President Eisenhower's administration, \nand his career has spanned 10 subsequent Presidents. His reputation as \na modest, soft-spoken, and principled man is a testament to his South \nDakota roots. He embodies the strong-willed, hard-working, and good-\nnatured characteristics that all South Dakotans share; and his life \nstory proves the continued resilience of the American Dream.\n  Jim is retiring to spend more time with his wife of 37 years, Karen, \nalong with his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. I \nwould like to thank him for his service to both South Dakota and the \ncountry and congratulate him on a well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8483-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8483-S8484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8484-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8484-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:26 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 614.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation for the purpose of enhancing hunting, fishing, \n     recreational shooting, and other outdoor recreational \n     opportunities, as well as strengthen conservation efforts \n     nationwide; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 109\n\n       Whereas, To this day, conservation is funded primarily by \n     sportsmen and women. This\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\n     American System of Conservation Funding is a user pays-public \n     benefits approach that includes excise taxes on hunting, \n     fishing, and boating equipment. This strategy is widely \n     recognized as the most successful model of fish and wildlife \n     management funding in the world; and\n       Whereas, Through the pursuit of their outdoor passions, \n     sportsmen and women support hundreds of thousands of jobs and \n     contribute billions to our economy annually through salaries, \n     wages, and product purchases; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress has worked on several \n     pieces of legislation over the years to boost a number of key \n     conservation priorities that are supported by millions in the \n     outdoor recreational community; and\n       Whereas, Currently pending legislation in both the U.S. \n     House and Senate would create or renew several important \n     programs that are vital to the continued conservation of our \n     natural resources, the health of America's local economies, \n     and the enhancement and protection of our time-honored \n     outdoor pastimes. Known as the Sportsmen's Heritage and \n     Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act (H.R. 2406) and the \n     Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act (S. 405), these bills contain a \n     broad array of bipartisan measures, including the \n     Recreational Fishing and Hunting Opportunities Act; the \n     Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting Protection Act; \n     the Target Practice and Marksmanship & Training Support Act; \n     and the Recreational Lands Self-Defense Act; and\n       Whereas, A complementary piece of pro-sportsmen legislation \n     also exists in the U.S. House, called the Sportsmen's \n     Conservation and Outdoor Recreation Enhancement (SCORE) Act \n     (H.R. 3173). It shares several similar titles with the SHARE \n     Act and Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act. Provisions in the SCORE \n     Act include: the National Fish Habitat Initiative Sense of \n     Congress, the Federal Lands Transaction Facilitation Act \n     reauthorization, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act \n     reauthorization, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation \n     reauthorization, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \n     Act reauthorization, the Partners for Fish and Wildlife \n     Program Act reauthorization, and the Making Public Lands \n     Public authorization; and\n       Whereas, By renewing or creating these programs, these \n     bills will enhance opportunities for hunters, anglers, \n     recreational shooters, and other outdoor recreation \n     enthusiasts, improve access to public lands, and help boost \n     the outdoor recreation economy. Conserving our fish and \n     wildlife resources and their habitats and ensuring that \n     future generations have access to public lands and continued \n     recreational opportunities are of great importance and are \n     bipartisan issues: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States \n     Congress to enact legislation for the purpose of enhancing \n     hunting, fishing, recreational shooting, and other outdoor \n     recreational opportunities, as well as strengthen \n     conservation efforts nationwide; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-110. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President \n     of the United States and the United States Congress to \n     support the National Breast Cancer Coalition's goal of \n     knowing how to end breast cancer by 2020; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 144\n\n       Whereas, Michigan Breast Cancer Coalition and breast cancer \n     prevention advocates across the country are joining their \n     collective voices in the call for an end to breast cancer. \n     State level advocates in conjunction with the National Breast \n     Cancer Coalition (NBCC) are undertaking the challenge \n     referred to as Breast Cancer Deadline 2020; and\n       Whereas, Breast Cancer Deadline 2020, created by the NBCC \n     has set the goal and developed a strategic plan to know how \n     to end breast cancer by January 1, 2020. NBCC developed a \n     blueprint that involves research, access and influence. This \n     includes leveraging financial resources, ensuring individuals \n     at risk have access to information and medical care; and \n     harnessing the influence of leaders in government and \n     industry; and\n       Whereas, Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-\n     skin cancer in women in the United States. Michigan counties \n     have some of the highest incidences of breast cancer in the \n     country. This disease affects women of all ages, claimin 'yes \n     of thousands each year; and\n       Whereas, The advancement of the NBCC strategic plan for \n     eradicating this disease is imperative. This plan focuses on \n     prevention, including how to prevent the often fatal \n     metastasis of cancer once it is detected. All elements of the \n     NBCC strate ic plan are necessary to find an end to this \n     disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     President and the Congress of the United States to support \n     the National Breast Cancer Coalition's goal of knowing how to \n     end breast cancer by 2020; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-111. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan encouraging the United States Forest Service to \n     issue the owners of privately held hunting camps on leased \n     acres within the Ottawa National Forest special use \n     authorization under the Recreation Residence Program; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 79\n\n       Whereas, Starting in the late 1950s, Michigan residents \n     were offered an opportunity to lease privately-owned land \n     from the Upper Peninsula Power Company (UPPCO) to build \n     recreational hunting camps. In 1991, the UPPCO announced \n     intentions to sell the land currently under lease to an \n     intermediary who would simultaneously sell the land to the \n     United States Forest Service (USFS). Existing leaseholders \n     were offered an option to sign a 25-year, nonrenewable lease \n     on the land that was to be sold or to immediately vacate the \n     property. The leases were signed in March of 1992 and the \n     United States Forest Service (USFS) took control of the land \n     in June 1992. The land currently under private lease accounts \n     for less than 1,100 acres in the Ottawa National Forest; and\n       Whereas, Hundreds of people have experienced the wonders of \n     Michigan's great outdoors at these hunting camps. The Ottawa \n     National Forest is almost one million acres of rolling hills, \n     lakes, rivers, waterfalls, and abundant wildlife. Those who \n     lease land in the forest have built outdoor recreational \n     traditions with their families. The hunting camps allow them \n     to experience the seclusion and isolated environment of the \n     Ottawa National Forest while engaging in varied recreational \n     activities, including hunting, fishing, canoeing, and \n     snowshoeing; and\n       Whereas, The USFS has informed leaseholders that leases \n     will not be renewed at the end of 2016 because it is national \n     policy not to lease national forest land to individuals. The \n     holders of the active leases will have 90 days after the \n     leases expire to remove the hunting cabins and return the \n     land to its natural state; and\n       Whereas, The expiration of the leases will hurt local \n     economies in Ontonagon and Gogebic Counties. It will result \n     in over $35,000 in lost lease fee revenue to the townships \n     and almost $10,000 in tax revenue to the counties. Even a \n     greater loss will be realized by local businesses, including \n     gas stations, grocery stores, hardware stores, and \n     restaurants that benefit from the patronage of the camp \n     families; and\n       Whereas, The expiration of the leases will eliminate refuge \n     for people from the occasionally harsh and unexpected shifts \n     in weather conditions. The Ottawa National Forest covers a \n     large area in the western Upper Peninsula. Camp owners often \n     leave their cabins or outbuildings unlocked to the relief of \n     individuals stranded in the woods who have sought shelter. A \n     Boy Scout troop once sheltered at the Twin Pines camp after \n     being caught in a storm, and a group of snowmobilers is known \n     to regularly rest at one of the camps; and\n       Whereas, The USFS Recreation Residence Program provides \n     private citizens an opportunity to own single-family cabins \n     in designated areas of national forests. Currently, 15,570 \n     recreation residences occupy national forest system lands \n     throughout the country; and\n       Whereas, Although the National Forest Service placed a \n     moratorium on the establishment of new tracts under the \n     Recreation Residence program in 1968, the authority to issue \n     special use authorization under the Recreation Residence \n     program remains in federal regulations (36 CFR Part 251). \n     Therefore, lifting that moratorium for the limited purpose of \n     establishing a Recreation Residence tract in the Ottawa \n     National Forest and issuing special use authorization permits \n     is possible and would allow the many families currently \n     leasing in the Ottawa National Forest an opportunity that is \n     provided to thousands of people elsewhere in the country; and\n       Whereas, Converting to the Recreation Residence Program \n     would maintain a tax base for local governments, provide \n     continuing support for the local economy, and and ensure that \n     hunting and recreational traditions held so dear by Michigan \n     residents continue to be experienced in the Ottawa National \n     Forest: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we encourage the United States \n     Forest Service to issue the owners of privately-held camps on \n     leased acres within the Ottawa National Forest special use \n     authorization under the Recreation Residence Program; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Chief of the United States Forest Service and the members \n     of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-112. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the United States Senate to concur with the \n     United States House of Representatives and repeal the \n     country-of-origin labeling regulations; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 87\n\n       Whereas, The United States and Canada have the largest \n     trading relationship in the world, with bilateral trade \n     valued at $759 billion in 2014, an association that benefits \n     the\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\n     economies of both countries. Michigan's merchandise exports \n     to Canada in 2014 were valued at $25.4 billion, and 259,000 \n     Michigan jobs depend on trade and investment with Canada; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. has implemented mandatory country-of-\n     origin labeling (COOL) rules requiring meats sold at retail \n     stores to be labeled with information on the source of the \n     meat. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has repeatedly ruled \n     that COOL discriminates against imported livestock and is not \n     compliant with international trade obligations. Due to the \n     WTO rulings, the U.S. may be subject to $3.6 billion in \n     retaliatory tariffs sought by Canada and Mexico; and\n       Whereas, COOL regulations also jeopardize the viability of \n     the U.S. packing and feeding industries. The additional $500 \n     million in annual compliance costs could lead to significant \n     job losses and plant closures with potentially devastating \n     impacts to local and state economies. All this for an issue \n     the United States Department of Agriculture has clearly \n     indicated is not about food safety; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 2393 \n     to repeal the mandatory labeling for certain meats in June \n     2015 with 300 votes, showing a strong recognition across \n     party lines, as well as regionally, that COOL must be \n     repealed. However, the U.S. Senate appears less inclined to \n     repeal the COOL requirement, risking the American economy to \n     billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States \n     Senate to concur with the United States House of \n     Representatives and repeal the country-of-origin labeling \n     regulations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-113. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to support legislation \n     which will provide a comprehensive solution to allow banks \n     and credit unions to perform financial services for cannabis \n     businesses without federal retribution; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, Cannabis use for medical purposes is legal in 23 \n     states and is legal for recreational purpose in four states \n     and in the District of Columbia. The expansion of cannabis \n     businesses across the United States requires action from \n     Congress and the federal government; and\n       Whereas, While many states have laws permitting various \n     degrees of commercial activity using cannabis, it remains \n     illegal under federal law. The conflict between federal and \n     state laws has left financial institutions serving cannabis-\n     related businesses on uncertain legal ground. Banks and \n     credit unions are concerned that providing financial services \n     for businesses selling a product that is illegal under \n     federal law exposes them to possible charges of money \n     laundering and drug trafficking; and\n       Whereas, Federal laws, including the Controlled Substances \n     Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money \n     Laundering Act, prohibit financial institutions from \n     providing financial services to cannabis and hemp businesses. \n     Directives from federal regulatory agencies such as the \n     Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n     the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of \n     the Comptroller of the Currency also prohibit bankers from \n     accepting deposits from cannabis or hemp businesses; and\n       Whereas, In February 2014, the United States Treasury's \n     Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, in \n     coordination with the United States Department of Justice, \n     also issued a memo outlining expectations for compliance with \n     the Bank Secrecy Act. Despite this progress, remaining \n     uncertainties under current federal as still prevent banks \n     and credit unions from accepting cannabis-based businesses as \n     customers; and\n       Whereas, The medical, retail, and hemp agricultural \n     businesses are unable to accept credit or debit cards from \n     customers because electronic payments are handled through the \n     banking system. Therefore, transactions must be conducted in \n     cash. Further, these businesses cannot deposit cash from \n     sales into financial institutions. This is a major problem in \n     California as many businesses now have hundreds of thousands \n     of dollars in cash at their locations, which poses a public \n     safety risk to businesses, employees, and customers; and\n       Whereas, The lack of financial services makes paying taxes \n     to local governments and the California State Board of \n     Equalization a challenge because tax payments must be made in \n     cash by cannabis-related businesses, leading to hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars in cash being brought directly into \n     government offices. It is difficult for the State Board of \n     Equalization to audit cash-based businesses, especially when \n     records of wholesale transactions are not available; and\n       Whereas, Cannabis businesses cannot easily comply with \n     California tax laws, which has led to a significant \n     underpayment of revenue owed the state. In response, the \n     State Board of Equalization launched the Cannabis Compliance \n     Pilot Project in January 2015 to help determine both the \n     degree of noncompliance with state tax law and the amount of \n     lost tax revenue. However, state efforts alone cannot solve \n     the problem: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully urges \n     the President and Congress to support legislation which will \n     provide a comprehensive solution to allow banks and credit \n     unions to perform financial services for cannabis businesses \n     without federal retribution. The current system that requires \n     cash-based transactions poses a risk to public safety and \n     leads to reduced collection of taxes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and the Vice \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives, to the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n       POM-114. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the United States Congress to \n     permanently reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was \n     created by Congress in 1965 as a bipartisan commitment for \n     protection of natural areas, water resources, cultural \n     heritage, and outdoor recreational opportunities throughout \n     the country; and\n       Whereas, Over the 50 years since the LWCF was created, \n     billions of dollars in funding have been provided to protect \n     valuable land and water resources, including, but not limited \n     to, parks, forests, rivers, lakes, wildlife habitat, and \n     recreational opportunities. These investments have resulted \n     in the permanent protection of nearly five million acres of \n     public lands and working landscapes; and\n       Whereas, Despite being chronically underfunded, the LWCF \n     has had several positive conservation and recreation impacts \n     throughout the country, has protected lands in each state, \n     and has supported over 41,000 state and local park projects; \n     and\n       Whereas, Since its inception, the LWCF has delivered over \n     $2 billion to California, and has provided hundreds of \n     millions of dollars more for projects through its matching \n     fund program; and\n       Whereas, The LWCF has helped conserve some of California's \n     most treasured and iconic natural resources in each region of \n     the state, including, but not limited to, Lake Tahoe, the \n     Mojave Desert, Point Reyes National Seashore, the Headwaters \n     Forest Reserve, the San Diego and Don Edwards San Francisco \n     Bay National Wildlife Refuges, working forests in the Sierra \n     Nevada, and Central Valley wetlands; and\n       Whereas, The LWCF has provided funding for outdoor \n     recreational and park programs benefitting underserved youth \n     and others in urban and rural communities throughout the \n     state, and has established a critical federal partnership \n     with state and local parks and communities; and,\n       Whereas, Forest Legacy Program grants are also funded \n     through the LWCF to protect working forests, which support \n     jobs and sustainable forest operations and enhance wildlife \n     habitat, water quality, and recreation. The Forest Legacy \n     Program grants have provided $12 million in federal funds, \n     which along with matching funds have provided a total of $62 \n     million in investments in California forests; and\n       Whereas, The LWCF is critical to the quality of life in \n     California. The LWCF protects watersheds and drinking water \n     supplies; provides sustainable jobs in urban and rural \n     communities; protects the economic asset that federal, state, \n     and local public lands represent; conserves natural areas, \n     wildlife habitats, and open space from urban parks to large \n     landscapes; improves access for sportsmen, sportswomen, and \n     recreationists to natural lands; stimulates local economies \n     and jobs that support tourism and outdoor recreation sectors; \n     preserves wetlands, forests, and watersheds; and provides \n     state and local grants to support healthy communities; and\n       Whereas, According to the Outdoor Industry Association, \n     active outdoor recreation supports $85.4 billion of consumer \n     spending and 723,000 jobs in California, which annually \n     generates $27 billion in wages and salaries and $6.7 billion \n     in state and local tax revenue; and\n       Whereas, The United States Census Bureau reports that each \n     year 7.4 million people engage in outdoor recreation in \n     California, which contributes over $8 billion of wildlife-\n     related recreation spending to the state economy; and\n       Whereas, Despite the LWCF's successes, many more lands and \n     resources remain vulnerable and in critical need of \n     investment, and many urban and rural populations remain \n     underserved; and\n       Whereas, The LWCF will expire if not reauthorized by \n     Congress before September 30, 2015: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature urges Congress to \n     permanently reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\n     the Senate, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the \n     author for appropriate distribution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-115. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the United States Congress to restore Great \n     Lakes Restoration Initiative funding to $300 million for \n     fiscal year 2016; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 42\n\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes are a critical resource for our \n     nation, supporting the economy and a way of life in Michigan \n     and the other seven states within the Great Lakes region. The \n     Great Lakes hold 20 percent of the world's surface freshwater \n     and 95 percent of the United States' surface freshwater. This \n     globally significant freshwater resource provides drinking \n     water for more than 30 million people and is an economic \n     driver that supports jobs, commerce, agriculture, \n     transportation, and tourism throughout the region; and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) \n     provides essential funding to restore and protect the Great \n     Lakes. This funding has supported long overdue efforts to \n     clean up toxic pollution, reduce runoff from cities and \n     farms, combat invasive species like the Asian carp, and \n     restore fish and wildlife habitat. Since 2010, the federal \n     government has invested nearly $2 billion in more than 2,000 \n     projects through the GLRI. Over its first five years, the \n     GLRI has provided more than $280 million for 580 projects in \n     Michigan alone; and\n       Whereas, GLRI projects are making a significant difference. \n     They have restored more than 115,000 acres of fish and \n     wildlife habitat; opened up fish access to more than 3,400 \n     miles of rivers; helped implement conservation programs on \n     more than 1 million acres of farmland; and accelerated the \n     cleanup of toxic hotspots. In Michigan, GLRI funding has been \n     instrumental in removing contaminated sediments from Muskegon \n     Lake, the River Raisin, and the St. Mary's River; restoring \n     habitat along the St. Clair River, Cass River, Boardman \n     River, and the Keweenaw Peninsula; and developing improved \n     methods for sea lamprey control; and\n       Whereas, While this is a significant investment, there is \n     still more work to be done with numerous ready-to-go projects \n     that need funding. Toxic algal blooms, beach closings, fish \n     consumption advisories, and the presence of contaminated \n     sediments continue to limit the recreational and commercial \n     use of the Great Lakes. The 2014 shutdown of the city of \n     Toledo's drinking water system due to a toxic algal bloom, \n     forcing more than a half million people to find another \n     source of drinking water, is just one example of how much \n     still needs to be done; and\n       Whereas, Proposed cuts to GLRI funding would jeopardize the \n     momentum from a decade of unprecedented regional and \n     bipartisan cooperation. The FY 2016 executive budget \n     recommends a $50 million cut in federal funding to $250 \n     million. This cut would be a shortsighted, cost-saving \n     measure with long-term implications. Restoration efforts will \n     only become more expensive and more difficult if they are not \n     addressed in the coming years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the Congress of the \n     United States to restore Great Lakes Restoration Initiative \n     funding to $300 million for fiscal year 2016; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-16. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the President of the United \n     States to encourage the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to adopt policies to repeal the current and upcoming \n     discriminatory donor suitability policies of the United \n     States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding blood \n     donations; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 16\n\n       Whereas, Since 1983, the United States Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA), an agency under the United States \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has prohibited \n     the donation of blood by any man who has had sex with another \n     man (MSM) at any time since 1977; and\n       Whereas, in December 2014, based on recommendation from the \n     HHS Advisory Committee on Blood and Tissue Safety and \n     Availability, the FDA announced its intent to promulgate \n     regulations to allow an MSM to donate blood only if he has \n     not been sexually active for the past 12 months. Despite \n     these recent steps toward a policy change, a double standard \n     would still exist under the policy as it is proposed to be \n     revised because it would still treat gay and bisexual men \n     differently from heterosexual men; and\n       Whereas, California law prohibits discrimination against \n     individuals on the basis of actual or perceived sex, sexual \n     orientation, gender identity. and gender-related appearance \n     and behavior, and\n       Whereas, Spain, Italy, Russia, Mexico, and Portugal have \n     adopted blood donor policies that measure risk against a set \n     of behaviors sexual and otherwise, rather than the sex of a \n     person's sexual partner or partners; and\n       Whereas, The FDA does not allow gay and bisexual men in \n     committed relationships to donate blood because, while one \n     partner may be monogamous, that individual cannot guarantee \n     that the other partner is monogamous. The FDA does not apply \n     this same logic to heterosexual relationships, which in \n     effect discriminates against gay and bisexual men; and\n       Whereas, a 12-month deferral policy for gay and bisexual \n     men to donate blood is overly stringent given the scientific \n     evidence, advanced testing methods, and the safety and \n     quality control measures in place within the different FDA-\n     qualified blood donating centers. The techniques can identify \n     within 7 to 10 days with 99.9 percent accuracy whether or not \n     a blood sample is HIV-positive, and the chance of the blood \n     test being inaccurate within the 10-day window is about 1 in \n     2,000,000; and\n       Whereas, The General Social Survey conducted by NORC by \n     NORC at the University of Chicago estimates that 8.5 percent \n     of men in the United States have had at least one male sexual \n     partner since 18 years of age, 4.1 percent of men report at \n     least one male sex partner in the last 5 years, and 3.8 \n     percent report a male sex partner in the last 12 months; and\n       Whereas, An estimated 45.4 percent of men (54 million) in \n     the United States are eligible to donate blood, but only 8.7 \n     percent of eligible men actually do. There are 15.7 million \n     donations of blood per year made by 9.2 million donors, \n     yielding approximately 1.7 donations per donor; and\n       Whereas, The Williams Institute of the University of \n     California at Los Angeles School of Law estimates that, based \n     on the population of eligible and likely donors among the MSM \n     community, lifting the federal lifetime deferral policy on \n     blood donation by an MSM would result in 4.2 million newly \n     eligible male donors, of which 360,600 would likely donate, \n     generating 615,300 additional pints of blood. Applying \n     national estimates to the California population, the \n     Institute further estimates that lifting the ban on MSM blood \n     donations would add an additional 510,000 eligible men to the \n     current blood donor pool, of which 43,917 would likely \n     donate, resulting in an additional 74,945 donated pints in \n     California: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the California State Legislature \n     calls upon the President of the United States to encourage \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and \n     Human Services to adopt policies to repeal the current and \n     upcoming discriminatory donor suitability policies of the \n     United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding \n     blood donations by men who have had sex with another man and, \n     instead, direct the FDA to develop science-based policies \n     such as criteria based on risky behavior in lieu of sexual \n     orientation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Secretary of the United States \n     Department of Health and Human Services, to the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-117. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation that requires uniform and science-based food \n     labeling nationwide; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 59\n\n       Whereas, In the absence of a federal genetically modified \n     organism (GMO) labeling standard, some states and localities \n     have developed a patchwork of labeling proposals that can be \n     confusing and misleading to consumers. Multiple local \n     regulations increase agriculture and food production costs, \n     requiring food companies operating in Michigan to create \n     separate supply chains to be developed for each state; and\n       Whereas, GMOs are found in 70 to 80 percent of the foods we \n     eat and play a vital role in maintaining Michigan's \n     agriculture, food processing, and other industries. In 2014, \n     100 percent of all sugar beets, 93 percent of all corn, and \n     91 percent of all soybeans grown in Michigan were genetically \n     modified; and\n       Whereas, A maze of regulations would cripple interstate \n     commerce throughout the food supply and distribution chain \n     and ultimately increase grocery prices for consumers by \n     hundreds of dollars each year. A Cornell University study \n     found that a patchwork of state labeling laws would increase \n     food costs for a family by an average of $500 per year; and\n       Whereas, On July 23, 2015, the U.S. House of \n     Representatives passed bipartisan legislation--the Safe and \n     Accurate Food Labeling Act (H.R. 1599)--to avoid this \n     patchwork of regulations and the costly challenges it \n     creates; and\n       Whereas, Senate passage of the Safe and Accurate Food \n     Labeling Act will allow consumers to have access to accurate \n     and consistent information on products that contain CMOs by \n     ensuring that labeling is national, uniform, and science-\n     based. The bill also establishes a United States Department \n     of Agriculture (USDA)-administered certification and labeling \n     program, modeled after the USDA National Organic Program for \n     non-GMO, organic foods: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States \n     Congress to enact legislation that requires uniform and \n     science-based food labeling nationwide; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-118. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to take steps to reform \n     the outdated and inadequate Official Poverty Measure to \n     better reflect poverty and the unmet needs demonstrated by \n     the Supplemental Poverty Measure; to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 22\n\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure is determined by the \n     United States Census Bureau and is instrumental in \n     determining an individual's eligibility for a number of \n     government programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition \n     Assistance Program; Medicaid; School Lunch Program; Women, \n     Infants, and Children Program; Housing Assistance; and \n     others; and\n       Whereas, The method we use today was developed in 1964 by \n     Mollie Orshansky of the Social Security Administration; and\n       Whereas, Orshansky's method used before-tax cash income to \n     deterimine a family's resources, which was then compared to a \n     poverty threshold; and\n       Whereas, In determining this poverty threshold, Orshansky \n     used a food plan developed by the federal Department of \n     Agriculture that was designed for ``temporary or emergency \n     use when funds are low,'' and then multiplied the cost of the \n     plan by three because, at the time, a family typically used \n     about a third of their income on food; and\n       Whereas, Other than minor changes, the method has remained \n     the same over time, despite significant economic and \n     governmental changes, including the introduction of Medicare \n     and Medicaid, the shift from a manufacturing to a service \n     economy, welfare reform of the 1990s, and the general \n     stagnation of wages; and\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure is a one-size-fits-\n     all policy that leads to a distorted perception of poverty \n     and an inefficient allocation of resources to fight poverty; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure has failed to \n     accurately measure poverty because it has not kept up with \n     the changes to our economy and social science research; and\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure does not take into \n     account that families no longer spend one-third of their \n     income on food; they currently spend between 5 to 10 percent; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure does not account for \n     noncash transfers, such as the Supplemental Nutrition \n     Assistance Program or Medicaid, as income; and\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure does not account for \n     variations in cost of living in different regions of our \n     country; and\n       Whereas, Low-income working families in California are \n     especially disadvantaged by the Official Poverty Measure due \n     to our state's high cost of living, which results in the \n     denial of federally funded assistance to families living \n     above the federal poverty line, but who are unable to meet \n     their basic needs; and\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure does not account for \n     the increase in child care expenses due to the rise in the \n     workforce participation of both parents; and\n       Whereas, The Official Poverty Measure does not account for \n     variations in health care coverage and out-of-pocket medical \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, Historically, there has been widespread agreement \n     among analysts, advocates, and policymakers that the Official \n     Poverty Measure is inadequate, leading to a 1990 \n     Congressional appropriation that was made for an independent \n     scientific study on a new calculation method; and\n       Whereas, This study was performed by The National Academy \n     of Sciences, which established the Panel on Poverty and \n     Family Assistance. The panel released a report in 1995 \n     entitled ``Measuring Poverty: A New Approach'' which \n     established guidelines for creating a new method; and\n       Whereas, Fifteen years later, in 2010, the Interagency \n     Technical Working Group on Developing a Supplemental Poverty \n     Measure and the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor \n     developed an alternative poverty measure known as the \n     Supplemental Poverty Measure; and\n       Whereas, The Supplemental Poverty Measure was designed to \n     take into account changes in the United States economy over \n     time, cost-of-living variations in different parts of the \n     country, and the changing role of government; and\n       Whereas, The Supplemental Poverty Measure more accurately \n     measures poverty by using a basic set of goods that includes \n     food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, adjusted to reflect \n     the needs of different family types and to account for \n     geographic differences in living costs to establish what is \n     known as a poverty threshold; and\n       Whereas, The Supplemental Poverty Measure defines family \n     resources as the value of cash income from all sources, plus \n     the value of noncash benefits, including nutrition \n     assistance, subsidized housing, home energy assistance, tax \n     credits, and other benefits that are available to buy the \n     basic bundle of goods, minus the necessary expenses for \n     critical goods and services not included in the thresholds; \n     and\n       Whereas, Necessary expenses include income taxes, Social \n     Security payroll taxes, childcare and other work-related \n     expenses, child support payments, and contributions toward \n     the cost of medical care and health insurance premiums or \n     out-of-pocket medical costs; and\n       Whereas, The Supplemental Poverty Measure offers a more \n     accurate measure of poverty than the general Official Poverty \n     Measure; and\n       Whereas, The use of the Official Poverty Measure can have a \n     detrimental effect on policies to combat poverty because it \n     results in less efficient and less accurately targeted \n     policies and expenditures; and\n       Whereas, It is vital that we implement a fair poverty \n     measure that allows us to efficiently allocate resources and \n     focus on regions and populations that need help the most; and\n       Whereas, Given the numerous inadequacies of the Official \n     Poverty Measure as a tool to accurately target and \n     efficiently allocate antipoverty resources, the Supplemental \n     Poverty Measure should guide the reform and updating of the \n     Official Poverty Measure for administrative purposes in \n     determining financial eligibility for programs intended to \n     reduce poverty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California jointly, That the Legislature of California urges \n     the President and the Congress of the United States to take \n     steps to reform the outdated and inadequate Official Poverty \n     Measure to better reflect poverty and the unmet needs \n     demonstrated by the Supplemental Poverty Measure; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies' of this resolution to the President and the Vice \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and \n     to each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, to the Governor of California, \n     and to the author of this resolution.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-119.

Johnson, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a \n     landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, One hundred and forty-five years ago, in 1870, \n     Congress ratified the 15th Amendment, which declared that the \n     right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on the basis of \n     race, color, or previous condition of servitude; and\n       Whereas, By 1910, violence and intimidation resulted in \n     nearly all black citizens being disenfranchised and removed \n     from the voter rolls in the former Confederate States, \n     undermining the promise of equal protection under the law; \n     and\n       Whereas, Native American, Latino, and Asian American/\n     Pacific Islander communities experienced similar attempts to \n     disenfranchise citizens in their communities throughout the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Between 1870 and 1965, voters faced, ``first-\n     generation barriers,'' such as poll taxes, literacy tests, \n     vouchers of ``good character,'' disqualification for ``crimes \n     of moral turpitude'', and other tactics intended to keep \n     African Americans from the polls on Election Day; and\n       Whereas, During the 1920s, African Americans in Selma, \n     Alabama formed the Dallas County Voters League (DCVL). During \n     the 1960s in partnership with organizers from the Student \n     Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the DCVL held registration \n     drives and classes to help African Americans in Dallas County \n     pass the literacy tests required to register to vote. On \n     March 7th, 1965, the first march from Selma to Montgomery \n     took place. The march, nicknamed ``Bloody Sunday'' for the \n     horrific attack on unarmed marchers by armed police, was \n     broadcast nationwide and led to a national outcry for the \n     passage of the Voting Rights Act, and\n       Whereas, Often regarded as one of the most effective civil \n     rights laws, the Voting Rights Act was passed with the intent \n     to ban discriminatory voting policies at all levels of \n     government; and\n       Whereas, The Voting Rights Act is credited for the \n     enfranchisement of millions of minority voters as well as the \n     diversification of the electorate and legislative bodies \n     throughout all levels of government; and\n       Whereas, Before Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act was \n     added in 1975, language minorities were disenfranchised from \n     the electoral process. Section 203 required certain \n     jurisdictions to provide registration or voting notices, \n     forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials and \n     information regarding the electoral process in the language \n     of the applicable minority group; and\n       Whereas, In June of 2013, the Supreme Court struck down key \n     sections of the Voting Rights Act that were designed to \n     prevent discriminatory voting policies that can \n     disenfranchise minority voters; and\n\n[[Page S8491]]\n\n       Whereas, Despite 50 years of progress, racial minorities \n     continue to face voting barriers in jurisdictions with a \n     history of discrimination; and\n       Whereas, To build a stronger and more cohesive state and \n     nation, we must continue to help advance the cause of voter \n     equality and equal access to the political process for all \n     people in order to protect the rights of every American and\n       Whereas, We must continue to educate the next generation \n     about the importance of civic engagement in our communities: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature recognizes August \n     6, 2015, as the 50th Anniversary of the signing of the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965, and recognizes the significant progress \n     made by the Voting Rights Act to protect every citizen's \n     right to vote; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature honors and remembers those \n     who struggled and died for this freedom; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the Congress and the \n     President of the United States to continue to secure \n     citizens' right to vote and remedy any racial discrimination \n     in voting; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit, \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority leader of the United States \n     Senate, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-120. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California memorializing the United States \n     Congress to ban the sale or display of any Confederate flag, \n     including the Confederate Battle Flag, on federal property \n     and encourage states to ban the use of Confederate States of \n     America symbolism from state flags, seals, and symbols, and \n     would encourage the donation of Confederate artifacts to \n     museums; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, According to the 1860 United States Census, the \n     United States population was 31,443,321. The total number of \n     slaves in the Lower South was 2,312,352, comprising 47 \n     percent of the total population, and the total number of \n     slaves in the Upper South was 1,208,758, comprising 29 \n     percent of the total population; and\n       Whereas, South Carolina had a clear Black majority from \n     about 1708 through most of the 18th century. By 1720, there \n     were approximately 18,000 people living in South Carolina and \n     65 percent of those were African American slaves. South \n     Carolina's slave population grew to match the success of its \n     rice culture. Whereas in 1790, there were slightly more \n     Whites than Blacks, with 140,178 Whites and 108,806 Blacks \n     living in South Carolina. By 1860, the Black population had \n     grown, with 291,300 Whites and 412,320 Blacks, to nearly \n     double the White population; and\n       Whereas, The Southern United States, including the States \n     of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, Virginia, \n     and South Carolina, seceded, from the greater union in 1860 \n     to join the Confederate States of America under President \n     Jefferson Davis and General Robert E. Lee; and\n       Whereas, The symbolism of the Confederate flag when the \n     states seceded in 1860 represented, in its personification, \n     secession and treason; and\n       Whereas, The first official national flag of the \n     Confederacy, often called the Stars and Bars, was flown from \n     March 4, 1861, to May 1, 1863, inclusive. The Stars and Bars \n     flag was adopted March 4, 1861, in the first temporary \n     national capital of Montgomery, Alabama, and was raised over \n     the dome of that first Confederate Capitol; and\n       Whereas, At the First Battle of Manassas, the first battle \n     of the Civil War, the similarity between the Stars and Bars \n     and the Stars and Stripes caused confusion and military \n     problems. Regiments carried flags to help commanders observe \n     and assess battles in the warfare of the era. At a distance, \n     the two national flags were hard to tell apart. In addition, \n     Confederate regiments carried many other flags, which added \n     to the possibility of confusion; and\n       Whereas, After the battle, General Pierre Gustave Toutant \n     Beauregard, a prominent general of the Confederate States \n     Army during the Civil War, wrote that he was resolved then to \n     have the Confederate flag changed if possible, or to adopt \n     for his command a ``battle flag,'' the Stars and Bars, that \n     would be entirely different from any state or federal flag. \n     His aide William Porcher Miles, the former chair of the \n     Committee on the Flag and Seal, described his rejected \n     national flag design to Beauregard. Miles also told the \n     Committee on the Flag and Seal about the general's complaints \n     and request for the national flag to be changed. The \n     committee rejected this idea by a four to one vote, after \n     which Beauregard proposed the idea of having two flags. He \n     described the idea in a letter to his commander General \n     Joseph E. Johnston: ``How would it do for us to address the \n     War Dept. on the subject for a supply of Regimental or badge \n     flags made of red with two blue bars crossing each other \n     diagonally on which shall be introduced the stars, . . . We \n     would then on the field of battle know our friends from our \n     enemies''; and\n       Whereas, Although the soldiers of the Confederacy were \n     never tried by the United States government after the Civil \n     War, Jefferson Davis and General Robert E. Lee were indicted \n     and later acquitted of all charges by President Andrew \n     Johnson as he left office in 1869; and\n       Whereas, After the Civil War ended, groups such as the Ku \n     Klux Klan were formed to promote White supremacy and racial \n     hatred. The Ku Klux Klan, perhaps the most infamous, was one \n     of the first groups to continue using the Confederate flag \n     after the war. The Ku Klux Klan rallied others still vexed \n     after the war to instill fear and spout hate against freed \n     African Americans; and\n       Whereas, The flag was later resurrected in the 1950s to \n     rally resistance to the Civil Rights movement and support the \n     South's desire to maintain segregation and further the \n     policies of Jim Crow; and\n       Whereas, In South Carolina the Confederate flag was moved \n     to the top of their State Capitol building in 1962, after \n     President John F. Kennedy called on the Congress of the \n     United States to end poll taxes and literacy tests for \n     voting, and the United States Supreme Court struck down \n     segregation in public transportation; and\n       Whereas, According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \n     there are 788 ``hate groups'' in the United States. Of these, \n     57 are located in the State of California, which is the \n     highest of any state. There are a total of 283 of these hate \n     groups in the former Confederate states. Nineteen of these \n     hate groups reside in South Carolina. Of these 19 hate \n     groups, 16 use the Confederate flag as one of their symbols. \n     These hate groups include the Ku Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis, and \n     Neo-Confederates; and\n       Whereas, African Americans make up 15.6 percent of the \n     population of the United States, or 45 million people, but in \n     2013, they were victims of one-third of all hate crimes in \n     the United States, which is the highest number of any group \n     in America; and\n       Whereas, On June 17, 2015, Dylann Roof went to Emanuel AME \n     Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and opened fire during \n     a Wednesday Bible study, killing nine of the church's \n     attendees; and\n       Whereas, Over the last five years, friends of Dylann Roof \n     had seen him become increasingly aligned with White \n     supremacist ideologies. They observed his behavior becoming \n     more fanatical than that of the most notorious hate groups in \n     his native South Carolina. Dylann Roof believed that it was \n     up to him to do the work that other hate groups were failing \n     to do. Dylann Roof believed that African Americans were \n     ``stupid and violent'' people and viewed Hispanics and \n     Latinos as the ``enemy''; and\n       Whereas, Dylann Roof has been photographed on various \n     occasions with the same Confederate flag that many of these \n     hate groups proudly display; and\n       Whereas, Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed by Public \n     Policy Polling believe that the shooting attack at Emanuel \n     AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, was a hate crime \n     and 34 percent surveyed believe it was a form of terrorism; \n     and\n       Whereas, Since the end of the Civil War, private and \n     official use of the Confederacy's flags, and of flags with \n     derivative designs, has continued and generated \n     philosophical, political, cultural, and racial controversy in \n     the United States. These include flags displayed in states, \n     cities, towns, counties, schools, colleges, or universities, \n     or by private organizations, associations, or by individuals; \n     and\n       Whereas, In some American states the Confederate flag is \n     given the same protection from burning and desecration as the \n     United States flag. It is protected from being publicly \n     mutilated, defiled, or otherwise cast in contempt by the laws \n     of five states: Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n     South Carolina. However, laws banning the desecration of any \n     flag, even if technically remaining in effect, were ruled \n     unconstitutional in 1989 by the United States Supreme Court \n     in Texas v. Johnson and are not enforceable; and\n       Whereas, In 2000, South Carolina passed a bill to remove \n     the Confederate flag from the top of the state house dome. It \n     had been placed there since the early 1960s by an all-White \n     South Carolina Legislature to mark the 100th anniversary of \n     the Civil War. The flaw was moved to the north end of the \n     state house as part of a compromise. However, to this day, \n     there have been protests to have the flag removed from there \n     as well; and\n       Whereas, To many groups, especially African Americans, the \n     Confederate flag is a symbol of hate, racism, exclusion, \n     oppression, and violence. Its symbolism and history are \n     directly linked to the enslavement, torture, and murder of \n     millions of African Americans; and\n       Whereas, Today, as in the past, public display of the \n     Confederate flag is believed to instill fear, intimidation, \n     and a direct threat of violence towards others, though a \n     minute number of groups disagree, claiming that the \n     Confederate flag commemorates Southern heritage; and\n       Whereas, In 2014, the State of California, through the \n     enactment of Assembly Bill 2444, became the first state to \n     ban the state sale and display of the Confederate flag. The \n     State of California may not sell or display the Battle Flag \n     of the Confederacy, also referred to as the Stars and Bars, \n     or any similar image, or tangible personal property inscribed \n     with that image unless the image appears in a book, digital \n     medium, or state museum that serves an educational or \n     historical purpose; and\n       Whereas, On June 22, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley of South \n     Carolina called upon her\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\n     state to remove the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds \n     in the wake of the Emanuel AME Church shooting: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of California \n     encourages the United States Congress to identify the states \n     that have a Confederate symbol embedded into their state's \n     flag; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the United \n     States Congress to encourage states to ban the use of the \n     former Confederate States of America symbolism and seals from \n     all state flags, seals, and symbols; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature memorializes the United \n     States Congress to ban the sale and display of any \n     Confederate flag, including the Confederate Battle Flag, on \n     federally owned properties and buildings and to urge those \n     states that sell or display the flag at their capitols to \n     have the flag removed; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature encourages the United States \n     Congress to encourage businesses to urge their states to take \n     down any Confederate flag, including the Confederate Battle \n     Flag, from their capitols; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature encourages the donation of \n     any effects representing the former Confederate States of \n     America to local, state, and national museums; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, to each Senator and \n     Representative from California, and to the governors of the \n     southern states including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, \n     Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South \n     Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-121. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan opposing the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency's efforts to study or commission a study that, if \n     consistent with the agency's past practices, many fear will \n     serve as the first step towards the regulation of grills and \n     barbecues; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 56\n\n       Whereas, Barbecues are an American tradition enjoyed by \n     families from all walks of life across the country. Whether \n     tailgating for a football game, hosting a backyard get-\n     together, or just grilling a summer meal, barbecues are a \n     quintessentially American experience and an opportunity to \n     eat and socialize with family and friends; and\n       Whereas, Cooking outdoors on a grill during the summer \n     saves electricity. Using a grill prevents the release of heat \n     into the kitchen and other living spaces, while cooking \n     indoors heats up a kitchen, forcing cooling systems, such as \n     the refrigerator and air conditioner, to work harder and use \n     more energy; and\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA), our nation's environmental regulatory agency, has \n     funded a University of California-Riverside student project \n     to develop preventative technology to reduce emissions from \n     residential barbecues. By funding this project, the EPA is \n     apparently intent on finding a solution to a problem that \n     does not exist and demonstrating an unnecessary interest and \n     concern over the impact of backyard barbecues on public \n     health; and\n       Whereas, Based on the EPA's past practices, today's study, \n     no matter how small, is a concern to Michiganders and \n     Americans, as it is inevitably the first step towards \n     tomorrow's regulation of this American pastime. To fulfill \n     its mission to protect human health and the environment, the \n     EPA's primary tool has been, and continues to be, regulatory \n     mandates that time and again ignore the financial, economic, \n     and social burdens to the state and the country. The \n     regulation of barbecues would be the latest, egregious \n     example of overreach by the EPA; and\n       Whereas, Funding such a study is a poor use of taxpayer \n     dollars. In the face of record national debts, annual budget \n     deficits, and other profound problems the country is facing, \n     surely the federal government can better use our resources \n     than on a study of grills and backyard barbecues: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we oppose the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to study or \n     commission a study that, if consistent with the agency's past \n     practices, many fear will serve as the first step towards the \n     regulation of grills and barbecues; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation.\n       POM-122.

A bill to permit occupational therapists to conduct the \ninitial assessment visit under a Medicare home\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\nhealth plan of care for certain rehabilitation cases; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Medicare Home \nHealth Flexibility Act of 2015, which I am introducing today with my \ncolleague Senator Heller. This bipartisan, no-cost legislation would \nallow occupational therapists to perform the initial home health \nassessment in cases in which occupational therapy is ordered by the \nphysician, along with speech language pathology and/or physical therapy \nservices, and skilled nursing care is not required, ensuring that \nMedicare beneficiaries receive timely access to essential home health \ntherapy services.\n  Occupational therapy is frequently ordered as part of a physician's \nplan of care for patients requiring home health services, and, under \ncertain circumstances, an occupational therapist is allowed to perform \nthe comprehensive assessment to determine a Medicare beneficiary's \ncontinuing need for home health therapy services. However, under \ncurrent Medicare law, occupational therapists are not permitted to \nconduct the initial assessment for home health cases, even when \noccupational therapy is included in the physician's order and when the \ncase is exclusively related to rehabilitation therapy.\n  By permitting occupational therapists to perform initial home health \nassessments in limited circumstances, the Medicare Home Health \nFlexibility Act can help prevent delays in Medicare beneficiaries \nreceiving essential home health therapy services, especially in areas \nwhere access to physical therapists and speech language pathologists \nmay be limited. It is important to note that this legislation would \napply only to rehabilitation therapy cases in which skilled nursing \ncare is not required. Nurses would still be required to conduct the \ninitial assessment for all home health cases in which skilled nursing \ncare is ordered by the physician. Also, although the Medicare Home \nHealth Flexibility Act would allow occupational therapists to conduct \ninitial home health assessments, it would not alter the existing \ncriteria for establishing eligibility for the Medicare home health \nbenefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Heller in supporting the \nMedicare Home Health Flexibility Act, which will help ensure timely \naccess to essential home health therapy services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

An original bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to improve the efficiency of the Medicare appeals process, and for \nother purposes; from the Committee on Finance; placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today Senator Wyden and I have officially \nintroduced the Audit and Appeal Fairness, Integrity, and Reforms in \nMedicare, or AFIRM, Act of 2015, a bipartisan bill developed earlier \nthis year in the Senate Finance Committee. The AFIRM Act was actually \nordered reported out of the committee in June, passing by voice vote \nwith no recorded opposition.\n  This legislation, comes mainly in response to the concerns many have \nexpressed with regard to program integrity and the overall solvency of \nthe Medicare Trust Fund.\n  A recent report from the Government Accountability Office found that, \nin fiscal year 2014 alone, Medicare covered health services for \napproximately 54 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries at a cost \nof $603 billion in Federal funds. And, according to GAO, of that \nfigure, approximately 10 percent of the funds were improperly paid.\n  That is nearly $60 billion in improper payments--either errors or \nfraud--in a single fiscal year. That is an astronomical figure, and \nabout 33 percent higher than the number we saw the year before.\n  This unacceptably high level of improper Medicare payments has led to \nan increased number of audits to identify and recapture those funds. \nWhile officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have \nbeen reasonably successful in their mission to conduct audits on the \nmore than one billion claims submitted to Medicare every year, they \nface an uphill battle in their efforts to recover improper payments.\n  In 2014, for example, CMS recovery audit contractors recovered over \n$2.57 billion. While this may sound like a large number, that is less \nthan of the 2014 Medicare improper payments estimate of $45.8 billion, \nhardly a figure anyone should be proud of.\n  Coming on the heels of this massive loss in taxpayer funds and our \nGovernment's utter failure to retrieve them is an equally massive \nunintended consequence.\n  Due to the increasing number of audits, there has been a predictable, \nyet dramatic, increase in the number of Medicare appeals. Currently, \nthere are so many appeals being filed in response to these audits that \nthe Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals can't even docket them for \n20 to 24 weeks after they are filed.\n  In fact, within the last month, the total backlog of Medicare appeals \neclipsed 900,000. You heard that right: There are more than 900,000 \nappeals currently pending at the Office of Medicare Hearings and \nAppeals.\n  In fiscal year 2009, the majority of Medicare appeals were processed \nwithin 94 days. Now, 6 years later, it takes, on average, 547 days--or \nroughly a year and a half--to process an appeal. This is an incredibly \nfrustrating amount of time, not only for physicians and other health \ncare providers, but for Medicare beneficiaries as well.\n  Think about that for a second. It takes, on average, a year and a \nhalf for Medicare beneficiaries--many of whom live on fixed incomes--\nfiling an appeal to find out whether their services will be covered in \nthe end. It takes a year and a half for doctors--an increasing number \nof whom are already opting to not accept Medicare patients--to find out \nif they will be paid.\n  Contributing to this problem is the fact that large portions of the \ninitial payment determinations are reversed on appeal. The Department \nof Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General reported that, \nof the 41,000 appeals made to Administrative Law Judges, or ALJs, in \nfiscal year 2012, over 60 percent were partially or fully favorable to \nthe defendant.\n  Such a high rate of reversals raises questions about the quality of \ninitial determinations and whether providers and beneficiaries are \nfacing undue burdens up front.\n  In order to protect beneficiaries, provide certainty for doctors, and \ntake steps to at least partially shore up the Medicare Trust Fund, we \nneed to address these issues now. That is why Senator Wyden and I \nintroduced the AFIRM Act.\n  If enacted, our bill will improve oversight of the Medicare audits \nand appeals process, effectively addressing the staggering Medicare \nappeals backlog. It will make the most fundamental changes to the \nappeals process since Medicare began. It will lay the groundwork for a \nmore level playing field, reducing the burden on providers and \nsuppliers, while giving auditors the tools necessary to better protect \nthe Medicare Trust Fund.\n  The AFIRM Act will address these issues in five ways.\n  First, it will improve the audit programs by coordinating efforts \nbetween auditors and CMS to ensure that all\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\nparties receive adequate training on current policy, increasing \ntransparency in the audit process, and requiring that CMS create new \nincentives to improve auditor accuracy.\n  Second, the bill will make reforms to the Medicare appeals process to \naddress the appeals backlog without sacrificing quality. Part of this \nwill be done by raising the amount in controversy for review by an ALJ \nto match the amount for review required by a District Court. For cases \nwith lower costs, a new Medicare Magistrate program will be created to \nallow senior attorneys with expertise in Medicare law and policies to \ndecide cases in the same way as ALJs. This will allow more cases to be \nheard more quickly, while still providing ALJs full focus on the more \ncomplex cases.\n  Third, the bill will allow for the use of sampling and extrapolation \nof Medicare claims, with the appellant's consent, to expedite the \nappeals process.\n  Fourth, the bill will establish voluntary alternate dispute \nresolution processes for multiple pending claims with similar issues to \nbe settled as a unit, rather than as individual appeals. This will \nreduce administrative costs while still providing reasonable \nconsideration to pending claims.\n  Finally, the bill will also require that CMS create an independent \nOmbudsman for Medicare Reviews and Appeals to help resolve complaints \nmade by appellants and those considering appeal. As with any federal \nprogram, continuing oversight and good leadership are required to have \nany measure of success.\n  These are thoughtful, bipartisan improvements, agreed on by the \nentire Finance Committee that will address the appeals backlog while \nstill allowing us to improve program integrity going forward. I believe \nit is the best approach we can take to continue our efforts to recover \nlost taxpayer funds without creating undue burdens for health care \nproviders and suppliers.\n  Oftentimes in Congress we find ourselves shying away from bipartisan \ncompromises like this. Some may feel that they have more to gain, \npolitically, if they thumb their noses at the other party. Or, \ninversely, they have something to lose if they actually agree on an \nissue with members on the other side.\n  Let me clearly state, for the record, that we have neither the time, \nnor the money to play partisan games with this issue.\n  The average amount of time for an appeal to get processed has gone up \nby more than 550 percent in just 6 years. You heard me correctly--that \nincrease is just in the time it takes to get the appeal processed, not \neven ruled on. If this trend continues, and absent congressional \naction, I think we can assume that it will continue, imagine how much \nmore strained, expensive, and ineffective the Medicare appeals system \ncould become.\n  Truly, there is no time better than now to actually do our job and \nstem this rising tide.\n  Before I finish I want to thank Senator Wyden for working with me on \nthis effort and for making this a truly bipartisan endeavor. I hope all \nof my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--will support the AFIRM \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 2372.

A bill to require reporting \nof terrorist activities and the unlawful distribution of \ninformation relating to explosives, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nRequiring Reporting of Online Terrorist Activity Act, which would \nrequire technology companies to inform appropriate law enforcement \nauthorities when they become aware of terrorist activity online.\n  This provision is modeled after a similar requirement on technology \ncompanies under current law, which requires the companies to report \ninstances of child pornography that they become aware of online.\n  This legislation passed the Intelligence Committee earlier this year \nby a vote of 15-0 as part of our annual Intelligence Authorization Act, \nbut it was later dropped, along with other provisions, to try to move \nthe broader intelligence bill through the Senate.\n  I have continued to believe that terrorists' use of the Internet is a \nproblem that we need to address, and that the government can't do it \nalone. I have had conversations with the senior leaders and general \ncounsels of major technology companies and unfortunately, I don't \nbelieve that they will report terrorist activity on their websites \nwithout a legal requirement to do so.\n  So I am reintroducing this provision as a stand-alone bill, \nespecially in the wake of recent terrorist attacks that highlight the \nproblem of terrorist activity on social media.\n  The investigation into the San Bernardino attack is ongoing, but so \nfar, we have learned that sometime around the time of the attack, the \nfemale shooter, Tashfeen Malik, or an account connected to her, posted \nsomething on her Facebook page declaring allegiance to the Islamic \nState in Syria and the Levant or ``ISIL.''\n  Facebook has publicly confirmed that the company identified and \nremoved the account connected to Malik because praising a terrorist \nattack or declaring allegiance to leaders of ISIL would violate the \ncompany's standards for use.\n  Facebook has said it is cooperating with law enforcement on the \nmatter as part of the post-shooting investigation, but I would like to \nsee technology companies notify law enforcement about terrorist \nactivity they see online before an attack occurs.\n  It is important to recognize how ISIL has used social media to \nreinvent terrorist recruiting and plotting over the past year and a \nhalf. I believe that now is the time for Congress to pass legislation \nto help law enforcement better respond to the threat.\n  Unlike in the past when terrorists devised intricate plots years in \nadvance, today, thousands of ISIL followers have flooded social media \nwith a vast and persistent effort to find followers inside the United \nStates, identify targets of opportunity, and instruct their new \nsupporters how to conduct more small-scale, yet lethal terrorist \nattacks--all in a matter of days or weeks and all online without ever \nmeeting or vetting their operative in person.\n  This new trend shows that terrorism has adapted to the digital age, \nspreading first its propaganda and then its operational reach across \nthe globe. Its lack of coordination or complexity makes it faster and \nharder to thwart than ever before, and the ubiquitous use of social \nmedia gives ISIL a wider direct audience than al-Qa'ida ever enjoyed.\n  To respond, we must ensure that law enforcement is aware of the \nthreat. To do this, Congress should pass this legislation immediately, \nwhich requires technology companies to inform the appropriate \nauthorities when they become aware of terrorist activity.\n  This type of requirement is not new. For years, companies have been \nrequired to notify law enforcement when they become aware of online \nchild pornography. This bill would do essentially the same thing, but \nfor cases of terrorism. It would not require companies to monitor their \ncustomers, nor would it chill free speech protected by the \nConstitution. Instead, it simply requires that clear acts of terrorist \nplotting or illegal activity associated with terrorism be conveyed to \nlaw enforcement.\n  Most social media companies already devote considerable resources to \nremove content or suspend the accounts of individuals who post or \ntransmit blatant terrorist-related content. But under the current \nsystem, there is no requirement that a company provide notice to law \nenforcement when, through the normal course of business, it becomes \naware of images, posts, or other online terrorist activity. By closing \nthat gap and requiring that companies notify law enforcement, there is \na better chance the attempts by terrorist groups like ISIL to direct an \nindividual inside the United States to conduct a violent act will be \ndiscovered and thwarted before it is too late.\n  When technology companies see a picture of a child being exploited, \nthey are required to inform law enforcement. Terrorist activity should \nbe no different.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MARKEY (for himself and Ms. Warren):\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\n  S. 2374. A bill to amend the Defense Base Act to require death \nbenefits to be paid to a deceased employee's designated beneficiary or \nnext of kin in the case of death resulting from a war-risk hazard or \nact of terrorism occurring on or after September 11, 2001; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, in September 2012, an attack on the United \nStates facilities in Benghazi, Libya, resulted in the death of Glen \nAnthony Doherty, a former Navy SEAL who grew up in Winchester, MA, and \nthree others.\n  Mr. Doherty was killed while defending the classified annex near the \nU.S. Consulate in Benghazi against a terrorist attack that also caused \nthe deaths of U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, former Navy SEAL \nand C.I.A. contractor Tyrone Woods, and U.S. State Department officer \nSean Smith.\n  Mr. Doherty was unmarried and had no dependents. It is my \nunderstanding that he activated his mandatory Defense Base Act \ninsurance policy before deploying to Libya in 2012 believing this \npolicy would pay benefits to his estate or next of kin in the event of \nhis death.\n  After his death and despite the Doherty family's extensive efforts, \nthey have been unable to receive financial compensation from the \nCentral Intelligence Agency or from private insurance providers. This \nissue has compounded the pain the family has endured from the loss of a \nbeloved son and brother.\n  No family in the CIA community should be left uncompensated if a \nfamily member falls in the line of duty.\n  That is why I am today introducing the Glen Anthony Doherty Overseas \nSecurity Personnel Fairness Act, which was first introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Congressman Steven Lynch. This legislation \nwill remove a significant omission in federal law that currently \nprohibits the families of overseas contractors who are killed in the \nline of duty from receiving full death benefits if the deceased \nemployee is unmarried with no children or other dependents. The bill \nwould amend the Defense Base Act of 1941 to ensure that full death \nbenefits are extended to the families or designated beneficiaries of \nFederal contractors who have died in service to our country as a result \nof a war-risk hazard or an act of terrorism.\n  Specifically, it would allow the payment of death benefits otherwise \ndue a widow, widower, or surviving child of an individual employed at a \nmilitary, air, or naval base outside of the United States who dies as a \nresult of a war-risk hazard or act of terrorism occurring on or after \nSeptember 11, 2001, when there is no person eligible for a death \nbenefit under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.\n  The bill requires payment in such a case to a beneficiary designated \nby the deceased or the next of kin or the estate of the deceased under \napplicable state law if there is no designated beneficiary. The bill \nrequires benefits to be paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund.\n  More than merely a technical or administrative concern, this issue \ngoes to the heart of the United States government's relationship with \nthe families of those who are killed defending our country. I ask all \nSenators to support this important legislation for the families of \nthose who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8498-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 331--DESIGNATING DECEMBER 12, 2015, AS ``WREATHS \n                          ACROSS AMERICA DAY''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. King) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 331, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 331) designating December 12, 2015, \n     as ``Wreaths Across America Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined with my \ncolleague, Senator Angus King, in sponsoring this resolution to \ndesignate December 12, 2015, as Wreaths Across America Day. Since its \ninception, the Wreaths Across America project has become an annual \ntradition of donating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir \nremembrance wreaths on the graves of our fallen heroes buried at \nArlington National Cemetery, as well as at veterans' cemeteries and \nmemorials in every State and overseas. In the program's 24 years, more \nthan 2.4 million wreaths have been placed in honor of those who have \nserved our country.\n  The origin of Wreaths Across America is an inspiring example of that \ngenerosity and gratitude. During the Christmas season in 1992, Morrill \nand Karen Worcester took time during their busiest season to donate and \ndeliver wreaths from their company in Harrington, ME, to Arlington \nNational Cemetery to honor the heroes who lie at rest there. At first, \na small group of volunteers laid the wreaths with little notice. In \nrecent years, however, the Arlington Wreath Project has grown to become \na national phenomenon. The people of Maine are proud that this \nimportant and well-deserved tradition began in our State.\n  This year, on December 12, thousands of volunteers in Arlington, \nthroughout our Nation, and overseas will carry out the mission of \nWreaths Across America to ``Remember, Honor, Teach.'' This will \nconclude a weeklong procession between Maine and Virginia, with stops \nalong the way to pause and remember the men and women who have died to \npreserve our freedoms, spread the message about the importance of \nhonoring those who serve, and remind the people of the United States \nabout the sacrifices made by our veterans and their families. This \nprocession helps to ensure that those sacrifices are never forgotten.\n  The Patriot Guard Riders, along with other dedicated escort groups, \nwill accompany tractor-trailers filled with donated wreaths from Maine \nto Arlington National Cemetery. America's trucking industry has long \nsupported Wreaths Across America by providing drivers, equipment, fuel, \nand related services to assist in the transportation of wreaths across \nthe country to more than 1,000 locations.\n  Wreaths Across America not only honors our departed heroes, but also \nimparts the important message to veterans who are still with us that we \nhonor their service. It tells our men and women in uniform today that \nwe are grateful for their courage and devotion to duty. It tells the \nfamilies of those serving our country that they are in our thoughts and \nprayers. And it tells the families of the fallen that we share their \ngrief.\n  Throughout human history, the evergreen wreath has been offered as a \ntribute to heroes. On December 12, 2015, we will again offer this \nenduring symbol of valor and sacrifice as part of our never-ending \nobligation to thank those who wore the uniform of our country. In this \nseason of giving, we will pay tribute to those who have given us the \nmost precious gift of all, our freedom.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I have joined my esteemed colleague, \nSenator Susan Collins, in submitting a resolution designating December \n12, 2015, as Wreaths Across America Day. What started as a quiet \ntribute to our Nation's veterans in a small town in Washington County, \nMaine 24 years ago, has blossomed into one of the greatest honors paid \nto our servicemembers coast to coast. Every December, donated balsam \nfir wreaths travel from Harrington, ME, to veterans' cemeteries around \nthe country and are placed on the graves of our fallen heroes. During \nthis season of giving, it is only fitting to recognize this wonderful \ntradition and the generosity of those who conceived it, and as always, \nto reaffirm our commitment and appreciation for those who fought to \npreserve our freedom.\n  During the 1992 holiday season, Morrill and Karen Worcester of \nWorcester Wreath Company found themselves with a surplus of unused \nwreaths. Recalling a boyhood visit to Arlington National Cemetery, \nMorrill was inspired to use those extra wreaths to honor American \nservicemembers. So, aided by then-Senator Olympia Snowe and determined \nto celebrate our veterans and their families, the Worcesters arranged \nto have the wreaths placed in one of the older sections of Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  Building on the Worcester family's vision, other folks from around \nMaine stepped up to help out and give back. James Prout, the owner of a \nMaine trucking company, made sure the wreaths were safely transported \nto Arlington. The Maine State Society of Washington, D.C., a group of \npeople from Maine living and working in the Nation's capital, helped \norganize the wreath laying ceremony at the cemetery.\n  So it went for several years--wreaths were quietly assembled and sent \nto Arlington National Cemetery to honor our country's veterans. Then in \n2005, a photo of the wreaths in Arlington took the internet by storm, \nand the tradition quickly gained widespread attention. The salient \nimage of the snow-covered wreaths resting on the graves of the fallen \ntransformed what was\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\nonce a quiet act of kindness to a national sensation. Soon thousands of \nvolunteers were inspired to help in Arlington or to bring the project \nto their hometowns throughout the country.\n  Last year alone, Wreaths Across America and its national network of \nvolunteers laid over 700,000 memorial wreaths at 1,000 locations \nincluding sites in all 50 States and numerous national veteran \ncemeteries on foreign soil. Thanks to truckers and the Patriot Guard \nRiders who escort the tractor trailers on their motorcycles, the \nwreaths travel to Arlington and beyond as part of a Veterans Honor \nParade--stopping along the way to remember, honor, and teach.\n  I am proud to stand with Senator Collins in sponsoring December 12, \n2015, as Wreaths Across America Day. On this day, and every day, let us \nremember the brave men and women who have served our country and thank \nthe dedicated volunteers who proudly honor their memory and sacrifice.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about San Bernardino, about \nthe decades-long fight that our free society faces, and about our \ndangerous unwillingness to tell the truth about the nature of this \nbattle--about who our enemy is.\n  We are at war. The American people already know this. Our enemies \nobviously knows this. It is only this town where our so-called leaders \ndawdle and bicker, pander and misprioritize. It is only this town that \nseems confused. Washington ignores what it cannot escape, and that is \nboth a tragedy and a crisis, for it is impossible to win a war when one \ndoes not even admit that one is in a war.\n  Let's start by admitting that this war is different from most of the \nwars of the past. This is not about borders or territory. This is not \nabout gold or other material goods. We typically think about state \nactors--about traditional governments going to war with traditional \ngovernments. In this war, however, the enemy includes many state \nactors, many armed groups who are developing global reach in this \nflatter, technologically linked world.\n  Our enemy is merciless and barbaric. They are willing to kill people \nwho are not on traditional battlefields. They will kill noncombatants. \nThey will kill women and children. They will kill at holiday parties \nand restaurants, at Jewish delis and sporting stadiums.\n  Just as sad as the evolution of our enemies, though, this war is hard \nfor the American people to get their heads around because we have so \nmuch confusion right now--so much drift, so much orphanhood--not just \nabout our enemies but about exactly who we are and about exactly what \nwe are fighting to defend.\n  This body, the Congress, tries to do far too many things, and we do \nvery few of them well, but when there are really important tasks that \nwe should be tackling, well then folks seem to be unable to muster the \nenergy or the courage or the time or the will to focus diligently on \nthe task before us.\n  Today we have such a big task before us, and I will humbly suggest \nthat before another person in this body or another member of the \nnational media stands up to scold the American people about how they \ncould possibly entertain voting for candidate X or Y, perhaps we should \nlook in the mirror at why so many of our people are running to \ndemagoguing leaders.\n  Do Senators really not understand what is happening? Did anyone \nreally not see this coming? I think it is obvious why the people are \ndoing what they are doing--because they get so little actual leadership \nout of this town, out of either end of Pennsylvania Avenue and out of \neither political party. Make no mistake, there were some genuinely \ndreadful things said on our national stage yesterday, but they were \nalmost completely predictable. Did anyone really not see this coming?\n  Why is it that these words are so attractive to so many? Why do they \nfind so many followers? Because they are comforting to a people who are \nscared. They are food to a people who are starved for leadership.\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\n  Sunday night was a desert. Monday night was a flood. Neither are what \nour people need or really what they, at their best, want, but don't be \nsurprised that a people being misled by a political class that is in \ndenial about the nature of the fight we face--don't be surprised if \nthese people come then quickly to desire very different, much more \nmuscular words and utopian pledges.\n  This town's conversations are so often so completely disconnected \nfrom the people. Do you want to know what people calling my office and \nstopping me in the grocery store--since Paris and now since San \nBernardino--want to talk about? They want to talk about what Sharia law \nis and how many Muslims actually believe in it. It is a fair question \nfor moms to ask. They want to talk about American exceptionalism. They \nwant to know what we are for, what we are against, and what do we unite \naround. We should talk more about these things. For a minute tonight \nlet's just step briefly beyond the media cycle and look at where we \nstand. This is a clash of civilizations. This is a fight between free \npeople and a totalitarian movement. Let me say clearly that recognizing \na clash of civilizations is not at all to want one, but recognizing one \nis simply the truth in this matter.\n  We are free and our enemies hate it. They hate that my wife leaves \nour house and drives. They hate that my daughters know how to read. \nThey hate that we decided where we would go to church on Sunday. They \nhate us not because of any particular thing we have done by omission or \nby commission; they hate us because of who we are. They hate us because \nwe have a Constitution that enshrines these freedoms, and this is the \nConstitution that we should be uniting around--uniting to defend. We \nshould fight to defend the framework that has secured the freedom of \nspeech, the freedom of religion, the freedom of the press, and the \nfreedom of assembly for all Americans for 200 years--not initially \nsuccessfully judging every man by the content of his character instead \nof merely the color of his skin but eventually guiding us beyond this \noriginal American sin and toward a more perfect union.\n  This weekend I went to San Bernardino. My wife and I laid flowers at \na memorial that has popped up on a sidewalk outside the site where 35 \nof our neighbors bled this week; 14 of them ultimately died in this \nmassacre. We talked to our American neighbors there in a neighborhood \nthat should not be part of a war zone, but that neighborhood will now \nforever be a battlefield memorial. Some of the people grieving there \nwondered aloud to us: Why are our politicians so small, so mealy-\nmouthed? One marine asked my wife if Washington really even cares about \nthe victims of jihadi attacks like this. One woman asked why no one in \nWashington seems to be a full-throated lover of America. They are \nwrong, of course, about the caring and the loving. There is a lot of \ncare and love, but they can be forgiven for wondering why we are so \nunable to be full-throated about the big things.\n  We owe it to those who died this week, and to their families, to be \nclear and truthful about the nature of this conflict. We owe it to \nthose 14. We owe it to their families, we owe it to the service men and \nwomen in uniform who are fighting abroad right now to defend our \nfreedoms, some of whom will come home in caskets, and we owe it to the \nfamilies of those who have not yet died--but who will--in the next \njihadi attack on our homeland, for it is coming.\n  All adults know that the next attack is coming. You don't need to see \nthe classified briefings that some of us see to know the future is \ndangerous. The San Bernardino 14 will not be the last Americans to \nbleed and die in our homeland because we are a free society. So we \nshould tell the truth about the enemy we face. We should tell the truth \nabout them, and we should dig down deep to be honest not only about \nthem but about who we are. We should now reaffirm our core values that \nunite us as a people.\n  We are not at war with terrorism, which is just a tactic. We are not \nat war with some empty sociological label called radicalism or \nextremism, as if it has no connection to belief or ideology. We are not \njust at war with ISIS, though we are obviously at war with ISIS, but \nthere will be another group that will raise the black flag of death \nlong after ISIS has been routed out of Iraq and Syria.\n  This is not about workplace violence, this is not about global \nwarming or gun shows. This is not about income inequality. This is not \nabout some kid from a broken home somewhere in the Middle East, as \ntragic as broken homes are both at home and abroad. Again, against a \nwhole load of hand-wringing mush, we need to remember that this attack, \nand know that our next attack, is not because of anything we have done \nwrong. This is about who we are. This is about the nature of freedom.\n  Who are we? We are a people, 320 million of us, who unite around the \nConstitution and the First Amendment that guarantees the freedom of \nspeech, the freedom of religion, the freedom of the press, and the \nfreedom of assembly to all Americans of every creed and every \ntradition.\n  I am a Christian. I am not a Muslim. I am also in this life an \nAmerican, and I have taken an oath of office to the Constitution, and \nso, as an American, I stand and defend the rights of American Muslims \nto freely worship even though we differ about important theological \nmatters.\n  In America we are free to believe different things and to argue about \nthose beliefs. It matters what you think about the nature of God, about \nrevelation, and about salvation. It matters what you think about Heaven \nand Hell. In fact, it matters so much and we think these things are so \nimportant that you couldn't possibly solve any of them by violence.\n  America is about the right to argue about our differences with our \nneighbors but to make those arguments free from violence. We, in this \nland, under the constitutional creed, come together as a community of \nAmericans to unite around core American values: freedom of religion, \nspeech, press, and assembly.\n  So now, as it is emphatically and indisputably clear, that we are not \nin a war with all Muslims, let us tell the truth that we most certainly \nare at war with militant Islam. We are at war with violent Islam. We \nare at war with jihadi Islam. We are at war with those who believe in \nkilling in the name of religion.\n  This is, in fact, precisely what America means. It is about being \nfree to raise your kids, free to build a corner store, and free to \nworship and to assemble without the fear of violence. We can argue \nabout religion because many of us do disagree, and then we come \ntogether as Americans to protect and defend each other against \nreligious killing.\n  There are many hand-wringers in Washington who refuse to name the \nenemy we face. They refuse to admit we are at war with militant Islam, \nwith jihadi Islam, with violent Islam. They dance around platitudes and \noffer empty labels hiding behind a worry--an understandable worry--that \nMuslims in America could face backlash. I share this fear, and I \nbelieve that telling the truth about who is and who is not our enemy is \nactually the one sure way of avoiding that danger.\n  I think those who are refusing to tell the truth about our enemies, \nthose who will nonsensically claim that the next jihadi attack is \nsomehow just another random case of workplace violence are making the \nbacklash far more likely, not less likely.\n  Here is how I think the backlash actually happens: The people who are \nsupposed to be laser-focused on defending the American people--that is \nus--mouth silly platitudes that show we are either too weak or too \nconfused to keep our people safe.\n  Then, a megalomaniac strongman steps forward and starts screaming \nabout travel bans and deportation and offering promises to keep all of \nus safe, which to some--and I think actually to many more than those of \nus in this body seem to understand--sounds much better than not being \nprotected at all.\n  You want to stop a backlash against American Muslims? Then stop \nlecturing Americans that they are supposedly stupid to be frightened \nabout jihadis who actually do want to bomb their kid's sporting event \nand instead use your pen and your phone as Commander in Chief to start \ntelling us what your plan is to actually find and kill those who want \nto do us harm. Start telling us what your actual plan\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nis to have a Middle Eastern map that isn't generating more failed \nstates year over year that become the terror training camps of next \nyear.\n  This country invented religious liberty. This is the most tolerant \nNation the world has ever seen. Our people need a little less elite \nsermonizing about tolerance in our communities and a little more \narticulation of the shared constitutional principles around which we \nare united and a lot more articulating of an actual battle plan to win \nthe war that is going to be ours for the next many decades.\n  If you are worried about backlash--if you are worried about the \nobviously over-the-top rhetoric from unserious Presidential \ncandidates--perhaps it will be useful for those of us who have the \nactual job of protecting the Constitution to tell the truth. We should \nbe clear about who we are and about the freedoms we stand for, and we \nshould be clear about those who would try to kill us because we believe \nin these freedoms.\n  We are at war with militant or jihadi Islam, but we are not at war \nwith people who believe in the American creed, which includes the right \nof people--every people, every faith tradition--to freely worship, to \nfreely speak, to freely assemble, and to argue. We are not at war with \nall Muslims. We are not at war with Muslim families in Lincoln or in \nDearborn who want the American dream amid our pluralistic society for \ntheir kids, but we most certainly are at war with those who want to \nspread a variety of Islam that aims to motivate the killing and the \nfreedom-taking of other Americans.\n  This fight will be decades long, and we will win it, but we will not \nwin it by denying that the fight exists. We will not win it by being \nunclear about who we are and who they are. We will win it instead by \nbeing clearer about both who they are and who we are. We will win it by \nreaffirming our core constitutional values. We will win it because of \nwho we are: a people who believes in freedom and a people who is \nwilling to fight and even to die to preserve a free society for all \nAmericans.\n  Macbeth includes that aching line: ``Life is a tale, told by an \nidiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.'' The context is an \naimless people, drifting from who they are, drifting toward nihilism \nsignifying nothing.\n  This should not be us. This cannot be us. For America does signify \nsomething--something special. America is the belief that everyone--\nChristian, Jew, Muslim, Black and White, man and woman, rich and poor, \nfifth generation, first generation--everyone is endowed by our Creator \nwith certain inalienable rights. Our government is our shared project \nto secure and safeguard those rights. Our Constitution--our shared \ncreed--gives us a framework for that order of liberty. When \npoliticians--whether incumbents who seem to have forgotten their oaths \nor candidates trying to run merely on the bluster of their \npersonality--don't talk about the Constitution, when they don't defend \nfirst principles, when they refuse to prefer substance over sound \nbites, when they nonsensically say either that our enemy has nothing to \ndo with Islam or conversely that every Muslim is to be prejudged \nguilty--well, then our national conversation crumbles into sound and \nfury. That is not us, for we are Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8504-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8504-S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS BILL\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Every Student \nSucceeds Act--the bill to reauthorization the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  We have only one goal in mind: to give all our children the best \npossible education. The challenge has been to figure out the right role \nfor the Federal Government to do that.\n  This bill, which will replace No Child Left Behind, moves away from \nrigid standardized tests and respects the vital work our teachers do \nevery day. I strongly support those changes. However, I voted against \nthis bill when it was first approved by the Senate a few months ago \nbecause I felt it lacked even the minimum safeguards necessary to \nensure that States would use Federal funds effectively to support \nteachers and students. I was deeply concerned that without stronger \naccountability, billions of dollars in taxpayer money would not \nactually reach those schools and those students who needed them the \nmost.\n  Unlike the bill initially approved by the Senate, the proposal before \nus has significantly enhanced those safeguards. I argued that it was \nessential that billions of dollars a year of Federal funding must be \naccompanied by some minimum expectations for what States are going to \ndo with that money. One of those expectations must be that States \ntarget their efforts toward schools that are most in need of \nimprovement and resources.\n  That is why I am glad this final bill includes an amendment I offered \nwith Senator Cory Booker to ensure that States address the 1,200 high \nschools in the United States, where fewer than two-thirds of students \ngraduate every year.\n  When one-third of a high school's students don't graduate, we know we \nhave a crisis on our hands. We can't just turn our backs. This \nprovision will ensure that States can't ignore those kids, and it will \nensure additional Federal resources for those schools that clearly need \nit the most.\n  This commonsense accountability provision had deep support across the \nboard. It was supported by the Obama administration, the civil rights \ncommunity, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the NEA. It wasn't in the \nbill I voted against a few months ago, but I am glad to see it in the \nfinal bill before us today because helping schools with chronic dropout \nrates cannot be optional.\n  This bill also ensures that States cannot ignore any group of \nstudents who are consistently falling behind their peers. Let's face \nit. Historically, States haven't always stood up for their most \nvulnerable kids, and this bill makes certain that those kids will not \nbe ignored again. That is why we have a Federal education law in the \nfirst place: to ensure that when the Federal Government gives States \nmoney to buy a good education for kids, that States have to use that \nmoney to support all of our kids--especially kids who need those \nresources the most. Senator Murphy and I offered amendments to achieve \nthis goal when the bill came before the Senate. They weren't included \nback then, but I am glad to see that the final bill ensures that if \nStates want Federal dollars, they cannot turn their backs on vulnerable \nstudents.\n  This has been a very challenging process, but Senator Murray and \nSenator Alexander kept the door open for improvement, and I am grateful \nfor that. Many allies stood together to ensure that Federal dollars \nwould actually be used to improve both schools and educational \nopportunities for children living in poverty, children of color, \nchildren with disabilities, and other groups of kids who have been \nunderserved, mistreated or systematically denied even the most basic \nopportunities to get a good education.\n  One final note. States and communities cannot address persistent \nachievement gaps if they don't have good data. With this bill, parents, \nresearchers, and educators across the country will, for the first time, \nbe able to analyze the performance of African-American boys or Hispanic \ngirls or low-income children with disabilities. The ability to analyze \nthe interaction of race and gender or disabilities and income will help \nus better understand how our schools are serving students and identify \nstudent groups who need more help. I am very grateful to my cosponsor, \nSenator Cory Gardner, the Presiding Officer this afternoon, in helping \nmake sure this final bill includes this bipartisan data transparency \namendment that we offered to achieve this goal.\n  When President Johnson first signed ESEA back in 1965, it was a \nlandmark civil rights law. At the time, he said:\n\n       I know that education is the only valid passport from \n     poverty--the only valid passport. . . . I believe deeply no \n     law I have signed or will ever sign means more to the future \n     of America.\n\n  Today, the majority of our children in public school live in \npoverty--the majority. Think about that. This law is more important \ntoday than it has ever been. I am voting for this bill because I \nbelieve we have been successful in ensuring that it contains a minimum \nset\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\nof safeguards to protect our most vulnerable kids. I still have real \nconcerns about what States will do with the new flexibility it \nprovides, and many of us here will be watching closely to see if the \nStates deliver for our kids.\n  I am committed to keep fighting for our Nation's public schools, and \nthat includes fighting for more Federal investment. I hope this \nlegislation truly lives up to the promises made half a century ago to \nsupport public education fully and fairly enough to create real \nopportunities for all of our children.\n  If the changes in this law don't move us closer to providing a world-\nclass education for every single one of our children, then we will be \nright back here to fix it. We owe it to our students, we owe it to our \nteachers, we owe it to our history, and we owe it to our future to get \nthis right.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/senate-section/article/S8505-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
