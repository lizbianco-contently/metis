Mr. President, later this morning the Senate will have \nan opportunity to take decisive action to address our Nation's \ndevastating prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is good legislation that \nwill help tackle this crisis by expanding education and prevention \ninitiatives, improving treatment programs, and bolstering law \nenforcement efforts. This authorization bill, in conjunction with the \n$400 million appropriated for opioid-specific programs just a few \nmonths ago, can make important strides in combating the growing \naddiction and overdose problem we have seen in every one of our States.\n  In Kentucky, what we have seen is some of the highest drug overdose \nrates in the country, and we know all too well that the work that must \nbe done to overcome this crisis lies before us. Kentuckians also know \nthe positive impact this legislation can have.\n  Let me remind you of what a top anti-drug official from Northern \nKentucky said about CARA. She said this bill ``will address the growing \nneeds of our communities in getting appropriate treatment to those who \nare suffering . . . [and] allow individuals, families, and communities \nto heal from this scourge.'' So we will keep working hard to build on \nthese efforts so that fewer Americans ever have to know the heartache \nof drug addiction and overdose.\n  I appreciate the work of Senators on both sides of the aisle to \nadvance this bill. On the Democratic side, that includes the junior \nSenator from Rhode Island and the senior Senator from Minnesota. On the \nRepublican side, that includes Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire. She \ncares deeply about this issue and has studied the problem carefully. \nShe has seen the effect it has had on her home State, and she has \nworked hard to do something about it.\n  Now, of course, today's vote on CARA would not have been possible at \nall without the leadership and work of other colleagues. I particularly \nwant to mention Senator Portman from Ohio, who has been involved with \nthis for several years, from the very beginning, in developing this \nimportant legislation for our country. He has worked diligently over \nthe past few years as the lead Republican sponsor of this much-needed \nbill. He has held many meetings and expert conferences to get an even \ngreater understanding of the issue. We appreciate the long hours he has \ndevoted to addressing this national crisis through the legislation we \nwill pass today.\n  And of course, we thank the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for everything he has done to \nmake this moment possible. He understands the urgency of addressing \nthis epidemic, and we all appreciate the very important role he played \nin guiding this legislation to passage.\n  Indeed, this critical legislation to address America's national drug \nepidemic languished in a previous Senate Judiciary Committee, but then \nChairman Grassley came along. Under a new chairman and a new Republican \nmajority, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act became a real \npriority. It passed the committee swiftly, and it will pass the Senate \ntoday.\n  Important legislation to help the victims of modern slavery \nlanguished in a previous Senate Judiciary Committee, but then Chairman \nGrassley came along. Under a new chairman and a new Republican \nmajority, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act became a real \npriority. It passed the committee swiftly, and then it passed the \nSenate.\n  The list goes on. Here is the chairman who has worked to give voices \nto the voiceless. He also has a passion for letting Iowans and the \nAmerican people be heard. No wonder he is working so hard now to give \nthe people a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court.\n  The next Supreme Court Justice could dramatically change the \ndirection of the Court and our country for a\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\ngeneration. It is a change in direction that could have significant \nimplications for the rights we hold dear. That includes our Second \nAmendment rights and our First Amendment rights, things such as \nAmericans' ability to speak out politically and practice their religion \nfreely.\n  The American people obviously deserve to have a voice in this matter. \nIt is the fairest and most reasonable approach we could take. During \nour current national conversation, Americans could make their voices \nheard on the kind of judicial philosophy they favor.\n  One view says that judges should be committed to an even-handed \ninterpretation of the law and the Constitution so that every American \ngets a fair shake. Another view--the so-called empathy standard that \nPresident Obama favors--says that judges should, on critical questions, \nrely on their personal ideology to resolve a case.\n  I know which view Justice Scalia took. He said that setting aside \none's personal views is one of the primary qualifications for a judge. \n``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign \nyourself to the fact you're not always going to like the conclusions \nyou reach.''\n  The American people will have the chance to make their voices heard \nin the matter, and that is thanks to a dedicated Senator from Iowa who \ncontinues to stand strong for Americans' right to have a say. Chairman \nGrassley has gotten a lot done under the new majority, just as the \nSenate has gotten a lot done under the new majority. We will mark \nanother important accomplishment for the American people this morning \nwith the passage of CARA.\n  Now Senators have a choice. Senators can endlessly debate an issue \nwhere the parties don't agree or they can keep working together in \nareas where we do. I say we should continue doing our work, and the \nAmerican people should continue making their voices heard. That is good \nfor the country, and that is the best way forward now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1398-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 years ago voters went to the ballot to \nelect a President of the United States, the most powerful Nation in the \nworld. The American people spoke, and they overwhelmingly elected \nPresident Obama to a second term.\n  We know that my friend the Republican leader stated that the \nRepublicans had two goals: No. 1, to make sure that Obama was not \nreelected; and No. 2, that they would oppose everything Obama tried to \ndo. On the first, they were a failure. Obama was reelected with more \nthan 5 million votes. The other agreement the Republicans made was to \noppose everything that Obama wanted to do or tried do, and they have \nstuck with that. That is why we have had 7 years of turmoil, 7 years of \nnot doing nearly as much as we should, 7 years of endless filibusters.\n  So my friend the Republican leader can talk all he wants about the \nprogress made last year, but anyone studying what has gone on in the \nSenate recognizes that simply is without any basis. We have done so \nlittle that some political scientists say it is the most unproductive \nyear that has ever been spent in Washington. But 3 years ago, voters \nwent to the ballot box to elect a President. The American people spoke. \nThey spoke loudly, as I have indicated, and they overwhelmingly elected \nBarack Obama for a second term. It was a 4-year term he was elected to, \nnot a 3-year term--a 4-year term.\n  During the Presidential term of office, our President has \nobligations--constitutional obligations. But Republicans continue to \nreject that election. They continue to reject Barack Obama's \nPresidency. They say he is illegitimate. They continue to reject the \nwill of the people.\n  When he was reelected overwhelmingly, obviously, they gave him the \nconstitutional powers to do whatever is within the Constitution. One of \nthose is to nominate Supreme Court Justices, just as he did in his \nfirst term. Yet the Republican leader and the senior Senator from Iowa \nremain committed to blocking the President's nominee. They are not \nfollowing the Constitution. Republicans are not following the \nConstitution. The whole country is taking note. But the State of Iowa \nis taking special note.\n  Earlier this week, a mother wrote an open letter to Senator Grassley \nthat appeared in the Des Moines Register. Here is what she said:\n\n       Refusal to abide by the tenants of our Constitution, and \n     confirm a qualified candidate to the Supreme Court, is a \n     violation of our common values. Your example to my children \n     is that it doesn't really matter what the rules say; if the \n     stakes are high enough and the chips don't fall your way, \n     it's OK to arbitrarily change the rules and deny the other \n     player his/her turn.\n\n  That is the Senate Republicans' lesson to the people who elected \nthem. It doesn't matter who you elected for President, we will refuse \nto do our duty just to follow Donald Trump's example. Remember what \nDonald Trump told all of my Republican friends and the country on the \nSupreme Court nomination. Here is his very, very detailed explanation \nof what he wants to do. Here is what he said: ``Delay, delay, delay.'' \nThen he went on to something else. The Republicans have followed that.\n  Yesterday, Professor Jonathan Carlson of the University of Iowa--he \nis a professor of law there--published an op-ed in the Cedar Rapids \nGazette, a newspaper in Iowa. In the editorial, Professor Carlson \nwrote:\n\n       Grassley's decision [will] rob Americans of their voice.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The voters elected President Obama to fill the next Supreme \n     Court vacancy, and that vacancy is now upon us. Obama should \n     be allowed to do the job he was elected to do.\n       Grassley's problem isn't that he wants to give the American \n     people a chance to decide this issue. His problem is that he \n     doesn't like the decision they already made.\n\n  Republicans should not ignore the voice of the people just because \nthey don't like what the American people declared, but that is just \nwhat the senior Senator from Iowa continues to do--ignore the people of \nIowa and the rest of America.\n  Thirty years ago, Senator Grassley had it right. When the Judiciary \nCommittee began its consideration of the elevation of Justice Rehnquist \nto be Chief Justice, he said: ``This committee has the obligation to \nbuild a record and to conduct the most in-depth inquiry that we can.'' \nLet me repeat that. ``This committee''--he is referring to the \nJudiciary Committee--``has the obligation to build a record and to \nconduct the most in-depth inquiry that we can.''\n  Now Senator Grassley isn't interested in inquiries or building a \nrecord. He refuses to meet with the nominee, even if the nominee is \nfrom Iowa. He refuses to hold a hearing, and he refuses, of course, to \nhave a vote.\n  Senator Grassley isn't interested in inquiries or building a record. \nThrough his obstruction, he is already choosing to close the door on a \npotential nominee. He has even said that he will not consider the \nnomination of his fellow Iowan Judge Jane Kelly, even though she was \noverwhelmingly elevated from the trial court to the appellate court in \nthis body with, of course, Senator Grassley leading the charge on her \nbehalf. So what he said about his fellow Iowan, Jane Kelly, is a little \nstrange--a little odd--because it was Senator Grassley who strongly \nsupported Judge Kelly and pushed her confirmation to the Eighth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Senator Grassley says he will preemptively reject \nJudge Kelly, or\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nany nominee, out of--listen to this one--principle, and that is because \nRepublicans' only principle is obstruction.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he has fallen in line with \nthe Republican leader's obstruction and followed what Donald Trump has \nsuggested: Delay, delay, delay. He is going to great lengths to shut \ndown voices who simply want to do their jobs. For example, at the \nbehest of the Republican leader, he met privately with Republicans on \nthe Judiciary Committee and twisted his colleagues' arms to sign a \nloyalty oath, promising to block consideration of the President's \nnominees. That point has already been made here and is a part of the \nRecord. Next, he tried to move a committee markup behind closed doors. \nWhen Democrats objected, he canceled the meeting. He also used the \nPresiding Officer's chair here on the floor to shut down debate on the \nSupreme Court vacancy, which is really unheard of, but he did it.\n  Time and again, the senior Senator from Iowa has followed the orders \nof the Republican leader and Donald Trump and sought to silence his \ncritics and shut the American people out of the Senate's business. Why? \nIf the Senator's obstruction is truly supported by the Constitution and \nhistory, why wouldn't he want to have a debate in the open? Let's \ndebate it on the Senate floor. President Obama's nominee deserves a \nmeeting, a hearing, and a vote. The American people deserve a Senate \nthat honors the Constitution and provides its advice and consent on \nSupreme Court nominees.\n  As Professor Carlson said, by refusing to give President Obama's \nnominee consideration, Senator Grassley is robbing Iowans and Americans \nof their voice. Listening to the American people is our job, and Senate \nRepublicans should do their job.\n  Mr. President, what is the Senate business today?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1399-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the senior Senator from Arizona \ntook to the floor to criticize the work of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I am honored to be on that subcommittee as the vice \nchairman and to work with Senator Cochran, the Republican from \nMississippi.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona argued that the support for \nRepublican Presidential candidate Donald Trump is somehow connected to \nthe work of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I have heard some \npretty outlandish claims by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, but the \nfact that he would capture the hearts and minds of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee with his rhetoric is beyond me.\n  Senator Cochran has been a Member of the Senate for many years. He is \nrespected and has worked his way up to be chairman of the full \ncommittee. I have worked with him and found him to be an excellent \npartner. He is bipartisan and tries to make sure that we protect our \nNation's national defense. I have never found him to be in the thrall \nof Donald Trump, but that suggestion was made yesterday by the senior \nSenator from Arizona. I will leave it to the American people to judge \nthe wisdom or absurdity of that allegation.\n  I would like to take a moment to correct the record on a few of the \nthings that the senior Senator from Arizona said. The issues involved \nare pretty complex, but the crux of it comes down to this: The senior \nSenator from Arizona is proposing to waste $1.5 billion--and perhaps as \nmuch as $5 billion--on a controversial proposal on how the Department \nof Defense and intelligence agencies should launch national security \nsatellites. In addition to costing billions of dollars--that is \nbillions, not millions--the senior Senator from Arizona's proposal is \nopposed by the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter; the Director of \nNational Intelligence, James Clapper; the Under Secretary of Defense, \nFrank Kendall; and the Secretary of the Air Force, Deborah James. One \nwould think that the senior Senator from Arizona, who chairs the \nDefense Authorization Committee, would note that it is unified \nopposition from the Department of Defense to his ideas. Each of these \nindividuals has expressed strong concern about the ideas of the senior \nSenator from Arizona. They have stated as clearly as they can and as \noften as they can that what he has in mind will harm our national \nsecurity. They have even stated it in the senior Senator's committee \nhearings. He is either not listening, paying attention, or refusing to \nagree. Nevertheless, all that I did, all that the Senate has done last \nyear with Senator Cochran on a bipartisan basis, was to listen to our \nsenior national security leaders while protecting taxpayers from \nwasting billions of dollars.\n  The matter generating all of this discussion is about competition for \nlaunching defense satellites into space. Let me tell you at the outset \nthat before I came to the subcommittee, we made a terrible decision. \nAbout 10 years ago, the two leading competitors for launching \nsatellites into space were two private companies, Boeing Aircraft and \nLockheed. They came to the government with a suggestion, and they said: \nWe've got a great idea. Instead of competing against one another to \nlaunch satellites--listen to this--we will merge our companies \ntogether, and we will save the government lots of money. I don't know \nwhy, but the Department of Defense and the committees on Capitol Hill \nbought it, and they created the United Launch Alliance, or ULA. It \nbecame a monopoly. These two merged corporations became a monopoly in \nlaunching satellites. You know what happens when you have monopoly \nstatus? The costs go up dramatically, and that is exactly what \nhappened.\n\n  In the last 10 years, United Launch Alliance has been a reliable \npartner with the Department of Defense, and they have launched \nsatellites and other things into space which have been critical for \nnational security. But because they are a monopoly with no competition, \nthey became very expensive.\n  There are new entries in the market that are promising in terms of \nlaunching satellites, and one of them is SpaceX. SpaceX has matured \ninto a company that can play an important role in the future of \nsatellite launches. I noted this fact, and as chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I did something that is unusual by Capitol \nHill standards. In January of 2014, I held a hearing. At the same table \nI invited the CEO of United Launch Alliance and the CEO of SpaceX to \nsit next to one another and testify. They answered questions about \ntheir capabilities and about the history of space launch in the future. \nThe committee members asked them how they could save money, and each of \nthem responded. At the end of the hearing, I suggested to each of the \nCEOs that they propound up to 10 questions to the other CEO that they \ndidn't think were covered in our hearing. I tried to make this as open \nas possible and to invite a new competitive spirit when it came to \nthese space launches. I think it was constructive.\n  It is also clear that there is another element in this issue that \nbrought the senior Senator from Arizona to the floor. The United Launch \nAlliance has several engines that can take a satellite into space. The \nmost economical one, the RD-180, is not built in America. It is built \nin Russia. Now, that has become a major problem. Put Vladimir Putin and \nhis adventurism to the side here. I have even joined with the senior \nSenator from Arizona, condemning what Putin has done in countries such \nas Georgia and Ukraine and his threats to the Baltics and Poland. Put \nthat over to the side for a moment. It is best for us to make our own \nengines when it comes to the launching of satellites for America's \nnational defense and intelligence. We put millions of dollars in the \nappropriations bill to incentivize the building of a new engine so we \ncan finally break away from our dependence on this Russian RD-180 \nengine. For 2 years we have been putting that money in the bill.\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\n  I am not opposed to competition. I favor competition. I favor an \nAmerican-made engine. That is not the issue. Here is the problem: You \ncan't just waive a wand or pass an appropriation and recreate a new \nrocket engine. It can take up to 5 years. What will happen in that 5-\nyear period of time while we in America are developing at least one new \nAmerican-made reliable rocket engine? We will have to be dependent \neither on that Russian engine in transition or run the risk that we are \nnot going to have any engines available when we desperately need them \nfor satellite launches. That is exactly what the Secretary of Defense \nhas told the senior Senator from Arizona, and he just will not buy it. \nHe has said: We have to cut the cord and walk away from the Russian \nengines.\n  Here is something he can't answer: NASA also uses engines to launch \nsatellites and people into space. Why would we launch people into \nspace? For the space station. How do we get those folks up to the space \nstation and bring them home? On Russian rocket engines.\n  If the senior Senator from Arizona says that's it, cold turkey, no \nmore Russian engines, what in the world is he going to do about NASA's \nneeds for this engine in supplying the space station and making sure \nthat the folks in orbit can safely come home? He can't answer that \nquestion because the answer truly tells him the problem he is creating \nhere.\n  What we are trying to do is this: Transition to American-made \nengines. I am for that. Create competition for space launches in the \nfuture. I am for that. And make sure we do it in a thoughtful, sensible \nway and not at the expense of America's national defense, our national \nintelligence, or the future of our space program. We can work with the \nSenator from Arizona. I would like to do that, but when he comes to the \nfloor and suggests that all of us who oppose him are somehow cronies of \nVladimir Putin or marching to the orders of Donald Trump, it doesn't \ncreate a very productive environment for conversation.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's work together on an appropriations \nauthorization. Let's put the Russian engines behind us in an orderly \nway, let's create the American engine, and let's push for competition. \nThat is where I got started on this, and that is where I am today.\n  We need to listen to the experts--the experts at the Pentagon--who \nhave told us repeatedly that to do this cold turkey and to cut off the \nRussian engines is, frankly, to jeopardize our national defense, \nsecurity, intelligence gathering, and even our space program. That is \nsomething I hope the senior Senator from Arizona can agree is an \noutcome which we should avoid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Mr. President, I rise to address an issue we are \nconfronting in the Senate, and it is an issue folks in Pennsylvania and \nacross the country are dealing with every day; that is, the opioid \ncrisis. There are a lot of ways to describe this crisis. I am pleased \nto be able to talk about this issue with two of my colleagues who will \nbe following me in succession after my remarks have concluded.\n  This Senator wants to thank, in a particular way, Senator Whitehouse, \nSenator Shaheen, and our leadership for bringing this issue to the \nforefront within our caucus and here in the Senate. I know the effort \nto pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--known by the \nacronym CARA--is a bipartisan effort. I certainly appreciate that.\n  In the case of Senator Whitehouse, he brings a deep reservoir of \nexperience as a Federal prosecutor, U.S. attorney, as well as the \nattorney general of Rhode Island. He brings a law enforcement set of \nexperience as well as his caring and concern about those who have \naddiction issues. We appreciate his leadership. Senator Brown has \nworked on this for many years in the Senate and as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. This is an issue that confronts all of us in \nour States. Our efforts have to be commensurate to match the severity \nof the problem.\n  This week the Senate missed an important opportunity to invest \nsubstantial resources in our Nation's heroin crisis. The amendment \noffered by Senators Shaheen and Whitehouse would have provided $600 \nmillion in emergency funding to aid public health professionals and law \nenforcement, the two main segments of our society that deal with the \nchallenge of addiction on a daily basis. That amendment was defeated, \nand I think that was the wrong conclusion for the Senate and wrong for \nthe country.\n  While the Senate failed to act on this amendment, there is no reason \nwe shouldn't find other opportunities to invest in anti-heroin \nstrategies or, expressed another way, strategies that will lessen or \nreduce the likelihood that more people will be addicted to some opioid \nwhich often leads to other kinds of challenges such as heroin. It too \noften leads not just to the darkness of addiction but literally to the \ndarkness of death itself. We have some work to do.\n  We know we can pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the \nCARA Act, as I mentioned before. That is good, but it is not nearly \nenough. We have to do more than simply pass good legislation that will \nauthorize policies to better confront the challenge. That will not be \nenough. If we have in place new programs, new approaches, and new \nstrategies, that is a measure of progress, but we can't ask medical \nprofessionals to do more to treat addiction if they don't have the \nresources. We cannot ask law enforcement to do more if they don't have \nthe resources.\n  Heroin overdose deaths have increased 244 percent from 2007 to 2013. \nIn roughly a 6-year timeframe, heroin overdose deaths are up 244 \npercent. It is hard to even comprehend that kind of increase of a death \nstatistic--not just a number but a number that indicates the increase \nin the number of deaths. That alone should motivate us to do everything \npossible to do whatever it takes. Whatever authority, whatever policy, \nwhatever dollars we need to invest in this, we have to do that. There \nare lots of other numbers, and sometimes you can get lost in reciting \nthe numbers. I will mention a few that are relevant to Pennsylvania \nbefore I conclude.\n  In addition to just passing the CARA bill, we ought to focus on \ntaking measurable steps to solve the crisis. We don't want to just \naddress the issue, confront the challenge, we want to solve the crisis. \nIt will not happen in 1 year, and it will not happen because of one \nbill or one policy, but we have to put every possible resource or tool \non the table to actually solve the crisis.\n  There are lots of ways to illustrate the degree of the problem. I \nwill talk about a couple of communities in Pennsylvania, just by way of \nexample.\n  The Washington Post--a great newspaper here--went to Washington, PA. \nWe have a county and city just below the city of Pittsburgh, just south \nof Pittsburgh, Washington County and the city of Washington. The Post \nwent there last summer and began to interview people at the local \nlevel.\n  In one of the more stunning statistics they found in their reporting, \nin 70 minutes there were eight overdoses related to heroin--in this \ncase not yet deaths but overdoses. A newspaper could track in 1 hour 10 \nminutes, eight overdoses in one community in one State. Then they \ntracked it over a 2-day timeframe. In 48 hours there were 25 overdoses \nin Washington County, PA, and 3 deaths, in a 48-hour period. I cite \nthat not just for the compelling nature of those numbers but because of \nwhere it happened. This is not happening in communities we used to \nthink of as having a major heroin or drug addiction problem. We tended \nto think of it, at least in my lifetime, as being an urban issue that \nbig cities have this problem and less so in small towns, suburbs, and \nrural communities. In this case, this horror, this evil knows no \ngeographic or class boundaries. It is happening in big cities and very \nsmall towns in Pennsylvania. It is happening in suburban communities, \nhigh- and low-income communities and\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\nin middle-income communities. It is happening everywhere. There is no \nescaping it.\n  If it is happening in places like Washington County--the city of \nWashington, PA, is not a big city but a moderate-sized city. Other \nparts of that county tend to be more rural, small towns to rural. If it \nis happening there in those kinds of numbers, in 70 minutes or 48 \nhours, overdoses and overdose deaths, that gives you an indication of \nthe gravity of the problem.\n  The Coroners Association in Pennsylvania, which has to track the \nnumber of deaths in their counties, reported that in just over a few \nyears in Pennsylvania, the number of deaths from overdoses went from \nless than 50 to hundreds of deaths in just a couple of years. The \ngravity of this problem is self-evident.\n  It is not good enough to diagnose the problem and recite statistics. \nWe have to solve the crisis. There is no doubt this is a huge issue for \nthe country.\n  By not passing the funding that we tried to pass, we are missing a \nchance to support, for example, the substance abuse prevention and \ntreatment block grant, the so-called SABG, or the SA block grant. That \nis an existing program--an existing block grant program--that works. \nThe only good news here, in this debate about what policy to put in \nplace, is that local officials know what they are doing. Addiction and \nmedical professionals know exactly what to do. They know exactly what \nworks. They know exactly what they need. What they are asking us for is \na little bit of policy or a significant amount of policy, maybe. But \nthey are also asking for research and resources, and we have to give \nthose resources to them.\n  I conclude with the following. We know that good treatment works. All \nthe professionals tells us it works. We know so much more today than we \ndid 25 years ago about what works. We know that good treatment works. \nIt takes a long time. There is no 90-day program here because it takes \na lot longer than that. So we know that for sure. There is no dispute \nabout that. We also know that good treatment costs money. You cannot \njust have good intentions here.\n  Lifesaving overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone cost money. The \ngood news is we have a drug to reverse the adverse impact of an \noverdose, and yet a lot of communities cannot afford to get this very \nimportant drug called naloxone, the so-called reversal drug as some \ncall it.\n  Intercepting drugs before they reach our streets costs money. The \nworse this epidemic gets, the more these services are in demand.\n  So Congress--the Senate and the House of Representatives--must \nprovide additional funding to make sure local communities can meet the \ndemand. We know that investing in programs that treat addiction and \nsave lives is an abiding obligation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. It is an abiding obligation that we must fulfill. We have \nto tackle this problem. We can't do it without resources.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am delighted to join Senator Casey \nof Pennsylvania and Senator Brown of Ohio on the floor this morning to \napplaud what appears to be the imminent passage of the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act. So far we have had less than a handful of \nvotes against this bill at any stage through the voting on it, and I \nsuspect that some of those votes may have had to do with amendments and \nso forth. We might even do better than that on final passage.\n  I thank my cosponsors. This was not a bill that was just dreamed up \nin back offices. We had five national seminars in Washington, bringing \npeople in from all around the country to share their experiences, to \nshare their advice, to share their best practices, and to inform the \ndevelopment of this bill. It has been years of work in the making.\n  On our side of the aisle, Senator Klobuchar has been an extremely \nvaluable colleague. On the other side of the aisle, Senator Portman and \nSenator Ayotte were our coconspirators on this bill. I thank them and \nextend my appreciation to all of them.\n  This truly is a comprehensive bill: everything from at the point of \noverdose getting naloxone into the hands of first responders so that \nlives can be saved; through the prescribing process and the \nprescription drug monitoring process; through a whole variety of new \ntreatment programs; and through intervention for people who are \nincarcerated and the prevention of incarceration, particularly for our \npeople in veterans courts and so forth, who can be diverted out of the \nprison system through new means of treatment such as medically assisted \ntreatment that is emerging as a very promising new strategy; and all \nthe way, ultimately, to disposal of excess drugs. This truly is a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  Its only faults are ones that the Republican leadership are in a \nterrific position to remedy, if they would.\n  The first is that there is no additional funding to support any of \nthese new programs that I have described. The funding for the accounts \nin question was determined months and months and months ago in the \nAppropriations Committee before anybody could know what this bill was \ngoing to look like on the floor.\n  When the final deal was reached, the numbers actually matched the \nPresident's budget, and the President's budget was issued even before \nthe appropriations measure came out of its relevant subcommittee. So \nthe President's budget folks would have had to have been astonishing \nmasters of prediction in order to put in money for programs that \nweren't even law at that time.\n  There has been considerable commentary from the other side that there \nis funding for this, but what they overlook is that, yes, there is \nfunding for these programs, but you would have to take it away from \nother treatment and recovery programs to fund these. It would be \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Now, an argument could be made that under this bill, Paul will be a \nmore effective program than the pre-CARA Peter would have been, and, \ntherefore, robbing Peter to pay Paul is a net good. But, please, let's \nnot pretend there is money for this.\n  If there is one indication of how there really isn't new money for \nthis, it is the fact that our friends on the other side can't agree on \nhow much money there is for this. Some Senators have said that there is \n$78 million for funding CARA. The majority leader has said there is \n$400 million to fund CARA. The deputy majority leader has said there is \n$517 million to fund CARA. If the money were real, I suspect they could \nagree on the amount of it. I think the fact of the matter is that there \nis no new money for this, and the sooner we can get this funded, the \nsooner it will save lives.\n  The second problem is that the House, under Republican leadership, \nhas taken no action on this bill. No committee has taken it up and \npassed it. So I take this opportunity to call on the leadership here \nand in the House to put money where their proverbial mouth is to pass \nthis bill, to get some funding behind it--Senator Shaheen's measure \nwould have been terrific--and to get some action out of their \ncolleagues in the House. If we pass it in the Senate and the House \ntakes no action, this will be a sham, and that will have been a shame.\n  With that, I yield the floor for Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you to my colleagues for \nthe terrific work they have done on such an important issue, which in \nmy State sort of began in the most rural of the areas of the State and \nspread and spread and spread. This is the right kind of comprehensive \nresponse for this, but as Senator Whitehouse just said, it means real \nfunding for CARA and what we are doing.\n  I am pleased we are coming together in a bipartisan way overall, \nfinally taking action on the opioid epidemic that is devastating \ncommunities across our country.\n  We know some of the statistics. More people died in my State than in \nthe country as a whole in 2015 from opioid\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\noverdoses rather than they did from auto accidents. We are experiencing \na record number of fatal overdoses. There is no State and probably \ncounty untouched by the scourge.\n  We need to remember the human cost of addiction. In Warren, OH, a \ncouple of weeks ago, there was middle-age woman who now has a child now \nin his midtwenties who has suffered addiction for a dozen years, has \nbeen in and out and is doing better, and then falls back. His family is \naffluent, so his treatment has been better than some. But she says that \nwhen there is an addiction, it afflicts the whole family. Nobody is \nreally exempt.\n  In my State, 2,500 Ohio families in one year lost a loved one to \naddiction. Thousands more continued to struggle with opioid abuse or \nwith a family member's addiction. It is not an individual problem or a \ncharacter flaw. It is a chronic disease. Right now, it is placing an \nunbearable burden on families and communities in our health care \nsystem. That is why we need to tackle this at the national level.\n  It is why I am encouraged to see us debate this Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, or the CARA Act. The ideas in this bill are \nan important first step in tackling the epidemic, but they are just the \nfirst step. On their own they are not nearly enough to put a dent in \nthis epidemic. The initiatives are going to mean very little--and here \nis the key point that both Senator Casey and Senator Whitehouse made--\nwithout additional funding to back them up.\n  My colleagues Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire and Senator Whitehouse \nintroduced an amendment that would have provided an additional $600 \nmillion to fight the opioid epidemic. That would be a serious \ncommitment in putting the ideas in this bill into place into action.\n  But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked this \ninvestment. Again, they want to do things on the cheap. They want to \npass things to pat ourselves on the back but not provide the funding to \nactually accomplish things. It would block the investment in health \nprofessionals and communities who are on the frontlines of this battle.\n  You simply can't do a roundtable with health professionals and people \nworking toward recovery and families affected by it without hearing \nfrom them. They need resources locally. The States aren't coming up \nwith it adequately. They need resources, and they need real investment \nin prevention programs. We need real investment in treatment options to \nhelp patients not just get cured and get clean but stay clean.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Heroin and Prescription Drug \nAbuse Prevention and Reduction Act with my colleague Senator Baldwin of \nWisconsin. Our bill would boost prevention efforts that would improve \ntools for crisis response. It would expand access to treatment, and it \nwould provide support for lifelong recovery, the kind of serious \ninvestment we need to back up our rhetoric.\n  In public health emergencies, we are sometimes, somehow able to come \nup with necessary money--swine flu, Ebola, Zika virus. But addiction is \nnot a public health emergency. Addiction is a public health problem, \nbut one we need to fund in an ongoing way. You can look at the spike in \nthe number of deaths. You can conclude nothing else but that it is a \nlong-term public health problem. Too many lives have been destroyed. \nToo many communities have been devastated. I am just puzzled why my \ncolleagues won't come up with $600 million for this very important \npublic health program. It is time to get serious. It is time to call it \nwhat it is--the public health crisis that demands real and immediate \ninvestment, not more empty rhetoric, not more empty gestures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1402-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1402-S1403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk \nabout what I have been hearing from people in Wyoming about the issue \nof whether President Obama should nominate the next Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  This past last weekend, I was around the State of Wyoming in Rock \nSprings, in Rawlings, and in Casper and the weekend before that, as \nwell, in Casper, Cheyenne, and Big Piney. I am hearing the same thing \nfrom all around the State of Wyoming.\n  What I am hearing is that President Obama should not be the one to \nput another nominee on the Supreme Court and that it should come down \nto the people: Give the people a voice. That is what I am hearing back \nhome.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, is doing \nexactly what the people of Wyoming are insisting upon--the right thing. \nHe is doing the right thing by insisting that the American people \ndecide. I think Senator Grassley is doing a great service to this body, \nto the American people, and also to whomever the next President \nnominates for the Supreme Court.\n  On Monday, after traveling around the State of Wyoming, Senator Enzi, \nwho had also traveled around the State of Wyoming this past weekend, \nand I jointly held a telephone townhall meeting. Folks at home are very \nfamiliar with these. We do these just about every month. We have a \nchance to visit with people about what is on their mind. Then there is \na little way you can do a poll during that telephone townhall meeting, \nand 88 percent of the people of Wyoming agree with Senator Grassley, \nagree with Senator Enzi and with me about the next Supreme Court \nJustice and giving the people a voice.\n  Democrats want to turn this all around into a fight on the Senate \nfloor. They want this to be a backroom deal between the President and \nthe special interest groups. These are the groups that are pushing the \nPresident to appoint someone who will rule the way they want. But that \nis not what the American people want.\n  The American people--and certainly the people in Wyoming--want this \nto be a fight about what happens and what they decide in the voting \nbooth in November. When an election is just months away, the people \nshould be allowed to consider possible Supreme Court nominees as one \nfactor in deciding whom they will support for President. This shouldn't \nreally even be controversial.\n  Democrats in the past have come to the floor, and they said it would \nbe a bad idea to let the President make a lifetime appointment in his \nlast months in office. In 1992 Senator Joe Biden came to the Senate \nfloor to explain his rule. He called it the Biden rule, and it had to \ndo with Supreme Court nominations.\n  On the Senate floor, Joe Biden--now the Vice President, former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee--said that once the Presidential \nelection is underway--and I will tell you, Madam President, the \nPresidential election is underway--``action on a Supreme Court \nnomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over.''\n  Those are the words of Joe Biden. Senator Biden said that a temporary \nvacancy on the Court was ``quite minor compared to the cost that a \nnominee, the President, the Senate, and our Nation would have to pay \nfor what assuredly would be a bitter fight.''\n  That is what Senator Biden at the time was worried about. He was \nworried that a bitter fight over a nominee would do damage to the \nnominee and to the Senate. He knew there would be Senators who would \ncome to the floor and try to politicize this process for their own \npurposes, and we are seeing the Democrats doing that right now. He knew \nit because that is what Democrats have done for years.\n  This is politics as usual for the Democrats. It is the way they tend \nto live their lives here on the Senate floor--talking this way. It is \nexactly what Democrats did when Robert Bork was nominated to serve on \nthe Supreme Court. So Vice President Biden, former Senator Biden, \nunderstands it completely. It is what they did when Miguel Estrada was \nnominated to the circuit court. It is what Democrats did when Samuel \nAlito was nominated to the Supreme Court. Democrats in the Senate even \nfilibustered Justice Alito when he was the nominee. They did everything \nthey could to slander good, qualified people to try to score political \npoints. It is what they do.\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\n  Well, there is no need for us to have this bitter political fight \nthat Joe Biden worried about. Republicans have said there should not be \na bitter political fight. We have called on the President to spare the \ncountry this fight. The best way to avoid the fight is to agree to let \nthe people decide. Give the people a voice, and let the next President \nput forth the nomination. That is certainly what the people of Wyoming \nwant us to do. It is what I heard, along with Senator Enzi, on the \ntelephone townhall meeting this past Monday, and that is what I heard \nas I traveled around the State of Wyoming the past several weekends. I \nwill be back in Wyoming this weekend, and I expect to hear the same \nthing as I travel to Buffalo to the health fair and to communities \naround the State.\n  That is what the American people are saying: Give the people a voice. \nThey are saying that a seat on the Supreme Court should not be just \nanother political payoff to score points in an election year. They are \nsaying it should not be a decision for a lameduck President with one \nfoot out the door. It is too important for that.\n  The Supreme Court is functioning just fine with eight Justices right \nnow. That is not me saying it; it is the Justices of the Supreme Court \nsaying the same thing. Since Justice Scalia died last month, the Court \nhas heard oral arguments in 10 cases. They have released written \nopinions in five cases. They have scheduled more cases for the rest of \nthe term, and they are doing their jobs. That is exactly what Justice \nBreyer said they would do. He is a liberal Supreme Court Justice who \nwas appointed by President Bill Clinton.\n  A reporter asked Justice Breyer about the death of Justice Scalia, \nand he said: ``We'll miss him, but we'll do our work.'' He said: ``For \nthe most part, it will not change.''\n  So there is no urgency to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court \nright now. There is no danger in waiting for the next President to act. \nThere is tremendous danger, however, if we rush through a nomination in \nthe last few months of a Presidential election, to the nominee, to the \nSenate, and to the Nation, just as Joe Biden said 24 years ago. The \nstakes are very high, too high to let that happen.\n  The people are telling us what they want. Eighty-eight percent of the \npeople in Wyoming involved in our telephone townhall meeting on Monday \nsaid exactly that: Give the people a voice. We must let the people \ndecide.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1403-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I understand we are on the bill, but \nthere are no speakers presently here, so I would like to address the \nChair and my colleagues for a few moments about the matter my colleague \nfrom Wyoming was discussing just now, and that is the very serious \nmatter of how we will fill the vacancy of Justice Scalia.\n  I want to read to my colleagues a message I got from one of my \nconstituents in Columbus, MS. As you can imagine, we have all received \nquite a bit of opinion from the people who put us in office, but I \nthink this constituent really hits it on the head when she says: ``The \nnext appointment is probably the most crucial in our history and will \nhave ramifications on future generations.''\n  I really agree with that, and I think it is such a profound decision \nthat we ought to feel comfortable, as the Senator from Wyoming just \nsaid, in letting the people decide. We are in the midst of a great \ndebate about the direction our country will take, the executive branch \nwill take, over the next 4 and possibly 8 years.\n  The Court has been relatively balanced, with a slight 5-4 tilt toward \nthe conservative side. Clearly there is an effort in this city and on \nthe part of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle to shift \nthat balance. I think it is reasonable to conclude, with so much \ninvolved and with the ramifications on future generations, as my \nconstituent has said, that it is very appropriate that this be a matter \nof debate in this Presidential election and, frankly, in the Senate \nelections also. And I realize there is a lot of heat and light on this \nissue, but I would simply suggest that we are on the right track in \nletting the American people speak to this.\n  There is another matter in this regard that I have been reluctant to \nbring to the attention of my colleagues until today, but I think it has \ngotten to the point where we need to be reminded that there are rules \nof decorum that apply to this debate and to all debates we have on the \nSenate floor. I would direct the Chair's attention and the attention of \nmy colleagues to rule XIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate. \nParagraph 2 of that rule states: ``No Senator in debate shall, directly \nor indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to \nother Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a \nSenator.''\n  I read that paragraph in its entirety because it is quite obvious to \nme, to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I think to \nobjective observers, that what has ensued over the last week or two has \nbeen a concerted effort to impugn the reputation and honor of the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  I would just suggest to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and \nparticularly to my friend the distinguished minority leader that in \nreviewing some of the statements that have been made on this floor--and \nI have them in my hand, although I will not read them again to the \nChair because they are in the Record--particularly those statements \ncoming from the very top leadership of the other side of the aisle, \nthere has been statement after statement that crosses the line, that is \nprohibited under the rules. It is a breach of our rules to suggest \nabout any other Senator motives unworthy or unbecoming of a Senator.\n  I hope we can continue this debate, and certainly we will, but I hope \nwe will confine it to the merits of the issue, and there are merits on \nboth sides. This is not the place to conduct an election or reelection \ncampaign--the floor of the Senate is not that place--and it seems to me \nthat in recent days that line has been crossed and crossed repeatedly.\n  I will get back to my original point. We are prepared to let the \nAmerican people speak on this issue, and it is of vital importance not \njust for the next 4 years but perhaps for the next decade, two decades, \nor three decades. And I would ask us to dial the rhetoric back, dial \nthe heat back, and stay on the issues. We are comfortable making the \ncase that this is a decision that should be left to the American \npeople.\n  I thank the Chair for giving me the time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes to \ndescribe the funding that my substitute amendment for S. 524, the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, is intended to \nauthorize.\n  Section 202 of the amendment authorizes SAMHSA's grants to prevent \nprescription drug/opioid overdose-related deaths. These grants were \nappropriated $12 million in H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct of 2016. The specific appropriating language is located on page 50 \nof the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nreport to H.R. 2029.\n  Section 204 authorizes the COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force and Anti-\nMethamphetamine Task Force. These two task forces were appropriated $7 \nmillion each in H.R. 2029, for a total of $14 million. The specific \nappropriating language is located in paragraphs three and four under \nthe section entitled ``Community Oriented Policing Services'', on page \n70 of H.R. 2029.\n  Section 301 authorizes SAMHSA's grants for targeted capacity \nexpansion--medicated assisted treatments.\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nGrants under this program were appropriated $25 million in H.R. 2029. \nThe specific appropriating language for this program is located in the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education report \nto H.R. 2029, on page 47.\n  Section 501 authorizes SAMHSA's Services Grant Program for \nResidential Treatment for Pregnant & Postpartum Women. This grant \nprogram was appropriated $15.9 million in H.R. 2029. The specific \nappropriating language for this program is located in the Departments \nof Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education report to H.R. 2029, \non page 46.\n  Finally, some of the other sections in CARA are being authorized \nthrough 42 U.S.C. section 3797cc, which was appropriated $11 million in \nH.R. 2029. The specific appropriating language is located in paragraph \none under the section entitled ``Community Oriented Policing \nServices'', on page 69 of H.R. 2029. Therefore, the managers' amendment \nauthorizes a total of $77.9 million in total.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nhas expired.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The abuse of heroin and prescription opioid painkillers \n     is having a devastating effect on public health and safety in \n     communities across the United States. According to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose \n     deaths now surpass traffic accidents in the number of deaths \n     caused by injury in the United States. In 2014, an average of \n     more than 120 people in the United States died from drug \n     overdoses every day.\n       (2) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n     (commonly known as ``NIDA''), the number of prescriptions for \n     opioids increased from approximately 76,000,000 in 1991 to \n     nearly 207,000,000 in 2013, and the United States is the \n     biggest consumer of opioids globally, accounting for almost \n     100 percent of the world total for hydrocodone and 81 percent \n     for oxycodone.\n       (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or \n     abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as \n     ``CPDs'') and are involved in most CPD-related overdose \n     incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network \n     (commonly known as ``DAWN''), the estimated number of \n     emergency department visits involving nonmedical use of \n     prescription opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent \n     between 2006 and 2010, from 84,671 to 179,787.\n       (4) The use of heroin in the United States has also spiked \n     sharply in recent years. According to the most recent \n     National Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 900,000 \n     people in the United States reported using heroin in 2014, \n     nearly a 35 percent increase from the previous year. Heroin \n     overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014.\n       (5) The supply of cheap heroin available in the United \n     States has increased dramatically as well, largely due to the \n     activity of Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The Drug \n     Enforcement Administration (commonly known as the ``DEA'') \n     estimates that heroin seizures at the Mexican border have \n     more than doubled since 2010, and heroin production in Mexico \n     increased 62 percent from 2013 to 2014. While only 8 percent \n     of State and local law enforcement officials across the \n     United States identified heroin as the greatest drug threat \n     in their area in 2008, that number rose to 38 percent in \n     2015.\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\n       (6) Law enforcement officials and treatment experts \n     throughout the country report that many people who have \n     misused prescription opioids have turned to heroin as a \n     cheaper or more easily obtained alternative to prescription \n     opioids.\n       (7) According to a report by the National Association of \n     State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to \n     as ``NASADAD''), 37 States reported an increase in admissions \n     to treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while \n     admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased \n     500 percent from 2000 to 2012.\n       (8) Research indicates that combating the opioid crisis, \n     including abuse of prescription painkillers and, \n     increasingly, heroin, requires a multipronged approach that \n     involves prevention, education, monitoring, law enforcement \n     initiatives, reducing drug diversion and the supply of \n     illicit drugs, expanding delivery of existing treatments \n     (including medication assisted treatments), expanding access \n     to overdose medications and interventions, and the \n     development of new medications for pain that can augment the \n     existing treatment arsenal.\n       (9) Substance use disorders are a treatable disease. \n     Discoveries in the science of addiction have led to advances \n     in the treatment of substance use disorders that help people \n     stop abusing drugs and prescription medications and resume \n     their productive lives.\n       (10) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and \n     Health, approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States \n     needed substance use disorder treatment in 2013, but only \n     2,500,000 people received it. Furthermore, current treatment \n     services are not adequate to meet demand. According to a \n     report commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration (commonly known as ``SAMHSA''), there \n     are approximately 32 providers for every 1,000 individuals \n     needing substance use disorder treatment. In some States, the \n     ratio is much lower.\n       (11) The overall cost of drug abuse, from health care- and \n     criminal justice-related costs to lost productivity, is \n     steep, totaling more than $700,000,000,000 a year, according \n     to NIDA. Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major \n     economic dividends.\n       (12) According to NIDA, when schools and communities \n     properly implement science-validated substance abuse \n     prevention programs, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit \n     drugs is reduced. Such programs help teachers, parents, and \n     healthcare professionals shape the perceptions of youths \n     about the risks of drug abuse.\n       (13) Diverting certain individuals with substance use \n     disorders from criminal justice systems into community-based \n     treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent sizeable \n     numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the \n     course of those individuals' lives.\n       (14) According to the DEA, more than 2,700 tons of expired, \n     unwanted prescription medications have been collected since \n     the enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act \n     of 2010 (Public Law 111-273; 124 Stat. 2858).\n       (15) Faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models can provide \n     a critical path to successful recovery for a number of people \n     in the United States. The 2015 membership survey conducted by \n     Alcoholics Anonymous (commonly known as ``AA'') found that 73 \n     percent of AA members were sober longer than 1 year and \n     attended 2.5 meetings per week.\n       (16) Research shows that combining treatment medications \n     with behavioral therapy is an effective way to facilitate \n     success for some patients. Treatment approaches must be \n     tailored to address the drug abuse patterns and drug-related \n     medical, psychiatric, and social problems of each individual. \n     Different types of medications may be useful at different \n     stages of treatment or recovery to help a patient stop using \n     drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse. Patients have a \n     range of options regarding their path to recovery and many \n     have also successfully addressed drug abuse through the use \n     of faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models.\n       (17) Individuals with mental illness, especially severe \n     mental illness, are at considerably higher risk for substance \n     abuse than the general population, and the presence of a \n     mental illness complicates recovery from substance abuse.\n       (18) Rural communities are especially susceptible to heroin \n     and opioid abuse. Individuals in rural counties have higher \n     rates of drug poisoning deaths, including deaths from \n     opioids. According to the American Journal of Public Health, \n     ``[O]pioid poisonings in nonmetropolitan counties have \n     increased at a rate greater than threefold the increase in \n     metropolitan counties.'' According to a February 19, 2016, \n     report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, \n     ``[M]ultiple studies document a higher prevalence [of abuse] \n     among specific vulnerable rural populations, particularly \n     among youth, women who are pregnant or experiencing partner \n     violence, and persons with co-occurring disorders.''\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, as many Iowans know, I made a practice \nof holding townhall meetings in each of the 99 counties of my State \nevery year. It has become known in the media as a ``Full Grassley.'' \nThat is not something I named it. That is something someone else named \nit. It is kind of a flattering name, but in some ways it does not make \nsense because the townhalls are not about Senator Grassley. They are \nabout hearing from Iowans whom I am proud to serve. They are about \nhearing about the real problems my constituents have, and, of course, \nfrom our end, trying to find practical solutions to those problems. \nThat is what I work on every day. I suppose all of my colleagues would \nsay that is what they work on every day.\n  On many occasions at my townhall meetings in recent years, Iowans \nhave asked me why the Senate never gets anything done. Both parties \nprobably shoulder some of the blame for this attitude out there at the \ngrassroots, but the reality is that the most obvious, the most glaring, \nthe most unmistakable reason for the Senate's recent paralysis is the \nway Democratic Leader Reid ran it before he was toppled as majority \nleader.\n  When the Democratic leader was in control of the Senate, he was the \none who decided not to empower his committee chairs to craft and \nadvance bipartisan legislation. He decided not to\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\ngive all Members, Republican and Democratic alike, a real opportunity \nto participate in the process. He decided not to empower the Senate to \naddress real problems that real people face every day.\n  Instead, he chose dysfunction and gridlock over practicality and \nproblem solving. By November 2014, the American people had finally had \nenough. After the American people spoke, the Democratic leader no \nlonger controlled the Senate. Since the Senate has been under \nRepublican leadership, things have started to work again. You see it in \nthe latest example of this bill passing almost unanimously. So this is \nan example of Senators partnering across the aisle. Legislation is \nmoving. The result is real progress on real issues facing our country.\n  I am proud the Judiciary Committee has played its part. As chairman, \nmy goal has been to open the process and seek as much consensus as \npossible. The results reflect that. We have reported 21 bills out of \ncommittee, all with bipartisan support. I would like to walk through \nsome of these results because there is a lot of credit to go around on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Last February the committee passed the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. We passed it unanimously, 19 to 0. The bill enhances \npenalties for human trafficking and equips law enforcement with new \ntools to target predators who traffic in innocent young people. The \nbill passed the Senate 99 to 0 and was passed into law.\n  Yes, there were some bumps along the way. When the Democratic leader \nrealized that genuine bipartisanship had broken out and that we might \nactually accomplish something, a controversy had to be manufactured \nabout the Hyde amendment on that particular trafficking bill, but \neventually the Democratic leader took yes for an answer and the bill \ngot done.\n  This victory was a credit to the leadership of one Democrat and one \nRepublican--Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar. Their bill provided \nreal solutions for real victims of trafficking. A few months later, in \nOctober, the committee passed the Sentencing Reform and Corrections \nAct. Sentencing reform is a difficult and complex issue. Many Senators \nhave strongly held views. Despite that, the bill emerged from our \ncommittee with a strong 15-to-5 bipartisanship vote. My bill would \nrecalibrate prison sentences for certain drug offenders, target violent \ncriminals, and grant judges greater discretion at sentencing for low-\nlevel, nonviolent drug crimes. I am grateful for the Senators who have \npartnered with me on this legislation, especially Senators Durbin, \nCornyn, Whitehouse, and Lee. I am hopeful that if we keep working \ntogether, landmark sentencing reform can be another major \naccomplishment of this Senate. Time is growing short, but I cannot \nthink of a more productive use of the Senate's time than to make our \ncriminal laws more just. This is another example of a real problem we \ncan solve together.\n  Also, in July of last year, the committee passed my Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act, again, without \nopposition. The bill will ensure that at-risk youth are fairly and \neffectively served by juvenile justice grant programs. These important \nprograms provide the chance for kids to get back on the right track so \nthey will not enter the criminal justice system as adults. Every one of \nthese young people are worth helping to reach their greatest potential. \nSenator Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and I are working \nhard to move this bill through the full Senate. I thank him for working \nwith me on it.\n  There are many other bipartisan accomplishments of this Senate that \nthe Judiciary Committee cannot take credit for. I will not try to go \nthrough all of them, of course, but one example that comes to mind was \nthe outstanding work of Senator Burr, a Republican, Senator Feinstein, \na Democrat, on the cyber security bill. That legislation passed the \nSenate on a solid 74-to-21 vote. A conference version of it was later \nsigned into law by the President. With reports of breaches of our \npersonal data on an almost daily basis, it is self-evident that this \nbill helped to address a real problem that has affected millions of \nAmericans.\n  That brings me to the Senate's passage of the bill that was just \nvoted on, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--CARA, for \nshort. It passed today with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. This \nlegislation reflects the Senate at its finest, working in a bipartisan \nway to address an awful epidemic that is gripping our country.\n  I thank the authors of CARA for their leadership in crafting the \nlegislation and working with me to move it through the Judiciary \nCommittee and out of that committee unanimously. In particular, I thank \nSenators Portman, Ayotte, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar; you see, two \nDemocrats and two Republicans. Real lives will be saved because of the \nleadership of this bipartisan group. That is not something we can say \nevery day around the Senate. I know the efforts of those Senators and \nothers to address this epidemic stretch back a few years.\n  It is a shame the Democratic leader decided not to address this \ncrisis at the early stage when he was deciding the agenda of the \nSenate, but he decided not to act, even in the face of mounting \nevidence that the country was facing a grave and gathering epidemic of \nheroin and opioid painkiller overdoses. Deaths from prescription opioid \npainkillers rose over 30 percent from 2007 to 2014. Heroin overdose \ndeaths more than quadrupled during that time. Heroin seizures at the \nsouthwest border more than quadrupled as well. All the while, the \nDemocratic leader never brought a bill to the floor to address the \ncrisis.\n  So given the dysfunction that had overtaken the Senate not long ago, \nwe should take a moment to appreciate the bipartisan process through \nwhich the Senate just passed this CARA bill. As the Republican chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, I moved a Democratic bill through the \ncommittee. It passed without opposition. Then the Republican leader \npromptly scheduled the bill for floor consideration. I don't recall \nthat ever happening under the former Democratic leadership. The Senate \nhad rollcall votes on four amendments, although the Republican leader \noffered more such votes on Democratic amendments. All four of those \namendments were offered by Democratic Senators, and the bill passed \noverwhelmingly, as amended. This process would have been unthinkable \nunder the Democratic leader. This simply would not have happened. You \nknow the statistics. There were 18 rollcall votes on amendments all \nduring the year 2014. During 2015, we had 198 rollcall votes on \namendments and only 4 more Republican amendments than Democratic \namendments.\n\n  Yes, once again the Democratic leader tried to manufacture a \ncontroversy when this bill first came to the floor about a week ago \nMonday, this time over some alleged funding for this heroin-opioid \nepidemic. But when $400 million in newly appropriated money for it \nhasn't even been spent yet, well, that argument by the Democratic \nleader was a tough one to sell.\n  Over the last few days, the Democratic leader played some games with \nnegotiations on a managers' package of amendments. The Republican side, \nthe majority side, worked hard to clear amendments offered by many \nDemocrats, including Senators Durbin, Gillibrand, Heinrich, Kaine, \nMcCaskill, Blumenthal, Schatz, Heitkamp, and Cardin, but the Democratic \nleader objected to completely uncontroversial, commonsense amendments \nthat would be in the package offered by two Republicans, Senator \nJohnson and Senator Kirk. Why? Simply because these Republican Senators \nare up for reelection this year, and under those circumstances, we \ncouldn't reach an agreement. So all these Democratic amendments didn't \ngo because the Democratic leader had objection to two Republican, \nrelatively noncontroversial amendments, one of them absolutely \nnoncontroversial.\n  How noncontroversial were these amendments? Let me give you one \nexample. Senator Johnson wanted to add the Indian Health Service as a \nmember of the task force the bill creates to develop best prescribing \npractices for opioids. I suspect many Americans, including even people \nliving in the State of Nevada, would think Senator Johnson's idea is a \ngood one. Addiction is a problem for so many in our country, and the \nNative American community is unfortunately no exception. But this is \nthe kind of dysfunction, the kind of gridlock that the Democratic \nleader is known for. A good idea becomes a bad idea if it is simply \noffered by a Member\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\nof the Republican Party, and that especially is the case if you are a \nRepublican up for reelection.\n  As CARA's name reflects, the bill addresses this epidemic \ncomprehensively, supporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, \nand law enforcement. CARA begins with prevention and education. The \nbill authorizes awareness and education campaigns so that the public \nunderstands the dangers of becoming addicted. It also creates a \nnational task force to develop best prescribing practices, as I \nmentioned. The bill encourages the use of prescription drug monitoring \nprograms, such as those in my State of Iowa, which help to detect and \ndeter what is called doctor shopping behaviors by addicts. The bill \nauthorizes an expansion of the Federal program that allows patients to \nsafely dispose of old or unused medications so that these drugs don't \nfall into the hands of young people. In fact, along with a few other \ncommittee members, I helped start the original take-back program in \n2010 through the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act.\n  CARA also focuses on treatment and recovery. The bill authorizes \nprograms to provide first responders with training to use naloxone, a \ndrug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and directly \nsave lives. Critically, the bill provides that a set portion of \nnaloxone funding go to rural areas, like much of Iowa, which are being \naffected most acutely. This is critical when someone overdoses and \nisn't near a hospital.\n  The bill also authorizes an expansion of Drug-Free Communities Act \ngrants to those areas that are most dramatically affected by the opioid \nepidemic. And it also authorizes funds for programs that encourage the \nuse of medication-assisted treatment, provide community-based support \nfor those in recovery, and address the unique needs of pregnant and \npostpartum women who are addicted to opioids.\n  Finally, the bill also bolsters law enforcement efforts as well. The \nbill reauthorizes Federal funding for State task forces that \nspecifically address heroin trafficking.\n  So in all these ways, CARA will help real people address the very \nreal epidemic. The eastern part of my State has been hit the hardest. \nThe human costs of what is happening across so many of these \ncommunities is incalculable. Every life that is lost or changed forever \nby this crisis is precious, especially for many young people who fall \nvictim to addiction early in their lives. There is so much human \npotential at stake.\n  I can't wait until my next townhall meeting. I am going to be proud \nto explain how the Senate did something today that will help so many \npeople in Iowa and around the Nation, Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether. Let's keep it going.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MIGUEL ENCINIAS\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I rise today to remember a great New \nMexican and a great American, Dr. Miguel Encinias, who passed away on \nSaturday, February 20, at the age of 92.\n  New Mexico has a long and proud tradition of military service. Dr. \nEncinias is often called ``New Mexico's most decorated veteran.'' He \nfought in three wars and was the recipient of 3 Distinguished Flying \nCrosses, 14 Air Medals, and 2 Purple Hearts. His military career is one \nof courage and sacrifice. He later played an important role in the \ncreation of the World War II Memorial here in Washington, DC.\n  If the measure of a life is living to the utmost of one's talents and \ngiving the utmost of one's self, Miguel Encinias is an inspiration to \nall of us. I think that is why he will long be remembered with such \nadmiration and gratitude.\n  His service began at the young age of 16 when he joined the New \nMexico National Guard in 1939. Within 4 years, he had become a second \nlieutenant and a pilot in the Army Air Corps. Over the next three \ndecades he fought with distinction in three wars: World War II, the \nKorean war, and Vietnam.\n  As his friend and mine, Ralph Arellanes, who is chairman of the \nHispano Roundtable of New Mexico, said of Miguel: Miguel flew 245 \ncombat missions as a fighter pilot. Few American aviators in history \nhave flown combat missions in three wars. Miguel was one of them.\n  He was shot down over Italy in 1944 and served over 15 months in a \nNazi prison camp. He volunteered to go to Korea and was shot down again \nbut not captured. He answered the call of his country many times with \ngreat courage and sacrifice.\n  Dr. Encinias retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1971, but if that was \nthe conclusion of his storied military career, it was just the \nbeginning of new accomplishments and new achievements. He returned to \nNew Mexico and earned a doctorate in Hispanic literature at the \nUniversity of New Mexico.\n  In an article about his life, the Albuquerque Journal said: ``As a \nscholar, educator, New Mexico historian, and decorated combat flyer in \nthree wars, Miguel Encinias both studied and shaped history in a life \nthat spanned nine decades.''\n  There was an article about Miguel in the Santa Fe New Mexican, and \nthey put it this way: ``An ace in the air, a scholar on the ground.''\n  He earlier obtained a degree in political science at Georgetown \nUniversity and a master's degree at the Institute of Political Studies \nin Paris.\n  In 1995 he was requested by President Clinton to serve on the World \nWar II Memorial Advisory Board. By the time the memorial was built in \n2004, Dr. Encinias was the only living member of the board to see it \ncompleted. It was a happy day for him.\n  In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Dr. Encinias's son, \nJuan-Pablo Encinias, summed up what so many who knew Dr. Encinias \nunderstood: ``It's kind of amazing how much he accomplished,'' his son \nsaid. ``He really didn't stop.''\n  Those accomplishments, according to the Journal, included teaching \nHispanic literature at two universities and developing bilingual \neducation in New Mexico schools.\n  Dr. Encinias also found the time to write several books on New Mexico \nhistory and to fund a theater group and a light opera company in \nAlbuquerque.\n  His son Juan-Pablo also remarked to the Journal that Dr. Encinias \n``was very just and felt very strongly about people getting their fair \nshake in life.''\n  Dr. Encinias was honored for his work for civil rights and social \njustice by the New Mexico LULAC branch in 2007 and the Hispano \nRoundtable of New Mexico in 2011. As important as the medals and honors \nare, they aren't the most important thing we will remember about Dr. \nEncinias. It is the example he set in always doing his best, in always \ngiving back, both in wartime and at home.\n  His daughter Isabel shared with me that although her father had \nincredibly high standards and was very tough, he had an incredible \namount of compassion and always fought for the underdog.\n  Whether risking his own life to save that of his fellow airmen or \nfighting for quality education and opportunity for everyone, Miguel \nEncinias committed himself to the needs of others.\n  On November 11, 1995, at the World War II Memorial site dedication, \nDr. Encinias was introduced by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. He received a standing ovation from President Clinton and \neveryone present. They knew they were seeing a true patriot and a true \nhero and a great American. On that day, President Clinton thanked Dr. \nEncinias and said for ``your truly remarkable service to our nation.''\n  To all who knew this extraordinary man and who mourn him now, we know \nhis life was indeed a remarkable story of courage, of dedication, and \nof generosity of spirit.\n  Madam President, my State has lost one of its heroes. Over the course \nof a\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\nlong and distinguished life, Dr. Miguel Encinias always found ways to \nserve, and New Mexico and our Nation are better for it.\n  My wife Jill and I extend our sincere condolences to the Encinias \nfamily on the passing of Dr. Encinias. We honor his courage, we honor \nhis service, and we mourn his loss with the family.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1419-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1419-S1422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SALE OF FIGHTER JETS TO PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise to speak about the discharge vote \nthat will take place momentarily. I just want to say that I know that \nmany people in our country and certainly in this body have significant \nfrustrations with the country of Pakistan. This Senator is one of \nthose. I have been to Afghanistan multiple times. I have visited \nPakistan multiple times. Our relationship is one that is very complex. \nCertainly, Pakistan has been duplicitous in many ways with us relative \nto their relationship with the Taliban and with Al Qaeda and, certainly \nand most importantly, as it relates to this particular topic, the \nHaqqani network.\n  Our country has worked with them to clear out the FATA areas, the \nFederally Administered Tribal Areas. I think most of us have seen the \nwork that has taken place there, and they have worked with us closely \nin that regard.\n  There still are issues undoubtedly that exist relative to their \nrelationship with the Haqqani network, in particular, but also the \nTaliban. At the same time, there are negotiations that are underway \nthat are very important to create a lasting peace in Afghanistan. Even \nthough they play both sides of the fence--and I understand that--and \neven though we have concerns about their relationship with the Haqqani \nnetwork, they do play a role relative to how those negotiations are \ntaking place.\n  I have issues with them. I think everyone in the country of Pakistan \nby this point knows that I have issues with them, at least those who \nare paying attention to this issue.\n  What this discharge petition is about today is that it is voting to \ndischarge something to the Senate floor so that there can be a vote on \nending the allowance of a sale of some fighter jets. These will be \nU.S.-made fighter jets. In spite of some of the rhetoric around this, \nthis has nothing to do with the potential subsidy that could take place \nby U.S. taxpayers.\n  This is about one thing. It is about whether we as a country would \nprefer for Pakistan to buy American-made fighter jets or whether we \nwould prefer for them to buy Russian jets or French jets. This is what \nthis is about.\n  There are some issues that people have raised about potential \nsubsidies for this. I know Senator Cardin, who is on the floor right \nnow, and myself both have a hold on that--a hold to ensure that there \nis some behavior changes that take place in Pakistan before any U.S. \ndollars go toward this sale.\n  But this vote is not about that. This vote is a vote about whether we \nbelieve that countries around the world are better off buying U.S. made \nmaterials or whether we think they should buy them from Russia or \nFrance. That is what this is about in its entirety.\n  We are seeking some behavior changes with Pakistan relative to how \nthey are dealing with the Taliban, with how they are dealing with the \nHaqqani network. It is something that General Campbell, who has been in \ncharge of Afghanistan from a military standpoint, has pushed for. We \nare working closely with our military and others to try to effect the \nbehavior changes that are necessary for us to have an appropriate \nresponse in Afghanistan--but this is a foreign policy issue.\n  Again, everyone in this body, thankfully, is very concerned about our \nforeign policy. Foreign policy, I might say, sometimes has to have a \ndegree of nuance to it. We are working with people and with \nrelationships that matter. It matters deeply to the people who we have \non the ground, the men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and other \nplaces. Our efforts around foreign policy are to do everything we can \nto ensure we are not utilizing men and women in uniform to solve a \nproblem, because that happens when diplomacy fails.\n  So this is a very nuanced topic, and I can just say that the Senate \ndeciding en bloc to block a sale to Pakistan of U.S.-made fighter jets \nis going to be a huge public embarrassment to the country of Pakistan, \nand there are better ways, in my opinion, for solving this problem. All \nof us want to see the behavior change, and I am privileged to be in a \nposition to have some effect on the financing, as does Senator Cardin, \nand we can deal with this issue in a more nuanced way.\n  I know some people will say that this is a great thing for back home. \nOur people back home will love this. Surely, surely, in this body when \nit comes to dealing with a country with nuclear arms and dealing with \nAfghanistan, where we have been for 14 years, how we deal with foreign \npolicy will rise above just the immediate response and maybe \nmisunderstandings even that people back home can have about this type \nof issue.\n  This relationship with Pakistan needs to move beyond the \ntransactional way that it is carried out. I understand that. I \nunderstand that people are frustrated. But at the end of the day, our \ngoal here as representatives of the United States is to see through \ngood things happening for our country. That is what foreign policy is \nabout. It is about pursuing our national interests.\n  It is my strong belief that the Senate's voting today, in essence, to \nbegin the process of denying Pakistan the ability to purchase U.S. \nfighter jets is not a way to engender things that are good for our own \nU.S. national interests. A better way is for us to continue to put \npressure on them as we are doing at present, placing holds on financing \nuntil they do some things to change their behavior and work with us \nmore fully relative to the Haqqani network, in particular, but also Al \nQaeda and the Taliban.\n  So I would urge my fellow citizens and fellow Senators to please \nthink about the long-term interests of our country, to think about when \na country is radicalized and has so many problems as the country of \nPakistan has, the public embarrassment that will take place by our body \ndoing this. Let's work together in other ways that actually can \ngenerate behavior change by dealing with this in a more subtle way than \nthis blunt object that we are dealing with today.\n  I want to close with this--and I know Senator Cardin wants to speak, \nand I know he has a meeting to go to. What we are voting on, if we \ndischarge this, is that we are voting on whether we would rather for \nPakistan to purchase U.S.-made fighter jets, which carry with that at \nleast 30 years of maintenance, meaning that every single year the \nUnited States would be involved with these fighter jets. We could \nwithdraw that at any time if we thought their behavior continued to be \nsuch that we didn't want to support it. It can stop. It maintains our \nleverage with Pakistan over the longer haul. That is what our selling \nthem these pieces of equipment does. It maintains our leverage over \nthem.\n  Today, publicly embarrassing them and sending them to Russia or to \nFrance to buy fighter jets ends that leverage and humiliates them at a \ntime when, in spite of the fact that we don't like some of the things \nthey do, it in essence damages our ability to continue the negotiations \nthat are taking place relative to trying to bring a more lasting peace \nin Afghanistan.\n  I thank you for the time, Madam President. I yield the floor for my \ngood friend and ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I want to thank Senator Corker. The two of us have worked on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee without any partisanship. These are \nforeign policy issues that require the Senate to work together, and I \nwant to thank Senator Corker for his leadership on\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee on this issue and on many other \nissues.\n  Let me first try to explain what we believe will happen in the next \n45 minutes. Under the Arms Export Control Act, the sale of military \narmament to Pakistan requires the administration to give formal \nnotification to the Congress. Prior to that formal notification, there \nis an informal process where the administration will inform the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee \nthat they intend to make a sale. They did that in regard to the F-16s \nfor Pakistan, and that is the issue we are talking about.\n\n  For several months we have been in negotiations with the \nadministration--as well as with stakeholders with regard to the sale of \nthe F-16 to Pakistan--because quite frankly we did have concerns. We \nhad concerns as to how it would impact the region, including India. We \nhad concerns about Pakistan being a nuclear weapons state. We had \nconcerns about Pakistan's efforts for counterinsurgency. We had \nconcerns about Pakistan's participation in the peace process with \nAfghanistan. All of those are issues we were able to get some \ndiscussions on and we think some progress to the F-16 sale.\n  The administration formally notified Congress of the F-16 sale on \nFebruary 25. At that time the bipartisan leadership of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee had \nagreed the administration should go forward with the sale.\n  What we think will happen under the Arms Export Control Act--and any \nMember can offer a resolution of disapproval--is that Senator Paul will \nbe offering to bring up a resolution of this approval. We think that \nwill take place in about 45 minutes. It is likely it will require a \nmotion to proceed or to bring the motion forward, and it is possible \nthe leader, the Republican leader, the majority leader, may offer a \nmotion to table in regard to that motion.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand the next vote will be whether we \nare going to take up--or not--the resolution of disapproval.\n  Senator Corker and I both urge our colleagues that this resolution \nnot be approved, not be taken up; that we allow the sale to go forward \nbut that we maintain our leverage, as Senator Corker has explained, \nbecause there are many more issues involved before the sale becomes \ncomplete.\n  Quite frankly, the reason the F-16s are being recommended is because \nPakistan needs the F-16s for their fight against counterinsurgency. I \nthink all of my colleagues are aware of the mountainous terrain, \nterritory that is in Pakistan on the Afghan border. Pakistan needs an \nair force capacity to deal with that counterinsurgency.\n  It is our military's judgment that these F-16s are important in \nregard to that fight against counterinsurgency; that it is in our \ninterests, U.S. interests; that it is in the regional interests, \nincluding the stability of its neighbor, India; and it is in the \ninterests of dealing with the fight against the extremists.\n  As I said earlier, the relationship with Pakistan is complicated. We \nhave several areas of major concern in that relationship, and we fully \nunderstand the reasons Members would be concerned. We are a strategic \npartner with Pakistan in rooting out terrorism. Let me remind my \ncolleagues, the people of Pakistan have had 40,000 deaths as a result \nof extremist activities within their borders. That is an incredible \nsacrifice that has been made in their campaign against terrorists, \nagainst extremists. They have the Haqqani network, which we know has \ntaken out American interests in that region, they had the fight against \nISIS, and they had the fight against LeT, which is a terrorist \norganization within Pakistan that has committed terrorist attacks in \nIndia.\n  We want them to focus on all of these extremists. At times we don't \nget the full cooperation of Pakistan for these to be the priorities \nthey go after. Obviously, we want to continue our partnership with \nPakistan, but we want them to deal with the threat of the Haqqani \nnetwork. We want them to focus on the threats of ISIS. We want them to \nconcentrate on the destabilizing impact that LeT has on the \nrelationship between Pakistan, India, and the cause of problems in \nIndia. We want to see more progress.\n  On the second front, on the nuclear phase, Pakistan is the fastest \ngrowing nuclear stockpile in the world. Our relationship with Pakistan \nis critically important for the certainty, safety, and security of the \ncommand and control network of their nuclear arsenal. Are they doing \neverything we want them to do in that regard? No. Have we made \nsignificant progress in the safety of their nuclear stockpile? Yes. Do \nwe want to continue our relationship so we can continue to make \nprogress? Absolutely.\n  The third area we need Pakistan's cooperation is in bringing together \nall the stakeholders for a peaceful discussion of the peace talks in \nAfghanistan. The extreme elements that are located in Pakistan need to \nbe part of those discussions. Pakistan can play a critical role in \nhelping that come about. Has Pakistan been helpful? Quite frankly, they \nhave. They have been working with us to get all the stakeholders \ntogether in the talks. Could they do more? Yes, we think they could do \nmore.\n  What Chairman Corker said is absolutely accurate. We would encourage \nour colleagues to vote against the resolution of disapproval or to \nsupport our efforts to keep that off the floor, first and foremost \nbecause the F-16 are needed by Afghanistan and U.S. interests to fight \nthe extremists, but just as important, it maintains the ability of the \nUnited States to deal with Pakistan to bring about further progress in \nall the areas I have talked about. As the chairman said, the worst-case \nscenario is that we break our relationship with Pakistan and other \ncountries step in, and our ability to get changes in Pakistan's \npractices as they relate to support or fighting terrorist organizations \nor nuclear nonproliferation and participation in the Afghan peace talks \ncould be marginalized.\n  In order to maintain the type of bipartisan, bilateral pressure on \nthe problematic elements of the security sector, but while supporting \nreformers in the military and civilian governments, we urge our \ncolleagues that it is important we take this sale to the next level.\n  The last point--and Chairman Corker pointed this out--we are not \nsigning off on the foreign military financing part. The administration \nhas brought forward a proposal for some reprogramming of funds to help \npay for the F-16 sale to Pakistan. In other words, we would use some of \nthe moneys we have already programmed for Afghanistan to be used to pay \nfor the sale of the F-16s. That requires a signoff from the leadership \nof the two authorizing committees. Senator Corker and I had not signed \noff on that--nor do we intend to sign off on that until we have further \nexplanations on a lot of the issues Senator Corker and I have already \nraised. We have ample ways of dealing with our bilateral relationship \nwith Pakistan, allowing the sale formally to go forward by how the sale \nwill be financed.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Paul's \nresolution and allow us to continue the diplomatic path in regard to \nthat region.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I thank Senator Cardin and Senator \nCorker for how diligently they have worked over the course of the last \nseveral months, as both of them have stated on the floor, to make this \nsale much more palatable and to address many of the concerns that both \nthe chairman and the ranking member had about the nature of the sale \nand this long history of conflict with the Pakistanis when it comes to \nour mutual concern of confronting terrorism.\n  The reason I come to the floor is because this body historically has \nhad a history of deep engagement on questions of major arms sales, \nespecially in regions as dangerous and as complicated as the Middle \nEast. As it stands today, virtually the only two Members who are deeply \nand meaningfully engaged in the question of attaching conditions to \nthese very important arms sales are the ranking member and the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee. I trust their ability to hold the \nadministration's feet to the fire--whether it be the Pakistanis', the \nSaudis', the Emirates' feet to the fire as they request weapons from \nthe\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nUnited States, but this body writ large has to get back into the game \nof providing meaningful oversight on a radical and significant increase \nin the amount of arms sales the United States is providing to the rest \nof the world.\n  From 2011 to 2015, our arms exports have increased by 27 percent. \nWhen you compare these two periods, it is striking to note that during \nthat period of time our arms sales to the Middle East have increased by \n61 percent.\n  This Senate has, at its best moments, raised important questions \nabout these sales. I bring you back to the 1980s, when the Senate \nraised important questions and concerns about the sale of AWACS to \nSaudi Arabia. On this side of the aisle, it was Senator Biden and \nSenator Kerry opposing those sales. Those motions of disapproval were \nultimately unsuccessful, but through that process of deep congressional \nintrospection, new conditions were placed on the sale of that \ntechnology to the Saudis that ended up a much better and safer deal for \nAmerican national security interests and for the security of our \npartners in the region.\n  With respect to the specific sale of F-16 to Pakistan, my colleagues \nhave already pointed out--and I think Senator Paul will do a better job \nthan I of pointing out--the ways in which our aims of fighting \nterrorism have been contradictory with the actions of the Pakistanis, \nwhether it be their unwillingness to confront the Haqqani network, \nwhether it be their oftentimes open coordination with elements of the \nTaliban that the United States is fighting inside Afghanistan. The \nPakistanis have been an unreliable partner over the course of the last \n10 years in the fight against extremism, but what I worry more about is \nthat these F-16s will provide cover, will provide a substitute for \ntruly meaningful action inside Pakistan to take on the roots of \nextremism. Frankly, it is too late in many respects to beat these \nextremist groups if they are so big, so powerful, so deadly that you \nhave to bomb them from the air.\n  Today there are 20,000 madrassa, religious schools. Many, if not \nmost, are funded by the Saudis, the Gulf States, and the Iranians and \nare often preaching an intolerant version of Islam that when perverted, \nforms the basis of the extremist groups the United States is fighting \nin the Middle East and throughout the world.\n  The Pakistanis have done little to nothing to try to reduce the \ninfluence of those madrassas, of those religious schools, and of the \nforeign funding that often breeds this intolerant version of religious \nteaching. In a sense, we let them off the hook by selling them new \nweapons systems that will, in effect, constantly force the Pakistanis \nto chase their own tail.\n  I think it is important to understand that the Pakistanis are not \nmaking the real meaningful contributions to rooting out extremism, and \njust handing out weapon systems on the back end doesn't do the job.\n  I would point this body to the path forward. This is an incredibly \nimportant conversation that we are having with respect to the F-16s, \nbut we have other pending military sales that will directly involve the \nUnited States in regional civil wars and conflicts, unbeknownst often \nto the American people.\n  One of them is a major military sales agreement with the Saudis that \nwould eventually resupply them for their bombing campaign in Yemen, a \ncampaign that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, that has \nstopped emergency relief from reaching those who have been the victims \nof this humanitarian disaster, and frankly that has created space for \nthe expansion of ISIS and Al Qaeda, groups that want to do damage and \nattack the United States, inside the newly ungovernable territory of \nYemen. Yet we are going to be confronted with another military sale to \nSaudi Arabia that would double down the U.S. commitment on one side of \na civil war that if you look at the reality, doesn't seem to be \nadvancing our national security interests. It doesn't seem to be \nhelping us win the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda.\n  I hope that after the break we will have the opportunity to discuss \nthat military sale as well because it is time for Congress to get back \ninto the game when it comes to our constitutional responsibility to \noversee the foreign policy led by the executive branch. It is time for \nCongress to start having a meaningful impact when it comes to these \nmassive arms sales that often undermine U.S. national security and come \nwithout the necessary conditions to change the reality of the decisions \nmade in places such as Pakistan.\n\n  I am going to support Senator Paul's resolution today, although I \nhope in the future we will approach these resolutions of disapproval \nwith a slightly greater degree of subtlety in this respect. This is an \noutright disapproval. If we vote in favor of it, this sale will not go \nforward. There is another way. Congress could pass a motion of \ndisapproval with conditions. We could disapprove of a sale to Pakistan \npending, for instance, their commitment to join the fight against the \nHaqqani network; contingent upon, for instance, their movement to \nimplement a law to shut down the worst and most intolerant of the \nmadrasas. I would suggest that should be our path forward when it comes \nto the sale to the Saudis. Simple conditions could be applied to that \nresolution--making sure the munitions we are selling to the Saudis \naren't used to target civilians inside Yemen; committing the Saudis to \nopen up pathways of humanitarian relief and assistance; a promise that \nnone of the funding from the United States to the partners in the \ncoalition to fight the Houthis will be used to directly aid extremist \ngroups. That is probably the better path forward for this body to take.\n  This is a very blunt instrument, a resolution of disapproval. I think \nit is important for some of us to be on record supporting it to show \nthat Congress is getting back in the game when it comes to overseeing \nthis fairly substantial increase in arms sales to our named partners in \nthe Middle East, but I think there is a better way forward. I hope that \nSenator Paul and others, as we start to go about doing due diligence on \nfuture sales, will take a look at maybe a more meaningful contribution \nthis body can take rather than expressing our outright unconditional \ndisapproval. How can we make sure, if these arms sales go forward, that \nthey go forward with conditions attached that are in the best interest \nof the United States and our partner nations?\n  Again, I thank Senators Corker and Cardin for their important work in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, and I thank \nSenator Paul for having the courage to bring this resolution to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, let me first of all thank my colleague \nfrom the State of Connecticut for his comments. I, too, will be joining \nhim and others in supporting the resolution to be brought forward in \nsome moments by Senator Paul. I, too, agree that this is a rather blunt \ninstrument. A more strategic use of bringing some leverage to this kind \nof action would be a more appropriate path, and I hope that in future \ntimes, when we have a chance to review foreign arms sales, we will take \nthat more nuanced approach.\n  Madam President, while I approve of much of what the Senator from \nConnecticut has said, I want to speak to this issue from a slightly \ndifferent perspective, and that is the message that at least \ninadvertently we will be sending with approval of the sale of these \njets. And let me again commend Senator Corker and Senator Cardin for \nappropriately looking at the issue of public financing of these sales. \nIf we move forward with these sales without putting some markers down, \nI think we potentially not only do damage to holding Pakistan's feet to \nthe fire in terms of the threat of terrorists in Afghanistan and \nelsewhere in the region but also potentially do damage to one of the \nmost important relationships our country has, and that is the strategic \nrelationship between the United States and India. This relationship has \nbeen one of enormous, growing importance. India has been a valuable and \nstrategic partner of the United States and is a tremendous ally in \npromoting global peace and security. That has not always been the case. \nRelations between our two nations have been steadily improving over the \npast decade, ranging from approval on the Civilian Nuclear Agreement, \nto frequent coordination between our militaries, and at this point over \n$100 billion in bilateral trade. Prime Minister Modi in India has made \na personal commitment to improving the ties between the United States \nand India. The Prime Minister\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\nwill come back to the United States at the end of this month.\n  Nowhere is the potential for our strategic relationship greater than \nin our bilateral defense relationship, which again has seen great \nprogress over the past decade. Last year our two nations signed the \nframework that will advance military-to-military exchanges. We are also \nproceeding with joint development of defense technology, which seeks to \nincrease defense sales and to create a cooperative technology and \nindustrial relationship that can promote both capabilities in the \nUnited States and in India.\n  I viewed with some concern last month when the administration \nannounced the sale of these eight F-16s to Pakistan. And again I want \nto commend the leadership of the Foreign Relations Committee for making \nvery clear that even if this sale should go forward, the financing of \nthis sale is still subject to further American review.\n  What brings me to wanting to support Senator Paul's resolution is the \nfact that as recently as January of this year, Pakistani-based \nterrorists claimed responsibility for an attack against an Indian \nmilitary base at Pathankot. The attack on this air force base, which \nresulted in the killing of Indian military forces, was a great tragedy. \nSo far, Pakistan has refused to share intelligence or to turn over \nthose suspects to the Indian Government.\n  With those kinds of actions, I cannot go ahead and continue this \npolicy where we continue, in effect, to give Pakistan a pass, whether \nit is actions in the region vis-a-vis Afghanistan or within their own \ncountry but also in terms of their unwillingness to meet India even \nhalfway in terms of trying to bring a greater stability to one of the \nregions that could potentially become a tinderbox in terms of the \nborder regions between India and Pakistan.\n  So I will be supporting Senator Paul's resolution. I hope the \nGovernment of Pakistan hears the concern of this Senator and other \nSenators. I hope they will act aggressively in terms of bringing \njustice to those terrorists who invaded Indian space and attacked the \nIndian Air Force base. Showing that kind of responsible behavior might \nlead to at least this Senator taking a different view in terms of \nfuture military sales.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I recognize my colleague, who I \nbelieve will bring this resolution to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1422-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1422-S1424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MOTION TO DISCHARGE--S.J. RES. 31\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act of \n1976, I move to discharge the Committee on Foreign Relations from \nfurther consideration of S.J. Res. 31, relating to the disapproval of \nthe proposed foreign military sale to the Government of Pakistan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable for up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the American \ntaxpayers being forced to pay for fighter jets for Pakistan. Over $300 \nmillion from the American taxpayers will be designated to go to \nPakistan to pay for eight new F-16s for Pakistan. We have a lot of \nproblems here in our country, my friends. We have a lot of things going \non in our country that need to be taken care of, and we don't have \nenough money to be sending it to Pakistan. I can't in good conscience \nlook away as America crumbles at home and politicians tax us to send \nthe money to corrupt and duplicitous regimes abroad.\n  When I travel across Kentucky and I see the look of despair in the \neyes of out-of-work coal miners, when I see the anguish in the faces of \nthose who live in constant poverty, I wonder why the establishment of \nboth parties continues to send our money overseas to countries that \ntake our money, take our arms, and laugh in our faces.\n  We have given $15 billion to Pakistan--$15 billion over the last \ndecade--yet their previous President admits that Pakistan armed, aided, \nand abetted the Taliban. You remember the Taliban in Afghanistan that \nharbored and hosted bin Laden for a decade? Pakistan helped them. \nPakistan was one of only two countries that recognized the Taliban. Why \nin the world would we be taxing the American people to send this money \nto Pakistan?\n  Remember when bin Laden escaped? We chased him and he escaped. Where \ndid he go? To Pakistan. He lived for a decade in Pakistan. Where? About \na mile away from their military academy. Somehow they missed him. There \nin a 15-foot-high walled compound, bin Laden stayed in Pakistan while \nwe funneled billions upon billions of dollars to them.\n  Pakistan to this day is said to look away, to not look at the Haqqani \nnetwork. In fact, it is accused that many members of their government \nare complicit with the Haqqani network. Who is the Haqqani network? It \nis a network of terrorists who kill Americans. We have American \nsoldiers dying at the hands of Pakistani terrorists while that \ngovernment looks the other way.\n  GEN John F. Campbell testified before Congress that the Haqqani \nnetwork remains the most capable threat to U.S. forces in Afghanistan. \nYet we are asked to send F-16s and good money after bad to a government \nin Pakistan that looks the other way.\n  Pakistan is, at best, a frenemy--part friend and a lot enemy. If \nPakistan truly wants to be our ally, if Pakistan truly wants to help in \nthe war on radical Islam, it should not require a bribe; it should not \nrequire the American taxpayer to subsidize arms sales. They already \nhave 70 F-16s. They have an air force of F-16s. What would happen if we \ndidn't send them eight more that we are being asked to pay for? Maybe \nthey would listen. Maybe they would help us. Maybe they would be an \nhonest broker in the fight against terrorism.\n  We are $19 trillion in debt. We borrow $1 million a minute. We don't \nhave any money to send to Pakistan to bribe them to buy planes from us. \nWe don't have the money. We have problems at home. Our infrastructure \ncrumbles at home. We have longstanding poverty at home. We have \nproblems in America, and we can't afford to borrow the money from China \nto send it to Pakistan.\n  In my State, in Kentucky, we have a dozen counties with unemployment \nnearly double the national rate. In Magoffin County, KY, 12.5 percent \nof people are out of work. Today, those who will vote to send money to \nPakistan need to come with me to Kentucky. They need to come to \nMagoffin County, and they need to look people in the face who are out \nof work in America and explain to them why we should send money to \nPakistan. We have people hurting here at home.\n\n  In Harlan, the President's war on coal has led to longstanding \ndouble-digit unemployment. In Harlan, KY, people are out of work. \nPeople live in poverty, and they don't understand why Congress is \nsending money to Pakistan.\n  In Leslie County, high unemployment prompts their citizens to ask: \nWhy? Why is the government spending billions of dollars for advanced \nfighter jets for foreigners? They don't understand it. They can't \nunderstand, when they live from day to day, why their government is \nsending money to Pakistan.\n  As I travel around Kentucky, I ask my constituents: Should America \nsend money and arms to a country that persecutes Christians? I have yet \nto meet a single voter who wants their tax dollars going to countries \nthat persecute Christians.\n  In Pakistan, it is the law; it is in their Constitution that if you \ncriticize the state religion, you can be put to death. Asia Bibi has \nbeen on death row for nearly 5 years. Asia Bibi is a Christian. Her \ncrime? She went to the well to draw water, and the villagers began to \nstone her. They beat her with sticks until she was bleeding. They \ncontinued to stone her as they chanted ``Death, death to the \nChristian.''\n  The police finally arrived, and she thought she had been saved, only \nto be arrested by the Pakistani police. There she sits on death row for \n5 years. Is it an ally? Is it a civilized nation that puts Christians \nto death for criticizing the state religion? I defy any Member of this \nbody to go home and talk to the first voter. Go outside the Beltway. \nLeave Congress and drive outside the Beltway and stop at the first gas \nstation or stop at the first grocery store\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\nand ask anybody--Republican, Democrat, or Independent: Should we be \nsending money to a country that persecutes Christians?\n  Asia Bibi sits on death row for criticizing the state religion, and \nyour money goes to support her government. What will happen to Pakistan \nif they don't get eight more F-16s? They will have only 70 F-16s.\n  Most of the politicians here simply don't care. They don't care \nwhether Pakistan persecutes Christians. They know only one way. The one \nway is to open our wallet and bleed us dry and hope that someday \nPakistan will change its behavior. Guess what. If you are not strong \nenough to vote for this resolution, if you think some kind of cajoling, \nflattery, and nice talk with empty words are going to change the \nbehavior of Pakistan, you have another thought coming. It has been \ngoing on for decades.\n  When I forced a vote in the Foreign Relations Committee to say that \ncountries which put Christians to death for criticizing the state \nreligion--there are about 34 of these countries, a couple of dozen of \nthem who received money from us, American tax dollars going to \ncountries that persecute Christians. When I introduced the amendment to \nsay: Guess what. Let's not do it anymore. Any country that has a law \nthat compels a Christian and puts a Christian to death, that country \nwould no longer receive our money. Do you know what the vote was? It \nwas 18 to 2 from Washington politicians to keep sending good money \nafter bad because they say: Oh, the moderates there are going to change \ntheir minds someday.\n  We have given them $15 billion, and I see no evidence of change in \nbehavior. I see insolence, arrogance, and people who laugh as they cash \nour checks.\n  Is Pakistan our ally in the War on Terror? Well, not only did they \nhelp the Taliban that hosted Bin Laden for a decade, but when they \nfinally got Bin Laden, we got him with evidence that was given to us by \na doctor in Pakistan. His name is Shakil Afridi. Where is he now? \nPakistan has locked him away in a dark, dank prison from which he will \nprobably never be released.\n  Shakil Afridi has essentially been given a life sentence by Pakistan \nfor the crime of helping the United States and helping all civilized \nnations get to Bin Laden. He sat under the noses of the Pakistani \nGovernment for a decade. We finally got him when Shakil Afridi helped \nus.\n  People aren't going to continue to help America if we don't help \nthem, if we don't protect our human intelligence, if we don't protect \nthose who are willing to help America. He sits and rots in a prison. \nWhat message do we send to Pakistan if we send them eight more F-16s \nand we tell you, the American taxpayer, you are paying for it? What \nmessage does that send to Pakistan? The message to Pakistan is that we \nwill just keep thumbing our nose at America, we will keep cashing their \nchecks, and we will laugh all the way to the bank as we do nothing to \nrelease the Christians on death row or to release the doctor who helped \nus.\n  Should we give planes to a country that imprisons these heroes--\nheroes who helped and put their lives on the line for our country?\n  Today we will vote on whether the American taxpayers should foot the \nbill. I have yet to meet a voter in my State of Kentucky or across \nAmerica who thinks it is a good idea to send more money to Pakistan. We \nhave a $19-trillion debt. We borrow $1 million a minute. We have no \nmoney. It is not even a surplus. They say we are going to influence \nPakistan or they may rise up and say: Oh, the resolution will not stop \nthe money. The heck it will not. If my resolution passes, if it becomes \nlaw, the eight jets will not go to Pakistan, they will not be \nsubsidized, and not one penny of American tax dollars will go to \nPakistan. That is the absolute truth. No matter what they tell you, \nthis stops the sale. It stops the subsidy.\n  We have to borrow money from China to send it to Pakistan. Such a \npolicy is insane and supported by no one outside of Washington. You go \nanywhere in America and ask them: Should we give money? Should the \ntaxpayer be forced to give money to Pakistan, a country that persecutes \nChristians? Nobody is for it. Yet the vast and out-of-touch \nestablishment in Washington continues to do it. Is it any wonder that \npeople are unhappy with Washington? Is it any wonder that Americans are \nsick and tired of the status quo, sick and tired of people not \nlistening to them?\n  We have no money in the Treasury. We are all out of money. This \ninfluences nothing, other than to tell the Pakistanis they can continue \ndoing what they want. I urge my colleagues to vote against subsidized \nsales of fighter jets to Pakistan.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Can the Chair tell me how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator has used 14 minutes.\n  Mr. PAUL. So I have 16 remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few remarks about \nthis resolution of disapproval.\n  While I oppose this measure, I share the junior Senator from \nKentucky's frustration with some aspects of our relationship with \nPakistan. Notably, I think the jailing of Dr. Shakil Afridi for 23 \nyears under highly questionable charges is an outrage.\n  For those of you who don't remember, Dr. Afridi helped the United \nStates locate Osama bin Laden. His approach may have been debatable, \nbut one thing is clear--he doesn't deserve to languish in a Pakistani \njail for more than two decades on manufactured charges.\n  I have also been troubled by the Pakistani military and intelligence \nservice's support for militant groups that work against U.S. interests \nin the region. In fact, I would argue that many of these groups are \nalso working against the long term interests of our friends in Pakistan \nas well, as evidenced by its own domestic terrorist problem.\n  I am also concerned that, despite important foreign aid given to \nPakistan, there remains a troubling failure to address basic and urgent \ndevelopment needs--particularly education and schooling for girls. We \nalso see continued cases of extreme religious intolerance, including \ndeath sentences for dubious charges of blasphemy.\n  At the same time, I also want to take a moment to acknowledge that \nPakistan has suffered horrible losses in taking on militant groups \nwithin its own borders--something I don't think we always recognize.\n  And most importantly, I want to stress the importance of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee--let's allow it to do its work and \nthoroughly consider this resolution first, rather than rush it through \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nbe yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to table the motion to discharge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I would like to address a very \nimportant issue, which is the right for American citizens to know what \nis in their food. I am going to be talking about the topic of \ngenetically modified ingredients in food. I will be pointing out that \nthere are genetic modifications that are largely considered to have \nbeen beneficial and others that are largely considered to be causing \nsignificant challenges. In both cases, there is science to bring to \nbear around the benefits and there is science to bring to bear around \nthe disadvantages. Ultimately, I will conclude--to give a preface \nhere--that this is not a debate about the pros and cons. There is \ninformation on both sides, different aspects. What is at debate is \nwhether our Federal Government wants to be the large, overbearing \npresence in the lives of Americans and tell them what to think, or \nwhether we believe in our citizens' ability to use their own minds and \nmake their own decisions. To be able to do that, they have to be able \nto know when there are genetically modified ingredients in the foods \nthey are consuming.\n  Let's start with the point that there are significant benefits from \nvarious GM modified plants. One example is golden rice. Golden rice, as \nseen here, has been modified in order to produce a lot more vitamin A. \nSo growing this in an area where there is a vitamin A deficiency has \nbeen beneficial to the help of local populations.\n  Let's take, for example, a certain form of carrot. It has been \nmodified to produce an enzyme that helps rid the body of fatty \nsubstances. When you can't do that, you have Gaucher's disease. We have \na lot of trouble with Gaucher's disease, with brain and bone damage, \nanemia, and bruises. But through the modification of these carrots, \nthere is a solution, and should you be afflicted with Gaucher's \ndisease, you would be very happy about that.\n  Let's take another example. These are sweet potatoes that have been \nmodified to resist a number of viral infections common in South Africa. \nSo a place where otherwise you may not be able to grow these sweet \npotatoes, where the local population might not be able to benefit from \nnutrition in these sweet potatoes, they can now do so. These are some \nof the examples of some of the benefits that have come from some forms \nof genetic modification of plants.\n  But just as there is science that shows benefits, there is also \nscience showing concerns. I am going to start by explaining that the \nlargest modification in America--the largest deployed modification--is \nto make plants such as corn, soybeans, and sugar beets resistant to an \nherbicide called glyphosate.\n  The use of glyphosate has increased dramatically over the last two \ndecades. In 1994 we are talking about 7.4 million pounds--not very \nmuch. But by 2012, we are talking about 160 million pounds of this \nherbicide being put onto our crops.\n  Well, one's reaction may be this: OK, but is there any downside to \nthat massive deployment of herbicides? Yes, in fact, there is. This \nherbicide is so efficient in killing weeds that it kills milkweed. \nWell, milkweed happens to grow in disturbed soil. So it has been a \ncommon companion to our agricultural world. Milkweed is the single \nsubstance that monarch butterflies feed on. So as the glyphosate \nexpansion has increased over this time period, the monarch butterfly \nhas radically decreased because its food supply has been dramatically \nreduced. This is not the only factor considered to affect the Monarch \nbutterfly, but it is an example of a significant factor. That is \nsomething of which you think: What else could happen in the natural \nworld as a result of changing dramatically the variety of plants that \nsurround our farm fields?\n  Let's turn to another impact. Millions of pounds of glyphosate go on \nthe fields, and much of it ends up running off the fields and running \ninto our streams and rivers. It is an herbicide. So it has a profound \nimpact on the makeup of organisms in those streams and rivers.\n  For example, it can have an impact on microorganisms, algae, and \nthings that feed on that up the food chain--fish, mussels, amphibians, \nand so forth. We don't understand all the impacts of massive amounts of \nherbicides in our streams and rivers, but scientists are saying: Yes, \nthere is an impact. Studies are underway to understand those impacts \nmore thoroughly. Of course, we care about the health of our streams and \nrivers.\n  Let's take another example. Sometimes you just can't fool Mother \nNature. One impact of the massive application of glyphosate is that \nweeds start to develop a resistance to it, and then you have to start \nto use more of it. Also, that is true in a different sphere. I am \ntalking about a particular genetic modification that goes into the \ncells of plants and is designed to fend off the western corn rootworm.\n  The western corn rootworm eats corn when it is in the larvae stage--\nthat is the worm stage--and it does so when it is in the beetle stage. \nSome beautiful examples are shown here. It can eat the pollination part \nof the corn so that the corn doesn't produce healthy kernels as well. \nIt can eat the leaves. It pretty much loves the entire corn plant.\n  This genetic modification produces a pesticide inside the cell and \nwas in the beginning very effective in killing these corn rootworms. \nBut guess what. Mother Nature has a continuous stream of genetic \nmutations, and if you apply this to millions and millions of acres and \nmillions of pounds, eventually Mother Nature produces a mutation that \nmakes it immune to this pesticide. Then those immune rootworms start \nmultiplying, and you have to start applying a pesticide again, and \nmaybe you have to apply even more than before because they develop a \nresistance to it. That is exactly what is happening here. So that is a \nsignificant reverberation.\n  All I am trying to point out here is that this is not really an \nargument about science. Science can tell us that there have been \noccasions in which genetic modifications have had an initial beneficial \nimpact, and science will tell us that there are situations in which the \nreverberations of using the genetically modified plants are having a \nnegative impact. So that is where it stands. It is like any other \ntechnology. It can be beneficial. It can be harmful.\n  So the question is this: Does our government--the big hand of the \nFederal Government--reach out and say to our cities, our counties, and \nour States that there is only one answer to this and that is why we are \ngoing to ban you from letting citizens know what is in their food. Of \ncourse, there is no one answer. We have seen there are benefits and \nthere are disadvantages. Quite frankly, I think it is just wrong for \nthe Federal Government to take away our citizens' right to know. That \nis why I am doing all I can to publicize this at this moment.\n  Various States have wrestled on whether to provide information to \ncitizens so that the citizens can decide on their own whether they have \na product that has genetically modified ingredients. Most of our food \nproducts do because virtually all of our corn, sugar beets, and \nsoybeans are genetically modified, but citizens can look at what type \nof genetic modification. They can respond and use their minds with \ninformation.\n\n  This is really what is beautiful in democracy. Government doesn't \nmake up your mind for you. Government doesn't impose a certain \nframework in which you have to view the world.\n  Yet, right now, at this very moment, there are a group of Senators in \nthis\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\nbody who want to impose those blinders on you, American citizens. They \nwant to tell you how to think. They are supporting a bill that says the \nFederal Government will take one side of this argument and tell you it \nis the truth and spend your tax dollars publicizing it. This is the \ntype of propaganda machine that you would expect outside of a democracy \nbut not here in the ``we the people'' government of the United States \nof America--not here, where we value our citizens' ability to make \ntheir own choices. So it is very important that we wake up quickly and \nrespond to this, because the simple truth is a group of very powerful \ncompanies are working right now to get a bill passed that will take \naway our citizens' right to know about GM ingredients in their \nproducts. This bill is called the DARK Act, or the Deny Americans the \nRight to Know Act, and it has passed out of committee. The majority \nleader has said it is a priority for him to put the DARK Act on the \nfloor of this Senate next week with virtually no notice to the United \nStates of America.\n  Most of these positions percolate inside committees for a length of \ntime and then get digested on the floor for a length of time. But, no, \nthere is an effort to slam this through--this imposition on the right \nto know in America. That is just absolutely wrong.\n  Now let me talk a little bit about how American citizens feel about \nthis. There was a survey done at the end of 2015, just a couple of \nmonths ago. This was a nationwide survey of likely 2016 election voters \ndone in November of 2015.\n  The question that was asked of the participants was this: As you may \nknow, it has been proposed that the Food and Drug Administration, or \nthe FDA, require foods that have been genetically engineered or contain \ngenetically engineered ingredients to be labeled to indicate that. \nWould you favor or oppose requiring labels for foods that have been \ngenetically engineered or contain genetically engineered ingredients?\n  After the respondent gives the answer, then the follow-up question is \nthis: Is that strongly or not so strongly? Well, 89 percent of \nAmericans say they favor mandatory labels on foods that have \ngenetically modified ingredients. That is powerful. That is nine 9 of \n10 Americans.\n  Furthermore, 77 percent of the respondents said that they not only \nfavor mandatory labels but they strongly favor the proposal. Now, this \nis very unusual to have nine Americans line up on one side versus one \non the other.\n  Is this something that has to do with party affiliation? Absolutely \nnot. Across the great spectrum of ideologies in America, citizens agree \nin this poll, with 89 percent of Independents--the same as overall--84 \npercent of Republicans, and 92 percent of Democrats. In other words, \nregardless of party, basically 9 out of 10 individuals say the same \nthing on the right, on the left, and in the middle.\n  Well, that should be listened to up here on Capitol Hill because we \nare intended by constitutional design to be a ``we the people'' \ngovernment, not the government of, by, and for powerful ag companies. \nIf you want to serve in that kind of government, go to some other \ncountry because that is not the design of our Constitution.\n  Our responsibility is to the people of America. They don't like Big \nGovernment trying to tell them how to think, and that is why this DARK \nAct is just wrong.\n  There are some ideas floating around this building today. One of \nthose ideas is, well, we will put a label on a food product that will \nbe just a phone number, and if you, the citizen, want to know details \nabout this product--whether it contains genetically modified \ningredients--well, you can ring up this phone number and maybe somebody \nwill answer your question. You can call the company, and the company \nwill tell you what they think about their product.\n  Well, first, Americans don't want to stand there in the grocery store \nand start making phone calls to companies. Can you imagine, you are \nstanding there--and you actually care about whether there is a GMO in \nthis product. You are going to make a phone call. You are going to wait \nwhile you go through a telephone tree. You are probably going to have \nto speak to somebody overseas who may not even understand what you are \nasking, or you get a company spokesman who is going to lay out the \ncompany line and never really give you an answer. Why should you have \nto do that?\n  Think about the parallel situation. We have all these other \ningredients on the package. We include things such as sea salt as \nopposed to salt. We have preservatives. We have colors that are \nincorporated into the food because people want to know about the \ncolors, the food dyes that have gone into the food. They want to know \nabout the preservatives that have gone into the food.\n  We even tell companies that on the label they have to tell the \nconsumer whether the fish has been caught in the wild or raised on a \nfarm. Why do we require that label? Well, we require that label because \ncitizens want to know about the ingredients in their food--in this \ncase, the makeup of their fish, because it is different. There are \ndifferent farming practices between catching wild salmon and raising \nsalmon on a farm, in a pond, or in an ocean-contained area. There are \ndifferent impacts. Citizens care about that, so we require it to be \ndisclosed.\n  We require our juice companies to say whether the juice is fresh or \nreconstituted. Why do we provide that information? Why do we require \nthat? Because citizens want to know. There is a difference between the \ntwo products, and they want to know. It is their right to know what \nthey put into their own bodies, what they feed to their families, what \ntheir children consume. It is their right to know. Again, 9 out of 10 \nAmericans say this is important to them.\n  This telephone idea is just the worst possible scam. Let's put it \nfrankly. Nobody is going to stand there comparing soups, making phone \ncall after phone call after phone call. Nobody who wants to know if \nthere is high fructose corn syrup in their food is going to stand \nthere, look at a can, and dial phone number after phone number. That is \nwhy it is printed on the label. That makes it very simple.\n  There is another idea floating around here: Put a computer code on \nthe product, and people can scan it with their smartphone and get \ninformation. Well, this may be even more ludicrous than the phone idea \nin terms of stripping the power of American citizens' right to know. \nFirst, you have to be in the grocery store, and here are the different \ncans of soup you are going to compare. Oh, let me take a picture of the \nfirst one with my phone. Oh, OK, now I have to go to the Web site. I am \ntaking a picture of the bar code, and I am going to go to the Web site. \nOK, which page of this Web site do I go to? Oh, look, this Web site was \nwritten by the company that makes it.\n  They are making it hard for this information to be found. They are \nmaking it hard for this to be understood. They are not disclosing the \ndetails of the type of genetic modification. Well, that is absurd. Can \nany Member of this Chamber really tell me--can you stand and tell me \nthat you are going to take pictures of 10 different products while your \nchild is sitting in your grocery cart? And that is just to buy one \nthing on your grocery list. Does anyone here want to stand and claim \nthey would do that? I think the silence speaks for itself.\n  Certainly we are in a situation where people don't want to take \npictures of these codes with their cell phones because it reveals \ninformation about them that the companies collect on them. Why should \nthey have to give up their privacy to know about an ingredient in their \nfood?\n  Let's be clear. There are two scams being discussed right now by the \nmajority leaders of this Chamber, this esteemed Chamber which should \nstand for free speech and knowledge, not suppressed speech and lack of \nknowledge. They want to send you down this rabbit hole of 800 numbers \nor this blind alley of computer bar codes rather than a simple \nindication on a package.\n  Let's recognize that this is a pretty easy problem to resolve because \nmost of the world has figured it out--64 other countries, 28 members of \nthe European Union, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. They all have a \nsimple disclosure on the package, a consumer-friendly phrase or symbol. \nThat symbol is straightforward. There is no smokescreen. There is no \nblind alley. There is no rabbit hole. There is no cleverness\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nover an 800 number or a bar code or another computer code called a \nquick response code. No, they simply give the information, the way we \ndo on everything else, the way we do on preservatives, food colorings, \ncore ingredients, wild-caught fish versus farm fish, and juice from \nconcentrate versus fresh juice. They make it simple. They just have a \nsimple marking on the package.\n\n  Do you know who else provides this simple information to their \nconsumers? China. Do our citizens deserve less information than the \nChinese, who live in a dictatorship? Why are Members of this Chamber \ntrying to strip more information away from American citizens than does \nthe dictatorship of China? That is just wrong.\n  There is an easy solution here. There are a number of reasonable \narguments that Big Agriculture is making. They say: Look, we do not \nwant 50 States producing 50 different label standards.\n  I absolutely agree.\n  They say: We don't want a bunch of counties and cities producing yet \nother label standards; that could go into the thousands.\n  Fair point.\n  One common way of doing this would make sense. You cannot have a \nwarehouse that is serving three or four different States or multiple \ncommunities that need to have this product sorted and distributed, one \ngroup to here and one group to there. You can't keep it all straight. \nIt is expensive. There are all these different labels. It is confusing. \nThat is a fair point. I agree. Let's do one 50-State solution.\n  The industry says: We don't want anything pejorative. We don't want \nanything that says GM is scary or GM is bad.\n  I pointed out that there are some advantages to genetic modifications \nand there are some disadvantages. So I agree there too. Let's not put a \nmarking on a package that is pejorative.\n  The industry says: We don't want anything on the front of the \npackage. It takes up space. It may suggest there is something scary \nabout this if you are putting it on the front of the package.\n  OK, fair enough. Let's not put it on the front of the package. I \ncompletely accept that point.\n  The industry says: There are several different ways we could do this. \nWe would like flexibility.\n  Absolutely. Let's have flexibility.\n  So I have put together a bill which hits all these key points the \nfood industry has raised. It is a 50-State solution. There is nothing \non the front of the package. There is nothing pejorative. And it gives \nthe type of flexibility the industry has talked about.\n  Under the bill I have put forward, they are allowed to put initials \nbehind an ingredient in parentheses or to put an asterisk on the \ningredient and put an explanation below or to put in a phrase--as \nCampbell Soup plans to do--that simply says: This product contains \ngenetically modified ingredients. Campbell Soup is planning to do that \nbecause they say they want a relationship of full integrity with their \ncustomers. Shouldn't we all be for full integrity with our citizens? \nDoesn't that make a lot of sense?\n  Yet another option would be to put a simple symbol--any symbol chosen \nby the FDA, so certainly not one that suggests there is anything \npejorative about it. Brazil uses a little ``t.'' OK, how about a little \n``t'' in a triangle or in a box or something else that the FDA or the \nfood companies would like?\n  The point is, if someone cares enough to pick up a package, turn it \nover, and look at the fine print on the ingredients, if they care \nenough to look, just as they might care enough to look up whether there \nis high fructose corn syrup, just as they might care enough to see if \nthere are peanuts in it because they have a peanut allergy, or just \nbecause they want to look at the ingredients to see how many calories \nare in a product, if they care enough to pick it up and turn it over, a \nlittle symbol--all of those options are available under this type of \nreasonable compromise. It would appear on each product involved in \ninterstate commerce. OK, so that is consistent, and that is a point \nmade. It is clear. These symbols are clear.\n  The public that cares get educated. They know what to look for. It is \neasy to find. It is right there on the package. There is no sending you \noff on a wild goose chase through a phone tree and an 800 number. There \nis no proceeding to tell you that you have to use a smartphone, which \nmany people don't have. They might not even have reception to be able \nto use it effectively if they wanted to. No. It is a simple, \nstraightforward phrase or initials right there on the ingredients \npackage. What could be more appropriate than the simplicity of that?\n  Many folks have stepped forward to say this makes tremendous sense. \nCampbell Soup said: Yes, we endorse this. This makes sense. Also, \nNature's Path, Stonyfield, Ben & Jerry's, Amy's Kitchen, Consumers \nUnion, the American Association for Justice, the National Sustainable \nAgriculture Coalition, and the Just Label It coalition.\n  Yes, OK, that is fine, we are not asking for something on the front \nof the package. It doesn't have to be on the front. It doesn't have to \nbe scary. It can be in that tiny print on the ingredients page. When an \nearnest, sincere citizen wants to know, they have the right to know in \na consumer-friendly fashion.\n  I particularly thank the Senators who have already signed on to \nendorse this legislation: Senator Leahy and Senator Bernie Sanders, who \ncome from Vermont, which has a State labeling bill that would be \npreempted by this bill. It would be replaced by this 50-State national \nstandard. But because this is a fair standard for consumers, they are \nendorsing this bill. I also thank Senator Tester of Montana, Senator \nFeinstein of California, Senator Murphy of Connecticut, Senator \nGillibrand of New York, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut, Senator \nBoxer of California, Senator Markey of Massachusetts, and Senator \nHeinrich of New Mexico. All parts of the country, different parts of \nthe country, and they are all saying: You know what, our citizens, 9 to \n1, want a simple, fair statement or symbol on the ingredients list. \nThat is just the right way to go.\n  If you are going to step on the authority of States to provide \ninformation that citizens want, you have to provide a simple, clear, \nindication on the package. That is the deal. That is the fair \ncompromise. That is standing up for citizens' right to know. That is \nhonoring the public interest. That is a compromise in the classic sense \nthat works for the big issues the companies are talking about. They \ndon't want the expense from individual States and they don't want the \ncomplexity and confusion from individual States. What consumers want is \na simple indication on the package.\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's not be worse than China and block our \nconsumers from having access to information. Let's do the right thing \nthat virtually every developed country has done and provide a simple, \nclear system for citizens to be able to know what is in their food.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to \nthe floor and talk a little about the ongoing dialogue we are having on \nthe Supreme Court nomination.\n  Before I start this speech, I wanted to comment on something for \nthose who think all we do is fight here. I think the Presiding Officer \nwas at our bipartisan lunch. I think it is a great opportunity. So \noften we see the debate on the floor and the dialogue in the committee \nrooms, but we take the opportunity every month or so and Democrats and \nRepublicans come together and we enjoy each other's company. We talk a \nlittle about policy but more about the folks back home. So I just \nwanted to let the American people know that because we happen to have \ndifferences, it doesn't mean we don't like and respect so many of our \ncolleagues.\n  Today, though, I am talking about something that is a point of \ncontention between Democrats and Republicans, and it relates to the \nopen Supreme Court seat as a result of the tragic passing of Justice \nScalia. Originally, I was going to come to the floor and provide a \nspeech I had prepared, but I was in the Judiciary Committee today and I \ndecided--probably against my staff's wishes--to deviate a little from \nthe script and to talk about some of the facts that were put forth in \nthe Judiciary Committee today.\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\n  One of the arguments we hear from Members of the Democratic Party is \nthat somehow the Supreme Court has been shut down. That couldn't be \nfurther from the truth. Actually, since the passing of Justice Scalia, \nthere have been some 12 arguments heard in the Supreme Court and 5 \nopinions. There will be several more.\n  As a matter of fact, over the course of history there have been a \nnumber of instances where the Supreme Court has had Justices recuse \nthemselves or Justices go on a leave of absence for another duty. So \nthere have been a number of instances where the Court continues to \nfunction just fine with eight, and sometimes even fewer than eight, \nJustices active in any given opinion. So to say for some reason until \nwe make an appointment to the Supreme Court that the Supreme Court is \ngoing to cease to function defies the facts.\n  As a matter of fact, in the October 2014 session--the Supreme Court \nhas two sessions, the first half of the year and the second half of the \nyear. In October of 2014, there were 72 arguments heard before the \nSupreme Court. There were only 18 of them that actually were divided \nalong ideological lines within the Court. So three-fourths of all the \ncases in 2014 were actually settled with significant numbers of people \njoining together to render an opinion. So the Court is working just \nfine, and it will continue to work just fine.\n  I would also argue that the idea put forth by some Members that the \nSupreme Court is suddenly going to be shut down for a year defies logic \nand history. The Supreme Court is already in session. They will go \nthrough probably the end of June or the beginning of July. There is no \npossible way, under normal circumstances, that we would have time to \nappoint a Supreme Court Justice who would be participating in this \nterm. So what we are really talking about is the October term. If the \nOctober term of this year bears any resemblance to the October term of \n2014, there may be 5 or 10 cases where the 9-member Court would be \nmaterial. The vast majority of them are going to move through. That is \nwhy this idea of shutting down the third branch of government is \ndisingenuous and really supporting a political agenda and less about \nwhether the government is functioning properly.\n  The other thing I wanted to talk about before I get into some of the \nreasons I do not support nomination proceedings going through under \nPresident Obama is related to some history. Before I get to the history \nthat specifically relates to the constitutional obligation of the \nSenate, the Senate rules, and maybe some of the positions that have \nbeen taken by Members of the minority in the past, I also want to talk \nabout one other area that concerns me in this dialogue.\n  There has been a discussion about the backroom meetings, making the \ndecisions. Well, members meet oftentimes--we tend to meet the majority \nof the time--in public settings, but members got together and we \ndecided to come up with a policy that was a clear position that the \nmajority of the members of the Judiciary Committee--and the majority of \nthe members are today Republicans--that we were going to take on the \nnomination. We all agreed--all 11 of us--that we are not going to move \nforward with the nomination.\n  They can call it a backroom deal, but whether you would argue that is \nan improper practice, what I found interesting is that members of the \nJudiciary Committee who brought this up did something that I think was \na profound show of disrespect to this institution. It happened a few \nyears ago, when in a back room the leader of the then-majority, Senator \nReid, convinced all the members of the Democratic conference to vote on \nthe nuclear option. The nuclear option is--well, it is great I guess \nfor TV--but structurally the nuclear option is that throughout decades \nthere was a 60-vote threshold for moving nominations through the Senate \nunless you had consensus to hold it down to 51 votes. In a back room, \nthe then-majority leader, Senator Reid, convinced his conference to \ncome to this floor and break the rules to change the rules in order to \nprevent the minority from being able to weigh in on judicial \nnominations and a number of other nominations. In fact, after that rule \nwas passed, after that decision was made in a back room and after those \nfolks came to the floor and broke the rules to change the rules, they \nended up confirming judges without any input from the then-minority \nRepublicans.\n  So when people want to stand up here and say that somehow what we did \nwas different, this is one nomination. This is a decision we made about \none nomination, but we have a group of people--every single person on \nthe Judiciary Committee, in fact, who are in the Democratic conference, \nvoted to deny the minority from having what has been a decades-old \ntradition in the Senate to have the minority weigh in on nominations.\n  I would now like to get to some of the other discussions. First off, \nwe have to recognize we are in the throes of the primary season for the \nPresidential nomination. It would be very difficult to live in the \nUnited States and not know a little about the primary that is going on. \nThe people are in a position where, over a very few short months, they \nare going to make a decision. They are going to voice their vote, and \nI, for one, think the people should be allowed to weigh into this \ndecision. I do believe many of the Senators on the other side of the \naisle have felt the same way. In fact, I will go through a couple of \nquotes where they made it very clear. In fact, they are very trained \nand very articulate and can probably voice their position--which now is \nmy position--better than I ever could.\n  One thing that comes up in this discussion is our constitutional \nobligation, and that is the obligation to advise and consent. Keep in \nmind, the advice and consent is not a constitutional obligation for the \nSenate to rubberstamp the decisions of the President. Quite the \ncontrary. The whole idea of the three branches was to have certain \nchecks and balances in place. So there absolutely was no concept on the \npart of the Founding Fathers to say when the President makes a \ndecision, the Congress will rubberstamp that decision. We then have an \nequal authority to determine whether that nomination will come to a \nnominations process or we will simply decide not to take up the \nnomination.\n  Now, a lot of people think that is a new concept, but the reality is, \nit is a concept that has been in place for many years in the Senate \nrules. For people to say we always dispose of nominations in the term \nwe are in defies the existence of this rule, which simply says: Should \nthe Senate choose not to take up a nomination, then the next President \nwill put forth another nomination for consideration.\n  Again, I think people are finessing what our responsibilities are and \nwhether this is really something different or something that wasn't \nanticipated by the people who have come before us and who established \nthe rules that govern the Senate.\n  I want to talk a little about what I think must be a very \nuncomfortable place for some Members of the minority to be; that is, \ntheir own history on the current situation in the Senate. We are in the \nmiddle of a campaign. We are in the middle of a tough campaign on both \nsides of the aisle, whether it is the Democratic primary or the \nRepublican primary. People are engaging in a way they haven't in many \nyears. Turnouts in many of the primaries have been more significant \nthan they have been in many years. People are watching. So we have an \nopportunity to educate the people on this very important choice in \nterms of a Supreme Court nomination.\n  I, for one, think the nomination should be instructed by the vote \nthat is cast in November for the President, and, actually, for that \nmatter, the Senate congressional elections. Some people say: Well, the \npeople have spoken and President Obama was reelected to a second term. \nThat is true. And 2 years later the people spoke again, and I was \nelected to the Senate and Republicans were brought to a majority. So \nthe people spoke in a different way. Just a few months from now we will \nget the most up-to-date read of where the American people are, who they \nwant to lead the country, and who they want to nominate as the next \nSupreme Court Justice.\n  This quote has been famously reported in the press, and I couldn't \nsay it any better than then-Senator Biden did. He talked about the \nneed, at a certain point in time during the political\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\nprocess, to set things aside, let the people speak, and let that be \ninstructive to the Supreme Court nomination.\n  Incidentally, I know the Vice President, at the time he made this \nquote, was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the position \nSenator Grassley currently holds. He was basically saying what Senator \nGrassley has said and that I fully support. So I think Vice President \nBiden was right the first time. He seems to be stepping back on his \nwords, but I don't think his words can be parsed. They were pretty \nwell-articulated right here on the Senate floor.\n  Then we come to the minority leader. We now have the minority leader \nand others coming to the floor talking about what our constitutional \nduty is, but the minority leader came to this floor--right over there, \nnot very far from where I am now--and he said:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give presidential appointees a vote.\n\n  I agree with Senator Reid. And finally, we have one from my good \nfriend from New York, Senator Schumer. Senator Schumer is a very \narticulate man. He is a practiced attorney, and there are many aspects \nof the man I admire. In another instance, in a very passionate speech \ngiven--it is on YouTube so you can all watch it--he has taken a very \nsimilar position; that circumstances get to a point to where maybe we \nneed to hold nominations until we get the information we need that is \ninstructive to the future nomination or the future vote or consent \nmatter.\n  I agree with Senator Reid's 2005 statement, I agree with Senator \nBiden, Chairman Biden, now-Vice President Biden's statement of 1992, \nand I agree with Senator Schumer's of 2007.\n  My colleagues, it is time for us to move on and recognize the \nposition we have taken is a position that is going to stand. We can go \nto the American people back in our States, States like North Carolina, \nwhere we have a primary next week, and I will be traveling all across \nthe State tomorrow and Saturday, back again on Monday. I will explain \nto them why I have taken the position I have, and when we do, all the \ngames that are being played now, with one poll saying one thing or \nanother poll saying another thing, we can cut through the noise and \ntalk about what we are really trying to do.\n  What we are trying to do is to give the people an opportunity to \nvoice where they want to take the direction of the Supreme Court, where \nthey want to take the Nation in terms of the Presidency, and where they \nwant to take the Nation in terms of the Congress. I am willing to bet \non the people's voice, and I am looking forward to it being instructive \nto the ultimate decision I make about a Supreme Court nominee.\n  I love getting letters from folks in my State, so the last thing I \nleave you with is a quote from a lady named Lois from North Carolina. I \nthink she does a good job of summing up my own feelings. She said:\n\n       I really wish the discussions and hoopla could have waited \n     a little longer after Judge Scalia's passing, but we are \n     having the back and forth of what to do. As your constituent, \n     I'm in agreement with the committee position of waiting until \n     after we have a new President. Word out of the White House to \n     the Senate is: Do your job. Well, I, for one, think you are \n     doing your job. It's called checks and balances.\n\n  In the coming weeks, I am looking forward to continuing this debate. \nI want to especially note that Senator Grassley is a wonderful Member \nof the Senate. He has support and admiration from both sides of the \naisle. I appreciate his leadership on this matter. I appreciate Leader \nMcConnell's leadership on this matter. I look forward to getting back \nto North Carolina and hearing what the people would like for me to \nconsider as we move forward with the nomination process.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Mr. President, last month we reached a milestone in the \ncontinuing reform of our policy toward Cuba. The United States and Cuba \ncompleted a bilateral air service agreement that is key to ensuring the \ncontinued travel of Americans to the island. The newly minted air \nservices agreement will, for the first time in 50 years, provide \nscheduled air service between the United States and Cuba, including 20 \ndaily flights to Havana and 10 daily flights to other Cuban airports.\n  As someone who believes that all Americans should have a chance to \nsee a living museum of a failed socialistic experiment, I look forward \nto the day when all Americans can use Web sites they are familiar with \nto make reservations, even with their frequent flyer miles, to book \nflights to Havana and elsewhere in Cuba. Clearly, there is interest on \nour side of the Florida Strait. With easing of regulatory restrictions, \nauthorized travel to Cuba by Americans has increased by more than 50 \npercent in just one year. Freedom to travel between the two countries \nwill continue to open cultural and economic ties, benefiting the Cuban \npeople and Americans alike.\n  While I ardently support everyone's right to travel to Cuba, key to \nthe success will be ensuring that the initial flights being awarded by \nthe Department of Transportation provide for the continued and expanded \nability of the Cuban American community to travel to the island via \nregular air service. This should include adequate regular service to \naccommodate the growing demand from the largest and closest Cuban \nAmerican population located in Miami-Dade County.\n  In addition, having traveled to Cuba multiple times over the years, I \nhope that the Department closely evaluates the complexity of operating \nthere and ensures that those selected to operate these routes are up to \nthe task--those with experience.\n  A failure-to-launch scenario would represent a critically missed \nopportunity represented by the potential of successfully scheduled air \nservices between the United States and Cuba. We can't afford to let \nthis opportunity go to waste.\n  I have long supported efforts to restore the rights of American \ncitizens to travel to Cuba and have introduced legislation to lift the \nstatutory ban on travel, along with my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy. I am pleased to say that our legislation continues to gain \nbipartisan support.\n  As the situation changes on the ground with developments like regular \nair service, direct air service, and scheduled air service, I hope that \nthousands upon thousands of Americans will visit Cuba and Congress will \ndo the right thing when it comes to changing our outdated law.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1428-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1428-S1430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Nation has lost one of the greatest \nJustices ever to sit on the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia. My \ncondolences and prayers go out to his wife of 55 years, Maureen, his 9 \nchildren, and 36 grandchildren.\n  My thought is that Justice Scalia's greatness was founded on the \npower of his ideas. His defense of those founding principles of America \nat the highest intellectual level is unprecedented, to my knowledge, in \nthe United States. Over his career, he moved the legal world. As a \nyoung lawyer out of law school, I remember what the trends were and how \nJustice Scalia relentlessly, intellectually, aggressively, and soundly \ndrove the message that many of the ideas that are out there today are \ninconsistent with the rule of law and the American tradition.\n  The trend was relentlessly toward activism. Judges were praised if \nthey advanced the law--not when they followed the law, or served under \nthe law,\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\nor the Constitution, but if they advanced it. By advancing it, what \nthat really means is you change it. If you advance it, it means the \nlegislature hadn't passed something that you would like, or the \nConstitution doesn't advance an idea that you like, then you figure out \na way to reinterpret the meaning of the words so it says what you would \nlike it to say and what you wish the legislature had passed.\n  One of the bogus ideas at that time--you don't hear much about it \nanymore, but it was current, and it was mainstream then--was that the \nink-stained parchment, well over 200 years old and right over in the \nArchives Building, was alive. Our Constitution, they said, was a living \ndocument.\n  Well, how ridiculous is that? The judges said that the Constitution \ngave them the power to update it, advance it, and make it say what they \nwanted it to say. They even contended that it was the duty of the \njudge, not just the privilege of the judge, to advance the words of the \nConstitution. Justice Scalia saw this as a direct threat, and he \nunderstood at the most fundamental level who was threatened by it, and \nthat was ``we the people.''\n  You know how the Constitution begins with ``We the People of the \nUnited States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish \nJustice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, \npromote the general Welfare . . . do ordain and establish''? Well, \nfriends and colleagues, we establish this Constitution, the one we \nhave, not the one some judge would like it to be or some politician \nwould like it to be but the one we have.\n  He boldly criticized the idea that a mere five judges--it just takes \nfive out of nine--with lifetime appointments who are totally \nunaccountable to the American people. We are prohibited from even \nreducing their pay, which I support because we want an independent \njudiciary.\n  Judges need to know they are given independence and a lifetime \nappointment because we trust them to serve under the Constitution and \nnot above it. They serve under the laws duly passed by the elected \nrepresentatives of the people of the United States, not above those \nlaws. They were not given the power to set policies that they would \nlike to set no matter how strongly they feel about it. That is not what \nthey have been given to do. He boldly criticized those ideas and those \nindividuals and didn't mind saying it in plain words: You are setting \npolicy, you are not following the law.\n  I would say that Professor Van Aylstyne--while at William & Mary or \nDuke--had a great quote about this. He said: If you really honor the \nConstitution, if you really respect the Constitution, you will \nreinforce it as it is written whether you like it or not.\n  If judges today can twist the Constitution to make it say something \nit was not intended to mean, how might a new Court--five judges in a \nnew age a decade or two from now--reinterpret the words to advance an \nagenda during that time? Isn't that a blow to the very concept of the \ndemocratic Republic we have? I think so.\n  I will tell you that this has been a long and tough intellectual \nbattle. You don't hear many people say that paper document over in the \nArchives is a living thing. Of course it is not a living thing. It is a \ncontract. The American people have a contract with their government. \nThey gave it certain powers and reserved certain powers for themselves. \nThey reserved certain powers for their States, and the Federal \nGovernment is a government with limited power. This is absolutely, \nundeniably fundamental, and people don't fully understand it today.\n  I remember when I was a U.S. attorney back in Alabama and an \nindividual brought me a high school textbook. He said: I want you to \nsee this.\n  The book said: How do you amend the Constitution? It talked about \nseveral different ways to amend the Constitution, such as Congress and \nthe Constitutional Convention, but it also said by judicial decision.\n  He said: Mr. U.S. Attorney, I thought the judges were bound by the \nConstitution. They don't get to change the Constitution.\n  Well, of course that is correct. But, in effect, we have had many \ninstances when judges, through their interpretation, have in effect \namended the Constitution. It is an absolute legal heresy, and they \nshould not do that. It weakens the power of the democracy.\n  One of the things that I think is very unfortunate is that judges \nhave created an incredible amount of law that is contrary to common \nsense in the area of religion in the public life of America. Many of \nthese cases are very confusing. But Justice Scalia, in a series of \ncases where he wrote the majority opinion, or wrote the dissent, or \nwrote concurring opinions, applied the principles of the Constitution \nas they were intended to lay out a lawful and commonsense framework for \nfaith in the public square. I think that is a significant achievement.\n  When Chief Justice Roberts came before our committee for \nconfirmation, I remember telling him: Sir, I would like you to try to \nclear up and bring some common sense to the expression of faith. You \nhave a right to free speech in America, you have a right to the free \nexercise of religion under the Constitution, so how has it gotten \naround that you can be protected more in filthy speech than you can be \nprotected in religious speech?\n  So as I said, Justice Scalia issued a series of opinions that were \nimportant on this subject. For example, in 1992, the Supreme Court \ndecided Lee v. Weisman. This case involved a challenge to a Rhode \nIsland public school policy that permitted a member of the clergy to \ndeliver prayers at middle school graduation ceremonies. In this \ninstance, a rabbi had delivered a prayer at one such ceremony, and one \nof the families in attendance that objected brought suit, alleging that \nthe school's policy permitting prayer at graduation was a violation of \nthe First Amendment's Establishment Clause. By a vote of 5-to-4, the \nSupreme Court concluded that the school's policy violated the \nEstablishment Clause. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote:\n\n       In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits \n     invocations and benedictions at public school graduation \n     ceremonies, the Court--with nary a mention that it is doing \n     so--lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school \n     graduation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of \n     an even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian \n     prayer to God at public celebrations generally.\n\n  Two years later, the Supreme Court decided Board of Education of \nKiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet. This case involved a \nchallenge to a New York statue that tracked village boundaries to \ncreate a public school district for practitioners of a strict form of \nJudaism known as Satmar Hasidim. By a vote of 6-to-3, the Court \nconcluded that the government had drawn political boundaries on the \nbasis of religious faith in violation of the First Amendment's \nEstablishment Clause. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote:\n\n       the Founding Fathers would be astonished to find that the \n     Establishment Clause--which they designed to insure that no \n     one powerful sect or combination of sects could use political \n     or governmental power to punish dissenters, has been employed \n     to prohibit characteristically and admirably American \n     accommodation of the religious practices--or more precisely, \n     cultural peculiarities--of a tiny minority sect. . . . Once \n     this Court has abandoned text and history as guides, nothing \n     prevents it from calling religious toleration the \n     establishment of religion.\n\n  Ten years later, in 2004, the Supreme Court decided Locke v. Davey. \nIn this case, a student challenged a Washington State statute which \ncreated a scholarship for students enrolled ``at least half time in an \neligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington,'' but \nexcluded from eligibility for this scholarship students seeking degrees \nin devotional theology. A student sued to enjoin Washington from \nrefusing to award him a scholarship. By a vote of 7-to-2, the Supreme \nCourt upheld the statute. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote that:\n\n       When the State makes a public benefit generally available, \n     that benefit becomes part of the baseline against which \n     burdens on religion are measured; and when the State \n     withholds that benefit from some individuals solely on the \n     basis of religion, it violates the Free Exercise Clause no \n     less than if it had imposed a special tax. That is precisely \n     what the State of Washington has done here. It has created a \n     generally available public benefit, whose receipt is \n     conditioned only on academic performance, income, and \n     attendance at an accredited school. It has then carved out a \n     solitary course of study for exclusion: theology.\n\n  The next year, the Supreme Court decided McCreary County v. ACLU of\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\nKentucky. This case involved a challenge to the placement of the Ten \nCommandments on the walls inside two Kentucky courthouses. By a vote of \n5-to-4, the Supreme Court held that the placement of the Ten \nCommandments inside of courthouses was a violation of the First \nAmendment's Establishment Clause. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote \nthat:\n\n       Historical practices demonstrate that there is a distance \n     between the acknowledgment of a single Creator and the \n     establishment of a religion. The former is, as Marsh v. \n     Chambers put it, ``a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs \n     widely held among the people of this country.'' The three \n     most popular religions in the United States, Christianity, \n     Judaism, and Islam--which combined account for 97.7% of all \n     believers--are monotheistic. All of them, moreover (Islam \n     included), believe that the Ten Commandments were given by \n     God to Moses, and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous \n     life. Publicly honoring the Ten Commandments is thus \n     indistinguishable, insofar as discriminating against other \n     religions is concerned, from publicly honoring God. Both \n     practices are recognized across such a broad and diverse \n     range of the population--from Christians to Muslims--that \n     they cannot be reasonably understood as a government \n     endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint.\n\n  More recently in 2014, Justice Scalia dissented from a denial of \ncertiorari in the case of Elmbrook School District v. Doe. In this \ncase, the entire seventh circuit, over three dissents, held that a \nsuburban Milwaukee public high school district violated the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment by holding its graduation \nin a nondenominational church. Justice Scalia wrote that:\n\n       Some there are--many, perhaps--who are offended by public \n     displays of religion. Religion, they believe, is a personal \n     matter; if it must be given external manifestation, that \n     should not occur in public places where others may be \n     offended. I can understand that attitude: It parallels my own \n     toward the playing in public of rock music or Stravinsky. And \n     I too am especially annoyed when the intrusion upon my inner \n     peace occurs while I am part of a captive audience, as on a \n     municipal bus or in the waiting room of a public agency.\n       In this case, at the request of the student bodies of the \n     two relevant schools, the Elmbrook School District decided to \n     hold its high-school graduation ceremonies at Elmbrook \n     Church, a nondenominational Christian house of worship. The \n     students of the first school to move its ceremonies preferred \n     that site to what had been the usual venue, the school's \n     gymnasium, which was cramped, hot, and uncomfortable. The \n     church offered more space, air conditioning, and cushioned \n     seating. No one disputes that the church was chosen only \n     because of these amenities.\n       In this case, it is beyond dispute that no religious \n     exercise whatever occurred. At most, respondents complain \n     that they took offense at being in a religious place. It \n     bears emphasis that the original understanding of the kind of \n     coercion that the Establishment Clause condemns was far \n     narrower than the sort of peer-pressure coercion that this \n     Court has recently held unconstitutional.\n\n  Although many of his dissents were memorable, not all of Justice \nScalia's notable opinions on religion in public life were issued in \ndissent. In 1995, Justice Scalia wrote the opinion for the Court in \nCapitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, where the Court \nrejected an Establishment Clause challenge to the Christmas season \ndisplay of an unattended Latin cross in a plaza next to the Ohio State \nCapitol. Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia said:\n\n       Respondents' religious display in Capitol Square was \n     private expression. Our precedent establishes that private \n     religious speech, far from being a First Amendment orphan, is \n     as fully protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular \n     private expression. Indeed, in Anglo-American history, at \n     least, government suppression of speech has so commonly been \n     directed precisely at religious speech that a free-speech \n     clause without religion would be Hamlet without the prince.\n\n  And just last term, Justice Scalia wrote the opinion for the Court in \nEEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, a case about accommodation on the \nbasis of religion in the employment environment. In this case, a Muslim \nindividual who wore a head scarf as part of her religious observation \napplied for a job at a clothing retailer, but was not hired due to the \ncompany's policy, which prohibited employees from wearing ``caps.'' In \nreversing the court of appeals in favor of the applicant, Justice \nScalia wrote that:\n\n       Congress defined ``religion'' for Title VII purposes as \n     ``including all aspects of religious observance and practice, \n     as well as belief.'' Thus, religious practice is one of the \n     protected characteristics that cannot be accorded disparate \n     treatment and must be accommodated.\n\n  As we see, these opinions by Justice Scalia involve parties of varied \nfaiths--Christians, Jews, and Muslims. Regardless of the identity of \nthe party, Justice Scalia's opinions on religion in public life \nconsistently evidence a deep respect for the unique history of \nreligious pluralism in this country and a heartfelt appreciation for \nits positive impact across the landscape of the nation. While some may \nsay his opinions are not consistent, I disagree. Religion in American \nlife is an important and complex subject. Judges must think carefully \nbut not abandon common sense as so many opinions have. Justice Scalia \nsaw limits on free exercise of religion when it came to the contention, \nfor example, that one's religion required the use of drugs that a State \nhad declared illegal.\n  So this is an important area that needs to be cleared up so that we \ncan bring some reality to the question of the expression of religious \nconviction in public life. Because the Constitution says we shall not \nestablish a religion--Congress shall not establish a religion. It \ndoesn't say States couldn't establish a religion; it says Congress \ncan't establish a religion. It also says ``nor shall Congress prohibit \nthe free exercise thereof.'' So you can't prohibit the free exercise of \nreligion.\n  I think we have forgotten the free exercise clause and over-\ninterpreted the establishment of religion. Some States at the time had \nestablished religions. Most of the countries in Europe had a religion \nthat they put in law for their country, and we said: No, we are not \ngoing to establish any religion here. You have the right to exercise \nyour religious faith as you choose.\n  Madison and Jefferson particularly believed it was absolutely \nunacceptable for this government to tell people how to relate to that \nperson they considered to be their creator. That was a personal \nrelationship that ought to be respected and the government ought to \nhave no role in it.\n  Like Madison and Jefferson, Justice Scalia, too, believed in American \nexceptionalism. Indeed, he was truly exceptional. Although he will be \nimpossible to replace, his seat on the Supreme Court will eventually be \nfilled by the next President. After that nominee is confirmed, his or \nher decisions will likely impact our Nation for the next 30 years and \nfar beyond. Next year, when we debate this eventual nominee's \nqualifications to assume Justice Scalia's seat, we need look no further \nthan his own words for wisdom to guide us as we consider our decision. \nIn no uncertain terms, Justice Scalia's McCreary County dissent reminds \nus that:\n\n       What distinguishes the rule of law from the dictatorship of \n     a shifting Supreme Court majority is the absolutely \n     indispensable requirement that judicial opinions be grounded \n     in consistently applied principle. That is what prevents \n     judges from ruling now this way, now that--thumbs up or \n     thumbs down--as their personal preferences dictate.\n\n  That is the governing principle that Justice Scalia abided by--\nunwavering commitment to the rule of law even when reaching the outcome \nthat the law dictated did not align with his policy preferences. This--\nabove all things--is the duty of a judge or Justice, and it is a \nprinciple that has fallen by the wayside far too often in recent years. \nIt is imperative that we keep these words in mind when we consider \nappointments not only to the Supreme Court, but all lifetime \nappointments to the Federal judiciary.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, now that the Senate has passed the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, I wish to take a few moments \nto reflect on what I believe are going to be additional steps that are \nneeded to really\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nput an end to the horrible opioid epidemic. This is a horrible, \nhorrible health scourge that has carved a path of destruction \nthroughout communities in Oregon and across our country.\n  Now, over the last several weeks, I have traveled around Oregon to \nspend time listening to experts. We heard powerful testimony in the \nFinance Committee, and I have spoken with colleagues here in the Senate \nabout the urgency and the important scale of this national crisis. The \nmessage has been very clear: Our country is paying for a distorted set \nof priorities. Our citizens get hooked on opioids, there is not enough \ntreatment, and enforcement falls short. My view is that is a trifecta \nof misplaced priorities.\n  What it says to me is that our country needs a fresh approach where \nprevention, better treatment, and tougher enforcement work in tandem. \nWe have to have all three working together to really get on top of this \nhorrible, horrible health scourge. The Congress ought to be working \novertime on policies that start moving our Nation towards this tandem \napproach that I have described.\n  Now, my view is that the bill that was passed by the Senate takes the \nfirst step toward updating the country's out-of-date approach to \nsubstance abuse. More needs to be done, and that is what I and other \ncolleagues have pushed hard to do. I very much hope that more can be \ndone in this Congress.\n  As ranking member of the Finance Committee, we are required to pay \nfor Medicare and Medicaid. I wish to spend a few minutes talking about \nthe fundamental role that is going to play in stemming the tide of \nopioid abuse.\n  These are bedrock health programs, and they are expected to account \nfor over a third of substance abuse-related spending in the upcoming \nyears. We are talking about billions and billions of dollars. Medicare \nand Medicaid have an important role when it comes to preventing \naddiction at its source, and talking about prevention has to include \ntalking about how these drugs are prescribed in the first place.\n  As I visited with citizens around Oregon, I was struck--and I know of \nthe Presiding Officer's expertise in health care as a practitioner--by \nwhat I have come to call the prescription pendulum. Doctors were once \ncriticized for not treating pain aggressively enough, and today they \nare criticized for prescribing too many opioids to manage pain. So in \nthe days ahead, our country is going to have to look for solutions that \nget the balance right.\n  During the debate on this bill, the Senate considered an amendment I \nwrote that would have doubled the penalties for opioid manufacturers \nwho give kickbacks to prescribers and put profits over patients. It has \nbeen well documented in recent years that companies are pushing the \nunapproved use of some drugs at the expense of patient safety. It is \nhigh time for real accountability when the manufacturers go too far.\n  My amendment would also have made significant progress to connect \nthose struggling with addiction to appropriate treatment. Some parts of \nthe bill the Senate passed crack down on those on Medicare who are \nsuspected of abusing opioids. It is an enforcement-only approach, and \nmy view is that the story cannot stop there. Without treatment, those \naddicted to opioids might try to get their pills on the street or turn \nto heroin. My amendment would have ensured that those who are at risk \nfor opioid abuse are connected to meaningful treatment choices so they \ncan better manage their pain and limit excessive prescriptions.\n  I also proposed an amendment that would have helped some of the most \nvulnerable Americans, including pregnant women on Medicaid who struggle \nwith addiction. The costs of inaction here add up every single day for \nmoms and their babies. A recent Reuters investigation found that, on \naverage, an opioid-dependent baby is born every 19 minutes. These are \nhigh-risk pregnancies that can have lifelong consequences for mothers \nand their children. Some of these babies tragically aren't going to \nmake it. Many of them are going to be placed in foster care if their \nmothers cannot break their addiction.\n  So it is critical that these women have and retain full access to \npre- and post-natal care as well as addiction treatment. Yet, today, if \na pregnant woman on Medicaid receives treatment for drug or alcohol \ndependency, in certain in-patient facilities, that woman loses her \nhealth coverage for the duration of her stay. That just defies common \nsense.\n\n  The good news is, the country has a pretty good idea of a \nstraightforward solution. There is no reason someone who is pregnant \nshould lose access to their health insurance. This amendment simply \nstates that no pregnant woman would lose her Medicaid while she \nreceives treatment for addiction. To be clear, this amendment doesn't \ninstruct Medicaid to pay for these treatment services. That charge \nrequires a broader debate. I do believe, though, in the meantime, \naccess to services like prenatal care should not be restricted for \npregnant women who want to receive care for their addiction.\n  It is unfortunate these amendments didn't make it into the Senate \nlegislation today, but I have seen a number of times--and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate--that sometimes we \ndon't win on day one, and you have to come back again and again and \nagain. A few weeks ago, a bill I authored well over a decade ago, the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, finally got passed permanently into law. So \nsometimes when something is important, you just have to stay at it, and \nI want colleagues to know I think the CARA bill is a good start. It \nfocuses on enforcement, but unless you get the prevention and treatment \npart of it in addition to enforcement, you are not going to get the job \ndone properly.\n  The Congress obviously has some tough choices to make. If prevention \nand treatment aren't addressed upfront, the costs are going to be even \nhigher--pregnant mothers giving birth to opioid-dependent babies, EMTs \nin emergency rooms dealing with overdose calls every night, county \njails taking the place of needed treatment, able-bodied adults in the \nstreets instead of working at a family wage job. American tax dollars \nneed to be spent more wisely, and it is my view the Senate has to come \nback to this issue. It has to come back to this issue and get the job \ndone right.\n  I indicated earlier that I am very much aware of the expertise of the \nPresiding Officer in health care and his involvement as a practitioner, \nand I look back, as I said, to how the prescription pendulum has moved. \nIt wasn't very long ago when I was of the view that there wasn't enough \ndone to manage pain. As patients began to insist on those kinds of \ndrugs and therapies to help them with their pain, we saw they were able \nto get relief. The pendulum may have swung the other way now, and there \nis too much prescribing. I don't pretend to be the authority on how to \nget the prescription pendulum right, but I do know from listening to \npractitioners in the field, to citizens, to grieving parents, that you \nhave to have more than enforcement. That is what the Senate has done \nwith the bill that was passed today. The story must not end there. The \nSenate can do better in the days ahead. The Senate can fill in the rest \nof the story and ensure that in addition to enforcement, there will be \nprevention, there will be treatment, and a sensible policy that ensures \nthat these three priorities work in tandem and is what the Senate \npursues on a bipartisan basis in the days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1431-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1431-S1432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to spend just a few minutes to \ndiscuss women's health care because I believe women's health care in \nAmerica is in trouble--very deep trouble. It is in trouble in Congress, \nit is in trouble in the courts, and it is in trouble in our \nstatehouses. In these bodies, I think there is a serious risk to \nwomen's access to affordable, high-quality health care. There is an \nassault on women's right to choose their own physicians and their own \nproviders, and that assault is wrong. Drip by drip, State by State, the \nassault goes on.\n  The latest example is in Florida, where lawmakers seem to be heading \ndown the same road that Texas and Louisiana have traveled, restricting \nthe choices of women. This all began with a Texas law, HB2, that has \nbeen challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Arguments were \nheard just last week. HB2 backers have argued the law is about \nprotecting women's health. My view is that is pretty\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nmuch fiction. HB2 has very little to do with women's health. It is a \nthinly veiled scheme to block women's health choices with unjustifiable \nrequirements for abortion clinics. The AMA and the American Congress of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists--people who obviously have expertise on \nthis issue--have said very clearly in a legal brief, an amicus brief, \nthat the restrictions are ``contrary to accepted medical practice and \nare not based on scientific evidence.'' Despite the advice of the \nAmerican Medical Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, Texas went ahead with the law anyway. If it stands, \nthe number of clinics that provide abortion care will drop by more than \nthree-quarters. Now HB2 backers say it is about preventing \ncomplications from abortion. Yet they ignore other procedures--\ncolonoscopies, for example, that have much higher rates of \ncomplications. HB2 backers say women who live where these clinics have \nshuttered could go to other States, but the fact is, we are hearing \nthat really isn't an option for so many women.\n  Louisiana just passed its own version of HB2. Just yesterday the news \ncame down that legislators in Florida have passed a similar measure. \nThe Florida bill goes one dangerous step further by going after funding \nfor Planned Parenthood. Attacks on Planned Parenthood aren't anything \nnew, not in statehouses like Tallahassee or here in the Congress. When \nyou threaten Planned Parenthood in this way, you are going far beyond \nrestricting access to abortion. Here is the list of vital women's \nhealth care services which have absolutely nothing to do with abortion, \nand these services which have nothing to do with abortion are under \nthreat: pregnancy testing, birth control, prenatal services, HIV \ntesting, cancer screenings, vaccinations, testing and treatment for \nsexually transmitted infections, basic physical exams, treatment for \nchronic conditions, pediatric care, hospital and specialist referrals, \nadoption referrals, nutrition programs.\n  The fact is, this assault on women's health care is going to hit \ndisadvantaged, struggling women hard across our country. There are \ncountless women across America enrolled in Medicaid who rely on Planned \nParenthood and similar programs for their basic, essential medical \ncare. It is their first line of defense for basic health care, \nparticularly in rural communities in rural Oregon. The women know and \ntrust their doctors at those clinics. Without those clinics, they \naren't going to have anywhere to turn for their care. If you are \nworking an hourly job, you have kids to care for on your own, it is \npretty clear you are not going to find an easy way to take a day off \nwork and travel far away for medical care. Yet these are the kind of \nlaws that are being passed in States across America. These anti-woman \nlaws are unfair and they are dangerous.\n  This will not be the last time I come to the floor to discuss this. \nMy view is access to health care for women in this country is in \ntrouble, and a number of the services I have talked about are \nessentially part of what is a constitutional right--a constitutional \nright. It doesn't just mean it is a constitutional right if you are \nwell-off. It is a constitutional right because the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas said it, and I intend to defend that constitutional right. I intend \nto do everything I can to build bipartisan support so that instead of \nwomen's health services being in deep trouble as I described today, \nwomen can know that those essential services are available for them \nacross the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \none of our most cherished rights as U.S. citizens; that is, the freedom \nof speech and why allowing our children and young people to exercise \nthis right at a young age is critical to learning and understanding \ncomplex and tough issues and ideas.\n  The ability to effectively teach and learn journalism--and for other \nstudents to be challenged to engage in public discourse on tough \nissues--was severely hindered by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1988 \nin Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier. The Hazelwood case \nlegitimized a school's decision to remove material about divorce and \nteen pregnancy from the pages of a student newspaper on the grounds \nthat the material was overly mature for a high school audience.\n  Justice William Brennan, one of the First Amendment's greatest \njudicial champions, dissented from that ruling in words that resonate \nwith us here today. He said: ``Instead of teaching children to respect \nthe diversity of ideas that is fundamental to the American system and \nthat our Constitution is a living reality, not parchment preserved \nunder glass, the Court today teaches youth to discount important \nprinciples of our government as mere platitudes.''\n  History has vindicated Justice Brennan's dire warning. Students \nregularly report that they have been prevented from discussing matters \nof public importance in the pages of student media or, perhaps worse, \nthey have restrained themselves from even attempting to address an \nissue of social or political concern in fear of adverse consequences. \nThat is not an environment that values and empowers student voices, and \nit is not a climate conducive to the effective learning of civic \nparticipation. We can and must do better.\n  On the 25th anniversary of the Hazelwood decision in 2013, every \nmajor journalism education organization in the Nation enacted a \nresolution calling on schools and colleges to abandon reliance on the \nHazelwood level of institutional control. The sentiment was perhaps \nbest expressed by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass \nCommunication, the largest organization in the country of college \njournalism instructors, which stated that ``no legitimate . . . purpose \nis served by the censorship of student journalism even if it reflects \nunflatteringly on school policies and programs, candidly discusses \nsensitive social and political issues, or voices opinions challenging \nto majority views on a matter of public concern.''\n  Since then, nine States have statutes protecting the independence of \nstudent journalists to report on issues of public concern without fear, \nand two have comparable protections by way of the State board of \neducation rules. The combined experience of these 11 States spans well \nover 160 years, demonstrating that young people are fully capable of \nexercising a measure of legally protected press freedom responsibly and \nwithout incident or harm.\n  I am proud to say that my own home State of North Dakota established \na position of national leadership by enacting the John Wall New Voices \nof North Dakota Act in 2015. The statute was named in memory of a truly \namazing educator, John Wall, who lived his own civics lesson by running \nfor the North Dakota House of Representatives, where he served with \ngreat distinction for 10 years after retiring from a 34-year career as \na public school teacher.\n  The New Voices Act passed the North Dakota State Legislature with \nbipartisan sponsorship and without a single negative vote. That is \ntruly an amazing fact. As we think about the importance of student \njournalism, the importance of voicing opinions and the importance of \nlearning the value of participation through the First Amendment or \nthrough speech, I am often reminded of a personal incident that I had \nin my family.\n  My daughter was not on the school newspaper when she was in high \nschool, but she frequently wrote a column. One column that she wrote \ngenerated a lot of controversy in a very small town at a time when it \nwas much more controversial. It was an article that promoted marriage \nequality. She ended up getting a lot of grief and a lot of negative \nattention as a result of writing that article. My daughter is pretty \nopinionated. So it didn't bother her too much.\n  But many years later, I received a letter from a mother. That letter \nfrom a mother talked about how she was in a same-sex relationship, had \nbeen most\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\nof her life and most of her daughter's life, and how once my daughter \nhad published this article in the Mandan school newspaper, it changed \nthe outcome. It changed the way her daughter went to school every day \nbecause she knew she wasn't alone. She knew someone was there in that \nschool who understood her challenges and supported her family. So where \nit may not move big issues--and it may not be a big, moving example \nlike Hazelwood--it can, in fact, change outcomes. The ability to \nexpress yourself, the ability to be part of a community where we have \nopen ideas is absolutely instrumental and critical to the future of our \ncountry.\n  When you look at the restrictions that still today are put on student \npress and student newspapers, we know we have to do better.\n  I applaud the new voices of North Dakota organization and its \nfounder, Professor Steven Listopad of Valley City State University and \nthose teachers, professors, and students around the country who engage \nin similar efforts for helping shine the Nation's attention on the \nurgent need to protect meaningful and candid journalism so that young \npeople have an opportunity to participate and drive the civic dialogue \nabout the world in which they live and they will eventually lead.\n  The skills learned and developed by student journalists and the roles \nthey can play in driving public conversation among their peers speak to \nthe indispensable role that journalism can play--if adequately \nsupported by our schools--in educating the next generation for the \ncareers of the future and for preparing our children to discuss, \ndebate, and lead on important and controversial issues.\n  I think that, as we are moving forward and taking a look at what can \nbe done, it is important that we all appreciate that the First \nAmendment is not something that you should just learn in school books. \nIt is something that you must exercise. And the sooner you exercise \nthat First Amendment right to speech, the sooner we recognize that \nyoung voices in this country are as critical as older voices and no \nstudent should be restricted or prevented from expressing an opinion \nand the stronger we will grow in our democracy.\n  I look forward to continuing to work on this issue. I look forward to \ntaking on the difficult task of talking about what we can do nationally \nto advance this, but I mainly came to the floor to applaud the great \nState of North Dakota for recognizing the importance of students' First \nAmendment rights.\n  I encourage all Members in this Chamber to examine what happens at \nhome with students' First Amendment rights, to provide leadership, to \npromote those rights in their State, and to potentially look at how we \ncan reverse the Hazelwood decision so that we can grow a more \nconfident, a more educated, and a more diverse population for our \nfuture.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout an extraordinary person who passed away on Monday, March 7, at \nthe age of 92. Dr. Quentin Young was a dedicated physician and an \nadvocate for civil rights in Chicago.\n  Some of Dr. Quentin's patients included the Rev. Martin Luther King, \nJr., the Beatles, Studs Terkel, the late Mayor Harold Washington, and \neven President Obama.\n  Dr. Young's commitment to the common good is what makes him a legend. \nHe spent 35 years at Cook County Hospital and 56 years of private \npractice in Hyde Park improving health care while fighting for social \njustice and racial equality. His autobiography is titled, ``Everybody \nIn, Nobody Out: Memoirs of a Rebel Without a Pause.'' And he meant it.\n  Doctor Quentin Young grew up in Hyde Park in Chicago's Southside. And \nwhen America entered World War II, he enlisted in the Army and served \nhis country honorably.\n  After returning from the war, Dr. Young graduated from medical school \nat Northwestern University and would go on to spend 35 years at Cook \nCounty Hospital treating patients and becoming a moral voice during the \nCivil Rights era. When people outside of Chicago hear the words Cook \nCounty and hospital, people think about the show ``ER'' and doctors \nresembling George Clooney. For the people in Chicago, they think of Dr. \nQuentin Young.\n  Dr. Young's experience at Cook County Hospital and his efforts during \nthe Civil Rights movement were intertwined. In 1951, he was a founder \nof the Committee to End Discrimination in Chicago Medical Institutions, \nwhich focused on ending racist practices in Chicago's hospitals and \nclinics.\n  By 1960, the Cook County Hospital was serving the Black community and \nimmigrant Mexican community almost exclusively. Eighty percent of \nChicago's Black births and nearly half of all Black deaths were at Cook \nCounty Hospital. This place was one of the frontlines of social \ninequality and Dr. Young and his family fought to change that. His \nefforts were not limited to the Chicagoland area. Dr. Young was a \nfounder and national chairman of the Medical Committee for Human Rights \nor MCHR, which formed in June 1964 to offer support and medical care \nfor civil rights workers, community activists, and summer volunteers \nworking in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer.\n  It was the MCHR that provided help and emergency medical care to \nanti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in \nChicago. In October of that year, Dr. Young received a summons by the \nHouse Un-American Activities Committee for his involvement in MCHR. He \nvaliantly defended the MCHR's work.\n  After Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was struck in the head by a rock \nwhile marching through a White neighborhood, Dr. Young was there to \npatch him up. He was not only Dr King's physician but a fellow marcher \nduring the Marquette Park protest in 1966.\n  Dr. Young and the late Dr. Jorge Prieto, former head of the Chicago \nBoard of Health, became the primary force behind the movement to found \nneighborhood medical clinics in the late 1960s. These clinics gave \nmedical help to countless people when they couldn't afford to go to the \ndoctor.\n  From 1972 to 1981, he served as chairman of Medicine at Cook County \nHospital. His example helped bring many dedicated people back to the \nhospital, but it wasn't without challenges. The staff went on strike \nbecause of the lack of resources in 1975. Dr. Young sided with the \nyoung doctors, and the governing commission fired him for it. With \nloyalty, the striking staff took his office door off its hinges so \nmanagement couldn't change the locks and held a 24-hour vigil outside \nhis office until he regained his position after a court fight.\n  In 1980, Dr. Young founded the Chicago-based and Illinois-focused \nHealth & Medicine Policy Research Group, which conducts research, \neducation, policy development, and advocacy for policies that impact \nhealth systems to improve the health status of all people. He would go \non to serve as Mayor Harold Washington's appointment as president to \nthe Chicago Board of Health.\n  Dr. Quentin Young never lost his passion for providing equal access \nto health care for the people of Illinois. Since retiring from private \npractice in 2008, he fought hard for a single-payer system.\n  In 2001, at the age of 78, he walked 167 miles across Illinois, from \nMississippi River to Lake Michigan, with former Governor Pat Quinn to \npromote access to health care.\n  He never wavered in his belief in humanity's ability and \nresponsibility to make a more equal and just nation. My prayers and \nthoughts go out to his family, Michael, Ethan, Nancy, Polly, Barbara, \nWilliam, Karen, and his nine grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1433-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1433-S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, 8 years ago, I convened the first in a \nseries of hearings in Vermont where the Senate Judiciary Committee \nexamined\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\nthe growing problem of drug addiction in rural communities. As we \ngathered in Rutland in March 2008, the mayor noted in his opening \nstatement that there was a part of him that wished that the committee \ndid not have to be there in his city that day. He wished that his \ncommunity was not facing the scourge of drug abuse and addiction that \nwas creeping across rural America.\n  But in true Vermont fashion, Mayor Louras and the other community \nleaders, law enforcement officials, and health professionals who \ngathered with us that day in March 2008 did not shy away from the \nproblem. Instead, we had an honest discussion about how to fight this \nproblem together and about how the Federal Government could help. Over \nthe past 8 years, we have continued this important conversation at \nother hearings I convened in St. Albans, in Barre, and again in \nRutland. We have heard testimony from community leaders and officials \nthroughout Vermont about the growing problem of opioid addiction. In \nSt. Albans, for example, Dr. Fred Holmes told us tragic stories about \nteenagers getting hooked on OxyContin and other opioids and then \ncommitting crimes to support their habits. These stories have been \nheartbreaking.\n  Despite these difficult circumstances, I am struck by the \ndetermination of Vermonters to come together to address this crisis--\nand to do so not just through law enforcement and locking people up, \nbut through comprehensive prevention, treatment, and recovery programs.\n  In Rutland, for example, Project VISION brings together city \nofficials, law enforcement, and social services to work together, all \nin the same office, to confront the problems of drug abuse and related \ncrime. What they have found is that something as simple as sharing \noffice space improves communication and coordination and begins to turn \nthe tide.\n  Mary Alice McKenzie, executive director of the Boys & Girls Club, \ntestified at the most recent hearing in Rutland about children who are \nneglected because their parents are opioid addicts and how there is \nsometimes no money for food because parents have spent it on drugs. \nKids are also becoming addicts at younger and younger ages. The Boys & \nGirls Club has responded by extending evening hours and staying open on \nSaturdays. They now serve dinner 6 nights a week and drive kids home \nafter dark. They provide safety for these children. They are also \nworking with schools and public health officials to provide education \nand prevent them from getting swept up in that world.\n  At that same hearing, Vermont's health department commissioner, Harry \nChen, described to us Vermont's innovative and successful ``hub and \nspoke'' treatment model. This system has two levels of care, with the \npatients' needs determining the appropriate level. Although challenges \nremain and waiting lists are still too long, I believe this system can \nbe a model for the Nation's response to the opioid crisis.\n  Earlier this year, we heard powerful testimony from Governor Shumlin \nabout the progress that Vermont has made because of this comprehensive \napproach--but also about the work that still remains to be done. \nVermont's focused and persistent efforts are now drawing attention and \nreplication in communities across the Nation.\n  In many ways, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, \nbuilds upon the work in Vermont.\n  To specifically address the opioid problem in Vermont and other rural \nareas, I made sure that CARA will help get the overdose-reversal drug \nnaloxone into more of our rural communities. Getting naloxone into more \nhands will save lives. I also ensured that CARA includes a new Federal \ngrant program to fund expanded treatment options for heroin and opioid \nabuse and Federal funding to expand State-led anti-heroin task forces.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of CARA, and I am glad to see the Senate \npass this bill. This bill is historic because it marks the first time \nthat we are treating addiction like the public health crisis that it \nis. We are not imposing harsh and arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences \non those who abuse drugs. We are not condemning the poor and sick among \nus to be warehoused in our Nation's jails. Today I am hopeful that we \nhave finally learned our lesson from the failed war on drugs.\n  But our work is not done. The Senate missed an opportunity to provide \nreal funding for this effort when Republicans blocked Senator Shaheen's \namendment that would have provided for emergency supplemental \nappropriations, so we need to keep fighting to ensure that we provide \nthe necessary resources to support implementation of this bill. In \nVermont and across this country, there are few issues more pressing \nthan opioid and heroin addiction, and I will not stop working with \npeople throughout our State to help fight this epidemic.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate overwhelming \npassed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which is a good \nfirst step toward combatting the opioid addition epidemic facing our \nNation. The bill authorizes expanded treatment options and empowers \nlocal health and law enforcement agencies to intensify efforts to \ncombat opioid addiction. This bill is a good start, but there is a lot \nof work left to do to address this increasingly dire situation. This \nbody needs to put real resources behind the initiatives we approved \ntoday and place a greater priority on investing in research for non-\nopioid alternatives to pain management.\n  The CDC estimated that, in 2014, overdose related to prescription \npain killers killed nearly 19,000 Americans. In Montana alone, \naccording to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human \nServices, prescription drug overdoses led to at least 369 deaths and \nmore than 7,200 hospital inpatient admissions and emergency department \nencounters statewide over a recent 3-year period. The effects of opioid \naddiction are undisputedly devastating.\n  It is also important to keep in mind that chronic pain is a very real \nproblem that affects millions of Americans. When discussing the \nnegative consequences of opioids, we must also remember that effective \ntreatments for chronic pain are absolutely necessary for those \nstruggling with long-term pain management.\n  That is why I believe it is time to devote more energy and funding to \nthe development of non-opioid painkillers. Early stage research in my \nhome State of Montana is demonstrating incredible promise in developing \nnon-opioid drugs that could help treat both chronic and acute pain. I \nam confident that medical professionals will eventually be empowered to \noffer their patients effective pain management alternatives that may \nsignificantly reduce our society's reliance on opioids.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to \nfind ways to invest in the research and development of non-opioid \npainkillers. In the meantime, I encourage Federal agencies, such as the \nNational Institutes of Health, to ramp up focus on finding alternative \ntreatments for chronic pain to reduce our Nation's dependency on \nopioids. Thank you.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1434-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

Mr. President, on February 13, 2016, Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia passed away in his sleep. He was an enduring \nlegacy of the Reagan administration and the conservative standard not \nonly on the Supreme Court but for the entire American judicial \ncommunity.\n  History will remember Scalia as a stalwart defender of the \nConstitution and a brilliant legal mind. He authored the majority \nopinion on countless rulings of the Court, preserving and protecting \nour Nation's founding principles. His intellectual honesty, as well as \nhis humor, will be greatly missed.\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\n  Justice Scalia played a pivotal role in the shaping of constitutional \ninterpretation throughout his 30-year tenure on the Supreme Court. He \nhad within him a fervor for law and order; yet he demonstrated a warmth \nthat resonated with many colleagues on both sides of the political \ndivide.\n  Scalia built meaningful relationships across that divide which were \nindicative of the strength of his character. Hadley Arkes, an expert in \nconstitutional law, said that Scalia was able to ``find something \nredeeming and likeable in just about everyone he met, regardless of \npolitics.'' This was no doubt a reflection of his strong Christian \nbackground and tremendous character.\n  You can learn the character of a man best by listening to how those \nwho knew him speak of him. Former colleagues and intellectual \nadversaries alike are unrestrained in their kind words for Justice \nScalia.\n  Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer spoke fondly of the late \nJustice, saying: ``Nino sparkled with enthusiasm, energy, sense of \nhumor, insight, and seriousness of purpose--the very qualities that I \nand his other colleagues have benefited from in more recent years.''\n  Justice Thomas described Scalia as a patriot with a true calling for \ninterpreting the Constitution and noted that their relationship \nflourished based on that common interest. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \nalso described their relationship as close and ``how blessed she was to \nhave a friend of such brilliance, high spirits, and quick wit.''\n  Scalia had a positive impact on so many lives as a Justice, a \ncolleague, a father, and a friend. His demeanor was just and fair, but \nmarked with personality and humor. Late Justice Scalia was a staunch \ndefender of the Constitution, rendering unbiased opinions and a unique \nperspective.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I honor the late Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States Antonin Scalia.\n  During his many years of serving our country, Justice Scalia proved \nto be a great defender of our constitutional liberties. Regardless of \none's politics, it is undeniable that Justice Scalia was a true patriot \nwhose passion for upholding our American principles was matched only by \nhis eloquence and intellect.\n  Justice Scalia's record of public service stretched from the time \nPresident Nixon appointed him as general counsel of the Office of \nTelecommunications Policy in 1971 to when President Reagan nominated \nhim as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in 1986, where he \nserved until his death in February 2016. Before and intermingled during \nthis service, Justice Scalia also served as an extremely talented \nattorney in private practice, a brilliant law professor, including for \nmy alma mater Tulane Law School in its summer programs, and an \neffective leader in the U.S. Justice Department at a number of levels.\n  One of the single most memorable events in my time in the Senate was \nwhen Justice Scalia agreed to visit with and speak to me and my staff. \nHis presence and authority impressed all of us and, as he discussed a \nnumber of topics including the importance of protecting our \nconstitutional rights; I admit to being awestruck. It was a great honor \nto hear directly from one of most significant jurists in American \nhistory, and I know my staff remember that day as clearly as I do.\n  One thing that distinguished Justice Scalia was not necessarily what \nhe did, but what he chose not to do. As a staunch adherent of limited, \nconstitutional government, on numerous occasions, he advocated for the \nCourt to separate itself from political fights or matters involving \nindividuals who are free to decide their own fate. Originalism, the \ntheory that the clear meaning given to words in the Constitution by our \nFounding Fathers should be honored, was prevalent in Justice Scalia's \ndecisions. He abhorred judicial activism, and he correctly understood \nthat the place for instituting laws was in the legislature, where the \nwill of the people is democratically represented.\n  I know that Justice Scalia will also be remembered for his upbeat \nnature, affability, charm, and wit. At the heart of his larger-than-\nlife personality was an educator, a person who not only ruled on the \nlaw, but also took the opportunity to inform readers of his opinions \nabout the history behind the decisions.\n  I commend his lifetime commitment as a public servant and hope his \nexample will inspire us all as we work to respect the Constitution and \nprotect the freedoms of all Americans. We would be wise to follow \nJustice Scalia's lead in remembering America's founding principles as \nwe are deciding matters of the future.\n  I also wish to express our deepest condolences to his wife, Maureen, \nand to the rest of his family. I am honored to join with the rest of \nthe United States Senate in celebrating the wonderful memory and \nlasting legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing the \ndeepest respect and admiration for Supreme Court Justice Antonin \nScalia. Our country has lost a brilliant, principled, and determined \njurist.\n  For three decades, Justice Scalia invigorated the Supreme Court, \nbecoming an icon for constitutional originalism. He had a remarkable \nability to espouse legal theory with memorable turns of phrase, and he \ncould expose gaps in opposing opinions with laserlike precision. He did \nnot fear differences of opinion but embraced the intellectual challenge \nthat conflicting viewpoints could offer. The enduring friendships he \nmade with those across the ideological spectrum are a true testament to \nhis indomitable scholarship.\n  Antonin Scalia had a distinguished career in law, academia, and \npublic service before being confirmed to the DC Circuit and later the \nSupreme Court. The many accolades and achievements of his biography are \nwell known. But Antonin, fondly known as ``Nino,'' was much more than \nan extraordinary legal mind. He was man of faith and family, raising \nnine children with his wife, Maureen.\n  His son, Christopher, wrote this in the Washington Post following his \nfather's death: ``As proud as we are of his legacy as a jurist, of \ncourse it's his presence in our personal lives that we'll miss the \nmost.'' To his children, he was a loving father who took them to Sunday \nmass, listened to Bach in his study, and never shied away from \nplayfulness at the dinner table.\n  We will remember Justice Scalia in my home State of Mississippi, \nwhere we were honored to host him over the years. We shared with him \nour variety of southern hospitality during his regular visits to the \nMagnolia State in pursuit of duck, deer, and turkey. When he wasn't \noutdoors, he spent time educating the public, especially college \nstudents, delivering thought-provoking lectures at the University of \nMississippi, Mississippi State University, the University of Southern \nMississippi, William Carey University, and MUW.\n  Justice Scalia's unanimous confirmation as the first Italian-American \nJustice was a historic moment for the Supreme Court and the beginning \nof a legendary tenure that will have a profound effect for generations \nto come. He leaves a vibrant legacy--perhaps most notably characterized \nby his steadfast protection of the Constitution as the Framers intended \nit. As I said shortly after learning the news of his death, ``I like to \nthink Antonin Scalia and James Madison are having the damnedest visit \nright now.''\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we honor the life and public service \nof Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whose passing signifies a \ngreat loss for our country. Justice Scalia was a devoted family man, \nscholar, and tireless public servant. He faithfully served Nevadans and \nall Americans for over 30 years on our Nation's highest Court. My \nthoughts and prayers continue to go out to his wife, Maureen, and the \nentire Scalia family.\n  Born on March 11, 1936, to Salvatore and Catherine Scalia, Justice \nScalia was a disciplined, intellectual conservative from a young age. A \ndiligent student who studied his way to become valedictorian at \nGeorgetown University and graduating magna cum laude at Harvard Law \nSchool, Justice Scalia began his legal career in Cleveland, OH in 1961. \nAfter practicing law for 6 years in Cleveland, Justice Scalia accepted \na position teaching administrative law at the University of Virginia.\n  Justice Scalia entered public service in 1972, during which he served \nas general counsel for the Office of Telecommunications Policy and \nchairman of the Administrative Conference of\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nthe United States. In these positions, he expanded his expertise in \nadministrative law, a topic that interested him throughout his career. \nIn 1974, Justice Scalia became the Assistant Attorney General for the \nOffice of Legal Counsel. It was here that Justice Scalia would argue \nand later win his first case before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed Justice Scalia to the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Justice Scalia's \noriginalist mindset, keen perception, and witty writing caught the \nattention of President Reagan, making Justice Scalia a top prospect to \nfill a potential Supreme Court vacancy. In 1986, Justice Scalia was \nconfirmed by the Senate upon the retirement of Chief Justice Warren \nBurger. As a Supreme Court Justice, Justice Scalia would dramatically \nchange the Court through his powerful dissents and sharp oral \narguments.\n  Throughout his over 30-year tenure on the bench, Justice Scalia never \nstrayed from his conservative principles and steadfast dedication to \nupholding the Constitution. His prominent leadership and originalist \nphilosophy will never be forgotten as his legacy will live on through \ngenerations. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me today in \nremembering and celebrating the life of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, Antonin Scalia was one of the \ngreatest Supreme Court Justices in the history of our country. A lion \nof the law, Justice Scalia spent his tenure on the bench championing \nfederalism, the separation of powers, and our fundamental liberties. He \nwas a passionate defender of the Constitution--not the Constitution as \nit has been contorted and revised by generations of activist Justices, \nbut the Constitution as it was understood by the people who ratified it \nand made it the law of the land. Scalia understood that if the \nConstitution's meaning was not grounded in its text, history, and \nstructure, but could instead by revised by judicial fiat, then the \npeople were no longer sovereign. No longer would the Nation be governed \nby law, which expresses the will of the people; it would be governed \nby, as Scalia put it, ``an unelected committee of nine.'' This, he \nbelieved, ``robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted \nin the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: \nthe freedom to govern themselves.''\n  As one of the leading advocates of this restrained judicial \nphilosophy, Justice Scalia became an intellectual force on the Court, \nwhere he authored a number of noteworthy majority opinions. In 1997, \nfor example, Scalia wrote the opinion in Printz v. United States, one \nof the few cases in the last century where the Supreme Court has \nactually limited the Federal Government's power to coerce the states. \nIn 2001, in Kyllo v. United States, he led the Court in holding that \nthe Fourth Amendment requires the government to obtain a warrant before \nusing high-tech equipment to invade the sanctity of the home. And in \n2008, he penned the lead opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, \nwhich finally recognized the people's individual right under the Second \nAmendment to keep and bear arms.\n  As important as these majority opinions were, though, Justice Scalia \nwas even better known for his dissents, in which he let his true \npersonality--jovial, acerbic, and witty--fully shine through. Scalia \nunderstood that changing the languishing legal culture would take \ndrastic measures, so he wrote his dissents with a specific target in \nmind: law students. His aim? To delight their senses and engage their \nbrains. To this end, he liberally employed colorful metaphors, pithy \nphrases, and biting logic; and he mercilessly, yet playfully, exposed \nthe abundant flaws in the writing and reasoning of other Justices. Pure \napplesauce. Jiggery-pokery. Argle-bargle. If you squinted hard enough, \nyou could almost convince yourself that G.K. Chesterton had taken a \nseat on the Supreme Court.\n  But perhaps the highest compliment I can pay to Justice Scalia is \nthis: Several of his key opinions went against some of his staunchest \nsupporters--and they still loved him. Why is that?\n  The answer is simple: Even in disagreement, Justice Scalia's \nsupporters had confidence that he did not make up his mind by reading \nthe political tea leaves, by voting lockstep with ideological cohorts, \nor by working his way backward from a desired end to whatever means was \nnecessary to reach that end. Rather, he actually attempted to interpret \nthe law; that is, he consistently did his best to come to a conclusion \nbased on the only items that make a Supreme Court opinion valid in the \nfirst place: text and logic.\n  You don't have to take my word on this, though. Unlike many in our \nmodern society who espouse ``diversity'' yet surround themselves with \nideological yes-men, Justice Scalia actively sought out opposing views. \nHis typical practice was to hire at least one ``liberal'' law clerk per \nterm so that he would always have someone calling him out for \nunexpected mistakes and weaknesses. And in the wake of Scalia's \npassing, one of those clerks--a self-identified liberal--wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       If there was a true surprise during my year clerking for \n     Scalia, it was how little reference he made to political \n     outcomes. What he cared about was the law, and where the \n     words on the page took him. More than any one opinion, this \n     will be his lasting contribution to legal thought. Whatever \n     our beliefs, he forced lawyers and scholars to engage on his \n     terms--textual analysis and original meaning. He forced us \n     all to acknowledge that words cannot mean anything we want \n     them to mean; that we have to impose a degree of discipline \n     on our thinking. A discipline I value to this day.\n\n  I first met Justice Scalia in 1996, when I was serving as a law clerk \nfor Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was a judicial gamechanger in \nhis own right. And I had the good fortune of knowing Scalia personally \nfor 20 years. He was brilliant, passionate, and full of humor. He \nadored his wife, Maureen; his nine children; and his 36 grandchildren. \nHe had a zest for life. He relished anchovy pizzas at A.V. Ristorante \nItaliano, where he would take his law clerks and the clerks of other \nJustices. Over the decades, Scalia inspired and mentored a generation \nof conservatives on the bench and in the legal academy.\n  Any advocate who stood before Justice Scalia, as I was privileged to \ndo nine times, knew to expect withering questions that would cut to the \nquick of the case. When he was with you--when he believed the law was \non your side--he was ferociously with you. And when he was against you, \nhe would relentlessly expose the flaws in your case.\n  President Ronald Reagan could not have picked a better person to \nexemplify the true, nonpartisan role of a judge. A philosopher-king \nJustice Scalia was not. Rather, he showed the world, with his trademark \nwit and impassioned personality, what a legitimate, limited, and \nprincipled judiciary would actually look like. An incomparable writer, \nScalia's legacy will live on for generations. He wasn't perfect, but he \nwas close. What his supporters--myself included--treasured especially \nwas the rock-solid ground he gave us on which to expect so much more \nfrom everyone else. And in doing so, he, along with Chief Justice \nRehnquist and others, helped spark a revolution on a Court where \npolitics and power had been the only guideposts for decisionmaking for \nfar too long. That, more than anything else, is Scalia's great \ncontribution to the Nation and will be his steadfast legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1436-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1436-S1437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HARRIET TUBMAN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of \nHarriet Tubman on Harriet Tubman Day. Harriet Tubman is a true \ntrailblazer and one of the most inspiring people in the history of our \nNation and in the history of the State of Maryland.\n  Tubman was born into slavery around 1822 in Maryland's Dorchester \nCounty on the Eastern Shore. After 30 years of enslavement, she \nescaped. But instead of staying up North with her newfound freedom, she \nreturned to the Eastern Shore 13 times to lead her family and hundreds \nof other slaves to freedom, becoming the most well-known ``conductor'' \nof the Underground Railroad. Harriet Tubman was such a central figure \nin liberating slaves that many simply knew her as Moses.\n  In addition to her work liberating slaves through the Underground \nRailroad, Tubman served as a Union scout and spy during the Civil War. \nShe was the first woman to lead an armed expedition, guiding the raid \nat Combahee\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\nFerry and liberating 700 slaves. After the war, she became an active \nleader in the women's suffrage movement and opened a home to serve the \naging African-American community in her new hometown of Auburn, NY.\n  In 2014, Congress established the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \nNational Historical Park, which creates a National Park on Maryland's \nEastern Shore dedicated to tracing Tubman's early life and work leading \nthe Underground Railroad. Congress also established the Harriet Tubman \nNational Historical Park in Auburn, NY, which will commemorate her \nlater years as an active participant in the women's suffrage movement \nand a caregiver for aging African Americans.\n  I am proud that Congress has recognized Harriet Tubman's lifelong \ndedication to our country through the establishment of these two \nnational parks. We must continue to tell the stories of heroes like \nHarriet Tubman, amplify the voices of more women and people of color, \nand make sure they are equally represented in our national parks and \nmonuments. I also urge Secretary Lew to include Harriet Tubman's \nportrait on our currency as the U.S. Department of the Treasury \nredesigns the $10 bill.\n  As Harriet Tubman said, ``Every great dream begins with a dreamer. \nAlways remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and \nthe passion to reach for the stars to change the world.''\n  It is my hope that, as we commemorate this Harriet Tubman Day, we can \nall follow Harriet Tubman's example and work together to change the \nworld for the better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1437-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING OFFICER ASHLEY GUINDON\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, people across the Washington area were \nsaddened by the death of Officer Ashley Guindon, slain in the line of \nduty just one day after being sworn into the Prince William County \nPolice Department in Virginia. This brave police officer is also being \nmourned in New Hampshire, especially in her hometown of Merrimack, \nwhere the law enforcement community considers her one of their own. As \nMerrimack Police Chief Mark Doyle said: ``When any law enforcement \nofficer is struck down, it leaves a hole in our hearts. The fact that \nshe and her family are part of the Merrimack community drives that \npoint home even more so.''\n  Ashley was the only child of Sharon and the late David Guindon, a \nNavy veteran who also served in the Marine Corps Reserve and later the \nNew Hampshire National Guard. After graduating from Merrimack High in \n2005, she followed in her father's footsteps by joining the Marine \nCorps Reserve. Ashley loved flying and went on to earn a bachelor's \ndegree in aeronautical science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical \nUniversity in Florida and later a master's degree in forensic science. \nAs a Marine Reservist for 6 years, she flew helicopters and used her \nforensic skills to assist the Mortuary Affairs Office.\n  Ashley had a passion for public service and was always eager to help \npeople in need. She volunteered with a suicide prevention program and \nregularly spent Thanksgiving helping out at a soup kitchen. She is \nfondly remembered by teachers and classmates at Merrimack High as \nexceptionally kind and friendly and as the talented leader of the \nMerrimack Cardinals cheerleading team.\n  As a newly sworn-in police officer, Ashley was struck down while \ncoming to the assistance of a woman who was being threatened by her \nhusband. ``She has accomplished more in 28 years than I think I could \nin 100,'' Prince William County Police Chief Stephan Hudson told The \nWashington Post. ``That was her desire: to serve, to be involved with \nthings that mattered, to give her life to something worth giving it to. \nAnd that's exactly what she did.''\n  In New Hampshire as in Virginia, the loss of a police officer is felt \ndeeply in the local community and far beyond. We know that the work of \nlaw enforcement professionals is difficult and dangerous. They perform \ntheir duties with great professionalism and selflessness, putting their \nlives on the line every day.\n  Ashley Guindon worked and studied hard to become a superbly qualified \nlaw enforcement professional. She was proud to wear the badge and to be \na police officer. She gave her life in the line of duty, coming to the \nassistance of a stranger. I join with so many others in the Granite \nState and across the Washington area in expressing my respect and \nadmiration for this remarkable young woman and my deep condolences to \nSharon Guindon and the entire family. I know how proud they are of \nAshley. We are all proud of Ashley. She was America at its finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1437-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1437-S1438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES BROWN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize James Walter \nBrown, a true public servant, an accomplished businessman, and a \nlongtime family friend. Over the course of the last 30 years, Jim has \nserved at some of the highest levels of the State and Federal \nGovernments; most recently, as my chief of staff here in the Senate. \nFor 9 years, my staff and I benefitted from his considerable \nexperience, sage counsel, and signature personal charm.\n  Jim's impressive academic credentials prepared him well for success: \na diploma from Scranton Preparatory School; an undergraduate degree \nfrom Villanova University; and a J.D. from the University of Virginia. \nHe also has a combination of substantial public and private sector \nexperience from which to draw. He began his public service career as a \ncounsel and, later, staff director for the Subcommittee on Oversight \nfor the House Banking Committee. After serving the Federal Government, \nJim returned to Pennsylvania to join the prestigious Pennsylvania law \nfirm, Dilworth Paxson, where my father was a partner. In a pattern that \nwould be repeated throughout his career, Jim's skill and dedication \nwere quickly recognized by those around him, and he made partner \nhimself in just 4 short years.\n  When my father was elected Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986, he asked \nJim to return to public service as the Secretary of the Department of \nGeneral Services for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He would serve \nonly 10 months in that position before being called on again by my \nfather, this time to take on the role of executive secretary to the \nGovernor. Jim continued to prove his commitment to his work and to \nPennsylvania, and in 1989, Governor Casey named him chief of staff at \nthe young age of 37. Serving as one of the chief executive officers in \none of the most populous States in the Nation is a daunting task, but \nJim approached this challenge like he would every other in his life: \nwith poise, determination, and a commitment to excellence. He served as \nchief of staff until late 1994. His strong and patient manner was \ncrucial in guiding State government through the difficult months of \n1993 while Governor Casey recuperated from serious health issues. After \nleaving State service, he continued his dedication to Pennsylvania \nthrough his service as chairman of the Pennsylvania Higher Education \nFacilities Authority, chairman of the Pennsylvania Public School \nBuilding Authority, and chairman of the Finance Committee of the \nPennsylvania Housing Finance Agency.\n  When I was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006, I knew Jim would be \nthe best architect to help me build my Senate organization. He moved to \nrecruit the best and brightest for our team and quickly set up a highly \nfunctional and transparent office to work for the best interests of the \ncitizens of Pennsylvania. He fostered an internal culture of hard work \nand mutual respect and established a firm open door policy within the \noffice. Jim eschewed the notion of a hierarchical Senate office and \nreferred to himself as the ``first among equals,'' rolling up his \nsleeves ``for the good of the order,'' as he was fond of saying. He \ntook a particular interest in the professional development of our \njunior staff and interns, happily engaging in countless career \ncounseling sessions, as he called them. While some managers quickly \nforget about the staff who move on, Jim did the opposite; instead, he \ngrew with care a formidable alumni association of past staff and \ninterns, staying in touch with people as their careers took them to \ndifferent posts here in Washington and beyond.\n  It is a rare honor to work with anyone of Jim's caliber, but rarer \nstill when that person can be counted as one\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\nof your closest friends. Over the years, from his time as a mid-level \nstaffer in the House of Representatives, to the chief of staff to the \nGovernor of Pennsylvania, from his success in the private sector, to \nhis public service in the Senate, Jim has always stood out as \nexceptional. Serving in the Senate has been one the highest honors of \nmy life, equaled only by the privilege of working with a man of such \nintegrity and professionalism.\n  As Jim leaves Senate service, I must thank his patient wife Lynne, \nwho tolerated her husband living in Washington for half of every week \nin the name of public service. While Jim's day job kept him closer to \nhis son, Patrick; daughter-in law, Michelle; and daughter, Laura, I \nknow he is eager to give his Buick a rest and spend more time back at \nhome in the Commonwealth. I wish Jim and his entire family good health \nand good fortune as they embark on this next phase of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1438-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT JAMES J. GERAGHTY\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join with people across my \nState of New Hampshire in mourning the loss of State police Lieutenant \nJames J. Geraghty, who passed away late last month after a valiant \nbattle with cancer. He devoted his career to public service, serving in \nthe U.S. Army, later as a police officer in Hudson, NH, and for the \nlast 24 years as a State trooper.\n  ``His priorities in life were well defined,'' said his friend and \ncolleague, State police Lieutenant John Marasco. ``He was committed to \nhis family, he was committed to this organization, and he was committed \nas the lieutenant overseeing the Major Crimes Unit to delivering \njustice to victims, many of whom were victims of homicide and relied on \nhis voice to bring that justice to them.''\n  Jim, as he was known to family and friends, was born in Boston, MA, \nand grew up in Tewksbury. He attended St. John's Prep in Danvers, MA, \nand the University of Lowell before joining the U.S. Army in 1984. \nAfter assignments at U.S. Army bases in the southern United States and \nGermany, his love of New England motivated him to end his military \nservice and return home for what would be a long career in law \nenforcement. He began his service with the police department in Hudson, \nNH, and went on to serve for two decades as a State trooper, respected \nby his colleagues as a model officer, mentor, and leader. He was \npromoted to detective sergeant in 2008 and took command of the major \ncrimes unit. He retired in 2015.\n  Jim was deeply devoted to his wife of 30 years, Valerie, and their \nfour adult children, Jimmy, Colleen, Katie, and Erin. Friends say that \nhis mantra was ``family first.'' He cherished annual family vacations \nin Wells, ME. Instead of talking about himself, he would often speak \nglowingly about the achievements of his children.\n  At the 2015 Congressional Achievement Awards ceremony, Lieutenant \nGeraghty received a richly deserved Lifetime Achievement Award--the \ncapstone of a distinguished career in public service. An inscription at \nArlington National Cemetery accurately describes his service both in \nthe military and in law enforcement: ``Not for fame or reward, nor \nlured by ambition or goaded by necessity, but in simple obedience to \nduty.''\n  I would like to express my gratitude to New Hampshire State police \nLieutenant James Geraghty for his service and my sincere condolences to \nhis beloved wife and family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/10/senate-section/article/S1438-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1438-S1439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN for the Committee on Armed Services.\n       *Eric K.

A bill to provide housing opportunities for individuals \nliving with HIV or AIDS; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joining my \ncolleague, Senator Collins, in introducing a bill to update the funding \nformula for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, or HOPWA, \nprogram.\n  HOPWA is a program within the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, HUD, that provides state and local governments with \nresources to ensure that stable housing and supportive services are \navailable for low-income individuals living with HIV/AIDS and their \nfamilies.\n  Stable and affordable housing is a critical component of treatment \nfor HIV-positive individuals. More than half of this population will \nface homelessness or an unstable housing situation at some point during \nthe course of their illness. Medication for treatment is extremely \nexpensive, and the assistance offered by HOPWA results in better \nmanagement of this illness, reduces the risk of HIV transmission, and \nensures that better public health outcomes can be achieved.\n  Our bipartisan legislation seeks to strengthen HOPWA by improving the \naccuracy of the formula used to distribute funding to housing programs \nthat benefit people living with HIV/AIDS. This improved funding formula \nwould take into account the number of persons currently living in a \ncommunity with HIV/AIDS.\n  HOPWA's current funding formula instead considers the cumulative \nnumber of individuals diagnosed with HIV in a community since 1981, and \nincludes those individuals who have since passed away. In fact, \naccording to HUD, 55 percent of the cases used to determine funding \nallocations under the current formula are deceased individuals. As a \nresult, this diverts already limited funding from communities that are \ndealing with the effects of this epidemic most acutely today\n  Our bill proposes a more accurate formula that will protect low-\nincome individuals living with HIV/AIDS and their families and will \nbetter target federal resources to the states and localities with the \ngreatest need today. In short, we hope to make the program more \neffective and responsive in addressing the current needs of \ncommunities.\n  Furthermore, to ease the move to a fairer allocation of resources, \nthe bill transitions current grantees to the new formula over a 5-year \nperiod. Grantees will not lose more than 5 percent of their share of \nHOPWA formula funds in each successive year until fiscal year 2021 and \ncannot gain more than 10 percent of their share in each successive \nfiscal year.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her partnership, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this bipartisan bill, which will enable communities to \nprovide care to those living with HIV/AIDS by ensuring that their \ncurrent housing challenges can be addressed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 2669.
