Mr. President, it is a hard thing to admit you are wrong. \nIt is always very difficult. It is not very pleasing to look back and \nsay to yourself: Oh, I wish I wasn't so far off; I was way off.\n  But as public servants, we have to accept reality, regardless of \nwhere we may have stood or what we may have said in the past.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress are trying their utmost to \nescape the reality that ObamaCare is a smashing success.\n  Just consider a few of the facts--and these are only a few of them: \n16.4 million Americans now have quality health coverage, many for the \nfirst time in decades, many for the first time in their lives.\n  Since 2013, the United States has seen the largest decline in the \nuninsured rate--ever. Nine in ten Americans have health insurance. In \nthe last 18 months, the uninsured rate for nonelderly adults has fallen \nby 35 percent. Health care costs have grown at their slowest rate in 50 \nyears.\n  Since 2011, the number of preventable deaths at hospitals and care \ncenters has dropped by 50,000. That is 50,000 lives--50,000 people are \nalive today who wouldn't have been but for ObamaCare, and ObamaCare \nenrollees are overwhelmingly satisfied with their coverage.\n  Those are the facts. No matter how hard my Republican colleagues try, \nthey cannot wish those numbers away. All of the doomsday reports are \nwrong.\n  I understand that many Senate Republicans have worked hard to make \ntheir opposition to ObamaCare their legacy.\n  In June of 2009, the Republican leader--the majority leader--was on \nthe Senate floor decrying health care reform more than 3 months before \nthe bill even passed. His mind was made up before he even saw the bill.\n  And so it has been with too many other Republicans in this body, and \ncertainly in the other body where they voted--I lost track of it--65 \ntimes to repeal it. Each time it has been a colossal flop.\n  The junior Senator from Wyoming, for example, has been relentless in \nhis condemnation of ObamaCare. He comes to the floor all the time with \nhis charts and everything, but he avoids the facts. He has been \nrelentless in his condemnation of ObamaCare--before and after the bill \nwas passed. But he is wrong. I don't say so, the facts say so.\n  For example, Paul Krugman's piece in the New York Times today \neffectively lays out the options congressional Republicans have with \nrespect to ObamaCare. Remember, this isn't some high school teacher \ntalking about the merits of ObamaCare, it is a Nobel laureate in \neconomics.\n  This is what he said today, and I quote part of what he said--simply \nput, Republicans were wrong on ObamaCare. In this body, it is \nunderstandable for a Senator to be dead wrong on some piece of policy \nfrom time to time. It happens. But what is not understandable and what \nis not acceptable is for the entire Republican Party to double down on \nits opposition after they have already been proven wrong. It says a lot \nabout their inability to govern and, quite frankly, their grasp on \nreality--that Republicans refuse to acknowledge facts.\n  That is a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full piece \nfrom the New York Times written by Paul Krugman.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 27, 2015]\n\n                            Nobody Said That\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Imagine yourself as a regular commentator on public \n     affairs--maybe a paid pundit, maybe a supposed expert in some \n     area, maybe just an opinionated billionaire. You weigh in on \n     a major policy initiative that's about to happen, making \n     strong predictions of disaster. The Obama stimulus, you \n     declare, will cause soaring interest rates; the Fed's bond \n     purchases will ``debase the dollar'' and cause high \n     inflation; the Affordable Care Act will collapse in a vicious \n     circle of declining enrollment and surging costs.\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\n       But nothing you predicted actually comes to pass. What do \n     you do?\n       You might admit that you were wrong, and try to figure out \n     why. But almost nobody does that; we live in an age of \n     unacknowledged error.\n       Alternatively, you might insist that sinister forces are \n     covering up the grim reality. Quite a few well-known pundits \n     are, or at some point were, ``inflation truthers,'' claiming \n     that the government is lying about the pace of price \n     increases. There have also been many prominent Obamacare \n     truthers declaring that the White House is cooking the books, \n     that the policies are worthless, and so on.\n       Finally, there's a third option: You can pretend that you \n     didn't make the predictions you did. I see that a lot when it \n     comes to people who issued dire warnings about interest rates \n     and inflation, and now claim that they did no such thing. \n     Where I'm seeing it most, however, is on the health care \n     front. Obamacare is working better than even its supporters \n     expected--but its enemies say that the good news proves \n     nothing, because nobody predicted anything different.\n       Go back to 2013, before reform went fully into effect, or \n     early 2014, before the numbers on first-year enrollment came \n     in. What were Obamacare's opponents predicting? The answer \n     is, utter disaster. Americans, declared a May 2013 report \n     from a House committee, were about to face a devastating \n     ``rate shock,'' with premiums almost doubling on average.\n       And it would only get worse: At the beginning of 2014 the \n     right's favored experts--or maybe that should be \n     ``experts''--were warning about a ``death spiral'' in which \n     only the sickest citizens would sign up, causing premiums to \n     soar even higher and many people to drop out of the program.\n       What about the overall effect on insurance coverage? \n     Several months into 2014 many leading Republicans--including \n     John Boehner, the speaker of the House--were predicting that \n     more people would lose coverage than gain it. And everyone on \n     the right was predicting that the law would cost far more \n     than projected, adding hundreds of billions if not trillions \n     to budget deficits.\n       What actually happened? There was no rate shock: average \n     premiums in 2014 were about 16 percent lower than projected. \n     There is no death spiral: On average, premiums for 2015 are \n     between 2 and 4 percent higher than in 2014, which is a much \n     slower rate of increase than the historical norm. The number \n     of Americans without health insurance has fallen by around 15 \n     million, and would have fallen substantially more if so many \n     Republican-controlled states weren't blocking the expansion \n     of Medicaid. And the overall cost of the program is coming in \n     well below expectations.\n       One more thing: You sometimes hear complaints about the \n     alleged poor quality of the policies offered to newly insured \n     families. But a new survey by J. D. Power, the market \n     research company, finds that the newly enrolled are very \n     satisfied with their coverage--more satisfied than the \n     average person with conventional, non-Obamacare insurance.\n       This is what policy success looks like, and it should have \n     the critics engaged in soul-searching about why they got it \n     so wrong. But no.\n       Instead, the new line--exemplified by, but not unique to, a \n     recent op-ed article by the hedge-fund manager Cliff Asness--\n     is that there's nothing to see here: ``That more people would \n     be insured was never in dispute.'' Never, I guess, except in \n     everything ever said by anyone in a position of influence on \n     the American right. Oh, and all the good news on costs is \n     just a coincidence.\n       It's both easy and entirely appropriate to ridicule this \n     kind of thing. But there are some serious stakes here, and \n     they go beyond the issue of health reform, important as it \n     is.\n       You see, in a polarized political environment, policy \n     debates always involve more than just the specific issue on \n     the table. They are also clashes of world views. Predictions \n     of debt disaster, a debased dollar, and Obama death spirals \n     reflect the same ideology, and the utter failure of these \n     predictions should inspire major doubts about that ideology.\n       And there's also a moral issue involved. Refusing to accept \n     responsibility for past errors is a serious character flaw in \n     one's private life. It rises to the level of real wrongdoing \n     when policies that affect millions of lives are at stake.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Religious Freedom\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Congress unanimously passed the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act in 1989 with a 98-to-0 vote in this \nbody for that legislation, including 19 Senators still serving today--\n11 Republicans and 8 Democrats. We asserted that religious freedom \n``undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States.'' Yet, \nreligious freedom today is under attack across the country.\n  Political activists are attacking religious freedom as the enemy of \nequality, claiming that laws protecting religious freedom are designed \nto enshrine discrimination in State law. This effort is misinformed, it \nis misguided, and it is misleading. It will serve only to harm \nreligious freedom and to demonize religious people, many of whom would \nbe allies in the effort to promote equality.\n  The attack on religious freedom misunderstands the history and \nimportance of religious freedom in America. That story began more than \n400 years ago, as one religious community after another came to these \nshores so they could freely live their faith. As far back as December \n1657, residents of the community known today as Flushing, NY, signed a \npetition called the Flushing Remonstrance. This petition protested a \nban on certain religious practices that prevented the Quakers from \nworshipping. The petition signers stated that they would let everyone \ndecide for themselves how to worship.\n  One hundred twenty years later, the original States and the Federal \nGovernment specifically protected religious freedom in their \nConstitutions. Indeed, the phrase America's Founders chose for the \nfirst individual right listed in the First Amendment--the free exercise \nof religion--is very important. The free exercise clause is not limited \nto particular exercises of religion or to the exercise of religion by \ncertain parties but instead protects the free exercise of religion \nitself. James Madison wrote in 1758 that exercising religion according \nto conviction and conscience is an inalienable right. Two hundred years \nlater, Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg declared that ``to the \nFounding Fathers, freedom of religion was regarded to be preeminent \namong fundamental rights.''\n  This belief in the special importance and preeminent status of \nreligious freedom did not end with America's founding generation. In \nhis famous 1941 State of the Union Address, President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt asserted that ``the right of every person to worship God in \nhis own way'' is an essential human freedom. Just 4 years later, after \nthe end of World War II, the United States signed the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. This crucial document includes religious \nfreedom as one of the inalienable rights universal to all members of \nthe human family.\n  Our last several Presidents have issued annual proclamations \ndeclaring January 16 Religious Freedom Day. This date marks the \nanniversary of the Virginia General Assembly's adoption of the Virginia \nStatute for Religious Freedom. In this year's proclamation, President \nObama said that religious freedom is a fundamental liberty and defined \nreligious freedom as the right of every person to live and practice \ntheir faith how they choose. In previous years, President Obama has \ncalled religious freedom a universal and natural human right and an \nessential part of human dignity. President George W. Bush similarly \ndeclared that no human freedom is more fundamental than the right to \nfreely practice one's religious beliefs. President Clinton said that \nreligious freedom is a fundamental human right, a core value\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nof our democracy, and essential to our dignity as human beings.\n  I want my colleagues to appreciate how robust religious freedom has \nhistorically been in our country. Article 18 of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights states that religious freedom includes \n``freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or \nprivate, to manifest . . . religion or belief in teaching, practice, \nworship and observance.''\n  In America, religious freedom has always included freedom in both \nbelief and behavior, in private and in public, individually and \ncollectively. Today's attacks on religious freedom know none of this. \nInstead, they dismiss religious freedom as a sham, as little more than \nan excuse for mean-spirited people who want to discriminate. Today's \nopponents of religious freedom laws either do not know or do not care \nthat religious freedom is an integral part of the origin, the identity, \nand the very life of our Nation.\n  They are also clearly misinformed about how, even in America, the \nreality of religious freedom has not always matched the promise of \nreligious freedom. The truth is that government does many things that \ncompromise, burden, and even prohibit the exercise of religion. The \nFlushing Remonstrance was necessary because community leaders allowed \nreligious freedom for some but not for others. Government has even \nsometimes passed laws explicitly designed to limit or stamp out \nparticular religious practices or religious communities.\n  More often, government undermines and restricts the exercise of \nreligion through indirect impact. General laws that on their face do \nnot explicitly target religion can nonetheless have a profound impact \nwhen applied to particular religious practices. Zoning ordinances may \nrestrict where churches can meet, whether they may expand their meeting \nplace, and what services they may offer. Religious institutions may be \nforced to hire individuals who do not share their faith. Regulations \nmay prohibit individuals from wearing items required by their faith or \nrequire employees to work on their Sabbath.\n  Government at all levels--Federal, State, and local--is becoming ever \nmore intrusive in virtually every facet of life. Unless government is \nmindful of its impact on religious practices, government will become \nincreasingly intrusive in matters of religion as well.\n  The attack on religious freedom is also misinformed about how \nimportant religious liberty laws are to protecting the exercise of \nreligion.\n  Prior to 1990, for more than a century the Supreme Court's \ninterpretation of the free exercise clause had gradually moved toward \nbroader application and stronger protection. In the 19th century, for \nexample, the Court said that the First Amendment protected religious \nbelief but not religious conduct, even though the First Amendment makes \nno such distinction. The Court subsequently adopted a more unified view \nof religious practice and set a standard that made it difficult for \ngovernment to interfere with either belief or conduct.\n  In 1981, the Supreme Court made clear that government ``may justify \nan inroad on religious liberty by showing it is the least restrictive \nmeans of achieving some compelling state interest.'' This standard was \nimportant for two reasons. First, it reflected the general importance \nof religious freedom in our country. Second, it applied to both \nreligious conduct and religious belief and protected against both \ndirect and indirect government burdens and restrictions.\n  In a 1990 case entitled ``Employment Division v. Smith,'' the Supreme \nCourt regrettably reversed course. Under the Court's new interpretation \nof the First Amendment, as set forth in Smith, the free exercise clause \napplies only when government directly burdens religion with a law \ntargeted at religious practice. The clause provides no protection at \nall when government burdens religion indirectly through a generally \napplicable law or regulation. Before the Smith decision, it had been \ndifficult but not impossible for government to interfere with the \nexercise of religion. Government had to show that a law or regulation \nburdening religion furthered a compelling State interest and was the \nleast restrictive means of achieving that interest. I might add, under \nthe Court's new Smith standard, however, government can make religious \npractice not only difficult but even impossible. Provided government \ndoes not specifically target religion for disfavor, it can pass all \nsorts of laws that interfere with worship, practice, or belief.\n  It would be hard to overstate the impact of Smith. In 1992, the \nCongressional Research Service found that as a result of Smith, ``free \nexercise claims have become markedly unsuccessful.'' Remember that the \ngovernment has its biggest impact on religion not through direct \nsuppression but, rather, by indirect restriction--by disregarding \nreligious practice as something needing special attention. Under Smith, \ngovernment can do exactly what the First Amendment forbids and prohibit \nthe free exercise of religion so long as it does so through generally \napplicable laws rather than laws targeted at specific groups.\n  Congress responded to Smith by enacting the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, or RFRA. I had a lot to do with that. RFRA's standard \nmirrored what the Supreme Court had only a few years earlier said the \nFirst Amendment required--namely, that government may impose a \nsubstantial burden on the exercise of religion only if it is the least \nrestrictive means of achieving a compelling government purpose.\n  RFRA does not automatically protect any specific exercise of \nreligion, nor does it automatically prohibit any specific government \naction that burdens religion. RFRA sets a standard that requires \nbalancing government action against religious freedom and puts a thumb \non the scale in favor of religious freedom. RFRA leaves it to the \ncourts, in individual cases based on real facts, to determine whether a \nparticular exercise of religion or a particular governmental action is \nmore important.\n  In 1997, the Supreme Court held in City of Boerne v. Flores that RFRA \napplies only to the Federal Government. This meant that once again \nreligious practice was vulnerable to virtually any restriction, \nregulation, or prohibition by State or local government. States \nresponded to the Flores decision just as Congress had responded to the \nSmith decision: They immediately began enacting State religious \nrestoration acts that set the same standard for State and local \ngovernments that the Federal statute still imposes on the Federal \nGovernment, the Federal statute called the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act. These State RFRAs differ in a few minor ways from the \nFederal RFRA but are identical to the Federal RFRA in the core \nprovision that really matters--the standard that government must \nsatisfy in order to burden religious exercise. Under all of these \nstatutes, government action that burdens religion must be the least \nrestrictive means of achieving a compelling government purpose.\n  I want my colleagues to understand two things about these religious \nfreedom laws: First, States are enacting State-level Religious Freedom \nRestoration Acts for the same reason Congress did. Without such laws, \nevery exercise of religion is vulnerable to restriction or even \nprohibition by government. Second, State versions of RFRA operate the \nsame way the Federal statute does. They set a standard and then leave \nthat standard for courts to apply in individual cases with real facts. \nIn every case, the party claiming RFRA protection must show that \ngovernment action imposes a substantial burden on his or her exercise \nof religion, and the government must show that this burden is the least \nrestrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest. \nWithout this protection, government action will trump religious \npractice in almost every case. With this protection, government action \nwill have to accommodate religious practice in at least some cases.\n  Those attacking religious freedom today are completely misinformed \nabout why these laws are passed and how they work to protect religious \nfreedom. They want people to believe that RFRA was passed to provide \ncover for discrimination masquerading as religious practice and to \ntherefore oppose efforts to pass or strengthen State-level RFRAs. That \naccount is complete fiction. RFRA was passed so that the fundamental \ninalienable right to practice religion can have at least some \nprotection.\n  What would happen if we treated the free speech clause of the First \nAmendment the way these activists treat the\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nfree exercise clause of the First Amendment? No one would be protected \nagainst government restrictions on speech because a few people might \nsay things the rest of us don't like.\n  In addition to being misinformed about religious freedom in America \nand how the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects it, the attack \non religious freedom today is misguided because discrimination--not \nreligious freedom--is the real problem.\n  I am sure my colleagues have heard the sound bite that RFRA legalizes \ndiscrimination. NBC News, for example, reported last year that the \nArizona RFRA ``would have permitted businesses in the state to deny \nservice to gays and lesbians for religious beliefs.''\n  I explained how RFRA works to make crystal clear that this claim is \nfalse. Neither the Federal Government nor any State RFRA legalizes, \npermits or prohibits anything. RFRA sets a standard that government \nmust meet when its actions burden the exercise of religion. Courts \napply that standard in individual cases based on real facts to decide \nwhether the religious practice or the government action is more \nimportant.\n  I need to make one more important distinction before looking at \nanother reason why this claim is false. Those attacking religious \nfreedom today use a very broad brush when raising the specter that \nbusinesses will ``deny service.'' They apparently want us to believe \nthat businesses everywhere are intent on turning away customers, on not \ndoing business with certain people. That not only makes no sense, but \nit just plain is not true.\n  Instead, the controversy exists only with regard to a few businesses \nthat supply particular goods or services for weddings. A small number \nof business owners apparently feel that, while they gladly serve the \ngeneral public and provide goods and services to all types of \ncustomers, providing certain specific goods or services for a same-sex \nwedding would amount to supporting or endorsing something inconsistent \nwith their religious beliefs. Think what you want about those business \nowners, I want my colleagues to know that RFRA does not protect their \ndecision to refuse service today.\n  Here is what has to happen for a case pitting RFRA against a claim \ndiscrimination to exist. The particular State where the business is \nlocated must have a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual \norientation and gender identity in places of public accommodation such \nas businesses. The State must also have not only a Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act but one that applies between private parties. The \nbusiness would have to violate the antidiscrimination law and, if the \nbusiness were sued, argue that the antidiscrimination law imposed a \nsubstantial burden on the exercise of religion. Only then would a judge \ndecide whether--in that case based on its specific facts--the \nantidiscrimination law or the business owner's religious beliefs were \nmore important.\n  Do you see why the claim that RFRA, by itself, legalizes \ndiscrimination is absolutely, completely false? Not only does RFRA not \nlegalize anything, the situation in which RFRA would even be involved \ndoes not exist anywhere in America today. Right now, according to the \nHuman Rights Campaign, 17 States have the necessary antidiscrimination \nlaw, and only 4 of those 17 have a Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \nAnd of those four, none has a RFRA that applies to lawsuits between \nprivate parties. In other words, the number of States today in which a \nbusiness could look to RFRA to justify discrimination is precisely \nzero.\n  Moreover, the current controversy, misinformed and misguided as it \nis, has no doubt diminished the likelihood that States with \nantidiscrimination laws will now enact religious freedom laws. \nDiscrimination, not religious freedom, is the real problem. Despite \nwhat the activists want everyone to believe, Americans practice \nreligion every day in innumerable ways that have nothing whatsoever to \ndo with anyone's sexual orientation or gender identity. In the very few \nsituations in which religious freedom and discrimination might overlap, \nRFRA would actually be the way to sort out the conflict--the mechanism \nto balance these competing interests. Even though the exercise of \nreligion is a fundamental and inalienable right, it is not absolute. \nMany courts have found that government has a compelling interest in \nprohibiting discrimination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an excellent analysis of \nthis point by David Rivkin and Professor Elizabeth Price Foley that \nappeared in the Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  Here is the bottom line. The situation that activists want everyone \nto believe is sweeping the country cannot exist anywhere in America \ntoday. If the day ever comes when that situation does arise, many \napplying RFRA would place freedom from discrimination over freedom of \nreligion by a wide margin.\n  The attack on religious freedom today is not only misinformed about \nreligion freedom in America and how laws such as RFRA protect that \nfreedom, it is not only misguided in presenting religious freedom \nrather than discrimination as the real problem and RFRA as the culprit, \nbut it is also misleading in broadly painting religious people as mean-\nspirited bigots. That is wrong. That is just plain wrong.\n  It is also unfortunate because many Americans believe in both \nequality and religious freedom and could be allies in seeking to \nmaximize both. I voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act last \nCongress after working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to \nstrengthen its provisions protecting religious freedom. Earlier this \nyear, the Utah State Legislature passed and Governor Gary Herbert \nsigned a law prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing while \nalso protecting religious freedom.\n  How did we go from religious freedom being a fundamental and \ninalienable right to religious freedom laws being attacked as un-\nAmerican? How did we go from religious freedom being an essential human \nright that undergirds our Nation's very existence to activists calling \nlaws that protect religious freedom dangerous and even contemptuous?\n  Those attacking laws that protect religious freedom would deny any \nlegal protections for anyone to exercise religion in any way today \nbecause a few people might someday attempt to exercise their religion \nin a way that the courts would likely reject. This is a misinformed, \nmisguided, and misleading campaign that will only damage religious \nfreedom and demonize many who would work toward maximizing both \nequality and freedom for all Americans.\n  I was the prime sponsor in the Senate of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act. I went to Senator Kennedy. He was a friend, and we \njoined on many pieces of legislation that were in the best interests of \neverybody in America. At first, he said: I am not joining on that bill. \nThen I kept talking to him about it and how important it was. Finally, \nhe said: Yes, I am going to be a prime cosponsor on that bill. There \nare many other prime cosponsors on that bill.\n  When that bill was signed on the South Lawn of the White House by \nPresident Clinton, one of the most proud people on Earth on that \nsigning day happened to be Ted Kennedy, who knew that he had done \nright, who knew that it was right to protect the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act. And I know it is right. That is one reason we fought \nso hard for it, and it passed 97 to 3, if I recall it correctly--almost \nunanimously--and unanimously in the House, as far as I know.\n  It is time for us to wake up and realize that religious freedom is \nunder attack in this country. It is under attack because people don't \nunderstand the Constitution and people don't give a darn about the \nConstitution. It is under attack because some groups think they can get \nahead by attacking religious freedom. Frankly, we ought to decry that, \nand we all need to stand up for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, \nwhich upholds the first basic law of freedom in our Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 9, 2015]\n\n               Gay Rights, Religious Freedom and the Law\n\n          (By David B. Rivkin, Jr. and Elizabeth Price Foley)\n\n       There is a better route to protections than the battle in \n     Indiana.\n       Debates about the Indiana and Arkansas Religious Freedom \n     Restoration Acts, or\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\n     RFRAs, have regrettably pitted religious freedom against gay \n     rights. Critics claim the laws provide a license to \n     discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender \n     (LGBT) individuals. But this criticism shouldn't be aimed at \n     the religious-freedom laws, which don't license \n     discrimination based on sexual orientation or anything else.\n       Those wanting to advance LGBT rights should focus on \n     enacting laws that bar discrimination. If there is a legal \n     ``license'' to discriminate based on sexual orientation, it \n     is because few jurisdictions today provide protection against \n     such discrimination, or because the Constitution may immunize \n     such behavior in certain circumstances.\n       There is no federal law prohibiting private discrimination \n     based on sexual orientation. An executive order by President \n     Obama in 2014 bans such discrimination only for federal \n     workers and contractors. About 20 states and some \n     municipalities prohibit sexual-orientation discrimination in \n     workplaces and public accommodations. But the majority of \n     states still don't proscribe discrimination based on sexual \n     orientation, though discrimination based on race, gender, \n     ethnicity or national origin is banned.\n       The federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed by \n     overwhelming bipartisan majorities and signed by President \n     Clinton in 1993. It represented a backlash against the \n     Supreme Court's 1990 decision in Employment Division v. \n     Smith. That decision held that the First Amendment's Free \n     Exercise Clause doesn't allow a religious exemption from laws \n     of general applicability--e.g., compulsory military service, \n     or prohibitions on drug use or animal cruelty--even if those \n     laws substantially burden religious exercise.\n       The federal RFRA law supplanted Smith, declaring that the \n     government could substantially burden religious exercise only \n     upon proving a ``compelling'' government interest for doing \n     so, and using only the ``least restrictive means'' of \n     furthering that interest. The Supreme Court, for example, \n     recently affirmed that the federal RFRA allowed Hobby Lobby, \n     a corporation closely held by religious owners, to refuse \n     participation in ObamaCare's contraceptive mandate, which \n     would have required the company to provide contraceptives \n     that may destroy an already-fertilized egg.\n       Because the federal RFRA applies only to federal actions, \n     20 states have passed their own religious-freedom laws \n     designed to provide the same protection against state-imposed \n     religious burdens. Another 11 states have implemented similar \n     protections through court decisions, based on state \n     constitutions.\n       So why have the latest religious-freedom laws been so \n     controversial? RFRA has become a political focal point for \n     pent-up anger over the paucity of legal protections against \n     LGBT discrimination. A specific controversy is over the \n     application of such laws to lawsuits between private parties.\n       Indiana's RFRA applies ``regardless of whether the state or \n     any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.'' \n     Federal RFRA doesn't clearly apply to such private disputes, \n     and federal courts are divided on whether it should. Arkansas \n     adopted language identical to the federal RFRA.\n       Applying religious-freedom laws to private disputes has \n     stirred fears that businesses will be able to defend \n     discriminatory behavior when LGBT individuals sue them. This \n     fear is greatly overblown. First, in states or localities \n     where there is no law banning sexual-orientation \n     discrimination, individuals and businesses are allowed to \n     discriminate, with or without a RFRA.\n       Second, where it's illegal to discriminate, a religious-\n     freedom defense requires proving that the antidiscrimination \n     statute ``substantially burdens'' religion.\n       Third, even if it does, courts routinely conclude that \n     preventing discrimination is a compelling interest, so the \n     LGBT plaintiff wins. RFRA thus doesn't change outcomes--only \n     laws banning sexual-orientation discrimination will.\n       Such laws won't eliminate all legal questions, however. \n     Those engaged in activities with a strong expressive \n     component--e.g., officiating at a wedding--may claim that \n     their First Amendment free-speech or association rights trump \n     antidiscrimination statutes. Some of these claims may prove \n     successful.\n       Moreover, state and federal law allows individuals to \n     refuse to provide certain services, such as abortions, based \n     on moral objections. Similar conscience-based protections may \n     eventually be demanded to accommodate moral objections to \n     participation in same-sex weddings by the likes of wedding \n     planners, photographers or bakers.\n       Americans have generally settled on the proper reach of \n     statutes prohibiting race, gender, ethnicity or national \n     origin-based discrimination by banning it in places of \n     employment or public accommodation. With this consensus in \n     mind, states and the federal government should consider \n     statutes prohibiting in similar circumstances sexual-\n     orientation discrimination.\n       Religious-freedom laws merely recognizing religious \n     liberty--a centerpiece of liberal society--would then be more \n     likely to become as universally accepted as they were in the \n     1990s.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, while the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee is here, I want him to know of my admiration for \nhim for trying to work together in a bipartisan way on an especially \nthorny issue, this Iranian nuclear negotiation.\n  I read in today's paper that there are a lot of people who are trying \nto torpedo the chairman's good work by basically bringing up all kinds \nof poison pill amendments. If the chairman's conclusion is that he is \ngoing to stick with the unanimous product that came out of this \ncommittee, then I will be with him to keep that product clean so it can \ngo forward in the bipartisan way in which the chairman brought it to \nthe floor.\n\n\n                             Takata Airbags\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak on a different subject today. It \nis not as pleasant as the remarks I addressed to the chairman, and it \nis on a completely different subject matter. It is about the defective \nairbags manufactured by the Takata Corporation which are exploding in \npeople's faces and our collective effort to get them out of cars.\n  Instead of saving a life, these airbags--when they explode--either \nmaim or kill because of the defective construction. When the airbag \nexplodes, metal is coming out of the airbag like shrapnel and hitting \nthe occupant of the car--either the driver or the passenger.\n  Last November, we had a hearing in the commerce committee about these \nrupturing airbags and the recalls. The number of vehicles recalled due \nto the defective Takata airbags is going to be in the record books as \none of the largest in American history.\n  At that hearing, we saw that instead of preventing these deaths and \ninjuries, the opposite was happening. Interestingly, many of these \nincidents are happening in vehicles exposed to persistent high heat and \nhumidity.\n  This Senator is from Florida, so it is, sadly, no surprise that \nFlorida has been the epicenter of these incidents. Earlier this year, I \ncame to the floor and reported that Takata had received unconfirmed \nreports of 64 injuries and 5 deaths as a result of the exploding \nairbags. At the time, these numbers from Takata were far greater than \nwhat had been reported. Takata recently provided an update to the \ncommittee, and I have new numbers.\n  According to the most recent data as of the end of January, Takata \nhad identified 40 more alleged incidents of rupturing airbags, \nincluding 1 death. This brings the total number of alleged injuries \nfrom 64 to 105 and the total number of alleged deaths to 6. As one \nwould expect, 17 of the 40 newly reported incidents provided by Takata \nto our committee occurred in Florida. That brings the total number of \nalleged incidents of exploding Takata airbags in Florida--just in \nFlorida--to 35, including 1 that caused a death.\n  Now, these injuries have been very serious. I am not talking about a \nminor little nick. These injuries include facial fractures, blindness, \na broken sternum, and even quadriplegia. This Senator has visited with \none of his constituents--a big, strapping, healthy firefighter who will \nno longer be a firefighter because he does not have sight in one of his \neyes. But even the new numbers I just gave do not paint the full \npicture.\n  In fact, Reuters recently reported that another Takata airbag in \nFlorida ruptured just last month. The figures I reported earlier were \nas of the end of last January. The victim who was injured last month \nwas in a 2003 Honda Civic. He had a 1\\1/2\\-inch piece of metal shrapnel \nlodged into his neck after the airbag exploded. He was airlifted to the \nhospital and the doctors were able to remove the shrapnel, but now he \nhas a big scar and a constant reminder that this incident could and \nshould have been prevented.\n  The death that occurred in Florida was due to shrapnel cutting the \njugular vein of the victim. When the police got to that accident, \ninstead of thinking it was a traffic accident, they looked at the \ndriver and thought a homicide had just occurred. It didn't occur to \nthem that shrapnel from an exploding airbag killed the driver.\n  Honda has informed us that they are sending their recall notices out \nin both English and Spanish in order to more effectively reach \nconsumers. We appreciate what Takata has done in trying\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\nto ramp up their production of replacement inflators. After that Honda \nannouncement, Honda also started an ad campaign in both English and \nSpanish to remind owners to have their recalled airbag inflators \nreplaced, but obviously more still needs to be done.\n  We need to get to the root cause of the problem, that is what we need \nto do, and we need to make sure we know why these defective airbag \ninflators are failing. It may be the inflator or it may be the \npropellant inside. We need to know. So, yes, we need more replacement \ninflators, but we need to make sure they are actually safe replacement \ninflators instead of potentially producing more defective inflators.\n  It is my understanding that Honda and others are taking steps to \nensure the safety of the replacement inflators. Well, that needs to \nhappen right now and be validated right away by an independent third \nparty. We need to make sure we are able to prevent defects like this in \nthe future.\n  I am going to stay on Takata. This Senator is going to stay on the \nautomakers. This Senator is going to stay on the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration to do exactly that. But for right now, I \nurge anybody listening to me--if a defect is identified and you receive \na recall notice, get your car into the dealership for repair just as \nquickly as you can. I also want folks to know that even if they have \nnot received a notice from Takata, they should go to the Web site, \nsafecars.gov and put in their car's VIN number to check and see if it \nis subject to this or any other recall. That is imperative.\n  We are continuing to monitor this situation. We are going through \ntens of thousands of pages of documents related to this defect. I will \nkeep the Senate updated.\n  I am pleased to report that the Senate is very close to approving S. \n304, the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation, which Chairman Thune and I authored, would provide \nfinancial incentives for whistleblowers in the automotive sector to \nstep forward if they see a manufacturer that is hiding or failing to \naddress a dangerous defect.\n  Certainly none of us needs to be reminded about the ignition switch \ndefect coverup at General Motors. They hid that defect for a decade, \nand at least 87 people died because of it. This bill will hopefully \nhelp prevent such coverups in the future.\n  This bill, S. 304, is a small but meaningful step toward automobile \nsafety. I hope my colleagues will urge their constituents to check on \nthose Takata airbags by going online, and I urge my colleagues as well \nto clear this commonsense legislation. I certainly urge the House to do \nso as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator \nCoats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am just going to speak for a few minutes. \nI am happy to defer to the Senator from Tennessee, but it shouldn't \ntake more than 2 or 3 minutes.\n  If the Senator is interested, this is this week's installment of my \n``Waste of the Week'' speech. I come to the floor every week to point \nout some spending of taxpayer dollars that perhaps we should absolutely \nsave. The cost to the taxpayers, as I will point out shortly, is in the \ntens of billions, if not hundreds of billions, of dollars on programs \nthat have already been identified by government agencies as worthless, \nfraudulent, unnecessary, and wasteful. While we have been unable--and \nthe Senator from Tennessee was a very pivotal part of this effort--to \ncome to an agreement on dealing with the larger issue of saving our \ncountry from insolvency down the line, the very least we can do is to \npoint out those areas where we are spending money that absolutely does \nnot need to be spent and can be returned to the taxpayer. This week's \nwaste of the week is such that I can't keep from chuckling over how \nthis could happen, but it happens.\n  Everybody has heard about Ponce de Leon's search for the fountain of \nyouth. Obviously, that hasn't happened. A recently released Social \nSecurity Inspector General's report found that 6.5 million individuals \nover the age of 112 still have active Social Security numbers. How can \nthis happen? Well, it happened because in 1936 when the program \nstarted, there were some people even from the mid-1800s who were \nenrolled in Social Security, and they have never been taken off the \nrolls. Now, obviously, these people are not all receiving checks, but \nit opens the prospect for fraud and waste and people getting these \nnumbers, using them, and then receiving Social Security benefits \nillegally.\n  In this inspector general's report, the Social Security \nAdministration is faulted for poorly managing data on ``number holders \nwho exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies and were likely \ndeceased.''\n  Well, to put it mildly, if we have 6.5 million people in America who \nare over the age of 112, my guess is that most of those people, if not \nall of those people, are deceased--not likely deceased but are, in \nfact, deceased.\n  Of those 6.5 million, the Social Security Administration inspector \ngeneral has determined that nearly 3,900 numbers were run through the \nU.S. Government's E-Verify system for people more than a century old. \nThe E-Verify system is used when someone applies for a job. So that \nmeans thousands of people over 100 years old are applying for these new \njobs. Obviously, someone is fraudulently using the system to report a \nSocial Security number for someone over 112 years of age who is in the \nE-Verify system as applying for a job.\n  Auditors also discovered nearly 67,000 Social Security numbers in \nrecent years were used to report wages for people other than the \ncardholders themselves. The workers reported about $3 billion in \nearnings between 2006 and 2011, and then those earnings are used to \ncalculate their Social Security benefits.\n  Obviously, this is an issue that needs to be addressed. Auditors have \nproposed that the Social Security Administration take action to correct \ndeath records, but the Social Security Administration says it doesn't \nwant to divert resources away from efforts to improve payment accuracy. \nI suggest the Social Security Administration might want to reassess \ntheir assessment.\n  A gaping hole such as this undermines the confidence of the American \npeople in our government and in the way we run this business of \ngovernment in both the Social Security Administration and the Federal \nGovernment at large.\n  Government agencies have estimated that the Social Security \nAdministration can reduce fraud and save at least $2 billion, likely \nmore, if this problem is corrected.\n  So as I do each week, we keep adding to our gauge of savings that now \nare approaching very close to $50 billion, just over several weeks of \npointing out waste and fraud that has been documented by nonpolitical, \nneutral Federal agencies. We keep adding more. We are approaching $50 \nbillion. Our goal is $100 billion. I think we will go way past that if \nI keep doing this every week.\n  In order to help correct the problem, I have introduced legislation, \nalong with Senator Carper and others, which will update the Social \nSecurity system and ensure accuracy in Federal records, not just in \nSocial Security but in other agencies as well. I am just looking at one \nagency. Wait until we get into some of the others.\n  The key provisions of our bill include allowing Federal agencies \naccess to the complete death database, because under current law, only \nagencies that directly handle beneficiary payments may have access to \nthe complete database. The act allows all appropriate Federal agencies \nto have access to the complete death data program for integrity \npurposes as well as for other needs such as public safety and health. \nIt requires the use of death data to curb improper payments. Our \nlegislation establishes procedures to ensure more accurate death data.\n  As I have said before, by simply correcting the death records, the \nSocial Security Administration can reduce fraud and save at least $2 \nbillion.\n  This is an area that is ripe for reform, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation and eliminate this waste, along with the other \n$49 billion we have identified in just the last few weeks. We would be \ndoing the taxpayers a great service while making\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\nour government the efficient, effective government it needs to be, \nparticularly in these times of lack of fiscal discipline.\n  I thank the Chair for the time. I also thank my colleague from \nTennessee for giving me this time.\n  Mr. President, I know we have important legislation on the floor this \nweek. This ``Waste of the Week'' speech is kind of tongue in cheek. We \nare moving on to legislation that has historic consequences for the \nfuture of America, for our own future, our children's future, and our \ngrandchildren's future.\n  The debate that will take place this week, led by Senator Corker from \nTennessee regarding the Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons capability \nis, in my time of service here in the Senate and in Congress, I think \nthe most consequential piece of legislative debate that I will ever \nenter into. It will have enormous historical consequences, and we need \nto get it right.\n  So I commend my colleague Senator Corker for his efforts in this \nregard. He has moved the legislation through the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee with total bipartisan support, which is absolutely \nkey to the success of our efforts and necessary to prevent a \ncatastrophic activity taking place in Iran.\n  So I appreciate the time to speak, while not focusing all of my \nattention and effort, as I hope all of my colleagues will, to this \nextraordinary challenge that we have before us this week that will \ndetermine the future for country and maybe the world.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator for his \ncontinual focus on fiscal issues. I know he spent a great deal of time \nwith a handful of folks at the White House two summers ago trying to \ncome up with a plan to really save our Nation.\n  I actually was just standing up a minute ago. I was about to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum until I saw the Senator from Indiana, so the \nSenator can speak as long as he wishes on these waste issues. I thank \nhim for the kind of Senator he is and his continual efforts to save our \nNation from a national security standpoint and also our greatest \nnational security risk right now which is our inability to get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  So I thank the Senator for this, and I look forward to the debate \nover the next several days.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this week we are going to, in my view, deal \nwith one of the most concerning, one of the most dangerous, one of the \nmost treacherous issues we will face--that I will face as a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate and, certainly, has been in the short period of time I \nhave had the honor of representing Kansans here in our Nation's \nCapital. It is the question of Iran. It is the question of their \nability to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  On this question of Iran, American policymakers are approaching a \nnumber of fateful decisions--in fact, a series of decisions that I \nthink have significant consequences. The implications of the choices \nthat will be made by our Nation and others will determine events today, \ntomorrow, and well into the future, both regionally and globally. As I \nindicated, the consequences will be felt for decades--generations, \nperhaps--to come.\n  Such significant consequences require each step to be planted with \ngreat care and consideration. I fear that the recent American march \ninto nuclear negotiations with Iran has been misguided, drawing our \ncountry and the global community into a dangerous position.\n  American foreign policy with respect to Iran has long been centered \naround the goal of preventing Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapon \ncapability. Today, this policy has weathered and has been allowed to be \nweakened. It has become a position of delayed tolerance of a nuclear \nIran. This policy deterioration was made clear in recent weeks by \nglobal affairs minds no less than former Secretaries of State George \nShultz and Henry Kissinger, who wrote: ``. . . negotiations that began \n12 years ago as an international effort to prevent an Iranian \ncapability to develop a nuclear arsenal are ending with an agreement \nthat concedes that very capability. . . . ''\n\n  The administration's stated goal of securing a 1-year nuclear \ndevelopment breakout period reveals a shift from firm disapproval to \nacquiescence. The result, in my view, is a world that is much less \nsafe, a Middle East that is further prone to violent conflict, and an \ninternational order trending toward nuclear armaments rather than \nwalking away from it.\n  Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif pointed this out last week in his \nwriting in the New York Times:\n\n       Nothing in international politics functions in a vacuum. \n     Security cannot be pursued at the expense of the insecurity \n     of others. No nation can achieve its interests without \n     considering the interests of others.\n       Nowhere are these dynamics more evident than in the wider \n     Persian Gulf region.\n\n  That is the Foreign Minister of Iran speaking. Mr. Zarif's words \napply to the pending nuclear question and the budding proposal to \nexchange sanctions relief for a temporary suspension of Iranian nuclear \ndevelopment. The decisions made by Iran and the P5+1 participants in \nthese nuclear negotiations are being considered and acted upon and \nresponded to by others in the region and others around the globe. As \nIran's neighboring states are looking to increase arms purchases for \nuse in the ongoing conflicts in their region, international concerns \nabout a nuclear-capable Iran are not merely passive policy critiques. \nThey are warnings worthy of our careful, determined consideration.\n  I would suggest and I will ask what we must ask: Does this pending \naccord make the world safer or more dangerous? Does it bring Iran \ncloser to or further from nuclear capabilities? Can the world trust \nIran to uphold its commitments? Will the terms of the deal be \nsufficiently verifiable to know if they do not?\n  Ultimately, we must ask if this deal would stabilize tensions in the \nMiddle East or accelerate them. These questions are greater than any \ngrappling things that go on between Congress and the President, between \nRepublicans and Democrats. This cannot and should not be a politically \npartisan issue. It should be one of serious consideration about long-\nterm consequences to America, its allies, and our enemies.\n  The nuclear accord will have serious and lasting consequences for us \nall. It is incumbent upon American leadership to guide these efforts in \nthe safest possible direction. In my view, our trajectory to date has \nbeen uncertain. In response, Congress has insisted--and rightfully so--\nthat it oversee and participate in the process, especially in any \ndecision regarding the lifting of sanctions.\n  The President's efforts to ignore or sidestep the legislative \nbranch's constitutional role in foreign policy are troublesome. Many, \nincluding me, have been asking why Congress lacks the ability to block \nor more forcefully respond to a potential bad deal or to do more to \nlimit the President's ability to act unilaterally. Unfortunately, the \nlaw resulting from the previously passed sanctions legislation allows \nthe President to waive sanctions under certain conditions--the \nlegislation that we passed.\n  Let me say that again. The legislation that we passed over a period \nof time--and I am a Member of the banking committee involved in this \nlegislation--allowed a President--this or other Presidents--to waive \nthose sanctions under considerations of national security. What we \nregrettably discovered is that Congress provided way too much \nflexibility to a President too willing to ignore the concerns of the \nlegislature, too willing to find a reason to waive the sanctions.\n  But there remains reason of hope that Congress will play a \nconstructive and important part in this matter. Despite opposition from \nthe White House, bipartisan efforts led by Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee Chairman Senator Corker have produced legislation providing \nfor a congressional review process. The bill had broad bipartisan \nsupport, and perhaps that makes it impervious to President Obama's \ninitial threats of a veto.\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\n  Any increased role by Congress is welcomed, from my perspective. For \ntoo long, Congress has deferred to Executive action when it comes to \nforeign relations and foreign affairs--not just this Congress and this \nPresident, but many Congresses and many Presidents. In my view, \nCongress has failed its constitutional authority to oversee a \nPresident's foreign policy efforts.\n  So this increased role for Congress is welcome. And for anyone who is \nskeptical of the framework released by the State Department in early \nApril or curious about what the parameters might look like in a final \ndeal, Congress will have the ability to see, to know, and to let the \nAmerican people, and, in fact, the world know what these agreements \nmight contain.\n  After the presumed passage of the Iran Nuclear Review Act--the \nlegislation we have been considering this week--if it passes and the \ncase is that a deal is ultimately struck and an agreement is struck by \nthe June 30 deadline between the administration, the P5+1, and Iran, \nCongress will have 30 days to review that agreement.\n  As we began late last week and early this week to consider this \nlegislation, the point in being here at this stage is to indicate that \nwhile I wish there were more opportunities for congressional \ninvolvement in the process, what the committee has presented to us \ngives us the starting point, the beginning point, and the opportunity \nto explore fully what the administration has been negotiating in \nsecret.\n  I have attended the meetings--the so-called classified briefings--and \nit is hard to leave those meetings with an understanding or \nappreciation or more knowledge of what is in the potential agreement \nwith Iran than before I walked in the door. What will transpire this \nweek on the Senate floor gives me and others the opportunity--and \nultimately the American people--to know a lot more.\n  As this process has been developed and as we implement it here on the \nSenate floor, it is important that we use this time to carefully \nexamine the results of any nuclear negotiations and ask ourselves this \nquestion: Is the world better off as a result of that agreement? Is \npeace more assured, and does humanity have a better future?\n  We don't have the agreement in front of us yet, but what we do this \nweek sets the stage for that review, for that understanding, and for \nthe ability to reject, if necessary. What that agreement contains is \nimportant. It is encouraging to me to see that the Senate--the \nCongress, in fact--is stepping forward to play its rightful \nconstitutional role in foreign affairs.\n  I look forward to the discussion this week, but more importantly, I \nlook forward to the passage of legislation that allows us to have a \nmuch greater say, much more significant knowledge, and a better \nopportunity to have understanding about a potential treacherous path \nthat our country may be headed toward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Kansas. I \nthink he has articulated about as well as anybody the importance of \npassing the legislation on the floor.\n  Many of my colleagues, I think, unlike the Senator from Kansas, in \nsome ways fail to recognize that when we put the sanctions in place \nthat brought them to the table, in the meanwhile they were going from \n164 centrifuges back in 2003 to 19,000 centrifuges today. What Congress \ndid in a bipartisan way was put four tranches of sanctions in place to \nbegin putting pressure on them to stop and to get them to the table. We \nhave done that, but in each of those cases, we gave the President \nunilaterally the ability to waive or suspend the sanctions ad \ninfinitum--forever.\n  It is something that my friend Senator Kaine from Virginia recognized \nin our meetings as we had the Secretary come forward and talk to us \nabout the fact that, yes, you are going to have a vote on this. But we \nall recognized that was 4 to 5 to 6 years down the road after the \nsanctions regime had been totally alleviated.\n  I just want to thank the Senator for being so articulate in his \ncomments.\n  The fact is that without this legislation--without this legislation \npassing--Congress will have zero. The President will go straight to the \nU.N. Security Council with the suspensions in his hands that we have \nalready given them and implement whatever kind of deal he wants to \nimplement.\n  I have had a great conversation with my friend from Virginia today. I \nthink this bill obviously does give Congress, as the Senator from \nKansas mentioned, its rightful role. But I think it also gives the \nPresident a backstop when he is negotiating so that people will \nunderstand that we are going to play that role.\n  So I thank the Senator very, very much for his comments and for the \nconstructive way he is on so many of the big issues we deal with and \nfor his cosponsorship of this very important legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I see my friend from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the comments of Chairman Corker, and I appreciate the \ntwo punch lines of the Senator from Kansas to his argument that I am \nstrongly in support of. The first is that this is a very momentous \ntopic, and there are many, many questions about an ultimate deal that \nwe have to grapple with. Second, it is so much of the moment that the \ncongressional sanctions themselves are so wrapped up in the discussion \nthat Congress must have a role to fulfill our constitutional obligation \nand to actually do what we essentially set in motion by passing the \ncongressional sanctions. We must have a role.\n  So to the chairman and to all who are supporting the bill, I think we \nhave got it in a good place on the floor, and I am proud to be a strong \nsupporter of it.\n  The only issue on which I would offer a slightly different take than \nthe Senator from Kansas is this. I think by all objective standards, \nthe negotiations to this point have produced a status quo that has been \nbetter than where we were before the negotiations. If you think back to \nbefore November 2013, Iran--although under punishing sanctions--was \nmoving forward in a very dramatic way to build up an architecture. \nWhile the sanctions were hurting the Iranian economy, there was some \nargument that it was not slowing down their nuclear program. It was \naccelerating it because they were feeling isolated.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel appeared before the United Nations \nand gave a very famous speech in which he talked about the stockpile of \nuranium that was enriched to a 20-percent level. We drew a bomb and \nshowed a level of enrichment that was getting to an extremely dangerous \nplace. That is where we were before President Obama started these \nnegotiations with the P5+1 in November 2013.\n  At the time the negotiations were started, there were some who said \nthey were misguided or a historic mistake or a giveaway. But, by now, \nvirtually all--even those who were skeptical at the beginning--would \nacknowledge that the negotiations have actually led to a status quo \nsignificantly better than before November 2013. The 20-percent enriched \nuranium stockpile Iran had has been rolled back to a 5-percent \nenrichment level. Many of the centrifuges and facilities where nuclear \nweapons and nuclear activities were occurring have either been disabled \nor in some way have been reconfigured so that they are not continuing \nto produce more material that would cause significant concern. Since \nNovember 2013 the international community has been able to achieve \nsignificantly greater inspections of the Iranian nuclear activity than \nthey had before.\n  So while we still have significant questions about an ultimate deal \nand Congress's role, we have a much better handle on their program. \nThey have rolled back that program to a significant degree, and even \nskeptics of the original deal acknowledge that. I do think that is \nimportant to mention.\n  Congress needs to fulfill its article I powers, but we also need to \nhave the President do the diplomacy that article II allows him to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Kaine and Senator \nCorker.\n  This is the second day that we have been debating the nuclear \noversight bill. Members have had a chance to express their concerns. \nThey have had a chance to put forward amendments, to file them at this \nparticular moment. We have been working with several Members to try to \nsee whether we can work out an orderly way for the consideration of \nthose amendments. I want all of the Members to know we are open for \nbusiness. Senator Corker has been meeting with Members, and I have been \ntalking to Members. We hope we can find a way to move this bill forward \ntomorrow for the consideration of amendments.\n\n  I would urge Members--we are not encouraging amendments because we \nthink we took up these issues in the committee and we worked out a \nbipartisan bill to get this done. But please talk to us so we can try \nto work out in an orderly way the consideration of amendments starting \ntomorrow and hopefully finish the bill shortly thereafter.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/27/senate-section/article/S2427-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2427-S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF DAVA J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm Dava \nNewman to be Deputy Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration. I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Newman. She is a \ntalented individual. She is passionate about aerospace engineering and \nis generating awareness of science, technology, energy, and math \nopportunities in Montana students.\n  Dr. Newman is excited to get to work and continue to make NASA \ncompetitive with other countries studying space exploration.\n  A graduate of C.R. Anderson Middle School and Capital High School in \nHelena, MT, Dr. Newman is a testament to the quality of Montana's \npublic education. After graduating from high school, Dr. Newman \nattended the University of Notre Dame before pursuing graduate school \nat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Newman is now a \nprofessor of aeronautics and astronautics.\n  In 2007, Time magazine highlighted Dr. Newman's work as one of the \nbest inventions of the year. She developed a new space suit, known as \nthe BioSuit, to increase astronauts' agility and movements, allowing \nastronauts to not only walk but also run and even climb mountains.\n  Her track record of success and nomination to NASA serve as a way to \nencourage young Montanans to pursue careers in space and engineering.\n  Dr. Newman is an incredibly accomplished Montanan who truly \nexemplifies our State's legacy of public service. Her passion and \ndedication to NASA is clear. I know she will lead with honor and is \nprepared for whatever challenges may lie ahead. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of Dr. Newman's nomination.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in a few minutes, we are going to vote on \nthe confirmation of Dava Newman, the nominee for Deputy Administrator \nof NASA. This little Agency happens to be one that I have some personal \nfondness for, having participated with NASA many Moons ago--29\\1/2\\ \nyears ago--on the 24th flight of the space shuttle, a crew led by then-\nNavy Captain Robert Gibson, otherwise known as Hoot Gibson, and his \nsecond in command, the pilot of our mission, which was dubbed STS--\nSpace Transportation System--61-C. Subsequently, all of the numbers of \nthe space shuttles reverted to their original numbering, but there was \na hiatus in there where several shuttle flights had a very complicated \nnumbering system, and ours was one of them. The pilot of that mission \nwas then-Marine Colonel Charlie Bolden, now-Marine General, Retired, \nCharlie Bolden, who is the Administrator of NASA and has been for the \nlast 6 years. But Administrator Bolden does not have a Deputy, and he \nneeds a Deputy Administrator. So this process has been carefully \nconducted, and they sifted through hundreds of names to come up with \njust the right person, and that is in the person of Dr. Dava Newman.\n  She received her bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame \nand two master's degrees and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology. She is currently a professor of aeronautics and \nastronautics and engineering systems at MIT. She is also the director \nof the Technology and Policy Program there.\n  Right off the bat, you can see there is no question as to her skills, \nher smarts, and her credentials, but she is also known for her \nleadership and technical expertise in aerospace engineering. She \nauthored over 200 research publications, including the textbook \n``Introduction to Aerospace Engineering and Design.''\n  I think that would be kind of interesting, that as a backup to \nAdministrator Bolden, who is a five-time space shuttle astronaut, we \nhave someone who is an expert in aerospace engineering design, \nparticularly as we are creating the new rockets and the new spacecraft \nas we speak, for the goal, which is Mars in the decade of the 2030s.\n  During her career, she served as the principal investigator on three \nspace flight experiments flown on board the space shuttle and on board \nthe previous Mir Space Station. She is tremendously known for her \ninnovative space suit designs that use mechanical counterpressure to \nmake the space suit formfitting, lightweight, and much more flexible \nthan previous space suits.\n  If you notice, when you see the astronauts outside of the \nInternational Space Station--which, by the way, blows the mind, how big \nit is. It is 110 yards long. From one goalpost to the other goalpost is \n120 yards. That is how big the International Space Station is that is \n250 miles above the Earth with six humans on board. When you watch \nthose EVAs--extravehicular activities--when they go outside to do the \nrepairs, well, lo and behold, Dr. Newman is the designer of their \ninnovative space suits. She has been recognized. Back in 2007, Time \nmagazine recognized her and her space suit work as one of the best \ninventions of the year. She is currently leading the development of a \nsuit that may help astronauts overcome back problems in space. The suit \nis planned to be tested on the International Space Station later this \nyear.\n  As we go on this dual track in our civilian space program--first the \ntrack with commercial rockets that will take our cargo and is taking \nour cargo to and from the International Space Station and will soon be \ntaking Americans to and from the International Space Station, and the \nother track of the dual tracks is the development of this huge new \nrocket, much larger than the\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\nApollo Saturn V Rocket, which at the time defied the imagination of how \nlarge it could be--this is even bigger. This is called the Space Launch \nSystem, and atop it will sit the human capsule Orion, which will start \nthe process of developing the systems, the techniques, the lifesaving, \nlife-enhancing, and life-protecting measures and equipment that can \ntake us all the way to Mars.\n  So we need a professional at NASA to help General Bolden and his very \ndedicated team. I certainly commend Dr. Dava Newman to the Senate as \nthat person. We should confirm her today, and we can continue this \nNation's civilian space program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Dava J. Newman, of Massachusetts, to be Deputy Administrator of the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

From the earliest launches of \nrockets that established manned missions, to the Apollo program and the \ncontinued support for the International Space Station, my home State of \nFlorida is proud to take ownership in NASA's past and will certainly be \na part of its future.\n  It is imperative that we continue to have a robust space exploration \nprogram that promotes America's economic, scientific, and security \ninterests, and that effectively utilizes its resources. NASA must have \nstrong leadership and I believe Dr. Dava Newman will serve the \nAdministration well in her new role as Deputy Administrator of NASA. \nWhile other obligations kept me from Washington, I would have voted in \nfavor of her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Under the previous order, the \nmotion to reconsider is considered made and laid upon the table, and \nthe President will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/27/senate-section/article/S2428-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address for the first time \nthis august body, the United States Senate--the greatest governing body \never conceived. Out of respect, I have waited until we passed the 100-\nday mark to deliver this speech, but I rise today because I believe our \nRepublic is in grave danger. We need to create a new beginning by \ndealing with the very real crisis of leadership we face today. It is \nwhy I ran for the Senate in the first place--because we need a new \nperspective in Washington. Like many Americans, I am outraged by \nWashington's dysfunction, its fiscal irresponsibility, its lack of \nleadership in foreign policy, its intrusiveness and overreach, and its \nnegative impact on hard-working Americans.\n  Before being elected to the Senate, I had never been involved in \npolitics. Simply put, I am a political outsider committed to changing \nthe direction of our country. I grew up in a small military town in \nMiddle Georgia, working on our family's farms. My mom and dad were \npublic school teachers, and I grew up modestly, as did most people \nthere. I worked my way through college and was blessed with a business \ncareer that took me from the factory floor to become a Fortune 500 CEO.\n  My story is not unique. It is the American story. Only in America is \nthis possible, thanks to hard work and self-reliance. It is called the \nAmerican dream, and it is our job to make sure it lasts. Many people \ntoday believe that this dream no longer exists, that we need big \ngovernment to provide us with more and more financial security. I \ndisagree totally. I believe our best days lie ahead. But we have to act \nboldly if we are to save this dream and our very way of life.\n  As an outsider to the political process, I am humbled by the \nprivilege to serve my country as a U.S. Senator. I am sobered by the \nimmense responsibility of representing the people of Georgia, and I am \nencouraged by the opportunity we have to solve this crisis of \nleadership and create a new beginning.\n  As one of the Original Thirteen Colonies, Georgia has long been \nblessed with outstanding statesmen in the U.S. Senate. The first \nSenator to serve in this seat in the first U.S. Congress in 1789 was \nSenator William Few. He also signed the U.S. Constitution. As fate \nwould have it, Sarah Few Collins, a member of the team that helped me \nbecome Georgia's 37th U.S. Senator in this seat, is a direct descendant \nof Senator Few. I think that is pretty special. This desk I use on the \nSenate floor is also very meaningful to me. It has served such \ndistinguished leaders from Georgia such as Saxby Chambliss, Zell\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\nMiller, Sam Nunn, Herman Talmadge, and the venerable Richard B. \nRussell, Jr.\n  I rise to speak about three issues creating this national crisis of \nleadership we experience today: the abuse of Executive power, the \nsignificant deterioration of American foreign policy, and our out-of-\ncontrol debt.\n  First, ``What we are witnessing today is one of the greatest \nchallenges to our constitutional system in the history of this \ncountry''--not my words but the words of George Washington University \nconstitutional law professor Dr. Jonathan Turley, who incidentally \nvoted twice for President Obama. Unbridled use of Executive orders and \nregulatory mandates has basically allowed this President to run the \ncountry without Congress for the past 6 years. According to Professor \nTurley, this sets dangerous precedents for future courts and future \nPresidents.\n  To create a new beginning, we must first get back to our founding \nprinciples articulated in our Constitution that created this miracle \ncalled America in the first place: economic opportunity, fiscal \nresponsibility, limited government, and individual liberty. When \ngovernment grows larger, individual liberty declines. I even believe \nthat our Founders were committed to the concept of citizen \nlegislators--people would come to Congress, do their work, and go home. \nI don't believe they could perceive of the potential rise of career \npoliticians we experience today.\n  We also face a global security crisis that is getting worse by the \nday. This administration has created a situation where our allies don't \ntrust us and our enemies don't fear us. Leading from behind has failed \nus as a foreign policy.\n  Right now, we face the threat of nuclear proliferation starting with \nIran. As President Obama has conceded, this deal being negotiated would \nleave Iran with a breakout time ``almost down to zero'' in 10 to 15 \nyears. As Prime Minister Netanyahu reminded us when he spoke before \nCongress, a nuclear Iran is not just a threat to Middle East security, \nit is not only a threat to U.S. security, it is indeed a threat to \nglobal security.\n  A nuclear Iran whose leaders are committed to the death of Israel and \nAmerica would spark an unprecedented wave of nuclear proliferation in \nthe Middle East. Under no circumstances can we allow Iran to become a \nnuclear weapons State--not now, not in 10 years, not ever.\n  After battling terrorism for the past 14 years and fighting two major \nwars, with thousands of American lives lost and billions spent, we \nstill face terrorist threats from jihadist Islamic groups who openly \nvow to do us harm. We face a tough choice, however: Deal with them over \nthere or wait and deal with the consequences here at home.\n  We are also witnessing the return of great power rivalries. Last \nyear, Russia actually seized territory of a sovereign state and \ncontinues their aggression today in the Ukraine. China is also growing \nmore aggressive, doubling its military spending and flexing its muscle \nin the region.\n  New asymmetric threats, combined with traditional symmetric \nchallenges, create unprecedented demand on our military at the very \ntime this administration has reduced military spending to the point \nthat we are about to have the smallest Army since World War II, the \nsmallest Navy since World War I, and the smallest Air Force ever. This \nis simply unacceptable.\n  To address this global security crisis and create a new beginning, we \nmust have a consistent and strong foreign policy. However, to have a \nstrong foreign policy, we must have a strong defense.\n  Providing for the national defense is one of only 6 reasons outlined \nin the Constitution why 13 Colonies formed our Union in the first \nplace. To have a strong defense, though, we have to have a strong \neconomy, as we proved during the Cold War with the Soviet Union.\n  Our own fiscal irresponsibility jeopardizes our very ability to fund \na strong military. ADM Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, once said that the greatest threat to our national \nsecurity is our own Federal debt. This debt crisis threatens our \nability to defend our country, stand for freedom, and maintain our very \nway of life. It is a primary reason why we need to create a new \nbeginning.\n\n  This debt crisis affects each of us every day. While the economy \nlurches along, we see working middle-class Americans struggling. Many \npeople are having difficulty finding jobs, and those with jobs are \nlucky to have a job. Their wages remain stagnant, making it harder and \nharder to get from payday to payday. Many families can't afford to buy \na home or plan for the future. Moms and dads fear they can't send their \nkids to college or prepare them for a good job. Many college graduates \ntoday have sizable student loans and still can't find meaningful \nemployment. A comfortable retirement is only a dream for many.\n  Back home in Georgia, people share my outrage with Washington's \nfiscal irresponsibility. From what I have seen so far up here, there is \nnot enough great sense of urgency in tackling this skyrocketing debt \ncrisis. There are no innocent parties up here, either. Both sides have \npushed us to the brink, contributing to this unsustainable level of \ndebt we face today. In the last 6 years alone, the Federal Government \nhas spent $21.5 trillion, but it borrowed $8 trillion, so that today we \nhave a Federal debt of more than $18 trillion. We simply cannot afford \neverything we are doing as a Federal Government. We are already \novertaxed and overregulated.\n  The progressive policies of the past 100 years and particularly the \negregious policies of this current administration have failed the very \npeople they were intended to help--the working middle class. Instead, \nWashington has created a spiraling situation that will only take us \ndeeper into debt.\n  What is worse, we have over $100 trillion in future unfunded \nliabilities related to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal \npensions, and the interest on the Federal debt. While developing a \nlong-term solution to this debt crisis, we also need to protect today's \nseniors and save our safety net programs so they will be there for \npeople who really need them the most, when they need them. Shockingly, \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds will be totally insolvent in \njust a few short years, and worse, this administration has no plan to \ndeal with that.\n  Unfortunately, we are already past the tipping point in this fiscal \ncatastrophe. If interest rates today were at their 5.5 percent 30-year \naverage, we would already be paying almost $1 trillion in interest. \nThat is twice what we spend on our military, and it is totally \nunmanageable.\n  People back home expect Washington to work. This fiscal \nirresponsibility drives people back in Georgia absolutely crazy. \nDoubling down on bigger government, more Federal programs, and more \ngovernment spending is not the answer, as has been proven repeatedly \nover the last 100 years. We have to break the gridlock in Washington to \nsolve this problem. One side wants to increase taxes; the other side \nwants spending cuts. The result is that we have had gridlock in \nWashington for a generation.\n  The real solution, of course, is to grow our economy. Just 1 \npercentage point of incremental GDP growth would generate over $3 \ntrillion of Federal tax revenues in the next decade alone. Combine that \nwith the elimination of truly duplicative programs, and we can develop \na long-term plan to solve this debt crisis, as well as get Americans \nback to work in meaningful, well-paying jobs.\n  To create a new beginning, my focus in this body will be to add to \nthe debate about how to grow our economy, rein in our outrageous \nspending, and solve this debt crisis.\n  To grow our economy, three priorities should be addressed right away. \nFirst, we need to totally reinvent how we fund our Federal Government. \nMany States, such as Georgia, have a balanced budget law, and so should \nWashington. American families can't spend more than they take in, and \nneither should their government.\n  Our archaic tax system is choking growth, holding back innovation, \nand discouraging investment. Eventually, I believe, we should \ntransition from an income tax to a simple consumption tax, such as the \nfair tax, that would level the playing field with the rest of the \nworld.\n  While that debate will take some time, there are things we can do \nright now to stimulate our economy. We need to reduce our corporate tax \nrate\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nand eliminate entirely our repatriation tax to be more competitive with \nother countries. At the same time, we need to eliminate corporate \nwelfare and make our tax system fairer and simpler for every American.\n  We also have to rein in our out-of-control regulators. This President \nhas created the fourth branch of government--the regulators--which \ntoday makes more rules that affect our lives and our jobs than does \nCongress.\n  Finally, we need to unlock our full energy potential to get this \neconomy moving. We need to develop our domestic natural resources. \nIsn't it time we finally develop a long-term energy policy that \nunleashes this potential while protecting our environment?\n  Doing these things now will also allow us to fund our infrastructure \nneeds, improve our education process, become more competitive with the \nrest of the world, create well-paying, 21st-century jobs, and ignite \nthe next economic boom for our kids and grandkids.\n  I have used the word ``crisis'' carefully and thoughtfully today. The \nfirst step toward making the tough choices required to change our \ndirection comes from a true realization that we indeed have a crisis. \nAmericans respond better than anyone in history to a true crisis, but \nwe are not always the quickest to recognize we have one.\n  To create a truly new beginning, it is time for this eminent body, \nthe U.S. Senate, to rise above partisan politics and do the right \nthing. It starts with leadership. It starts with making hard choices. \nIt starts with telling the American people the unvarnished truth. It \nstarts with no longer kicking the can down the road. It starts with \nhaving the courage to actually solve these problems independent of how \nit might affect our reelection chances.\n  My motivation is very simple. I do not want to be a member of the \nfirst generation in American history that has to tell its kids that we \nare leaving them a country that is worse off than our parents left us.\n  Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       Freedom is never more than one generation away from \n     extinction. We didn't pass it along to our children in the \n     bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on \n     for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset \n     years telling our children and our children's children what \n     it was once like in the United States when men were free.\n\n  Let us fight to find common ground to create a new beginning for our \ncountry, for people back home who are struggling, and for the future of \nour children and our children's children.\n  As I close, I am reminded of a seldom-quoted closing sentence of the \nDeclaration of Independence:\n\n       And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm \n     reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually \n     pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred \n     honor.\n\n  Our Founders got it right. They would remind us of that commitment \nand encourage us today to put our differences aside, to work together \nto solve these sometimes overwhelming problems.\n  Together, we can put our differences aside. Together, we can do the \nright thing. Together, we can create a new beginning.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate our new \ncolleague from Georgia on his insightful and accurate assessment of the \nbiggest challenges confronting our country. Not only did he lay out the \nbiggest challenges, he certainly laid out the best solutions to those \nchallenges to get this country moving again and to guarantee, as he put \nit, that we leave behind for the next generation a better country than \nour parents left behind for us.\n  I congratulate our new colleague for an outstanding major speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful that we have the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia in the Senate. I really enjoyed his \nremarks here this evening. He laid out a program that we ought to \nfollow.\n  I am very proud to have the Senator here, and I am proud to serve \nwith him. We wish him the very, very best in every way. I think he will \nenjoy this body in spite of all the vagaries and varieties of it. But \nhe is a great addition to this body, and we are very appreciative that \nhe is here with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to note that my colleague from \nGeorgia just made a great speech. In it he listed those who sat in the \ndesk he now sits in--Nunn, Russell, Chambliss. It is obvious he has \ninherited that seat, and he is equal to the task of those gentlemen. I \ncommend him on his first speech, and I am honored to serve with him in \nthe Senate.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to say, I knew the Senator from \nGeorgia prior to being a Senator. He was an outstanding CEO in a major \npublic company. He has done business all over the world. I know when he \ncampaigned in Georgia for this seat, what he said was that he was going \nto be the adult in the room. I just want to say that he certainly has \ndistinguished himself since he came here in acting that way and looking \nat the big issues that our Nation has to deal with.\n  I know that he knows that still the greatest threat to our country \nright now is our inability to get our fiscal house in order, and I \nreally believe that Senator Perdue is going to not just be a leader on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, as he already is--hugely helpful in \nthe vote that we had last week relative to Iran--but I think as much as \nanybody in the Senate, Senator Perdue is going to help drive this body \nto responsibly deal with fiscal issues we have to deal with.\n  We have a lot of work to do. We haven't even begun. I look forward to \nworking with him, not only to ensure that our Nation is safe and secure \nbut that we get our fiscal house in order. I could not be more \ngratified that Senator Perdue is part of this body and serving in the \nmanner that he is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nGeorgia on the content of his speech as well as on his enthusiasm and \nalso on how he follows through on what he says. I get to serve with him \non the Budget Committee, and I have been extremely impressed.\n  At his first meeting, I introduced him as someone who has balanced \nbudgets. He corrected me. In the private sector, one can't just balance \nthe budget; you have to do better than that. He has that kind of \nexperience to bring to the Budget Committee and to this body, and I \nlook forward to working with him diligently on the budget. We only had \n6 weeks to do what hadn't been done in 6 years, and he was a tremendous \nhelp in getting through that process and understanding some of the \ncomplexities. He is a good numbers man. So when he talks about what we \nneed to do with the budget and paying down the debt and the ways we can \ndo it, I look forward to working with him to get those things \naccomplished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I wish to commend my fellow freshman, \nSenator Perdue, for a great maiden speech. I like particularly his \nemphasis upon growing our gross domestic product, growing our economy, \nand making it stronger. It echoes what Senator Enzi just said. It is \nnot just about balancing the budget but about creating the sort of \ngrowth that creates more prosperity for the families who depend upon \nthis prosperity for better jobs for them and their families.\n  It was a great speech. I thank the Senator for capturing the optimism \nthat makes the United States unique.\n  I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/27/senate-section/article/S2430-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2430-S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING DR. DAVID RANKIN\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Southern Arkansas \nUniversity president Dr. David Rankin who will retire in June after \nnearly half a century of dedication to education.\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\n  For 46 years he served alongside the faculty of SAU, the last 13 as \npresident. Dr. Rankin made a career out of helping students and \nfacilitating growth at the school. His vision to improve academic \nprograms and expand campus resources has been a success; benefiting the \ncommunity and creating a new standard for education.\n  Since becoming president in 2002, Dr. Rankin helped grow graduate \nenrollment 200 percent. Throughout his presidency SAU has not only seen \nrecord enrollment, but record development as well. Construction of \nstate-of-the-art academic buildings, upgraded athletic facilities, a \n30,000-square-foot agriculture center and a $17.5 million Science \nCenter are just a few of the projects championed by Dr. Rankin.\n  Public service is a cornerstone of Dr. Rankin's life. Serving as \npresident of SAU is certainly enough to stay busy, but his commitment \nto the community and the State keep him active in a variety of other \nroles including as the chair of the Golden Triangle Economic \nDevelopment Council. During his tenure he also served as the economic \nadvisor to two Arkansas Governors. He is an active member of Central \nBaptist Church in Magnolia where he teaches Sunday school.\n  I congratulate Dr. David Rankin for his outstanding achievements in \neducation and the community. I have appreciated his friendship and \nenjoyed supporting his efforts to continue making his vision for SAU a \nreality. I wish him continued success. SAU is a much improved school \nthanks to his leadership and years of dedication to this \ninstitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/27/senate-section/article/S2431-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/27/senate-section/article/S2431-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/27/senate-section/article/S2431-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1560.

A bill to provide for institutional risk-sharing in the \nFederal student loan programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today postsecondary education is required \nfor most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs, and an educated \nworkforce is essential to a modern, productive economy. A recent report \nby the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce \nfound that college-intensive business services have replaced \nmanufacturing as the largest sector in the U.S. economy, and that while \ncollege-educated workers make up only 32 percent of the workforce, they \nnow produce more than 50 percent of the Nation's economic output, up \nfrom 13 percent in 1967. Median annual earnings for bachelor's degree \nholders were $23,000 higher compared to high school graduates in 2014.\n  Yet just as there is growing recognition that postsecondary education \nis indispensable in the modern economy, families are being required to \nshoulder growing debt burdens that threaten access to college.\n  According to a recent analysis of student loan debt by the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York, between 2004 and 2014, there was an 89 \npercent increase in the number of student loan borrowers and a 77 \npercent increase in the average balance size. Today, over 40 million \nAmericans have student loan debt.\n  This is a growing drag on our economy. As student loan debt has \ngrown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars, starting a \nfamily, saving for retirement, or launching new businesses. They have \nliterally mortgaged their economic future.\n  We know that student loan borrowers are struggling. Default rates are \non the rise. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that the \nnumber of borrowers who default each year increased from about half a \nmillion 10 years ago to 1.2 million annually in 2011 and 2012. Only 37 \npercent of borrowers are current on their loan and actively paying down \ntheir debt.\n  We cannot tackle the student loan debt crisis without States and \ninstitutions also stepping up and taking greater responsibility for \ncollege costs and student borrowing.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the Protect Student Borrowers \nAct with Senators Durbin, Warren, and Murphy to ensure there is more \nskin in the game when it comes to student loan debt by setting stronger \nmarket incentives for colleges and universities to provide better and \nmore affordable education to students, which will in turn help put the \nbrakes on rising student loan defaults.\n  The Protect Student Borrowers Act will hold colleges and universities \naccountable for student loan defaults by requiring them to repay a \npercentage of defaulted loans. Only institutions that have 25 percent \nor more of their students borrow would be included in risk sharing \nbased on their cohort default rate. Risk-sharing requirements would \nkick in when the default rate exceeds 15 percent. As the institutional \ndefault rate rises, so too will the institution's risk-share payment.\n  The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for \ninstitutions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens \nand reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or \neliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan \nmanagement plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for \ninstitutions whose mission is to serve low-income and minority \nstudents, such as community colleges, Historically Black Institutions, \nor Hispanic Serving Institutions provided that they are making progress \nin their student loan management plans.\n  The risk-sharing payments will be invested in helping struggling \nborrowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and reducing \nshortfalls in the Pell Grant program.\n  With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair \nthat institutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program.\n  We need to tackle student loan debt and college affordability from \nmultiple angles. And we need all stakeholders in the system to do their \npart. With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the \nresources and incentives for institutions to take more responsibility \nto address college affordability and student loan debt and improve \nstudent outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look \nforward to working with them to include it and other key reforms in the \nupcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Risch, and Mr. \n        Crapo):\n  S. 1103. A bill to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement \nof construction of a hydroelectric project involving Clark Canyon Dam; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today, I introduce two bills, S. 1103 and \nS. 1104, with my colleague from Montana, Senator Jon Tester, my Idaho \ncolleagues Senators Risch and Crapo and also my counterpart in the \nHouse, Montana's Representative Ryan Zinke. Current uncertainty in the \npermitting process threaten sources of clean, renewable power in my \nState. My bills would allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \nextend a license for nonfederal hydropower development on existing dams \nin my state of Montana.\n  The first bill would extend for 3 years a contract for hydropower \ndevelopment on the Clark Canyon Dam in Dillon, Montana. The bill would \nallow for construction and operation of a project that would power \nabout 1,200 homes each year with clean, renewable hydropower, while \nreplacing 18,000 metric tons of carbon each year. The bill would help \ncreate 30 to 40 jobs during construction. Further, the project would \nproduce $611,000 in State and Federal taxes over the first 5 years of \noperation and $37,000 in property tax contributions over the first 5 \nyears.\n  The second bill would provide a 6 year contract extension for \nnonfederal hydropower development on the Gibson Dam, near August and \nChoteau Montana. Once completed, the project will provide for decades \nof stable of tax revenues per year to each Teton and Lewis and Clark \nCounties, the state of Montana, and the Federal Government. Gibson \nHydro project will benefit the environment as they are required by \ntheir FERC license to incorporate measures in their operations and \nconstruction that would enhance fish and wildlife resources, water \nquality, recreational and aesthetic resources. Further, the project \nwould replace 40,000 tons of carbon per year and will strengthen the \nirrigation component of the Gibson Dam by providing a portion of the \npower sales to Greenfields Irrigation District to support irrigation \nimprovements, operations, water conservation and usage enhancements. \nThis bill will help create 15-25 construction jobs, $1 million in local \nrevenue over 2 years, and $4-5 million in wages during construction \nphase and over $200,000 per year for the Sun River Cooperative.\n  Hydropower development must be a key component of our Nation's all-\nof-the-above strategy to meet our Nation's needs. Passing these bills \nwill show the Senate's commitment to hydropower as a clean source of \npower for our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

UNITED STATES POLICY ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS \n                   CAPABILITY OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly stated that \n     its nuclear enrichment program is solely for peaceful \n     purposes. On September 20, 2009, the Supreme Leader of Iran, \n     Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated that Western nations ``falsely \n     accuse the Islamic republic of producing nuclear weapons. We \n     fundamentally reject nuclear weapons and prohibit the \n     production and the use of nuclear weapons''.\n       (2) President Bill Clinton, on August 5, 1996, signed the \n     Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996, which President Clinton \n     stated was intended to ``limit the flow of resources \n     necessary to obtain weapons of mass destruction''.\n       (3) In his 2006 State of the Union Address, President \n     George W. Bush stated that ``[t]he Iranian government is \n     defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations \n     of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain \n     nuclear weapons''.\n       (4) As recently as April 2015, President Obama reiterated \n     in an interview that ``[m]y goal, when I came into office, \n     was to make sure that Iran did not get a nuclear weapon and \n     thereby trigger a nuclear arms race in the most volatile part \n     of the world''.\n       (5) Secretary of State John Kerry, in the confirmation \n     hearing on his nomination for appointment to that position on \n     January 24, 2013, said about the development by Iran of a \n     nuclear weapon that ``[o]ur policy is not containment. It is \n     prevention, and the clock is ticking on our efforts to secure \n     responsible compliance''.\n       (6) In a March 2015 letter to Congress, President Obama \n     stated that ``[c]ertain actions and policies of the \n     Government of Iran are contrary to the interests of the \n     United States in the region and continue to pose an unusual \n     and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \n     policy, and economy of the United States''.\n       (7) On March 26, 2015, testifying before the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate, Generals Lloyd Austin, David \n     Rodriguez, and Joseph Votel, Commanders of the United States \n     Central Command, the United States Africa Command, and the \n     United States Special Operations Command, respectively, all \n     agreed that ``in terms of the long-term threat in the region, \n     Iran is the greatest threat to stability''.\n       (8) On February 26, 2015, testifying before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Director of National \n     Intelligence James Clapper was asked ``[i]s it still [United \n     States] policy that no options are off the table and that \n     Iran should not have a nuclear weapon?'' Director Clapper \n     replied, ``[t]hat's my understanding, yes sir. [. . .] No \n     option is off the table''.\n       (b) Declaration of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the \n     United States that the Islamic Republic of Iran should not \n     obtain nuclear weapons.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1161.
