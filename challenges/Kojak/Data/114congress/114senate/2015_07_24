Wicker, Susan \n           Collins, John Thune.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the hard work to pass a bipartisan, \nfiscally responsible, multiyear highway bill that doesn't raise taxes \nor increase the deficit continues. It hasn't been easy. We always knew \nobstacles would lie ahead at every turn, and they sure have, but our \ncountry needs a multiyear highway bill, and we will get there if we \njust continue to stick together.\n  Perhaps the most challenging issue now relates to amendments. \nSupporters of the Ex-Im Bank are demanding a vote to reauthorize it, \nand they have made it clear they are ready to stop all other amendments \nif denied that opportunity. They have already proven they have the \nvotes to back up the threat as well. This presents a challenge for the \nSenate and to opponents of the Ex-Im Bank, like myself in particular, \nbut I believe we can still move forward, and I believe the more \nequitable and more balanced proposal I just offered will allow us to do \nso.\n  So let me explain. It provides for votes on two long-sought, \nnongermane amendments. First, it allows a vote on an amendment to \nreauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, something nearly every Democrat wants. \nSecond, it allows a vote on an amendment that would repeal ObamaCare, \nsomething nearly every Republican wants and something we will continue \nto fight for.\n  Ex-Im shouldn't be the only vote we take on this bill, and under the \ncompromise I just filed, it will not be. That is a much fairer way \nforward.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join me in voting against Ex-Im, and I \nurge every Senator to take this important opportunity to join me in \nvoting to finally give the American people the fresh start they deserve \non health care.\n  I know we will engage in a robust debate on all of these issues--we \nshould--and then we will take a vote. While the clock demands that we \nfile cloture given that the highway trust fund will expire at the end \nof next week, I hope we still have a robust amendment process on this \ncritical bill.\n  So I would encourage every one of my colleagues to work with the bill \nmanagers on their germane amendments.\n  Senators should also note this: Yesterday, I circulated bill language \nto both sides of the aisle that I intended to use to modify my \namendment No. 2266. That language contained technical and conforming \nedits as well as the removal of a provision related to fugitive felons \nthat was not needed to fully offset the bill.\n  I wanted to let my colleagues know the amendment I just offered \ncontains one additional modification. It removes provisions that would \nhave terminated the $1.7 billion Hardest Hit Fund mortgage program. \nSeveral Senators on both sides of the aisle--and in particular Senator \nPortman on our side of the aisle has been a real champion on this \nissue--expressed their opposition to its termination. So we have \nreduced spending levels in the bill to accommodate this change, while \nensuring the bill remains fully paid for, for 3 years.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am just trying to focus. Did I just hear \nthe legislative tree being filled? I can answer that question.\n\n\n                    Tragedy in Lafayette, Louisiana\n\n  Madam President, this morning, Americans are waking to another news \naccount of a tragic and senseless shooting. This one occurred in \nLafayette, LA. The details are emerging, but at least two were murdered \nand about a dozen others were wounded.\n  We focus, as we should, on the innocent people watching the movie who \nwere murdered, but we also need to focus on the other dozen. How many \nof those people will be paraplegics, quadriplegics or have injuries \nthat will follow them for the rest of their lives? Time will only tell.\n  I know I speak for every Member of the Senate when I say our thoughts \nare with the victims, their families, and the many brave first \nresponders who were at the scene.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Madam President, once again the majority leader has cynically filed \nanother repeal of the Obama health care legislation--it was \nlegislation; it is now the law. I hope the Senate doesn't try to catch \nup with the House as to how many times they are going to try to repeal \nit.\n  It is a fact that the critics are stubbornly ignoring reality. That \nreality is that the bill passed many years ago. It has been reviewed in \ndetail by various courts in the land and the highest courts in the land \nhave upheld this law, including the Supreme Court, on two separate \noccasions.\n  We passed the Affordable Care Act. It has been signed into law. The \nSupreme Court has upheld it on two separate occasions. It is time for \nthe Republicans to move on and join us in trying to improve the health \ncare delivery system we have in America today. It is time to move on to \nsomething else because now we are approaching 20 million people who \nbenefit from the law that is now in existence.\n  Madam President, 85 percent of these 10.2 million consumers who have \ncoverage in these exchanges have tax credits to help them afford that \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nThese credits effectively cap premiums at a percent of income for those \nindividuals, defraying the impact of any premium increases.\n  Without going into more numbers, with rare exceptions, the fact is \nevery time I go home I have people come to me and say that we are so \ngrateful for this law because my daughter can now get health insurance. \nWe are not talking about a bunch of teenagers; we are talking about \npeople who were unable for all of their childhood and their adult life \nto get insurance until now.\n  We need to move on. This is not productive. I hope everyone will \nrecognize that the health care delivery system is not perfect, but we \nare willing to work with the Republicans in trying to improve it, but \nlet's do it constructively.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Madam President, finally, unless we act, in 3 months the Federal \nGovernment shuts down. I appreciate that this is not just me speaking \nout that something has to be done. The senior Senator from Arizona has \nsaid over the last week or so how important it is for the defense of \nthis country to get rid of sequestration. If sequestration kicks in, \nthe funding for defense and nondefense will be exactly the same. The \nonly way that can be changed is if we pass a law in the Senate. \nFrankly, I would think that is going to be hard to do.\n  We believe we want to do everything we can to help the defense of \nthis country, our fighting men and women, but we are also concerned \nabout nondefense programs which are in need of repair.\n  It would be untoward to think we are going to do sequestration at the \nNational Institutes of Health, as an example. Lifesaving, scientific \nresearch is being done there every day. The last sequestration knocked \ntheir pins out. I have talked to the head of the National Institutes of \nHealth, Dr. Francis Collins. For example, they were so close to coming \nup with a universal flu vaccine. They had to drop it. They lost almost \n$2 billion as a result of the first sequestration. I am sorry to say \nanother one that is staring them in the face will only be more hurtful \nto that great institution.\n\n\n                             Appropriations\n\n  Madam President, I was terribly disappointed yesterday to hear that \nmy friend the Speaker of the House intends to give up on doing his job. \nHe intends to abandon the appropriations process. He told a press \nconference yesterday: ``It's pretty clear given the number of days \nwe're going to be here in September that we're going to have to do a \n(continuing resolution) of some sort.''\n  By relying on a continuing resolution that underfunds critical \npriorities for working men and women in America--especially our \nfamilies--Republicans are neglecting their responsibilities and giving \nup on the middle class. Instead of working together with Democrats to \nnegotiate a long-term funding package, Republicans are calling it \nquits.\n  A continuing resolution should be a last-ditch, eleventh-hour option, \nnot an excuse 3 months before the deadline approaches to just say we \ngive up.\n  I hope the Speaker of the House will change course and recommit his \nparty to working with us. Three months, surely my Republican friends \nmust realize, is more than enough time for us to do our jobs.\n  Madam President, finally, there are a lot of complaints people can \nhave about the legislation before the body, but I do want to commend \nthe Republican leader for having this amendment before us dealing with \nthe Ex-Im Bank. It is very important that this legislation move on, and \nI hope the House will pass it as soon as they get it.\n  Right now, we have--let me just count them. I will not take the time \nhere, but there are about 45 different countries that have working \nexport-import banks that help their businesses and workers compete \nglobally. They are really hurting our exports because our exporters are \ngoing to these other companies trying to get some help so they can \ncontinue exporting. So I truly do appreciate this being part of this \nlegislation. It is an important piece of legislation. I am so glad the \nmajority leader put that in as something we are going to work on over \nthe next few days.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, today is a sad day for this institution.\n  The Senate operates based on trust. Whether we are Democrats or \nRepublicans, these 100 Senators have to be able to trust that when a \nSenator says something, he or she will do it, even if we disagree on \nsubstance--that we don't lie to each other.\n  What we just witnessed this morning is profoundly disappointing. I \nwant to describe the context of two preceding discussions.\n  A number of weeks ago, when this Senate was considering trade \npromotion authority, a group of Senators gathered on this floor and \nblocked TPA for many minutes because they were pressing for the Export-\nImport Bank. They huddled on this floor and negotiated a deal in front \nof C-SPAN and in front of the world. Then, when they had their deal, \nTPA had the votes to pass.\n  Shortly thereafter, we had a Senate Republican lunch, where I stood \nand asked the majority leader, very directly: What is the deal that was \njust cut on TPA and was there a deal for the Export-Import Bank? It was \na direct question I asked the majority leader in front of all of the \nRepublican Senators. The majority leader was visibly angry with me that \nI would ask such a question, and the majority leader looked at me and \nsaid: There is no deal. There is no deal. There is no deal. Like Saint \nPeter, he repeated it three times.\n  He said: The only thing I told the proponents of the Export-Import \nBank is, like any other Senator in this body, they could offer any \namendment they liked on any amendable vehicle, but I gave them nothing. \nThere is no deal. I gave them nothing. He was emphatic and he was \nrepeated.\n  Following that public discussion, Senator Mike Lee and I approached \nthe majority leader afterward, in which he emphasized: There is no \ndeal. I will do nothing. I oppose the Export-Import Bank. All I said is \nthey can offer an amendment like any Senator can to any bill.\n  I went back to my office and I sat down and I had a long discussion \nwith my staff. My staff told me that afternoon: He is lying to you. \nThat is what my staff said. We have been around the Senate a long time. \nHe is not telling you the truth.\n  What I told my staff that afternoon, I said: Well, I don't know if \nthat is the case or not, but I don't see how, when the majority leader \nlooks me in the eyes and makes an explicit promise--and by the way, \nlooks into the eyes of every other Republican Senator and says that to \nevery other Republican Senator--I don't see how I cannot take him at \nhis word when he makes an explicit promise.\n  As a result, I cast my vote in May in support of TPA because I \nsupport free trade, and I felt I had no choice but to assume that when \nthe majority leader spoke to 54 Republican Senators and made an \nexplicit promise, he wasn't lying to us. Well, as TPA moved on and it \nwent to the House, it became abundantly clear there was a deal. There \nwas a deal in the House for the Export-Import Bank. So the second time \nTPA came up, I voted no because of that corrupt deal.\n  Now, I will note to the public that the majority leader and the \nSpeaker of the House had repeatedly said: There was no corrupt deal. \nThere was no corrupt deal. We made no deal. We made no deal. That is \none element of the background context.\n  Let me tell you a second element of the background context. A number \nof weeks ago, when we were debating the Corker-Cardin bill, the Iran \nreview act, there were a number of amendments that Senators had filed. \nI filed an amendment that would actually put teeth in the Iran review \nact by requiring affirmative congressional approval before sanctions on \nIran could be lifted. Other Senators filed very good amendments. \nSenator Marco Rubio filed an amendment calling for Iran to recognize \nIsrael's right to exist as a Jewish State before sanctions could be \nlifted. Our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle did not want to \nvote on that amendment, and in response, the majority leader cut off \nall amendments.\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\n  Now, I sat in the majority leader's office, and I urged the majority \nleader: Invoke cloture on Senator Rubio's amendment. Invoke cloture on \nSenator Rubio's amendment calling on Iran to recognize Israel's right \nto exist and setting that as a precondition of any lifting of \nsanctions. I argued vociferously with the majority leader that if the \nDemocrats were so opposed to voting on that amendment, that was all the \nmore reason, because it was important substantively. The majority \nleader said no, he would not do so, that invoking cloture on an \namendment was an extraordinary step, and he would not do so. So he cut \noff every amendment. He filled the tree.\n  It was striking a minute ago seeing the Democratic leader, Senator \nHarry Reid, calling out the majority leader for filling the tree, for \nengaging in the same procedural abuse that Harry Reid did over and over \nand over again in this body. Now the Republican leader is behaving like \nthe senior Senator from Nevada.\n  What we just saw was not, Madam President, what the majority leader \ntold you and me and every other Republican Senator. What we just saw \nwas not that the proponents of the Export-Import Bank, like anyone \nelse, could stand up and offer whatever amendment they like on any \nissue. What the majority leader did is, No. 1, he called up that \namendment. He called it up himself. Why does that matter? Because, as \nthe majority leader, he has priority of recognition. When he calls up \nan amendment, no one can stop him. He didn't just call it up; he filled \nthe tree. Just like Harry Reid, he filled the tree, blocking everyone \nelse's amendment. And, by the way, I agree with Senator Reid when he \nsays the ObamaCare amendment is a cynical amendment. Of course it is. \nIt is empty showmanship.\n  We will have a vote on repealing ObamaCare. The Republicans will all \nvote yes, and the Democrats will all vote no. It will be at a 60-vote \nthreshold. It will be an exercise in meaningless political theater. \nMind you, when we had a fight in October of 2013 to actually stop \nObamaCare and defund it, the majority leader, then the minority leader, \nwas opposed to doing something with real teeth in it to stop ObamaCare. \nBut an empty show vote--that is a good way of distracting from what is \ngoing on.\n  You know, there is a profound disappointment among the American \npeople because we keep winning elections and then we keep getting \nleaders who don't do anything they promise. The American people were \ntold: If only we have a Republican majority in the House, things will \nbe different. Well, in 2010, the American people showed up in enormous \nnumbers, and we got a Republican majority in the House, and very little \nchanged. Then the American people were told, you know, the problem is \nthe Senate. If only we get a Republican majority in the Senate and \nretire Harry Reid as majority leader, then things will be different. \nWell, in 2014, the American people rose up in enormous numbers and \nvoted to do exactly that. We have had a Republican majority in both \nHouses of Congress now for about 6 months.\n  What has that majority done?\n  The first thing we did in December is we came back and passed a \ntrillion dollar CRomnibus plan filled with pork and corporate welfare. \nThat was the very first thing we did. Then this Republican majority \nvoted to fund ObamaCare, voted to fund President Obama's \nunconstitutional Executive amnesty. Then leadership rammed through the \nconfirmation of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. Which of those \ndecisions would be one iota different if Harry Reid were still majority \nleader? Not a one. Not a one. This Senate operates exactly the same--\nthe same priorities. Let me tell you why. It is not that this majority \ndoesn't get things done. It does get things done. But it listens to one \nand only one voice; that is the voice of the Washington cartel--the \nlobbyists on K Street, the big money and big corporations.\n  If you go to the American people and ask if reauthorizing the Ex-Im \nBank is a priority for you, the standard response for most of them \nwould be this: The what? They don't even know what this is. Let me tell \nyou what it is. It is an egregious example of corporate welfare. It is \nthe American taxpayer being on the dime for hundreds of billions of \ndollars in loan guarantees given out to a handful of giant \ncorporations. It is a classic example of cronyism and corporate \nwelfare. By the way, among others, do you know what person had the \nclarity of thought on that? Then-Senator Barack Obama, who described it \nas a classic example of corporate welfare. That was when he was in the \nSenate. Now that he is in the White House, corporate welfare sounds \npretty good. Now, just about all of the Democrats are supporting the \ncorporate welfare with the exception of Bernie Sanders. I will give \ncredit to Senator Sanders for standing up against corporate welfare. \nBut as to every Democrat who rails against big money and the corruption \nof Washington, as to every Democrat who styles himself or herself a \npopulist, their actions on this matter speak far louder than their \nwords. When it comes to Republicans, Republicans also are listening to \nK Street and the lobbyists. Why? It is not complicated. The giant \ncorporations that are getting special favors from the taxpayers hire an \narmy of lobbyists who write campaign checks after campaign checks. And, \nby the way, these checks go to both Democrats and Republicans. It is \ncareer politicians in both parties who are kept in office by looting \nthe taxpayer to benefit wealthy powerful corporations.\n\n  The single largest recipient of loan guarantees from the Ex-Im Bank \nis the Boeing corporation. The Boeing corporation just had an earnings \ncall where their CEO said--and I am paraphrasing: We'll be just fine \nwithout the Ex-Im Bank. It is not impacting us. There are plenty of \nprivate loan alternatives out there. But even though the market could \nprovide, it is a lot easier to have compliant lawmakers rob from the \npublic fist to enrich giant corporations.\n  Do you know who doesn't have lobbyists? A single mom waiting tables. \nDo you know who doesn't have lobbyists? A teenage immigrant like my \nfather, washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour, struggling to achieve \nthe American dream. Do you know who doesn't have lobbyists? A factory \nworker who just wants to work and provide for his or her children. They \ndon't have lobbyists, and so what happens? Career politicians in both \nparties gang up with giant corporations to loot their taxes to make it \nharder for people who are struggling to achieve the American dream.\n  Coal miners, Madam President, in your State don't have lobbyists who \nare representing them here--the individual miners--while the majority \nleader teams up with the Democratic leader to take from their paychecks \nto fund giant corporations. It is wrong and it is corrupt.\n  It saddens me to say this. I sat in my office. I told my staff: The \nmajority leader looked me in the eye and looked 54 Republicans in the \neye. I cannot believe he would tell a flatout lie, and I voted based on \nthose assurances that he made to each and every one of us. What we just \nsaw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told \nevery Republican Senator but what he told the press over and over and \nover again was a simple lie.\n  This institution should not operate at the beck and call of lobbyists \nin Washington. This institution, the majority and minority leaders arm \nin arm again, should not team up against the American taxpayers. It is \nwhy our children are going bankrupt.\n  Now we are facing an enormous threat with this Iran deal. A nuclear \nIran poses the greatest national security threat to this country. Yet \nthe majority leader refused to do what he just did for the Export-\nImport Bank on Iran. He refused to invoke cloture. That was an \nextraordinary step. If he was telling us the truth when he said there \nwas no deal, why would he do what he just did? Well, we now know that \nwhen the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit \ncommitment, he is willing to say things that he knows are false. That \nhas consequences for how this body operates. If you or I cannot trust \nwhat the majority leader tells us, that will have consequences on other \nlegislation as well, on how this institution operates.\n  There are a host of amendments that the American people have focused \non--issues such as defunding Planned Parenthood after the gruesome \nvideo. The majority leader doesn't want to vote\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\non that. That is actually something the American people are focused on. \nHe brought up his ObamaCare amendment as a smokescreen, because it is \nintended to fail. But you know, what he didn't bring up was my \namendment to end the congressional exemption from ObamaCare--the \ncorrupt deal that Harry Reid cut with President Obama to exempt Members \nof Congress. We ought to live under the same rules as everybody else. \nThe majority leader doesn't want to vote on that because he doesn't \nwant to end the cronyism for Members of Congress any more than end the \ncronyism for giant corporations that enrich themselves at the expense \nof the American people.\n  There are a host of priorities for the voters who elected you and me. \nMadam President, I would ask you to think about when you were running \nfor the Senate not too long ago. Do you recall any of your constituents \never saying: We want the Export-Import Bank. No, they want other \nthings. They have other priorities, but those are not the priorities of \nthe Republican leadership.\n  Sadly, today we have government of the lobbyists, by the lobbyists, \nand for the lobbyists. That is not how the Senate is supposed to \noperate. A far more important amendment than bringing back this \ncorporate welfare and cronyism is my amendment that provides that \nsanctions on Iran cannot be lifted unless and until Iran does two \nthings: No. 1, it recognizes Israel's right to exist as a Jewish State, \nand No. 2, it releases the four American hostages languishing in \nIranian prisons. That is a far more important issue than enriching some \nmore lobbyists on K Street and getting a few more campaign \ncontributions. That is what we should be voting on.\n  Accordingly, Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 2301 to the \nMcConnell amendment No. 2266, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not in order to be offered, \nas it is inconsistent with the Senate's precedents with respect to the \noffering of amendments, their number, degree, and kind.\n\n\n                   Appeal of the Ruling of the Chair.\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair that the \namendment is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The appeal is debatable.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to start by thanking the \nPresiding Officer for her work on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. We did what some people think is the impossible: We passed a \nbill without one dissenting vote to move forward with a 6-year \nreauthorization of our highway and transit programs.\n  People say: How did the committee do it? You are so split on other \nissues.\n  It is because we recognize--all of us, whether we are liberal, \nprogressive, moderate, conservative, very conservative--that it is \nessential for our great Nation to have an infrastructure that works. \nLast week, a bridge collapsed in California. It was a miracle no one \nwas killed. That bridge carries people from California to Arizona. That \nmeans commerce goes over that bridge. That means passenger cars go over \nit.\n  This is what happened. This is what it is about. It is not about what \ncommittees got in a room. It is not about Senator Cruz's ideological \nissues. It is not about any lobbyist. It is about the hard, cold fact \nthat more than 60,000 of our bridges are structurally deficient. It is \nvery hard to go to bed at night knowing we have not done anything about \nthis except just do these short-term extensions of the highway trust \nfund where States are simply not undertaking the kinds of projects they \nneed to undertake, which are inspecting those bridges and moving \nforward with repairing and strengthening them.\n  The reason I have this here--to me, it is the poster child of why, on \na bipartisan basis, we need to continue to move forward. Forget about \nthe naysayers on the Democratic side. Forget about the naysayers on the \nRepublican side. Let's have those of us who see this as the issue, not \nthe process, you know, not the sequester which we have to solve--it is \nnot part of this.\n  We have two bad problems facing us: the highway trust fund that funds \nthe transit and highway system and sequester is another problem. If we \ncan solve this problem now, let's solve this problem now.\n  We have a coming together, a very odd coalition here of Republicans \nand Democrats, despite the fact, I venture to say, that not one person \nloves this bill. There are always going to be things in a bill you \ndon't like. We stripped some of the pay-fors that were hurting our \ncities. Thanks to Senators Portman, Stabenow, and Peters, that was \ndone. That is good. We have a bill that is fully paid for, for 3 \nyears--the first time in 10 years.\n  We can always find problems. We can always say: Why are we doing this \nand not doing that? Well, the reason we are doing this is--if my \nnumbers are right--we are single digits away from the highway trust \nfund going bust. It goes bust on July 31. Imagine. And we are fighting \nabout this? We ought to be moving this faster. Oh, no, we have a \nfilibuster; we have to be in this weekend. But it is worth it. I asked \nmy staff to figure it out. Over the 3-year period, it is 2 million \njobs--2 million jobs. That is a quarter of the jobs that were lost in \nthe great recession. The fact is, those families are suffering still--\nover 500,000 construction workers out of work.\n  I want to say this. When people say ``Well, the lobbyists are winning \nhere,'' who are the people who are pushing us for a bill?\n  I would ask the American people--make your decision. The U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the \nLaborers' International Union of North America, the AAA, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, American Council of Engineering \nCompanies--I would just say to folks that this is a rare coming \ntogether of America. The Presiding Officer has been around here for a \nwhile. It is hard to find the U.S. Chamber on the same page as the \nLaborers' International and on the same page as Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving and the Conference of Mayors and engineering companies.\n  Let's continue looking at this list: the American Highway Users \nAlliance, the American Public Transportation Association, the American \nRoad & Transportation Builders Association, the Society of Civil \nEngineers, the American truckers, the Associated Equipment \nDistributors, the general contractors, the equipment manufacturers, the \nAssociation of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, the National \nAsphalt Pavement Association.\n  Labor has come together with business. Cities have come together with \nStates. The users of the roads, the AAA--remember how we call them when \nour car breaks down, sometimes because it falls into a pothole and gets \nall messed up? The AAA wants this done.\n  I am saying that this is an opportunity. There are naysayers on \neverything. It is rare that we can come together and get anything done. \nThis is one of those moments.\n  I want to share the fact that, on average, Federal funds provide 52 \npercent of every State's outlays for highways and bridges--52 percent, \nthe average. There are some States that rely on the Federal Government \nmore. I will tell you which States they are: Montana, 87 percent \nreliance on the Federal Government; Idaho, 68 percent reliance; Oregon, \n54 percent reliance; Colorado, 64 percent--in other words, these States \nare counting on us--New Mexico, 70 percent; Minnesota, 64 percent; \nMissouri, 65 percent; Oklahoma, 63 percent; Mississippi, 65 percent; \nAlabama, 68 percent; Georgia, 62 percent; South Carolina, 79 percent; \nNew Hampshire 57 percent; Vermont, 86 percent--I am sorry, New \nHampshire is 68 percent--Maine, 57 percent; Rhode Island counts on it \nfor everything, almost 100 percent; Connecticut, 71 percent; DC, 52 \npercent; Alaska, 93 percent; Hawaii, 79 percent; West Virginia--I \nthought my friend would be interested--61 percent reliance.\n  So what I am trying to say is that if we do not succeed on this and \nwe give it a patch again, our States will shut\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\ndown. Seven States have already shut down their programs. They cannot \nsign contracts to fix any bridge. If seven States have already shut \ndown and we do another extension, we are talking about hundreds of \nthousands of jobs bleeding--bleeding. We will spin back into a bad \nsituation.\n  I see the Senator from Montana is here. I was just going through the \nlist and showing that our States do rely on this highway program, and \nMontana relies on it for 87 percent of their spending. The average in \nthe country is 52 percent, but a lot of our Western States that have so \nmany miles rely on us more. My own State is 49 percent, but I have to \nsay, we have 40 million people, and if we are not getting 49 percent of \nwhat we are used to getting, we are shutting down a lot of programs.\n  I say all the time, if you want to get a house and you go to the bank \nand it says: Oh, you are cleared. You get a mortgage for 5 months. \nWell, you are not going to buy the house. You are not going to buy the \nhouse. You are going to say: Well, thank you for nothing. And that is \nthe place we are.\n  I know my colleague would like to have the floor, and I don't need to \nsay anything else except we have been working so hard across the aisle, \nSenator Durbin and I, with Senator McConnell and Senator Inhofe. It has \nbeen a collaboration and it has been difficult. We come to the table \nwith different ideologies and different ideas. We have hammered it out, \nand we have hammered it out because none of us, whether we are a \nRepublican or Democrat, moderate or conservative or liberal, wants to \nsee this happen again anywhere, but it is going to happen again.\n  I can't tell you how shocked I was. Imagine, anyone going to Arizona \nnow has to go 400 miles out of their way. What does that do to \ncommerce? What does that do to the truck drivers trying to deliver \ngoods? What does it do to our tourist industry? How many people go back \nand forth? They are going to make a fix to this, but it is going to be \na little tough because they are going to take one span and shut it down \nwhile they fix it and the other will be a one-way this way and that \nway. So it could be more dangerous.\n  I just say thank you to my Republican friends, to my Democratic \nfriends. We have two amendments, one is the Ex-IM Bank. We will vote on \nit on Sunday. Hopefully, that will pass and be attached to this bill. \nIt is an important jobs bill.\n  The other one is a Republican amendment to repeal ObamaCare. I will \nnot go into it today, but I have to say the House has voted 55 times on \nthis issue. The Supreme Court said it is fine. We are reaching 20 \nmillion Americans who now have health care. Why, as my friend the \nDemocratic leader asked, don't we just get together and make ObamaCare \nbetter?\n  I have met so many people who are thrilled to have insurance, but \nthere are ways we can make it better. But to talk about repealing \nsomething that is already in law, and it will be there--we can make it \nbetter. Let's not keep this repealing ObamaCare idea out there because \nit would hurt too many people and would create chaos.\n  I hope we will vote against that and vote for Ex-Im. But much more \nimportant is that we are going to see Senator Cruz and others who want \nto disrupt this, who will offer a lot of irrelevant amendments--\namendments on Iran, amendments on a woman's right to choose. That is \nwhat is going to happen. The Chair is going to rule in accordance with \nprecedent, and we are going to have to support the ruling of the Chair. \nIt is going to be a tough and messy process.\n  Someone said to me: Now that you are in the middle of this, is it \ntrue that passing a law is like making sausage? I said: Well, that \nwould be an insult to sausage. That is how tough it is. It is tough. \nLast night, at 11:30, 20 minutes to 12, I thought the deal was off. It \nhas been tough, but we managed to come together.\n  We don't want this to happen. We want to give certainty to the \nStates, and I hope we will stick together, as strange as the coalition \nis--because it is an odd one of Republicans and Democrats, though it is \nthe way the Senate used to work--and get this done.\n  Again, I thank all Members, even the ones who have opposed me \nstrongly and opposed Senator McConnell strongly. Thank you for being \nhere, and I hope you will be here Sunday because we have a couple of \nvery important votes.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, some in my home State of Montana like to \nsay we have two seasons: winter and construction season.\n  In fact, I grew up in the construction business. You learn in Montana \nthere is a famous line when you are paving and putting in \ninfrastructure. It is called 40 degrees and rising. In other words, if \nthe temperature is not at least 40 degrees and rising, you are not \nsupposed to pave. What that means is that we don't have a real long \nconstruction season in Montana to build our highways.\n  I also know how important it is to have certainty before you can \nbreak ground, before you can plan a project. With long winters and \nshort summers, Montana construction workers know what it is like to \nwait for 40 degrees and rising before putting down the asphalt. \nUnfortunately, they have also learned to wait a long time for a long-\nterm highway bill that provides the certainty needed to make the long-\nterm investments in infrastructure.\n  Congress has passed 33--let me say that again, 33--short-term \nextensions in an attempt to keep the highway trust fund solvent. Those \nare 33 too many short-term extensions. As somebody who has spent 28 \nyears in the private sector, I think it is ridiculous as I watch the \nway the Federal Government operates to try to manage in this spurt-\ndriven, short-term-driven environment of Washington, DC--and I would \nargue crisis-driven environment.\n  This uncertainty, coupled with rigid programs that make planning and \nexecuting projects very difficult, is prohibitive to progress and \nstrengthening the infrastructure in our country. These short-term \nextensions, these short construction seasons for those who live in the \nNorthern part of our country, along with these rigid regulations, leave \nStates such as Montana with their hands tied and hard-working Montana \nconstruction workers with their pockets empty.\n  Montana's short construction season is already well underway, and it \nis critical that Congress approves a multiyear solution that provides \nMontana and the rest of our country with the certainty needed to make \nlong-term infrastructure investments.\n  Montana's extensive transportation is a pillar of our economy. It \nallows visitors, our tourists, to come to our State and enjoy our \nnational parks. It allows our residents, including our farmers and our \nranchers, the ability to traverse the State and to get their goods to \nmarket. In any final transportation bill, it is critical to maintain \nMontana's share of Federal highway, transit, and safety programs.\n  Congress needs to maintain support for the rural as well as the \nmetropolitan areas. In fact, vehicle miles traveled increased in \nMontana by 43 percent from 1990 to 2012--to nearly 12 billion vehicle \nmiles traveled. This is estimated to increase another 30 percent by \n2030.\n  Because Montana is a bridge State, we play a vital role in national \nconnectivity. For example, Interstate 90 connects the east coast to the \nwest coast. It runs from Boston to Seattle. I-15 connects our northern-\nto-southern borders. Now, I-90 is 3,000 miles long. Nearly 600 miles \npass through the State of Montana. In fact, you add up the number of \nmiles of interstate highway we have in Montana alone, it is over 1,000 \nmiles. How far is 1,000 miles? To put that in DC terms, it is like \ngoing from Washington, DC, to Kansas City. In fact, the I-15 stretch \nthat runs north-south in Montana is the second longest section of I-15. \nIt is only 4 miles shorter than the entire north-south direction of the \nState of Utah.\n  In fact, studies by the research group TRIP have shown the two \nlargest transportation challenges facing Montana are I-90 and I-15. \nThere is inadequate capacity, there is deterioration of the pavement, \nand we need bridges replaced because these inadequacies will have a \nnational impact. TRIP estimates $7.4 billion is needed to address \nMontana's top 20 list of challenges. However, there is only $1.2 \nbillion currently available. That leaves a nearly $6 billion backlog.\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\n  What we need is to support a long-term highway bill. It creates \nconstruction jobs--union jobs. That is what is sitting on the table \nright now and what we will be debating this week in the Senate. These \nnew jobs, created by increased access and infrastructure capacity, are \nbeing left unrealized.\n  Specifically, in these times of constrained funding, it is critical \nto allow our States to have the flexibility to direct funds to their \ntop needs and their most effective projects. The bill we are now \ndebating will create a multiyear highway authorization and provide time \nto plan important long-term projects around the country and provide 3 \nyears of guaranteed funding for the highway trust fund.\n  I am an engineer by degree. In fact, I am the only chemical engineer \nwho serves in Congress. When you are in engineering, you take a look at \na problem and you find a solution. When you are an engineer, you lay \nout project plans. We need to put certainty in place so we can plan to \nimprove the infrastructure of this country--to rebuild our highways, \nrebuild our bridges that are so much in need of repair at the moment.\n  If we pass a multiyear highway bill, it will reverse Congress's trend \nof short-term, temporary bandaid fixes to fund the Nation's \ntransportation network. Across the country and in Montana these patches \nhave left States and localities without the certainty they need to plan \nand build long-term infrastructure projects.\n  In the Senate committee on commerce, I have been working to ensure we \nhave some of these needed reforms, and I want to thank Senator John \nThune for his efforts in leading the committee. I look forward to a \nrobust amendment process and debate on this much needed legislation.\n  The bottom line: I am looking forward to passing a long-term, \nmultiyear highway bill that provides certainty, that improves the \ninfrastructure of our country and most importantly creates jobs.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I rise to express my deep appreciation \nto my colleagues Senators Stabenow and Brown and to the majority leader \nfor the bipartisan work that was done to remove a harmful and \neconomically costly financing provision from the bill that is currently \nbefore this body. I had significant concerns with a provision in the \npending highway bill which could have impaired the economic recovery in \nmy home State of Michigan and in States across our country.\n  I am a strong supporter of programming to invest in our Nation's \ninfrastructure, and much of the substance of this bill is absolutely \nessential. I applaud the work that has been done on a bipartisan basis \nto achieve a compromise, something that happens too little in \nWashington. While I believe Congress must make smart investments in our \nNation's roads, bridges, and infrastructure, I also believe we must do \nso in a responsible way that does not hamper the economic recovery \noccurring in our States.\n  There are numerous financing policy alternatives available to \nlawmakers to fund infrastructure investments, but the drafters of this \nlegislation originally chose to pay for infrastructure investments, in \npart, by asking some of the hardest hit communities in our Nation and \nin my State to bear the burden in order to help pay for the \ninfrastructure investments contained in this bill. I am talking about a \nprovision in the original bill and in the substitute which would have \neliminated an important economic recovery program called the Hardest \nHit Fund.\n  The Hardest Hit Fund has successfully supported efforts by local \nlenders to promote economic revitalization and renewal after the \ndeepest and most painful housing and financial crisis in modern \nhistory. The Hardest Hit Fund helps States and municipalities invest in \ntheir citizens and in their communities. According to the most recent \ndata reported by the State of Michigan, the Hardest Hit Fund has \nassisted more than 25,000 of my constituents in preserving their piece \nof the American Dream--their family home.\n  Not only are these funds being used to keep eligible families in \ntheir homes, but these dollars have also been put to work improving \nneighborhoods that have been devastated by urban blight resulting from \nAmerica's most recent economic challenge.\n  In Michigan, we know the impact abandoned properties can have on \neconomic renewal. Blight is not just ugly, creating eyesores and \ndragging down surrounding property values, empty homes and buildings \nalso serve as way stations for criminals and drug dealers and further \ndiscourages outside investors and homeowners from taking a chance on a \nneighborhood that has been affected by blight.\n  That is why local leaders have been working with the nonprofit and \nprivate sectors to identify and eradicate blight in our communities. \nSeveral thousand blighted properties have been demolished or removed \nthanks to Michigan's partnership with the Hardest Hit Fund, and \nthousands more are in the pipeline to be addressed in the near term.\n  Thanks to the work done to address blight, homeowners are investing \nagain in neighborhoods. Urban farming and greening and beautification \nefforts are well underway with businesses, nonprofits, and local \nschoolchildren transforming their communities one block at a time. Some \nof the impacted cities have already made investments in this area in \nanticipation of reimbursement from the Hardest Hit Fund. It would have \nbeen an unfair and inappropriate breach of our agreement to pull the \nrug out from under these cities at this stage in the game. That is why \nI worked with Senators Debbie Stabenow and Sherrod Brown to offer an \namendment to strike this provision in the highway bill that would have \nrescinded the remaining Hardest Hit Fund money from communities that \nmost desperately need it.\n  Congress must come together and pass a multiyear transportation bill \nthat makes smart investments to upgrade our country's crumbling \ninfrastructure, but it would have been unacceptable to fund this plan \nat the expense of the communities in Michigan and other States that \nrely on the Hardest Hit Fund to eliminate blight and improve their \nlocal neighborhoods. This proposal not only risked future blight-\nremoval funds, it could have left cities across Michigan on the hook \nfor millions of dollars already outlaid for blight-removal projects.\n  As legislators, it is important that we first do no harm when making \npolicy. In considering this highway bill, it is important for us not to \nharm the very communities we are aiming to help by advancing \ninfrastructure policies.\n  It was important for us to act to avoid impairing the economic \nrenewal that is underway in places such as Detroit, Flint, Grand \nRapids, Saginaw, Pontiac, and other communities across my great State. \nElimination of Hardest Hit funding would have been harmful to entire \ncommunities that are relying on public-private partnerships to \ntransform their communities.\n  For these reasons, I was prepared to oppose the legislation we are \nconsidering today because I believed these changes would do damage to \nthe economic recovery in my State. I could not in good conscience \nsupport this legislation under those conditions. But thanks to the \nunwavering dedication of my colleague, the senior Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow, and the cooperation of the majority leader, we \nwere able to find a way forward that avoids disruption to this \nimportant program and avoids devastating economic outcomes in cities \nacross my State.\n  This is what the legislative process should be all about here in the \nSenate. We were able to come from a point of major disagreement, and \nthrough intense and respectful discussion, we were able to agree on a \nworkable solution. This process has demonstrated that colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle can work together to prioritize the needs of \ntheir constituents while also advancing the economic interests of our \ncountry.\n  I look forward to further consideration of this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n                        SBA's 7(a) Loan Program\n\n  Madam President, I wish to take a moment to express my gratitude to \nmy colleagues in the Senate for prioritizing the needs of our Nation's \nsmall businesses.\n  Last night the Senate passed a critical and timely reform of the \nSmall Business Administration's flagship lending program, the 7(a) Loan \nGuaranty Program.\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\n  Because of a growing economy and increased demand for small business \nloans, the SBA's 7(a) lending authority for this fiscal year may have \nbeen jeopardized absent the actions we took last night. This bill \nincreased the 7(a) loan program authority from $18.75 billion to $23.5 \nbillion. It also tightened the standards on lenders' determinations of \nborrower eligibility in order to target the SBA guaranty to promote \nloans to those who truly need it, and it included robust SBA reporting \nrequirements that will keep Congress updated on the pace of lending \ngoing forward.\n  I am glad we were able to act in a bipartisan fashion to address this \nissue to continue to put the wind at the back of our country's \nentrepreneurs. We must make sure small businesses continue to receive \nthe resources they need to survive, to compete, and to succeed.\n  I thank Senators Vitter, Shaheen, and Risch for their leadership on \nthis matter. I have been working with them since the spring to increase \nthe lending authority, and I am proud to say we accomplished that for \nthe rest of this fiscal year.\n  Small businesses need to access the capital they need in order to \ncontinue growing and creating jobs. The 7(a) program is a true success \nstory that provides small businesses and startups with a versatile \nfinancing tool that can be used to support a wide range of business \ndevelopment activities.\n  It is also a promising sign for our economy that demand for the 7(a) \nloan program is increasing at a faster rate than anticipated just last \nDecember when the previous authorization level was set.\n  In last week's semiannual ``Monetary Policy Report'' to Congress, the \nFederal Reserve indicated that financing conditions for America's small \nbusinesses were continuing to improve.\n  In recent months, SBA's 7(a) program has experienced unprecedented \ndemand, approving over 45,000 loans this year totalling more than $16.5 \nbillion--a 25-percent increase over this same period last year.\n  According to a Pepperdine University and Dun & Bradstreet study \npublished this summer, America's small businesses are seeing rises in \nrevenue, with 48 percent of surveyed small firms reporting revenue \nincreases--4 percent growth from 3 years ago. Demand for small business \nloans increased by 9 percent over the first quarter's study.\n  These are positive signs. We have more work to do, but they are very \npositive. If these trends continue, we will need to ensure that next \nyear's lending authorization level reflects the still-recovering \neconomy and the growth of small business loan demand so that we will \nnot be up against the cap again next year.\n  The reporting improvements in the bill passed last night will also \nhelp Congress perform better oversight and monitor the developments in \nthe 7(a) lending program in a more timely manner.\n  The 7(a) program is a critical tool in the small business policy \ntoolkit because it helps our economy at no cost to the taxpayer. Let me \nrepeat. This is a no-subsidy program, so this increased authorization \ncomes at no cost to taxpayers.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and helping them \ngrow and compete should be a bipartisan priority. As a member of the \nSenate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to explore other \nsmall business policy changes in the months and years ahead. Our \nNation's small businesses create jobs and help support our local tax \nbases, which in turn feed education, public safety, and health care \npriorities.\n  It is not a stretch to say that if small businesses succeed, all of \nour communities succeed. That is why I was proud to work with Senator \nRisch as the lead cosponsor on the Small Business Lending \nReauthorization Act of 2015 earlier this year, and I was proud to work \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship to pass this legislation to deliver needed results \nlast night.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I rise today to join many of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to express grave concerns with the currently \nproposed Iran deal from the administration. This deal is fundamentally \nat odds with the goals that these negotiations set out to achieve in \nthe first place, which were to prevent a nuclear Iran. In fact, this \ndeal does the opposite. It provides a patient pathway to the nation of \nIran.\n  With this deal, the administration has granted international blessing \nto a full-scale Iranian nuclear program in 15 years. With this deal, we \nlet Iran keep its most prized nuclear assets, such as advanced \ncentrifuges and to convert but not dismantle its nuclear reactors at \nArak and Fordow. With this deal, the anytime, anyplace access to all of \nIran's nuclear facilities became managed access. With this deal, \ninspectors need 24-day permission from Tehran to access their military \nfacilities such as Parchin, which we know were used for nuclear \nweaponization work in the past.\n  With this deal, our economic leverage in Iran through the sanctions \nregime that was painstakingly built over a number of years will be \ncompletely squandered. With this deal, Iran will rebuild its economy \nand add economic resilience against future sanctions through $100 to \n$150 billion in economic relief and lifting the sanctions.\n  With this deal, the arms embargo on Iran will be lifted in a mere 5 \nyears, allowing the regime to double down on its terrorism activities, \nincluding its support for Hezbollah, Hamas, and the murderous Assad \nregime in Syria.\n  With this deal, the ballistic missile embargo will be ended in 8 \nyears. The ballistic missile embargo against Iran will be lifted in 8 \nyears, directly endangering Israel and further down the line, the U.S. \nhomeland. As with many aspects of this agreement, hard-nosed \nverification gives way to Iran's wishes.\n  According to the new U.N. Security Council resolution, Iran is \n``called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic \nmissiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.'' That \nis the U.N. Security Council resolution.\n  What if Iran ignores the call of the international community, as it \nhas done through decades of deception and violations of U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions?\n  There is no other way to describe this deal other than as a massive \nwin for the Iranian regime at the expense of the national security of \nthe United States and our closest allies.\n  The leaders of the nation of Israel, the nation which Iran has \nthreatened to ``wipe off the face of the earth'' have agreed. Has the \nPresident listened to our military and the intelligence community \nbefore concluding this terrible deal? The 2014 Quadrennial Defense \nReview said:\n\n       Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear weapons, Iran's \n     other destabilizing activities will continue to pose a threat \n     to the Middle East, especially to the security of our allies \n     and partners in the region and around the world.\n\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, \ntestified that ``under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on \nIran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.''\n  Defense Secretary Ash Carter said: ``We want [Iran] to continue to be \nisolated as a military and limited in terms of the kinds of equipment \nand material they are able to procure.''\n  Yet we have the conventional arms embargo lifted in 5 years and the \nballistic missile embargo in 8 years under this deal. The deal achieves \nnone of those goals, but instead lets Iran off the hook to pursue arms \nexports and ballistic missile activities in only a few short years.\n  Yesterday I had the opportunity to engage Secretary Kerry, Secretary \nMoniz, and Secretary Lew at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I \nwas left confounded and stunned by their responses.\n  I questioned Secretary Lew about several of the top nuclear figures \nwho will be given sanctions relief under this deal. These are \nindividuals who are given sanctions relief under this deal:\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nMohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, known as the father of the Iranian nuclear \nprogram; Mr. Abbasi, whom the United Nations blacklisted in 2009 for \nbeing a close aide to Mr. Fakhrizadeh and working on nuclear programs \nin Iran and their very own ballistic missile program; and Gerhard \nWisser, a German engineer who in 2007 was convicted and sentenced to 18 \nyears in prison by a South African court for his role in supplying \ncentrifuge components to the A.Q. Khan black market network of nuclear \nproliferation. They received sanctions relief under this deal.\n  When I asked Secretary Lew what message these delistings will send to \nproliferators around the world, his response was:\n\n       I think that the message is if you violate the rules and \n     develop nuclear weapons and we and the world take action \n     against you--it will have significant consequence. But if you \n     reach an agreement and you unwind your nuclear program that \n     also will have consequence.\n\n  The moral of the story, according to testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, is if you cheat long enough on a large \nenough scale, the United States will negotiate to give you complete \namnesty from the consequences. It is a simply stunning outcome.\n  When I asked Secretary Kerry whether lifting the ballistic missile \nembargo will make Israel safer, his response was this: ``absolutely no \nquestion whatsoever that Israel is safer.''\n  On the question of whether to lift the ballistic missile embargo \nagainst Iran, the Secretary of State believes that it will put Israel \nin a safer position to give the Iranians ballistic missiles by lifting \nthe embargo.\n  In fact, the Prime Minister has said in response to lifting a variety \nof sanctions, not including the ballistic missile embargo: ``I think to \ngive Iran these capabilities is a grave mistake.''\n  Yet Secretary Kerry believes that by lifting the embargo--the \nballistic missile embargo against Iran--there is absolutely no question \nwhatsoever that it makes Israel safer.\n  My guess is Prime Minister Netanyahu would certainly disagree with \nthat statement. As he has already said, it would be a grave mistake.\n  It is not just Prime Minister Netanyahu who believes it would be a \ngrave mistake. It is the leaders on both the left and the right in \nIsrael, who believe that lifting these provisions is a grave mistake. \nTo Secretary Moniz, I quoted a top former IAEA official--an agency that \nwas brought up before throughout the committee hearing, an agency that \nhas done this time and again and that we rely on, respect, and trust to \ncarry out the elements of this deal. Former IAEA official Olli Heinonen \nsaid of this inspection regime: ``A 24-day adjudicated timeline reduces \ndetection probabilities exactly where the system is weakest: detecting \nundeclared facilities and materials.''\n  This deal gives 24-day notice, not anytime, anywhere inspections--24-\nday notice. It is not anytime, anywhere, 24-day notice, which will \nallow them to hide and to be able to present facilities and materials \nin an undetected and undeclared manner.\n  Secretary Moniz responded to this question: ``We have to know where \nto look, and that's the traditional role of intelligence--ours and \nthose of our allies and friends.''\n  If we are relying on intelligence to know where to look, what access \ndid we actually gain from the deal with Iran?\n  Finally, I asked the Secretaries how many imprisoned Americans will \nbe freed as part of the deal. We all know the answer is none. Yet the \nfather of Iran's nuclear program will receive sanctions relief.\n  Deal or no deal, four Americans, including Pastor Abedini will \ncontinue to languish in Iranian jails. Deal or no deal, we will know \nnothing more about the whereabouts of Bob Levinson. Deal or no deal, \nthis administration continues to leave American citizens as prisoners \nto Iran. These American citizens being held captive are but one more \nreminder of the regime we are dealing with and why they are not an \nequal and should not be treated as an equal negotiating partner. Let us \nnever forget the nature of the regime that was on the other side of the \nbargaining table. On October 23, 1983, a terrorist attack on the U.S. \nMarine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killed 241 American service men and \nwomen. Hezbollah, the wholly owned subsidiary of Iran, is widely \nbelieved to have been behind the attack.\n  Last week, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the President's nominee to lead the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff was asked about Americans killed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan by Iranian-supported militants. General Dunford said: ``I \nknow the total number of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that \nwere killed by Iranian activities and the number has been recently \nquoted as about 500.''\n  So can a regime that has killed at least 700 American soldiers be \nrelied upon to implement this deal in good faith and in a constructive \natmosphere based on mutual respect as stated in the text of the \nagreement? Does the Iranian regime deserve mutual respect from the \nUnited States? It does not and it should not. President Obama insists \nthat the only alternative to this deal is war with Iran. That is a \nfalse choice and should be rejected.\n  The alternative to this deal is what the administration said it would \nachieve; that is, a good deal based on continued economic pressure and \na genuine dismantling of Iranian nuclear programs verified by what was \nsaid would happen all along, anytime, anywhere inspections, as promised \nby the administration.\n  The President has gone to the United Nations to approve this deal \nwithout giving Congress or the American people a chance to consider the \nconsequences of this agreement. I urge my colleagues to reject this \nIranian nuclear gambit that endangers U.S. national security, the \nsafety of our friends and allies around the world, and empowers the \nlargest State sponsor of terrorism in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Religious Freedom\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in January 1941, President Franklin \nRoosevelt delivered his State of the Union Address as World War II was \nunderway in Europe. Even in that dark time, President Roosevelt \nreminded us all of what he called ``the simple, basic things that must \nnever be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of \nour modern world.'' Religious freedom was one of the four essential \nfreedoms President Roosevelt outlined in that speech.\n  President Roosevelt's counsel applies today as the pace and degree of \nsocial and cultural change increase. Last month, for example, the \nSupreme Court held that laws defining marriage as it had been defined \nat all times and in all societies are now unconstitutional. A bill has \njust been introduced in this body that would prohibit discrimination on \nthe basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in areas such as \nemployment, public accommodations, housing, and education. Some are \neven calling for punitive measures, such as revocation of tax-exempt \nstatus, for religious institutions that do not accept such social and \ncultural changes.\n  Debates about these issues continue in all three branches of \ngovernment, and I might say, branches of both Federal and State \ngovernments among commentators and experts across the media and \ninstitutions, both religious and secular, and among our fellow \ncitizens. President Roosevelt's words ``turmoil and unbelievable \ncomplexity'' seem to describe the situation today.\n  Yet these debates are not occurring on a blank slate. Some advocates \nof the social and cultural changes now underway ignore or perhaps never \nunderstood the history, importance, and value of religious freedom. \nThey seem to treat religious freedom as optional and are willing to \ncast it aside as a casualty of achieving certain political objectives. \nThat would be a grave error.\n  I wish to describe to my colleagues the backdrop for considering or \nimplementing these recent social and cultural changes. The religious \nfreedom Americans enjoy has been nearly 400 years in the making. Almost \ntwo centuries before American independence, one religious community \nafter another came to these shores seeking freedom to practice their \nfaith. Professor Michael McConnell, perhaps America's foremost scholar \nof religious liberty, writes that by the time the First Amendment was \nratified, ``the American states had already experienced 150\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nyears of a higher degree of religious diversity than had existed \nanywhere else in the world.''\n  The first individual right in the Bill of Rights is the free exercise \nof religion. The choice of words is significant. The First Amendment \ndoes not protect only some exercises of religion or religious exercise \nonly by some people but the free exercise of religion itself. This \nterm, the free exercise of religion, had appeared in American legal \ndocuments at least as early as 1648 and was a deliberate choice by \nthose drafting the new Constitution.\n  In 1776, the Virginia legislature considered a constitution for the \nCommonwealth. George Mason proposed this language, ``that all men \nshould enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion.'' \nJames Madison thought this implied that the right to practice religion \nwas a governmental favor rather than an inalienable right. He proposed \nthis language instead, ``All men are equally entitled to the full and \nfree exercise of [religion], according to the dictates of conscience.'' \nAmerica's Founders saw religious freedom as an inalienable right that \ngovernment must respect rather than something the government can decide \nwhether to tolerate. In fact, as Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg \nhas written, America's Founders saw religious freedom as preeminent \namong fundamental rights.\n  Religious freedom in America has two general features. It is \nuniversal in that it is a natural right shared by all people and a \nconstitutional and civil right protected by law. Religious freedom in \nAmerica is also robust in that it has three dimensions--it is freedom \nnot only of belief but also of behavior, it is freedom that may be \nexercised publicly as well as privately, and it is freedom to act both \nindividually and collectively. These two basic features of religious \nliberty, that is both universal and robust, can be seen not only in \nAmerican history and heritage but also in the commitments that we, as a \nnation, continue to make.\n  I will give three examples. In 1948, the United States joined 47 \nother nations in approving the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \nArticle 18 of that declaration states that every person has a \nfundamental right to religious freedom, including ``freedom, either \nalone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest \nhis religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.'' \nThere you see both the universal and robust nature of religious \nfreedom.\n  The United States reaffirmed this view of religious freedom by \nratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \nArticle 18 repeats the principle that everyone has the freedom ``either \nindividually or in community with others and in public or private, to \nmanifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and \nteaching.''\n  In 1998, Congress enacted the International Religious Freedom Act, \nwhich passed by a voice vote in the House and by a vote of 98 to 0 in \nthis body. This law States that religious freedom ``ungirds the very \norigin and existence of the United States.'' Congress has declared \nreligious liberty to be a fundamental right, a pillar of our Nation, a \nuniversal human right, and a fundamental freedom. So 32 Senators \nserving today--18 Republicans and 14 Democrats--voted for that position \neither here or when they served in the House.\n  In addition to Congress, Presidents have issued an annual \nproclamation designating January 16 as Religious Freedom Day. On that \nday in 1786, the Virginia legislature adopted the Statute for Religious \nFreedom. In his proclamation--and I will refer to the chart--President \nClinton proclaimed in his proclamation on religious freedom to be a \nfundamental human right, essential to our dignity as human beings, one \nof the most sacred of human rights, one of the core values of our \ndemocracy.\n  President George W. Bush said in his proclamation on his Religious \nFreedom Day that religious freedom is the foundation of a healthy and \nhopeful society, the birthright of every man, woman, and child \nthroughout the world, one of our Nation's most cherished values, one of \nour fundamental freedoms, and a cornerstone of our Republic.\n  President Obama has said in his proclamations that religious freedom \nis one of our country's fundamental liberties, the right of every \nperson to practice their faith, how they choose, a critical foundation \nof our Nation's liberty, a universal human right, an essential part of \nhuman dignity, a natural right of all humanity.\n  The Supreme Court has held many times that religious freedom is a \nfundamental right, and as it did in 1981, has held that the First \nAmendment ``by its terms, gives special protection to the exercise of \nreligion.''\n  There is no getting around the fact that universal and robust \nreligious freedom is the foundation of this Nation and an integral part \nof our national identity and character. It is a preeminent right \nrecognized by all three branches as fundamental. That is an important \nword. This is our heritage, and it is the backdrop for our debates \noccurring today over social and cultural changes.\n  Some advocates of these changes are spinning a fictional tale about \nreligious freedom in America. They may feel this narrative serves their \npolitical agenda, but that does not make their narrative true.\n  As I described earlier, religious freedom in America is both \nuniversal and robust. It includes both belief and behavior in public \nand in private, individually and collectively. The advocates I have \ndescribed want instead to make religious freedom selective rather than \nuniversal and reduce it to nothing more than an individual private \nbelief.\n  One of my Senate colleagues, for example, said in an interview \nshortly after the Supreme Court's decision that the First Amendment \nprotects the freedom of ``institutions of faith . . . to observe deeply \nheld religious beliefs. But I don't think it extends far beyond that.''\n  This is more than rhetorical spin in the service of a political \nagenda; this is simply wrong. From its very origin, the concept of \nreligious freedom in America has always been an individual right. From \nthe earliest laws of the 17th century, to the founding of America in \nthe 18th century, to the laws, treaties, and proclamations of the 19th, \n20th, and 21st centuries, religious freedom is first and foremost an \nindividual right.\n  The Supreme Court's very first case involving the free exercise of \nreligion in 1878 involved an individual. Adell Sherbert in the 1960s \nand Paula Hobbie in the 1980s--both Seventh-day Adventists--went to the \nSupreme Court after being fired for refusing to work on their Sabbath. \nPerhaps the most notorious free exercise case, Employment Division v. \nSmith, was brought by an individual. Whether these individuals won or \nlost, never did the courts say the right to religious exercise was not \ntheirs.\n  The argument by some that institutions but not individuals exercise \nreligious freedom is mystifying for another reason. Congress enacted \nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act--an act I had a lot to do with--\nin 1993 to make it difficult for government to interfere with the free \nexercise of religion. We saw it coming and we passed that bill 97 to 3, \nand it passed unanimously in the House.\n  When a company went to court arguing that a Federal mandate burdened \nits religious exercise, liberals objected because, they said, only \nindividuals may exercise religion. But now they say that only churches \nexercise religion. Think about that. They argued at one time that only \nindividuals may exercise religion, and now they are saying only \nchurches can. Which is it--churches, individuals, or, as some would \nhave it, none of the above?\n  The Supreme Court also contributed to this false narrative in its \nrecent marriage decision by saying that the First Amendment protects \nreligious organizations and persons, as they advocate or teach \nprinciples that are important to them. But that is not what the First \nAmendment says, nor does that describe its full meaning. Advocating or \nteaching would be protected under the First Amendment's free speech \nclause. The First Amendment separately protects the free exercise of \nreligion, which includes much more.\n  The current debates over social and cultural changes, including same-\nsex marriage and prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity, must take proper account of the history, \nimportance, and value of religious freedom. This is not a new concern. \nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, for example, had a\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nconference on this topic 10 years ago. Scholars on both sides of the \nsame-sex marriage issue agreed that legislating same-sex marriage \nwithout robust religious accommodations would create widespread legal \nconflict. In 2009, a group of leading scholars wrote the New Jersey \nLegislature, which was considering a bill to legalize same-sex \nmarriage, outlining such conflicts for both individuals and \norganizations.\n  I believe the best way forward is clear. Religious freedom should be \nproperly accommodated rather than ignored, disparaged, or distorted, as \nsome would do. Those acting on their religious beliefs about marriage, \nfor example, should not face government retaliation or discrimination. \nAnd statutes prohibiting discrimination should include robust religious \nexemptions. Doing so expands rights and protections on one side without \ndiminishing or eliminating them on the other. I supported the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act last Congress, for example, because \nit took this balanced approach. And my State of Utah similarly enacted \na law that both protects against discrimination and protects the \nexercise of religion.\n  Government should not be in the business of retaliating against \npeople because of their religious beliefs. This is true when \nindividuals worship privately as well as when they gather together in \nreligious organizations or associations. When government retaliates \nagainst a person or a group for acting in accordance with deeply held \nreligious beliefs, it undermines religious freedom and sends the \nmessage that the opinions of government officials trump rights of \nconscience. It tells worshippers that their right to religious \nexercise--far from being fundamental--exists at the pleasure of the \nState. That is precisely the view that James Madison, the primary \nauthor of the Bill of Rights, rejected.\n  Government retaliation further tells the believer that he or she is \ndisfavored; the believer's views are out of bounds; they have no place \nin our modern, advanced age. This view of government as the supreme \narbiter of faith and morality is contrary to the vision of our \nFounders. It is contrary to the First Amendment. It is contrary to the \nline of cases that culminated in the Supreme Court's recent marriage \ndecision. Religion-based restrictions on intimate conduct, the Court \nsaid, must be struck down because moral disapproval cannot form the \nbasis of law. How ironic it would be if the very principle that \nunderlay the victory over traditional marriage were suddenly cast aside \nin the effort to enforce the new morality.\n  When government tells religious believers that they must conform to \ncurrent State creeds or lose out on contracts, licenses, accreditation, \nfunding, and other benefits, it puts them in an extremely difficult and \nindeed sometimes impossible position--either violate your beliefs or \nforgo something which others have ready access to and which you may \nneed to carry out your mission.\n  Government should not be in the business of coercing citizens to \ncondone conduct their sincerely held religious beliefs forbid; rather, \ngovernment should allow space for the free exercise of religion. Surely \nwe can work to end discrimination without retaliating against religious \ngroups and schools for following practices they all agree are rooted in \nsincere religious belief. Surely there is space in antidiscrimination \nlaws, such as the one recently introduced here in the Senate, for \nreligious exemptions for religiously affiliated groups, schools, and \norganizations.\n\n  My point today is that religious freedom is not optional. It is a \nfundamental human right that is central to our existence and identity \nas a nation, and it is the backdrop against which the current debates \nabout social and cultural changes must proceed.\n  Finally, I wish to ask my colleagues what principles would attract \nthe support of the following: Republican and Democratic Presidents; the \nchairman of People for the American Way; the president of Focus on the \nFamily; the chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the president of \nthe AFL-CIO; leaders of the faith communities, including Jews, \nCatholics, Mormons, Muslims, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, and \nBuddhists; and the chairmen of both the Democratic and Republican \nNational Committees? Can anyone think of anything that can bring all of \nthose people together? What could they possibly agree on that would \nreally mean anything? These and many more leaders of government, \nacademia, faith communities, business, law, and minority groups all \nsigned the Williamsburg Charter. This document was first presented to \nthe Nation on June 25, 1988, on the 200th anniversary of Virginia's \ncall for a Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.\n  The charter presents certain first principles that are in the shared \ninterest of all Americans. These include that religious freedom is a \nprecious, fundamental right and an inalienable right founded on the \ninviolable dignity of the person. These are the Williamsburg Charter's \nprinciples about religious freedom--a precious, fundamental, and \ninalienable right founded on the inviolable dignity of the person; that \nit is our Nation's first liberty and undergirds all other rights and \nfreedoms secured by the Bill of Rights; and that it allows citizens to \nshape their lives, whether private or public, on the basis of their \nbeliefs. If these leaders who differ in so many ways and disagree on so \nmany issues could agree on these principles, we should certainly be \nable to incorporate them into current debates.\n  The signers of the Williamsburg Charter said that ``the ignorance and \ncontention now surrounding the [Constitution's religion] clauses are a \nreminder that their advocacy and defense is a task for each succeeding \ngeneration.'' I could not agree more.\n  President Reagan said it best:\n\n       Freedom is never more than one generation away from \n     extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the \n     bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on \n     for them to do the same.\n\n  I personally believe we can rise to that challenge. I think we must \nrise to that challenge.\n  Religious freedom is the first mentioned freedom in the Bill of \nRights. Frankly, it is time to get back to the constitutional \nprinciples that have made this country the greatest country in the \nworld, and we can do it without violating other people's rights.\n  Some desire to reduce religious rights in favor of other people's \nrights. Well, we don't have to hurt other people's rights by \nacknowledging and accepting the fact that religious freedom is an \nabsolute necessity for a great society such as ours and has been an \nundergirding principle that has helped make this country the greatest \ncountry in the world.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every July 24, we commemorate a solemn \nanniversary. We honor the sacrifice of J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson, \nCapitol Police officers who fell in the line of duty this day in 1998.\n  I hope it comforts the family and friends who loved these officers to \nknow that their memories continue to live on.\n  Their memories live on in the Capitol Police Headquarters that is \nnamed in their honor, and they live on within the Capitol itself: on a \ncommemorative plaque, inscribed indelibly; in the service of every \nofficer who wears the badge today, evoked daily.\n  Indeed, Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson may rest just \nbeyond the Potomac in Arlington National Cemetery, but the ideals they \ngave everything to defend endure in this symbol of democracy every day,\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\ncarried forward by the brave men and women of our Capitol Police force. \nMay they continue to do so, and may that bring some measure of comfort \nto every American mourning the loss of these brave officers again \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a select few men and women who \ncome to work every day with one primary job: to protect those of us who \nwork in the United States Capitol and all who come here from all \ncorners of our country to see the heart of our democracy.\n  In 1998, two of those brave police officers gave their lives while \nprotecting the Capitol. They were Special Agent John Gibson and Officer \nJacob Chestnut.\n  Mr. President, 16 years ago today, a man entered the House side of \nthe Capitol Building with a gun and shot Officer Chestnut at point-\nblank range. Agent Gibson warned tourists and staff to take cover and \nthen confronted the gunman. Although Agent Gibson was also shot, he \nprevented anyone else from being killed.\n  Both officers died that day. They served a combined 36 years on the \nforce protecting the Capitol.\n  I knew Agent Gibson. Years before the shooting, my wife and I \nattended a Senate retreat in southern Virginia. My wife became ill. \nAgent Gibson ran to her side. I can still remember how he was sweating \nfrom running so fast to come to my wife's aid. I have fond memories of \nthese officers.\n  Agent Gibson, who was from Massachusetts, would race to the back of \nthe sports section each morning to find the box score for his beloved \nBoston Red Sox. He was a generous neighbor and a loving father to his \ndaughter and two sons.\n  Officer Chestnut--everyone called him ``J.J.''--was a father of five \nwho loved his job and loved his country. He served in the Air Force for \n20 years and fought in Vietnam. At the time of the shooting, he was \njust weeks away from retiring.\n  Gibson and Chestnut were laid in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, just \nsteps from where they were murdered--a distinction Congress has \nconferred upon only a handful of Americans, including Abraham Lincoln, \nJohn F. Kennedy, and our unknown soldiers. Jacob Chestnut was the first \nAfrican-American ever to be so honored in our Capitol Rotunda.\n  On this solemn anniversary, we pause to appreciate not just the \nbravery of two men who saved so many others but each and every Capitol \nPolice officer who does his or her job so valiantly every single day of \nthe year. On behalf of the entire United States Senate and everyone who \nworks and visits here, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/24/senate-section/article/S5682-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING PRATT & WHITNEY 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Pratt \n& Whitney for 90 years of success in the aviation industry. While there \nhave been many important innovators in aviation over the past 90 years, \nPratt & Whitney's work on the jet engine deserves special recognition.\n  Pratt & Whitney began operations in Hartford, CT, in August 1925. \nWith a staff of 24 men and 2 women, the company began work in the old \nPope-Hartford auto plant. Under the direction of aviation engineer \nFredrick Rentschler, this small team set out to build a new and \nimproved aircraft engine. Despite limited funding and resources, Pratt \n& Whitney Aircraft succeeded in modernized the jet engine with \nrevolutionary advancements like a powerful and dependable air-cooled \nradial engine.\n  Through the many changes of the last 90 years, Pratt & Whitney's \nengines have consistently powered the most advanced modern aircraft. \nThe F135 engine, for example, designed by Pratt & Whitney, meets the \nexacting requirements of the F-35 Lightning II, which is one of the \nmost technologically advanced military jets ever made.\n  The jobs that Pratt & Whitney has created over the years have \nenriched Connecticut communities, and I am proud to honor Pratt & \nWhitney's 90 years of incredible achievement.

No local jurisdiction may require a remote seller to \n     submit a sales and use tax return or to collect sales and use \n     taxes other than as provided by this paragraph.\n       (B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among the \n     State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State \n     pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (C) Source all remote sales in compliance with the sourcing \n     definition set forth in section 62004(7).\n       (D) Provide--\n       (i) information indicating the taxability of products and \n     services along with any product and service exemptions from \n     sales and use tax in the State and a rates and boundary \n     database;\n       (ii) software free of charge for remote sellers that \n     calculates sales and use taxes due on each transaction at the \n     time the transaction is completed, that files sales and use \n     tax returns, and that is updated to reflect rate changes as \n     described in subparagraph (H); and\n       (iii) certification procedures for persons to be approved \n     as certified software providers.\n     For purposes of clause (iii), the software provided by \n     certified software providers shall be capable of calculating \n     and filing sales and use taxes in all States qualified under \n     this title.\n       (E) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the State or \n     locality for the incorrect collection, remittance, or \n     noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties \n     or interest, if the liability is the result of an error or \n     omission made by a certified software provider.\n       (F) Relieve certified software providers from liability to \n     the State or locality for the incorrect collection, \n     remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, \n     including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the \n     result of misleading or inaccurate information provided by a \n     remote seller.\n       (G) Relieve remote sellers and certified software providers \n     from liability to the State or locality for incorrect \n     collection, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use \n     taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability \n     is the result of incorrect information or software provided \n     by the State.\n       (H) Provide remote sellers and certified software providers \n     with 90 days notice of a rate change by the State or any \n     locality in the State and update the information described in \n     subparagraph (D)(i) accordingly and relieve any remote seller \n     or certified software provider from liability for collecting \n     sales and use taxes at the immediately preceding effective \n     rate during the 90-day notice period if the required notice \n     is not provided.\n       (c) Small Seller Exception.--A State is authorized to \n     require a remote seller to collect sales and use taxes under \n     this title only if the remote seller has gross annual \n     receipts in total remote sales in the United States in the \n     preceding calendar year exceeding $1,000,000.

REVISED DEFINITION; PRINCIPLES AND PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Revised Definition.--A revision to or guidance on a \n     regulatory definition of the term ``navigable waters'' or \n     ``waters of the United States'' promulgated or issued \n     pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) after February 4, 2015, shall have no \n     force or effect--\n       (1) unless the revision adheres to the principles under \n     subsection (b); and\n       (2) until after the Secretary and the Administrator carry \n     out each action described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Principles.--In promulgating a revised regulatory \n     definition pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary and the \n     Administrator shall adhere to the following principles:\n       (1) The term ``waters of the United States'' under the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     should identify bodies of water subject to Federal \n     jurisdiction, and should include--\n       (A) traditional navigable waters and interstate waters;\n       (B) tributaries of navigable waters that are streams that \n     contribute flow in a normal year through a surface hydrologic \n     connection to a traditional navigable water of sufficient \n     volume, duration, and frequency that pollutants in the reach \n     of the tributary would degrade the water quality of the \n     traditional navigable water, based on quantifiable and \n     statistically valid measure of flow for the geographic area; \n     and\n       (C) wetlands situated next to a water of the United States \n     that, in a normal year, protect the water quality of a \n     navigable water by preventing the movement of pollutants to a \n     navigable water.\n       (2) The term ``waters of the United States'' under the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     should not include--\n       (A) water that is located below the surface of the land, \n     including soil water, permafrost, and groundwater;\n       (B) water that is not located within navigable water, \n     interstate water, a territorial sea, a river, a stream, a \n     lake, a pond, or a wetland;\n       (C) a stream that does not contribute flow to navigable \n     water, as described in paragraph (1)(B);\n       (D) an isolated pond, whether natural or manmade, including \n     a farm pond, fish pond, livestock watering pond, quarry, mine \n     pit, ornamental pond, swimming pool, construction pit, fire \n     control pond, sediment pond, manure lagoon, and any other \n     isolated facility or system that holds water;\n       (E) a lawfully constructed and operated water management \n     system, other than a system component that is a traditional \n     navigable water;\n       (F) waste treatment systems; and\n       (G) prior-converted cropland (as defined in section 12.2(a) \n     of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the \n     date of enactment of this Act)).\n       (3) In promulgating a revised definition of waters of the \n     United States, the Secretary and the Administrator shall take \n     into consideration that--\n       (A) the use of a body of water by an organism, including a \n     migratory bird, does not provide a basis for establishing \n     Federal jurisdiction under the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.);\n       (B) the dispersal of plant seeds and insect eggs through \n     ingestion and excretion by birds and mammals does not provide \n     a basis for establishing Federal jurisdiction under the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.);\n       (C) the supply of water to a groundwater aquifer and the \n     storage of water in an isolated body of water are issues \n     that--\n       (i) pertain to the use of water resources that shall not be \n     superseded, abrogated, or otherwise impaired by the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) pursuant \n     to sections 101(g) and 510(2) of that Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(g), \n     1370(2)); and\n       (ii) do not provide a basis for establishing Federal \n     jurisdiction under that Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and\n       (D) evaporation, transpiration, condensation, \n     precipitation, the overland flow of water, and the movement \n     of water in an aquifer are all part of the water cycle and \n     may connect all water over sufficiently long periods of time \n     and distances, but do not provide a basis for establishing \n     Federal jurisdiction under the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.).\n       (4) Waters that are waters of the United States should be \n     identified on maps provided by the Secretary and the \n     Administrator to promote certainty and transparency in \n     jurisdictional determinations.\n       (c) Consideration, Consultation, and Report.--\n       (1) Federalism.--\n       (A) In general.--In proposing and promulgating a regulation \n     pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary and the \n     Administrator shall ensure compliance with the federalism \n     policymaking criteria and consultation in accordance with \n     Executive Order 13132 (64 Fed. Reg. 43255 (August 4, 1999)), \n     regardless of whether the Secretary and the Administrator \n     determine that the regulation would have any substantial and \n     direct effect on--\n       (i) States;\n       (ii) the relationship between the Federal Government and \n     the States; or\n       (iii) the distribution of power and responsibilities among \n     the various levels of government.\n       (B) Consultation.--\n       (i) In general.--To be considered meaningful consultation \n     described in section 101(b) of the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(b)), before publication of a \n     proposed rule under this section, consultation shall include \n     a discussion of alternative approaches with and a request for \n     input and advice on the approaches from States and political \n     subdivisions of States, including--\n\n       (I) Governors;\n       (II) State departments with authority over water supply and \n     water quality;\n       (III) State departments of agriculture; and\n       (IV) local governments, including elected officials, local \n     governmental entities with authority over water supply, \n     stormwater, waste water, floodplain management, and flood \n     control, irrigation districts, and conservation districts.\n\n       (ii) Topics.--The topics to be addressed in the \n     consultation under this paragraph should include--\n\n       (I) categories of waters, in addition to those discussed in \n     paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b), that should be \n     subject to Federal jurisdiction or should be subject solely \n     to State or local regulation;\n       (II) what is the role of States in the identification of \n     waters subject to Federal jurisdiction; and\n       (III) whether channels in which water is present only \n     during or for a short time after a precipitation event are \n     correctly categorized as geomorphological features rather \n     than hydrologic features.\n\n       (2) Regulatory flexibility.--In proposing and promulgating \n     a regulation pursuant to subsection (a), and regardless of \n     whether the Secretary and the Administrator determine that \n     the regulation would have a significant impact on a \n     substantial number of small entities, the Secretary and the \n     Administrator shall--\n       (A) carry out the actions described in sections 603, 604, \n     and 609 of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (B) in carrying out those actions, take into consideration \n     the costs of all programs under the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), regardless of whether \n     the Secretary and the Administrator consider the costs of the \n     proposed regulation to be direct or indirect.\n       (3) Unfunded mandates.--In proposing and promulgating a \n     regulation pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary and the \n     Administrator shall evaluate the intergovernmental and \n     private sector impacts of the regulation, in accordance with \n     title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 \n     U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), regardless of whether the Secretary and \n     the Administrator--\n       (A) consider the impacts of the proposed regulation to be \n     direct or indirect; or\n       (B) determine that expenditures resulting from the proposed \n     regulation would meet the monetary thresholds established in \n     that Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).\n       (4) Improving regulation and regulatory review.--In \n     proposing and promulgating a regulation pursuant to \n     subsection (a), regardless of whether the Secretary and the \n     Administrator consider the regulation to be a significant \n     regulatory action or significantly affect State, local, and \n     tribal governments, the Secretary and the Administrator shall \n     ensure that the regulation meets the requirements of--\n       (A) Executive Order 12866 (5 U.S.C. 601 note; relating to \n     regulatory planning and review); and\n       (B) Executive Order 13563 (76 Fed. Reg. 3821 (January 18, \n     2011)).\n       (5) Improving performance of federal permitting and review \n     of infrastructure projects.--In proposing and promulgating a \n     regulation pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary and the \n     Administrator shall consider--\n       (A) Executive Order 13604 (5 U.S.C. 601 note; relating to \n     improving performance of Federal permitting and review of \n     infrastructure projects); and\n       (B) the goal of reducing the time to make decisions in the \n     permitting and review of infrastructure projects by the \n     Federal Government.\n       (6) Report.--Not later than the date that is 30 days before \n     the date of issuance of a proposed regulation pursuant to \n     subsection (a), the Secretary and the Administrator shall \n     submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report that \n     describes the means by which the proposed regulation, if \n     finalized, would\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\n     achieve compliance with the laws and Executive orders \n     described in paragraphs (1) through (5).\n       (7) Timing.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary \n     and the Administrator shall use best efforts--\n       (A) to provide not less than 180 days for the consultation \n     described in paragraph (2);\n       (B) to provide a comment period on the revised proposed \n     rule of not less than 120 days; and\n       (C) to publish a final rule not later than December 31, \n     2016.\n\n     SEC. 62004. MEASURE OF FLOW.\n\n       After providing public notice and an opportunity for \n     comment, the Secretary shall establish quantifiable and \n     statistically valid measures of the volume, duration, and \n     frequency of flow in streams in different geographic areas \n     that would, in a normal year, allow pollutants in reaches of \n     streams in those geographic areas to flow to and degrade the \n     water quality of a traditional navigable water.\n\n     SEC. 62005. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Not later than the date that is 3 years after the date of \n     promulgation of a regulation pursuant to section 620003, and \n     not less frequently than once every 3 years thereafter, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States, after consultation \n     with State, local, and tribal governments and other affected \n     entities, shall--\n       (1) review the jurisdictional determinations made during \n     the applicable period by the Secretary and the Administrator; \n     and\n       (2) submit to Congress a report that describes--\n       (A) the interpretations of the regulation by--\n       (i) districts of the Corps of Engineers; and\n       (ii) regional offices of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency;\n       (B) whether those interpretations are consistent;\n       (C) if any inconsistency exists, the measures carried out \n     by the Secretary and the Administrator to reduce the \n     inconsistency or an explanation of the geographic differences \n     that make the inconsistency appropriate; and\n       (D) the impacts of those interpretations on Federal \n     permitting and review of infrastructure projects, and the \n     goal stated in section 1 of Executive Order 13604 (5 U.S.C. \n     601 note; relating to improving performance of Federal \n     permitting and review of infrastructure projects) that the \n     time to make decisions in the permitting and review of \n     infrastructure projects by the Federal Government be reduced.\n\n     SEC. 62006. EFFECT OF TITLE.\n\n       (a) Permitting Authority.--Nothing in this title limits the \n     authority of the Secretary or the Administrator--\n       (1) to require a permit for any discharge of pollutants to \n     a navigable water under the Federal Water Pollution Control \n     Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); or\n       (2) to take any enforcement action with respect to an \n     unpermitted discharge under that Act.\n       (b) Water Transfers.--Nothing in this title affects a \n     determination regarding whether the transfer of water from 1 \n     body of water to another requires a permit under section 402 \n     of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342).\n       (c) Retention of State Authority.--Nothing in this title \n     places any limitation on the scope of water subject to State \n     jurisdiction under State law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2349.
