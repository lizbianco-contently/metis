Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a few \nbrief remarks, and then I will respond to my friend.\n  By the end of the day, the Senate will have spent 3 days debating one \nof the most critical national security issues of our time--and that is \nprobably an understatement--whether to support the agreement to stop \nIran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  From the beginning of this process, Democrats have done everything \nwithin our power to support this debate. We allowed the Senate to begin \nimportant debate without any procedural hurdles--none whatsoever. \nDemocrats understand the severity of the urgent national security issue \nthat is before this body, and that is why we offered a consent \nagreement at the beginning of the week to eliminate all procedural \nhurdles and move straight to the final passage vote after the debate. I \ndid that again this morning, but the Republican leader did not take \nthat offer. Instead,\n\n[[Page S6544]]\n\nhe filed cloture on the debate. By rejecting our offer, the Republican \nleader has made the cloture vote the decisive and definitive vote on \nthis issue. That is why I once again will put forward my consent to \nskip cloture and all procedural votes and move to a vote on final \npassage.\n  Every Senator in this body should understand that if they are forced \nto vote on cloture, it is because Senator McConnell, not Democrats, \nwanted them to. The idea that Democrats are somehow trying to stop \ndebate or keeping us from a final vote is foolish. It is simply untrue.\n  Let's be clear. Let's be clear who is moving to end debate. It is the \nRepublican leader who is moving to end debate, not me, not us. It is \nthe Republican leader who filed a procedural motion last night and \ntoday.\n  What Democrats are offering is an opportunity to continue debate and \nmove straight to a vote on final passage. This is exactly what we have \ndone on many policy issues in the past because of Republican demands. \nIn fact, since 2007 the Senate has regularly held votes on passage at a \n60-vote threshold on policy and national security issues--for example, \non national security issues such as Iraq policy resolutions; the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA; United States-India \nnuclear cooperation; foreign aid prohibition for Pakistan, Egypt, \nLibya; FISA reauthorization; terrorism risk insurance, or TRIA. These \nare just a few of the many votes we have taken at the 60-vote threshold \ndemanded by our Republican friends.\n  Actions speak louder than words. Democrats acted to get this bill to \nthe floor and debate it. Democrats are ready to vote on final passage. \nBut if we are forced to vote on cloture, all Senators should understand \nthat the cloture vote would then become the defining vote that \ndetermines whether the resolution of disapproval moves forward to the \nPresident's desk. A vote against cloture is a vote for the Iran \nagreement, plain and simple.\n  Mr. President, may I have the consent agreement restated? I think I \nunderstand it, but basically we would have a cloture vote and move \nimmediately to a vote? No, just a cloture vote. I am sorry.\n  The question before the body--and they are waiting for me to \nrespond--is, we would have a cloture vote on this matter because the \nleader has objected to my consent request, and we would have it at 3:45 \np.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Please wait. Staff is conferring here.\n  No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just a few short months ago, Senators \nof both parties came together to pass a bipartisan bill based on an \nimportant principle: that the American people through the Congress they \nelect deserve a say on one of the most important issues of our time. We \nrallied around that principle, voting 98 to 1 to ensure the American \npeople would have a real say on any deal with Iran. What a tragedy it \nwould be, then, if at the very last moment some of those same Senators \ndecided to filibuster to prevent the American people from having a real \nsay on this incredibly important issue.\n  I know some of our colleagues are currently under immense pressure to \nshut down the voice of the people. But I would ask colleagues to \nreflect on the gravely serious nature of the issue before us. I would \nask colleagues to consider the expectations they set with their \nconstituents when they voted for the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. \nI would ask colleagues to consider something else as well. This is a \ndeal that will far outlast one administration. The President may have \nthe luxury of vacating office in a few months, but many of our \nresponsibilities extend beyond that time. The American people will \nremember. They will remember where we stand today.

Mr. President, I understand we are moving back to the \nincredibly important debate on Iran. I will come back and address that \na little bit later.\n\n\n  Remembering Alison Parker and Adam Ward and Paying Tribute to Vicki \n                                Gardner\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay \ntribute to the victims of another horrific act of gun violence.\n  On August 26, a gunman opened fire during a live television interview \nat Smith Mountain Lake in Virginia. By now, I think everyone in this \nChamber and all across the country saw that event on live television. \nThe gunfire killed WDBJ News 7 reporter Alison Parker, News 7 \nphotographer Adam Ward, and the shooting severely wounded Vicki \nGardner, a local chamber of commerce official who was being \ninterviewed. I know my colleague Senator Kaine has already spoken on \nthis, but I speak for everyone in the Commonwealth when I say our \nhearts go out to the Parker family and the Ward family. We are all \npleased to hear that Vicki Gardner was released from the hospital on \nMonday, and she is on the road to recovery.\n  So Smith Mountain Lake in Virginia is now added to the all-too-\nfamiliar, heartbreaking litany--Charleston, Aurora, Sandy Hook, Tucson, \nand Virginia Tech. It became clear in the days following the 26th that \nAlison Parker and Adam Ward represented the best of their community. \nThe outpouring of love and support for them and their families was \nremarkable. I had a number of conversations with Alison's father Andy, \nwhom I knew from local government, and I will be meeting with him later \ntoday. Vicki Gardner, who was released from the hospital, will soon, \nhopefully, be getting back to her job at the chamber of commerce.\n  We feel--particularly those of us in Virginia--as if we knew Alison, \nAdam, and Vicki because the crime committed against them was so \nhorrible and the details were reported so widely.\n  How many more parents must lose their children to gun violence? How \nmany more anxious families must maintain a lonely vigil at the hospital \nbefore all of us here in Congress move on commonsense gun legislation?\n  More than 30,000 people are killed by firearms in this country every \nyear. The last time Congress meaningfully engaged in a debate about gun \nreform was more than 2 years ago, after Sandy Hook. Even after the \nhorrific loss of 20 children and 6 adults in Newtown at Sandy Hook, the \nSenate was still unable to pass responsible, commonsense\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\nreforms, such as closing the gun show loophole. Since Sandy Hook, there \nhave been at least 136 school shootings in America. That is an average \nof one every week.\n  Probably like most of us, there are a lot of meetings we take in the \nSenate that kind of blur before our eyes. I will never forget the \nmeeting with the Newtown families after that tragedy. I would have \nthought and would have expected with their grief that these families \nwould have come in and asked for a whole array of legislative \nsolutions, but they didn't. The families I met with came in and simply \nhad one very reasonable, commonsense request of Congress: universal \nbackground checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those \nwith serious mental illness. Let me acknowledge that won't prevent \nevery shooting. It is not a magical fix for violent, disturbed people \nwho are determined to do harm, but it is a start at tackling the \nepidemic of gun violence.\n  I am a supporter of the Second Amendment--for many years I had an \n``A'' rating from the NRA--but I believe background checks do not \ninfringe on the Second Amendment. As a matter of fact, gun owners \nunderstand this. In fact, a greater proportion of gun owners support \nrequiring background checks for all gun sales than do non-gun owners. \nIn a recent survey, 85 percent of gun owners and 83 percent of non-gun \nowners--so gun owners more than non-gun owners--supported requiring \nbackground checks for all gun sales.\n  Reasonable people can disagree about what additional steps might need \nto be taken, but the facts are not up for debate. Background checks do \nwork, and they keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have \nthem.\n  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Brady law has \nblocked almost 2.4 million gun purchases since its enactment in 1994. \nAlmost 200,000 purchases were blocked in the most recent year in which \nwe have records. But, as we know, background checks aren't performed on \nevery purchase. In fact, a significant number of transfers are done \nwith no check whatsoever to determine whether a prospective buyer can \nlegally possess a gun.\n  There is no reason why we shouldn't have a comprehensive background \ncheck system on all firearms sales. The Senate came close to making \nprogress on this in the weeks following Sandy Hook. I want to \nparticularly cite two colleagues, Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey, \nwho both have strong records of support for the Second Amendment, who \nintroduced and fought for bipartisan legislation that would have \nexpanded background checks for many private gun sales, while still \nallowing families to appropriately transfer firearms within their \nfamily. However, this responsible and commonsense proposal fell short.\n  The cycle of tragedy followed by outrage followed by inaction has \nbecome all too familiar. These tragic events are not isolated in any \none part of the country--Charleston, Aurora, Tucson, Roanoke. Each of \nthem breaks our hearts. We should not and cannot simply acknowledge and \naccept them as the status quo. We must not be content, and we must \nrecognize that Congress, those of us in this body, have an ability to \nact. Thoughts and prayers for victims are not enough; we need to take \nresponsible action. We can debate and should debate how far reform \nmeasures should go, but at the very least, we should look at a way to \nrenew a push for more meaningful background checks. We must do more to \nmake sure criminals and those who are dangerously mentally ill cannot \npurchase guns. We must work together to make sure local and State \ngovernments have the resources and place an appropriate priority on \ninputting the correct data into the national background check system.\n  As recently as the end of June, Senators Toomey and Manchin indicated \nthey were considering ways to renew their efforts at meaningful \nbackground checks. I want to state clearly today that they will have my \nfull support in this effort. I call on my colleagues to work with us to \nget legislation expanding meaningful background checks to the floor of \nthe Senate before the end of this year. I can think of no better way to \nhonor the lives of Alison Parker and Adam Ward and the thousands of \nother American families touched by gun violence.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I intend to support the resolution of \ndisapproval of the comprehensive plan of action negotiated by the Obama \nadministration with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The agreement falls \nwoefully short of the international goal to improve global security by \nstopping Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions.\n  The American people and Congress were promised an inspections regime \nproviding anywhere, anytime access to facilities where tests were \nconducted. Instead, Iran can delay access to facilities for up to 24 \ndays. This is inconsistent with the Obama administration's claims that \nno part of this agreement is based on trusting Iran at its word. A \ncredible agreement would include stronger verification measures to \nensure that the Iranians play by the rules, particularly given that \ngovernment's well-documented efforts to conceal its nuclear activities \nand ambitions.\n  We are also concerned about the consequence of lifting the economic \nsanctions that forced Iran to the negotiating table. This agreement is \nan issue of long-term significance. Our country and our allies will be \nforced to deal with the repercussions of a strengthened Iran for the \nforeseeable future. This agreement is a bad deal for us and our allies, \nand I will not support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been a Member of this body for \nnearly four decades. During that time, I have had the honor of \nparticipating in numerous debates that shaped the course of our future, \nbut I can think of none more important than the one in which we are now \nengaged.\n  The Iranian regime is one of our most dangerous foes. It has declared \nthe United States to be the ``Great Satan.'' It has repeatedly claimed \nits intent to ``wipe Israel off the map.'' It has perpetrated violence \nagainst American servicemen and civilians alike. It has sewn conflict \nacross the most volatile region of the world. And it has repressed its \npeople by some of the most ghastly methods imaginable.\n  Indeed, we should remember throughout this debate that our quarrel is \nnot with the Iranian people. The Iranian people are our friends. We \nshould remember throughout our plight and their desire for a \ncooperative relationship with the United States and the rest of the \nworld. Instead, it is the dictatorial and fanatical regime that seeks \nto build and even use nuclear weapons, to destabilize the entire \nregion, and to kill Americans and Israelis. Given the threat posed by \nthis rogue regime, preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \ncapability is absolutely critical. It is a goal shared across party \nlines as well as among many of our friends and allies abroad.\n  All of us here prefer to prevent Iran from acquiring this capability \nby diplomatic means if possible rather than by armed conflict. In light \nof this shared desire to resolve the Iranian threat without a war, I \nexamined the Obama administration's proposed agreement hopeful, if \nskeptical, that I could support the agreement. Nevertheless, the duty \nincumbent upon us as Senators is not to accept or reject this deal \nbased upon knee-jerk reactions or blind partisan loyalty but rather to \ndetermine our stances based on thorough examination and reasoned \njudgment.\n  Regrettably, after much study, I have concluded that this is a \ncatastrophically bad deal that I must strongly oppose.\n  Now, at the outset, I should note that the media is reporting that \nPresident Obama has gathered the votes to support his Iran deal. In \nreality, he has done no such thing. Were this a treaty, it would fall \nwell short of the two-thirds requirement. It won't--and it can't--even \nmuster a majority in either the House or Senate. There is nothing \nbipartisan about support for this deal. Only the opposition is \nbipartisan, and only the opposition is a majority. The deal lacks the \nmost important kind of support--that of the American people. A strong \nmajority of Americans oppose this deal, and they are right to do so.\n  Far from blocking the Iranian regime's path to nuclear weapons \ncapability, this agreement actually secures\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\nwhat Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for \nDefense of Democracies, calls a ``patient pathway'' to nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  Consider the timeline. From day one, the Iranian regime will be \nallowed to enrich uranium using thousands of centrifuges and to conduct \nnuclear research and development. After 8 years, the regime will be \nallowed to begin building hundreds of new advanced centrifuges annually \nand will be allowed to expand its ballistic missile program.\n  After 15 years, it will be permitted to use advanced centrifuges to \nenrich uranium on an industrial scale, to stockpile significant \nquantities of enriched uranium, and to build heavy water reactors, \naccording to the State Department's own fact sheet. After only 10 \nyears, Iran's breakout time to rush for a nuclear weapon drops ``almost \ndown to zero,'' as President Obama himself admitted.\n  In the words of former Deputy National Security Advisor Juan Zarate, \nthis deal ``stalls, [then] enables, and then validates an Iranian \nnuclear program.'' All that the Iranian regime has to do is abide by \nthe terms of the agreement to achieve threshold nuclear status--with an \nexpanded infrastructure for the production of nuclear materials and a \nvisible means of delivering a nuclear weapon to targets as far away as \nthe United States.\n  Moreover, the deal's means of verifying the Iranian regime's \ncompliance with these temporary limits on its nuclear programs are, \nfrankly, pathetic. Our only peaceful means of recourse under the deal, \nthe so-called snapback mechanism, involves an incredibly cumbersome \nprocess.\n  It allows the Iranian regime to delay international inspections for \nup to 24 days without recourse, a critical gap that experts such as \nformer International Atomic Energy Agency Deputy Director General for \nSafeguards Olli Heinonen and former National Nuclear Security \nAdministration Deputy Administrator for Defense William Tobey assert \ncould allow Iran to hide evidence of illicit nuclear activities.\n  Other parties' intransigence could also drag out the snapback \nmechanism more than 2 months before reimposing U.N. sanctions, \napproximately the same length of time as Iran's current breakout \ntimetable, according to President Obama.\n  Furthermore, the deal only makes the snapback mechanism available for \ninstances of ``significant nonperformance,'' leaving no mechanism to \nrespond to the kind of incremental cheating that has characterized the \nIranian nuclear program thus far.\n  Perhaps most troubling, it remains unclear whether weapons inspectors \nwill even have access to all Iranian nuclear facilities in the first \nplace. Senior officials of the Iranian regime have repeatedly claimed \nthat the deal does not allow access to military sites. The agreement's \nlanguage appears to have been left deliberately vague on this point, \nhardly an encouraging development.\n  Moreover, press accounts of an IAEA side deal with Iran indicate that \nthe international watchdog has already agreed to rely on the Iranian \nregime to conduct its own inspections at the Parchin weapons testing \nsite, providing the IAEA with only photographs, videos, and \nenvironmental samples. Former IAEA Deputy Director General Heinonen may \nhave put it best when he observed:\n\n       If the reporting is accurate, these procedures appear to be \n     departing significantly from well-established and proven \n     safeguards practices. At a broader level, if verification \n     standards have been diluted for Parchin or elsewhere and \n     limits imposed, the ramification is significant as it will \n     affect the IAEA's ability to draw definitive conclusions with \n     the requisite level of assurances and without undue hampering \n     of the verification process.\n\n  Regarding these troubling reports, I have a number of outstanding \nquestions and concerns that have only been amplified by the Obama \nadministration's steadfast refusal to share the text of the agreement \nwith Congress. This intransigence amounts to an evasion of the spirit \nand possibly the text of the bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct, a development that rightfully sows doubt and concern about what \nelse the Obama administration might be hiding.\n  In light of these incredible concessions to the Iranian regime, I am \nalso deeply troubled by the great benefit the Iranian regime stands to \nenjoy from this deal. To use the succinct words of one scholar, \n``President Obama is agreeing to dismantle the sanctions regime \npermanently. In return, Tehran is agreeing to slow the development of \nits nuclear program temporarily.''\n  The current sanctions regime has imposed heavy costs on the Iranian \neconomy. Oil exports have dropped by 60 percent. The inflation rate has \nrisen to 40 percent. And foreign companies, deterred by harsh \npenalties, have avoided investing in Iran, thereby isolating Iran from \nthe global economy. Along with the threat of military action, these \nsanctions played a critical role in bringing the Iranian regime to the \nnegotiating table, and we should thus be very careful before \nsacrificing this leverage.\n  In exchange for these minimal, temporary concessions, the Iranian \nregime stands to reap enormous rewards in sanctions relief. According \nto figures cited by President Obama, the Iranian regime will regain \ncontrol of more than $150 billion currently frozen in the world's \nfinancial institutions. Sanctions relief will also allow an influx of \ninternational businesses into Iran, bringing about greater revenue for \nthe regime.\n  Where should we expect this money to be spent? Will it go to the \nlong-suffering Iranian people who are the victims of this regime, a \npeople who have long contributed to the advancement of civilization and \nthe good of mankind, a people whose true spirit has been continually \nrepressed for almost 40 years, a people who have paid a high price \nbecause of the radical fundamentalism of their leaders, and a people \nwho look to us for strength in the defense of our ideals, not \ncapitulation to this heinous regime?\n\n  Unfortunately, we cannot expect such an outcome. If history is any \nguide, we should expect the Iranian regime to use sanctions relief to \npursue its dangerous aims, including: to support its terrorist proxies \nthat represent a dire threat to the stability of the whole region, such \nas Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and the \nmurderous Assad regime in Syria; to encourage the ``swarming of \n[foreign] businesses to Iran,'' which the Iranian foreign minister \nbelieves will make it ``impossible to reconstruct'' broad international \nsanctions; to take advantage of the lifting of the U.N. arms embargo \nafter 5 years to purchase sophisticated weapons systems such as the \nRussian S-300 air defense system, which would make American or Israeli \nmilitary action against the Iranian nuclear program even more difficult \nthan it already would be; and to shore up the political and financial \nstanding of the most radical elements of the Iranian regime, reducing \nthe likelihood of internal reform and a more constructive Iranian \nforeign policy.\n  If the Iranian regime suddenly becomes flush with cash, what \nincentive will it have to change priorities 15 years from now?\n  Doesn't this deal reward what the Obama administration called ``bad \nbehavior'' in one of the most astonishing understatements that I have \never heard?\n  And in the words of one expert, ``when in the course of human history \ndid getting $100 billion [or $150 billion] at the stroke of a pen ever \nconvince anyone that they have been wrong all along?''\n  For a deal built on the unfounded hope that the Iranian regime would \nchange its ways, I see very little reason to expect success. And for an \nagreement that would supposedly reinforce the position of the Iranian \nmoderates and bring relief to the Iranian people, I see only the \nprospect of strengthening the hand of the hard-liners and of sanctions \nrelief diverted for more violent misadventures, rather than for the \nbenefit of the Iranian people.\n  Reflecting on this spectacularly bad deal, I can only conclude that \nObama administration officials proved to be weak negotiators because of \nan absolute desperation for a deal--almost any deal. These massive \nconcessions to the Iranian regime for so little in return were produced \nby this administration's knee-jerk aversion to the prospect of using \nmilitary force, a preoccupation demonstrated by the constant rhetoric \nthat we hear from the White House that the only alternative to this \ndeal is war.\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\n  That claim is patently false. We can and should go back to the \nnegotiating table. While reassembling the sanctions coalition that this \nagreement throws away will not be easy and may not even be fully \npossible, a nation as strong as ours still has plenty of tools at our \ndisposal. Our unparalleled economic and military might give us \nsignificant leverage to get a better deal, and we should not be misled \nby overly simplistic rhetoric to conclude otherwise.\n  War is never a happy matter to contemplate, especially from a \nposition of responsibility such as in the Senate. In this body, we are \nsaddled all too often with the sorts of decisions in which real \npeople's lives hang in the balance: those of our friends and neighbors; \nour fellow countrymen; our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines; and \neven those in faraway distant places who look to America as a guardian \nof freedom and peace, what Abraham Lincoln called the last, best hope \nof Earth.\n  None of us relish the prospect of war, especially in an age in which \nour weapons have a power almost too terrible to contemplate. In \nparticular, neither I nor any of my colleagues seek a war with Iran; as \nI stated before, the Iranian people are not our enemies. They are our \nfriends. No people have paid a higher price for the regime's record of \nterrorism, mass murder, corruption, and duplicity than the Iranians. \nThe prospect of inflicting collateral damage on our long-suffering \nfriends further counsels against any course of action that leads to \nwar.\n  It is not a cavalier attitude about war that leads me to oppose this \ndeal; it is my unwavering judgment that this deal makes war much more \nlikely that leads me to oppose it.\n  Let there be no doubt. A deal that paves rather than precludes Iran's \npath to a nuclear weapons capability makes war more likely. A deal that \nmakes the Iranian regime more confident of its ability to protect its \nnuclear program from international pressure and military action makes \nwar more likely. A deal that funnels tens of billions of dollars to \nterrorists bent on destabilizing the Middle East makes war more likely. \nA deal that provokes a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region on \nthe globe makes war more likely. A deal that surrounds Israel not only \nwith a nuclear Iran but also eventually with numerous other regimes \nwith nuclear weapons capability and a genocidal attitude toward the \nJewish State makes war more likely. And a deal that puts the Iranian \nregime and its terrorist allies one turn of a screwdriver away from a \nnuclear weapon and a means of delivering it anywhere across the world \nmakes war more likely.\n  War may come, but it is not inevitable. As Members of ``the world's \ngreatest deliberative body,'' it is our duty to discern the wisest \ncourse of action that preserves the security of the United States and \nour allies--that reduces the risk of war but does not let the strong \ndesire for peace we all share cloud our judgment about how we best \npreserve that peace.\n  In this solemn debate, it is my hope that the voice of reason will \nhave the power to change minds and overcome the pressures of our \npolitics that have the power to lead us astray. I am encouraged in my \nhope by the fact that almost every Member to come out in support of \nthis deal has noted its significant flaws. The opposition to it has \nbeen unambiguous, strong, and bipartisan, and it constitutes a strong \nmajority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. I want to \npay tribute to four of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nhave bucked significant political pressure to vote their consciences \nagainst this bad deal.\n  We still have a chance to change course. All that is required is the \nbravery and good judgment to lead our Nation and the world to an \nagreement that can actually preserve the long-term peace. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to join me in opposing this disastrous deal and in \nsupporting a better way forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, first, I thank our honored President pro \ntempore for his outstanding comments.\n  But while my distinguished friend from Illinois is on the floor, I \nthought I would walk through a unanimous consent request, if that is \nOK. I think it has been cleared with him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be further \ndivided as follows: from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. would be Republican time, \nfrom 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. would be Democratic time, from 12 p.m. to 1 \np.m. would be Republican time, from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. would be \nDemocratic time, from 2 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. would be Republican time, \nfrom 2:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. would be Democratic time, from 3 p.m. to 3:45 \np.m. it be equally divided between the leaders or their designees, and \nthat Senator Menendez be given 15 minutes of the Republican time and 15 \nminutes of the Democrat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask the Senator from Tennessee to clarify, \nwould the last part of his request relate to the period between 3 p.m. \nand 3:45 p.m.?\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, so our side knows what will occur between now and the \nend of our time, the next 15 minutes will be for Senator Graham, then \n10 minutes to Senator Barrasso, and then 10 minutes to Senator Flake.\n  With that, I yield the floor to one of the best national security \nvoices in the United States of America, Senator Graham of South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I just want to make sure people understand \nwhat we are trying to do here this morning. Our Democratic colleagues \nare filibustering an attempt to have a debate and an up-or-down vote on \nthe most consequential foreign policy decision in modern history. That \nis what you are doing.\n  Senator Corker, in good faith, got us here in a bipartisan manner. \nAnd Senator Reid has come out of nowhere to change what was the common \nunderstanding of how we would proceed--get 60 votes, a simple majority, \nand let the President act as he wishes.\n  But, no, we couldn't do that. They are more worried about protecting \nBarack Obama from having to veto this than they are about having a \ndebate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Now, let me tell you a little about who you are dealing with here, \nfolks. If I hear one more comment from my Democratic friends about how \nmuch they love Israel--with friends like this, you don't need an enemy. \nThis is who you are dealing with. This was yesterday:\n\n       Iran's supreme leader predicted Wednesday that Israel would \n     not exist in 25 years, and ruled out any new negotiations \n     with the ``Satan,'' the United States, beyond the recently \n     completed nuclear accord.\n       In remarks published Wednesday on his personal website--\n\n  At least the Ayatollah has gotten into modern times--\n\n     and in posts on Twitter, the supreme leader--\n\n  Do you know why they call him the Supreme Leader? Because he is--\n\n     Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded to what he said were claims \n     that Israel would be safe for that period. . . .\n\n  Where did those claims come from? It came from this administration, \nmy colleagues on the other side. You are telling the world that this is \nthe best deal for Israel. Guess what. Nobody in Israel who is in the \ncurrent government agrees with you. It is just not Bibi. Everybody who \nis in the current coalition government understands this is not a good \ndeal for Israel.\n  Why don't you listen to them? You want it to be a good deal for \nIsrael. Well, it is not, and your wanting it doesn't change it.\n  So let's finish what he said.\n\n       [The Ayatollah] responded to what he said were claims that \n     Israel would be safe for that period under the nuclear \n     agreement reached in July.\n       ``After nuclear negotiations, the Zionist regime said that \n     they will not be worried about Iran in the next 25 years.''\n\n  I repeat.\n\n       ``After nuclear negotiations, the Zionist regime said that \n     they will not be worried about Iran in the next 25 years.''\n\n  Israel didn't say that. People over here said that.\n  The Ayatollah wrote:\n\n       ``I am telling you, first, you will not be around in 25 \n     years' time, and God willing, there will be no Zionist regime \n     in 25 years. Second, during this period, the spirit of\n\n[[Page S6548]]\n\n     fighting, heroism and jihad will keep you worried every \n     moment.''\n\n  Clearly, somebody who is on the course of change, somebody we should \ngive $100 billion to, create a pathway to a nuclear bomb in 15 years \nand let him buy more weapons in 5 years and build an intercontinental \nballistic missile in 8 years--clearly, this is the man who has changed \ncourse and you have empowered him.\n  At least--at least--Chamberlain can say Hitler lied. At least \nChamberlain can say: I negotiated with the Fuhrer. He told me to my \nface: If you give me this, I am done.\n  Well, we all know Chamberlain was a chump, and Hitler actually meant \nwhat he said when he wrote a book.\n  The question is, Does this man mean what he says when he tweets \nyesterday that the ink is not dry on the deal?\n  The one thing you can say about the old Ayatollah--who is crazy, who \nis a religious Nazi--is that at least he is honest. He doesn't want you \nto be confused as you vote as to what he wants to do to your friend \nIsrael. See, he doesn't want you to misstate what this deal means to \nhim. You obviously are writing him off. You obviously believe he \ndoesn't mean it.\n  I guess he has a polling problem in Iran. He has to get his numbers \nup. He needs to say these things--because he doesn't mean it. But he \nhas to keep his people happy because they like hearing this stuff. All \nI can tell you is his people tried to rise up against him in 2009, and \nour President sat on the sidelines and didn't do a damn thing. The \nbiggest moment for change in Iran came in 2009, when young people and \nwomen took to the streets demanding a fair election that was stolen \nfrom them by the Ayatollah, and his response was to beat them, shoot \nthem, put them in jail and torture them. This is the guy you are going \nto give $100 billion to, a clear pathway to a bomb. He doesn't even \nhave to cheat to get there and buy more weapons to attack us.\n\n  At least Chamberlain lied. This man is telling you what he is going \nto do as of yesterday, and between these times that negotiations have \nstarted until now, has he shown us a little leg about what will change? \nDuring the negotiations he has toppled four Arab capitals. During the \nnegotiations he has supported the Houthis in Yemen, who destroyed a \npro-American government, and we have lost eyes and ears on Al Qaeda in \nthe Arabian Peninsula--a Sunni extremist group that attacked Paris and \nwill attack us.\n  During the negotiations they have done anything but be moderate. I \ncannot believe that you don't believe him. I cannot believe you made \nthe biggest miscalculation in modern history by empowering a religious \nfanatic with the ability to attack our Nation, destroy our friends in \nIsrael, and keep the Mideast on fire for 15 years. What are you all \nthinking over there?\n  All I can say is that on the last 9/11, 3,000 of us died because they \ncouldn't get weapons to kill 3 million of us. If you let this deal go \nforward, before too long the most radical regime on the planet will \nhave the most lethal weapons available to mankind. They will share that \ntechnology with terrorists and they will come here. Why do they need an \nICBM, folks? What are they going to do with it? They are not going to \nsend people to space. What are you thinking? What are you all thinking \nover there? You are taking the most radical regime on the planet, a \ntheocracy--this is not a democracy. The moderates were shot down in the \nstreets. They were begging: Are you with us or are you with him, \nPresident Obama?\n  President Obama is absolutely the poorest champion of freedom and the \nweakest opponent of evil in history. Evil is flourishing on his watch. \nPresident Obama said you would have to be crazy not to support this \ndeal. Let's walk through whether we should follow his advice about \nradical Islam.\n  This is the President who was told to leave troops in Iraq to make \nsure our gains would be maintained, and he pulled everybody out because \nhe wanted to get to zero. He turned down every commander's advice to \nget to zero because he made a campaign promise. This is the President \nwho was told by his entire national security team 3 years ago to \nestablish a no-fly zone and help the Free Syrian Army because Assad was \non the ropes, at a time when it would have mattered, when there was a \nFree Syrian Army to help and Assad was about to fall. Obama said: No \nthanks. This is the President who drew a redline against Assad, after \nhe backed off, and said: If you use chemical weapons and you cross that \nredline, there will be a price.\n  Here are the facts. Assad is going to be in power and Obama is going \nto be gone. The last man standing is going to be Assad. So all I can \ntell you is this is the man who said: Don't worry about ISIL. They are \nthe JV team. I killed bin Laden; Al Qaeda is decimated.\n  At what point in time do you realize President Obama has no idea what \nhe is talking about? At what point in time is it obvious to anybody in \nthe world who is paying attention that when it comes to radical Islam \nhe has no clue?\n  So this is the guy we are going to send in to negotiate with a \nradical ayatollah--a guy who, in the eyes of the world, is a complete \nweak defender of freedom and a very poor adversary of evil. If that is \nnot enough, the Iranians are rubbing this in John Kerry and Barack \nObama's face by tweeting this out hours before you vote on this deal.\n  Just to remind you that no matter what you say on this floor about \nIsrael, nothing has changed in his mind about Israel. When you claim \nIsrael is safe, he is telling you: No, they are not. But you are not \nlistening because you don't think he really means it. Well, I can tell \nyou right now, you better be right. How about this idea. When it comes \nto the Ayatollah, assume the worst, not the best.\n  To our friends in Russia, John Kerry said one of the big benefits of \nthis deal is that we will bring Russia in and Iran will be a better \npartner in the Mideast, and we will have a major breakthrough where \nIran begins to help us with problems like Syria. Well, here is Russia's \nresponse, before you vote. They are sending Russian troops--maybe \nfighter planes--into Syria to prop up Assad before you vote. They are \ntaking everything John Kerry said about what would happen if you do \nthis deal and rubbing it in his face.\n  Tell me how you fix Syria with Assad in power? What the Russians are \ndoing is ensuring he will stay in power longer, and the longer he stays \nin power, the more refugees the world will have to deal with and the \nmore Hell on Earth will occur in Syria.\n  The Syrian people want two things; they want to destroy ISIL and they \nwant Assad gone because he has destroyed their families. So Secretary \nKerry, how well is this working, with this new engagement of Iran and \nRussia. Things are really changing. Look at the tweet yesterday. What \nare you going to tell the American people this means? Interpret the \nAyatollah for me. This is just all talk? He has to say these things? He \ndoesn't get elected. He doesn't have to worry about the next election. \nHe says these things because he believes them. He is a religious \nfanatic, compelled by his version of Islam to destroy everything in his \nreligion that he doesn't agree with--to destroy the one and only Jewish \nState and attack democracies such as ours, and you are giving him more \nto do that with. This is, over time, a death sentence for Israel, if it \nis not changed.\n  If I had $100 billion to negotiate with, for God's sake, could I get \nfour people out of jail? I could get people out of jail here with $100 \nbillion. Who is negotiating with Iran? This idea we are going to \nseparate all of their bad behavior from their nuclear program was the \nbiggest miscalculation in modern foreign policy history.\n  To suggest we don't need to look at Iran as a whole unit; that we are \ngoing to ignore the fact that they have four hostages, U.S. personnel \nheld in sham trials, a Washington Post reporter; that they are the \nlargest State sponsor of terrorism; that they destabilize the region; \nthat they have driven our friends out of Yemen; that they are \nsupporting Hezbollah, a mortal enemy of Israel; and that they have \ntaken over the Lebanese Government--we are not going to worry about all \nthat? What do you think they are going to do with the $100 billion? Do \nyou really think they are going to build roads and bridges?\n  The best indication of the next 15 years is the last 35. When you \nseparated their nuclear ambitions from their destructive behavior, \ngiving them access to more weapons and $100 billion, you made a huge \nmistake because you are damning the Mideast to holy hell for the next \n15 years, and you are\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\ngiving the largest state sponsor of terrorism more money and more \nweapons to attack us--and you couldn't get four people out of jail.\n  The only reason they are not dancing in Iran is the Ayatollah just \ndoesn't believe in dancing. I have friends over there whom I respect \nand admire. I have no idea what you are thinking. I have no idea why \nyou believe the Ayatollah doesn't mean what he says, given the way he \nhas behaved. If they would shoot their own children down in the streets \nto keep power, what do you think they will do to ours? And the only \nreason 3,000 people died on 9/11 is because they couldn't get the \nweapons to kill 3 million of us, and they are on course to do it now.\n  I have never been more disappointed in the body than I am today, a \nbody known to be the most deliberative body in democracy in the history \nof the world. Yet you will not let us have a vote. You will not let us \nhave a debate.\n  Please stop saying this deal makes Israel safer. That is cruel. Your \nresponse to this deal is to give them more weapons because you know \nthey are not safer. I find it a bit odd that in response to this deal \nwe are selling the Arabs every kind of weapon known to man and we are \npromising Israel every kind of weapon we have. If you truly thought \nthis was such a good deal, why do you have to arm everybody who is in \nthe crosshairs of the Ayatollah?\n  When they write the history of these times, they are going to look \nback and say that President Obama was a weak opponent of evil and a \npoor champion of freedom. They are going to look and say that the \nUnited States Senate refused to debate the most consequential foreign \npolicy agreement in modern times, and the people in Israel are going to \nwonder where did America go.\n  Has it ever crossed your mind that everybody in Israel who is in \npower, who is running the government today, objects to this agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator Corker, thank you for trying to have the debate \nwe need. To my Democratic friends: You own this. You own every ``i'' \nand every ``t'' and every bullet, and you own everything that is to \nfollow and it is going to be holy hell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am so proud of my colleague from South \nCarolina for the remarkable speech he just gave to this Senate about \nhis concerns about this President's deal with Iran--the President's \nnuclear deal with Iran. That is what the Senate is debating right now--\na deal President Obama negotiated with Iran and whether that deal \nshould stand or fall.\n  This agreement could affect American foreign policy in the Middle \nEast and beyond for this generation as well as the next. It will affect \nAmerica's relationship with our allies as well as with our enemies. \nOther countries are wondering whether America will accept a flawed \nagreement that gives Iran almost everything it has asked for or will \nwe, as the United States of America, stand strong against outlaw \nnations with nuclear ambitions and dreams.\n  As Senators prepare to vote on this legislation we should ask: Does \nthis agreement do enough to stop Iran's nuclear weapons program? Does \nthis agreement do enough to protect the security of the American people \nand our friends around the world? I believe the answer is no. It would \nbe irresponsible to support such a weak, such a naive, and such a \ndangerous deal.\n  The original goal of ending Iran's nuclear weapons program was a good \none, and I wish the President had actually stuck with that goal. I wish \nthe President had done a better job of negotiating with the Iranians. \nHe did not. During the negotiations this administration was far too \nwilling to make concessions, concessions that put our own national \nsecurity at risk.\n  We were in a very strong position during these negotiations from the \nstart, and the Obama administration squandered the advantage. The \nPresident badly wanted to strike a deal with Iran, and that is the \nproblem because President Obama has shown once again that if you want a \ndeal badly enough, you will end up with a bad deal. The President fell \nin love with this deal, even though it is deeply flawed. And deeply \nflawed is a description our Democratic colleagues continue to make \nabout this deal. The President cannot see the flaws that our colleagues \non the Senate floor can see because I believe the President is blinded \nby deal euphoria. He is in love with the deal.\n  The agreement President Obama has negotiated will legitimize Iran's \nnuclear program. It will accept Iran as a nuclear threshold state. To \nme, this is inexcusable. It is not the deal the President should have \nsigned. It is not the deal the President could have signed. It is not \nthe deal President Obama promised he would sign.\n  President Obama once said that Iran didn't need advanced centrifuges \nin order to have a limited, peaceful nuclear program, but under this \nagreement his administration did negotiate that Iran will not eliminate \na single centrifuge. It will continue to research more advanced \ncentrifuges, and it can even start building them.\n  So how did it happen? How did this happen? On the day the agreement \nwas announced, the President of Iran bragged--bragged--about how he had \ngotten the Obama administration to surrender on this point. ``To \nsurrender,'' that is the language I am hearing around the State of \nWyoming and certainly the language we are hearing from Iran: The \nPresident surrendered.\n  At the beginning, the President said Iran would only need 100 \ncentrifuges. Then the number went to 1,000, then 4,000, then eventually \nallowed more than 6,000. When it mattered most, the Obama \nadministration wanted a deal so badly that it was willing to concede on \npoint after point after point. This proves if you want a deal bad \nenough, you will get a bad deal--and that is what we have here today.\n  The same thing happened with ballistic missiles. GEN Martin Dempsey, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States \nmilitary, told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``Under no \ncircumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic \nmissile capabilities and arms trafficking.'' Under no circumstances.\n  Defense Secretary Ash Carter also testified at the same hearing. Now, \nthis hearing, of course, was only 6 days before the final deal was \nannounced by the President. Secretary of Defense said, ``We want them \nto continue to be isolated as a military and limited in terms of the \nkinds of equipment and materials they are able to get.'' That was 6 \ndays before the final deal was announced.\n  So what happened? What did the President of the United States \nsurrender on? With this agreement, Iran will have access to ballistic \nmissile technology in as little as 8 years, even though the Secretary \nof Defense said no; even though the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff said, ``Under no circumstances.'' That is when Russia and other \ncountries are going to be able to start selling this deadly technology \nto Iran--and I believe that Iran will use it.\n  Now, this was a last-minute demand that Iran made, and it should have \nbeen easy for President Obama to reject it, but he did not. He \nsurrendered. The President was so desperate to get a deal that he gave \nin once again. It is always the same story with the Obama \nadministration: If you want a deal bad enough, you are going to get a \nbad deal--and they have. When the Obama administration is negotiating \nwith countries that need a deal much more than we do, the President of \nthe United States surrenders.\n  This administration has no red lines when it comes to negotiating. \nThey will give away anything to get a deal. There have been too many \nconcessions for anyone to be comfortable with this agreement. There are \ntoo many red flags. President Obama cannot see the defects that are \nobvious in this plan. He refuses to see what is so clear to the \nAmerican people.\n  After this agreement, Iran will be a nuclear threshold state, and a \nmilitary and an industrial power. It will have the money to support \nterrorists around the world--more money than it has had in the past. It \nwill have the freedom to pursue its nuclear ambitions.\n  Even some Democrats who have said they support this deal are doing so \nwith great reservations. They say they know it is not a good deal, but \nthey say: It is the only option we have. Well,\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\nthat is not a good enough reason for me to accept all of the risks and \nall of the concessions that the Obama administration allowed in this \nagreement.\n  The President says: The choice is the Iran nuclear deal or war. He \nhas said it time and time again. It is fear mongering. It is not true. \nThere is an alternative. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said \nso.\n  General Dempsey was asked about that at a hearing of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. In answer to the question: Is it this or war, the \ngeneral said, ``I can tell you that we have a range of options, and I \nalways present them''--present them to the President. ``We have a range \nof options.'' It is not just a choice between this deal or war. It is a \nchoice between accepting a bad deal or rejecting it. If the only choice \nis to take this deal or leave it, then we must leave it.\n  The Obama administration doesn't want us to have a vote here in the \nSenate. The Obama administration knows it signed a bad deal, and it \nwants the whole thing to disappear from the front pages before it \ncauses them any more embarrassment.\n  So instead of having a full and honest debate on the floor of the \nSenate, the President and the Senate Democrat leader are trying to hide \nbehind a filibuster. That is not how the Senate should handle this \nimportant resolution to disapprove the Iran deal. Every Member of the \nSenate should be willing to cast a vote up or down on this Iran deal. \nWe should stand up, we should represent the people of our State and \nthis Nation, and we should cast our votes.\n  The Obama administration has made its arguments, and it has failed to \nmake its case. The President has not shown that America will be better \noff with this deal, and I believe we would be better off without it.\n  We have heard the administration's excuses. We have heard all of the \nways the final deal fell short of their promises. America can't afford \nto let Iran have the nuclear program that this agreement will allow it \nto obtain. We should vote to disapprove the Iran deal. The President \nshould drop his veto threat. The President should send his people back \nto the negotiating table because this deal poses too great a threat to \nAmerica's national security for us to do anything else.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, as we continue the debate on one of the \nmost important foreign policy matters this body has addressed in some \ntime, I would be remiss if I didn't mention how honored I am to be a \npart of it.\n  It is not unusual for the Congress to engage in debate over matters \nlike spending bills, bills to authorize various Federal agencies, \nexecutive branch and judicial nominations, or other business that we \nroutinely attend to around here. But it is only on occasion that this \nbody gets to have the opportunity to weigh in on some of the more \npressing foreign policy matters. When it does, the legislation it \nconsiders often has lasting consequences for the United States and for \nthe rest of the world.\n  Take, for example, the Taiwan Relations Act. Passed by both chambers \nin 1979 in response to the normalization of relations between the \nUnited States and China, this piece of legislation remains the \ncornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship to this day.\n  Likewise, this body has considered a number of arms limitation \ntreaties over the decades between the United States and Russia. The \nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, was approved by this body in \n1992 by a vote of 93 to 6. START II was approved in 1996 by a vote of \n87 to 4. Most recently, the New START treaty with Russia was approved \nin 2010 by a vote of 71 to 26.\n  These bills address subject matter that was highly controversial. I \nam sure there was a fair amount of disagreement between Democrats and \nRepublicans, and between the Congress and the White House. But in \ninstances likely too numerous to count, Senate deliberation ended with \na bipartisan vote that set the U.S. foreign policy into place for \nyears, even decades, and signaled that America was speaking to the rest \nof the world with one voice.\n  I deeply regret the JCPOA will not build on this history. \nUnfortunately, the administration elected to negotiate this deal as an \nexecutive agreement rather than a treaty. That was the administration's \ncall. It does mean, however, that the administration did not need to \nnegotiate the JCPOA, mindful that it would need the support of 67 \nSenators. It also means the Senate does not have the opportunity to \noffer so-called RUDs--reservations, understandings, and declarations--\nthat can accompany treaties and clarify its interpretation of the \nagreement.\n  To be sure, there are several troubling aspects of this agreement \nthat could have been improved if the Senate had the opportunity to \nconsider the JCPOA as a treaty. For example, the text of the agreement \nclearly states that any reimposition of the sanctions specified in \nAnnex II would be viewed by Iran as a violation of the agreement and \nwould likely prompt Iran to cease abiding by its obligations under the \nagreement. The sanctions in Annex II include all the influential \nsanctions, such as those on Iran's Central Bank. These have had a \nprofound effect on Iran's economy.\n  In hearings and briefings by the administration, I have asked whether \nthe United States could reimpose these powerful sanctions at some point \nlater down the line for other, nonnuclear-related behavior by the \nIranian government to penalize Iran for regional activities or for \ncommitting acts of terrorism. This regime, as we know, has made \nachieving regional hegemony its calling card since its inception in \n1979. Now, this administration has assured me that these sanctions \nwould be available in the future, but, unfortunately, that simply does \nnot square with the text of the agreement.\n  The question of reimposition of sanctions raises a further question \nof how this agreement might bind the hands of future Congresses and \nfuture administrations. As I previously mentioned, though the JCPOA has \nalready been adopted by the United Nations, it will never be the \nsupreme law of the land in the United States because it is not a \ntreaty. A treaty that has been agreed to by at least 67 Senators gives \nthe treaty the critical imprimatur that insulates it from political \nwinds for the lifespan of the treaty. The JCPOA will benefit from no \nsuch imprimatur.\n  What if, for example, a future Congress or President wishes to \nreimpose sanctions against Iran or take some other action that might \nlegitimately cause Iran to accuse us of violating the JCPOA? A future \nCongress or President could be put in the position of either having to \npreserve an agreement that neither had a hand in negotiating nor taking \naction that would result in Iran walking away from its nuclear \nobligations. It would be beneficial for U.S. foreign policy to steer \nclear of those lose-lose propositions.\n  The current administration has already expressed reluctance to push \nback against Iran's interpretation of the agreement even before it has \nbeen implemented. I have serious concerns that if there is reluctance \nto push back on Iran now, there will be even more reluctance to push \nback on Iran's regional behavior once the deal is in place. This gives \nIran more leverage than it currently has moving forward, and that could \nhave disastrous consequences on the Middle East. These are issues that \ncould have been addressed in a positive manner by the Senate if the \nagreement had been submitted as a treaty.\n  Now, when this agreement was announced, I said I would take every \nopportunity to learn more about it, so I attended every hearing held by \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I commend Chairman Corker and \nRanking Member Cardin for holding these hearings and going about this \nin such a deliberative and serious manner. I attended every classified \ncongressional briefing and several other briefings, and had discussions \nwith numerous experts and administration officials.\n  After these discussions, these hearings, these briefings, I believe \nit is a much closer call on this agreement than most want to admit. \nThere are positive aspects on the nuclear side. Unfortunately, I think \nthis deal suffers from significant shortcomings.\n  Hoping that Iran's nuclear ambitions might change after a 15-year \nsabbatical might be a bet worth making. Believing that Iran's regional \nbehavior will change tomorrow while giving up tools to deter or modify \nsuch behavior is not a bet worth taking.\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\n  It is for these reasons that I reluctantly oppose the JCPOA.\n  I do hope that we can make up for this unfortunately partisan vote by \nworking together, and with the President, to pass a regional security \nframework agreement that will not only reassure Israel and our allies \nin the region, but solidify this agreement throughout the duration of \nthe JCPOA.\n  The United States is strongest when we speak with one voice on \nforeign policy matters.\n\n\n                      Border Jobs for Veterans Act\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday, we were able to pass on a bipartisan \nbasis--in fact, unanimously--a bipartisan bill to help put veterans \nback to work as Customs and Border Protection officers at understaffed \nU.S. ports of entry.\n  Earlier this week, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson \nconfirmed that the agency has not yet filled 1,200 of the 2,000 new CBP \nofficer positions created by Congress in 2014 to improve security and \nreduce trade-stifling commercial traffic in ports. Secretary Johnson \nhas attributed these shortfalls to delays associated with applicant \nbackground investigations. So we were able to pass legislation to force \nthe Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to work \ntogether with this legislation. Now they will do so, and hopefully it \nwill improve the condition of trade and the backlogs we have on the \nborder.\n\n  I applaud my colleagues for making this happen--cosponsors John \nMcCain, Chuck Schumer, Richard Burr, Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, \nDianne Feinstein, and others. Thank you for passing this legislation. \nIt will improve the situation on the Arizona-Mexico border.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know the time has ended. I know that \nSenator Daines wants to speak very briefly. Senator Durbin is allowing \nthat as long as we give back some time at a later moment. If we might \nhave 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DAINES. I wish to thank the Senator. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, if Iran's ultimate goal is to obtain a \nnuclear weapon, the deal reached by the Obama administration sets Iran \non course to do so. From the time this deal is agreed to, Iran has 10 \nyears to fill their coffers with tens of billions of dollars from newly \nunsanctioned oil sales and pursue the research and development of \nnuclear capabilities. As the world's leader of state-sponsored \nterrorism, it will only be a matter of time before Iran achieves its \nultimate goal, and that is obtaining a nuclear weapon. These are \nbipartisan concerns.\n  This deal will not prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and \nthe American people deserve a better deal. This deal is stacked against \ntransparency and accountability. It provides up to a 24-day delay \nbefore Iran is forced to comply with inspections of nuclear sites on \ntheir military bases. This is a long way from ``anywhere, anytime'' the \nAmerican people were promised. Can you imagine if the EPA or the FDA \ncame knocking on a Montana farmer or business owner's door, and they \nsaid: Well, you can't come and inspect right now, but come back in 24 \ndays. That is what we have set up right now with the Iranian Government \nthrough this deal.\n  Through this deal, the American people are being asked to enter into \na binding trust agreement with the world's leading state sponsor of \nterror. In fact, just yesterday I looked at my Twitter feed, and the \nSupreme Leader of Iran--he is called the Supreme Leader for a reason--\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei said: ``I say that you [Israelis] will not see \nthe coming 25 years and, God willing, there will not be something named \nthe Zionist regime in [the] next 25 years.'' And then he went on to \nreiterate in calling America the Great Satan. This is whom the United \nStates is making this bad nuclear deal with. It is not a mistake to \npush for tougher sanctions.\n  The American people deserve a better option. Two nights ago, I had a \ntele-townhall meeting, calling into 100,000 Montana households. \nOverwhelmingly, by 3 to 1, Montanans opposed this deal.\n  As we close, let me say this: As I step back and look at the numbers \ntoday, if we look at the Senate, it looks as if about 69 Senators are \nopposed to this deal. There are 42 supporting it. Those 58 who oppose \nit are bipartisan. The House numbers are similar in ratios.\n  The point is this: There is bipartisan opposition to this deal, both \nDemocrats and Republicans joining together. The only support is \npartisan. It is a mistake to not push for a better deal that can be \nsupported by more than one segment of one political party.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, so that those who are following this \ndebate understand where we are, this morning the Democratic leader, \nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, for the second time offered to the \nRepublican side the following: that we will bring this critically \nimportant, historic measure before the U.S. Senate for an up-or-down \nvote--a clean up-or-down vote--at a margin of 60 votes.\n  Sixty votes is the margin that is used for every major and, I might \nadd, controversial measure before the Senate. So what we are asking is \nnot out of line. In fact, the Republican side had supported the notion \nof a 60-vote margin until they didn't have 60 votes. Now they are \ncalling for some other approach.\n  So here is what we face. This afternoon at about 3:45 p.m., we will \nhave a rollcall vote. It will be on the procedural question of whether \nwe end debate on one aspect of this issue. It is known as a cloture \nvote. We will see how it turns out. But we have made a good-faith offer \ntwice to the Republicans to finish this important debate and to bring \nthis to a 60-vote close.\n  Every single Member of the Senate on both sides of the aisle has \nannounced publicly in advance where they stand on the issue. No one is \ntrying to avoid this tough vote, and it is a challenging vote. Everyone \nhas faced it squarely and honestly, and that is where we should go. \nSenator McConnell, on the Republican side, objected to this. We will \nface a procedural vote at 3:45 p.m.\n  What is troubling is that we are in disarray now in the Congress. \nThis statute that brings us to the floor of the U.S. Senate, the \nresolution of disapproval on the Iran agreement, passed the Senate with \na vote of 98 to 1--a strong bipartisan agreement that this is how we \nwould approach it. This is what Senator McConnell is working off of, \nthe basic statute that brings us together. But look what is happening \nacross the Rotunda. Yesterday the House of Representatives \ndisassembled. When they were supposed to move forward procedurally to \nthe same vote we are facing, they fell apart. There was a Republican \ncaucus, and it was in disarray. Now they are proposing not the \nunderlying statute which we are considering but three brandnew, \ndifferent approaches to this. This is no way to run a Congress. It is \nno way to address a serious foreign policy issue, one of the more \nserious issues of our time.\n  My colleagues are here to speak. I am going to yield the floor to \nthem. I have spoken from time to time, but I will say this: Understand \nwhat we are trying to achieve here. We are not putting a seal of \napproval on Iran and their conduct and their activity. That will never \nhappen. Instead, what we are saying is we have one goal in mind, shared \nby many nations around the world: to stop Iran from developing a \nnuclear weapon. That is the goal. I believe this agreement comes as \nclose to achieving that as we can hope for at this moment.\n  I wish it were stronger and better, but in the course of negotiation, \nwe don't always get everything we want. But think of what happened \nhere. We met in Switzerland at the table with five other nations--\nChina, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. The European \nUnion, I might add, joined the United States in this effort to \nnegotiate this agreement and walked away. All nations involved in the \nnegotiations said this is a good agreement and should move forward. In \naddition to that, we have had support from the Security Council of the \nUnited Nations. Over 100 countries have endorsed this.\n  Yet it has been categorically rejected by the Republicans in both the \nHouse and the Senate. The first evidence of their rejection was March 9 \nof this year while the negotiations were underway. Forty-seven \nRepublican Senators sent a letter to the Supreme Leader in Iran,\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\nthe Ayatollah, saying to him basically: Don't waste your time \nnegotiating with the United States of America. That has never happened \nin the history of the United States--never. I asked the historians to \ncheck it. Never have we had Members of Congress sending a letter in the \nmidst of negotiations telling the other side: Don't pay attention to \nour President; don't pay any attention to our Nation. It never happened \nbefore. So 47 of them made it clear even before the agreement was \nreached that they were rejecting it. That doesn't show good faith. That \ndoesn't show an effort to try to be objective and honest about this.\n  Here we stand today with the first procedural vote this afternoon. \nThere are two things we want to achieve with this vote and with this \nagreement: No. 1, stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We do \nthat by shutting down their production facilities, by closing down \ntheir centrifuges, and by sending in scores of international \ninspectors, who will be roaming through Iran during the entire pendency \nof this agreement, looking for violations that could trigger the \nsanctions being returned. No. 2, our goal is to bring peace and \nstability as best we can when it comes to the nuclear issue in the \nMiddle East, particularly in support of our friend and ally, the nation \nof Israel. I think the President's good-faith effort here reaches that \ngoal.\n  I support this, and I will be voting on the procedural side this \nafternoon to support the President's Iran agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, my dear friend and colleague and I \ndisagree, but I very much respect the way he has conducted himself \nthroughout this entire debate.\n  Every several years or so, a legislator is called upon to cast a \nmomentous vote in which the stakes are high, and both sides of the \nissue feel very strongly about their views. Such is the case with the \nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. It demands reasoned and \nserious debate.\n  Over the years, I have learned that the best way to treat big \ndecisions is to study the issue carefully, hear the full explanation of \nthose for and against, and then, without regard to pressure, politics, \nor party, make a decision based on the merits. That is what I did with \nthe Iran deal. I carefully studied the JCPOA, read and reread the \nagreement and its annexes, questioned dozens of proponents and \nopponents, and sought answers to questions that went beyond the text of \nthe agreement. After deep study and considerable soul-searching, I \nannounced that I would oppose the agreement and vote yes on the motion \nof disapproval.\n  While we have come to different conclusions, I want to give \ntremendous credit to President Obama for his work on this issue. The \nPresident, Secretary Kerry, and their team spent painstaking months and \nyears pushing Iran to come to an agreement and, years before, \nassembling the international sanctions regime that brought Iran to the \ntable in the first place. It was the President's farsightedness that \nled our Nation to accelerate development of the Massive Ordnance \nPenetrator, the MOP, the best military deterrent and antidote to a \nnuclear Iran. Regardless of how one feels about the agreement, all \nfairminded Americans should acknowledge the President's strong \nachievements in combating and containing Iran.\n  I also have a great deal of respect for the careful thought and \ndeliberation my colleagues went through before making their final \ndecisions. While I came to a different conclusion than many in my own \ncaucus, I recognize for them that this is a vote of conscience, just as \nit is for me.\n  I wish to recount my reasoning here on the floor before a vote is \ntaken. I examined this deal in three parts: nuclear restrictions on \nIran in the first 10 years, nuclear restrictions on Iran after 10 \nyears, and nonnuclear components and consequences of a deal. In each \ncase, I didn't ask what is the ideal agreement. We are not in that \nworld. I asked, are we better off with the agreement that we have \nbefore us or without it?\n  In the fist 10 years of the deal, there are serious weaknesses in the \nagreement. First, inspections are not ``anywhere, anytime.'' The \npotential delay of as many as 24 days before we can inspect undeclared, \nsuspicious sites is troubling. It is true that declared sites will be \nmonitored. That is one of the positives of this deal. But if Iran is \ngoing to cheat, it will not be at a declared site with the eyes of the \nworld watching, it will be at a nondesignated site. If Iran is trying \nto cheat, it will certainly delay the inspection process as long as \npossible.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that the United States cannot demand \ninspections unilaterally. We require a majority of the eight-member \njoint commission. Assuming that China, Russia, and Iran will not \ncooperate, inspections would require the votes of all three European \nmembers of the P5+1 as well as the EU representative. It is a \nreasonable fear that once the Europeans become entangled in lucrative \neconomic relations with Iran, they may not want to rock the boat by \nvoting to allow inspections.\n  Additionally, the snapback provisions in the agreement seem \ncumbersome and difficult to use. While the United States could \nunilaterally cause snapback of all sanctions, there will be instances \nwhere it is more appropriate to snap back some but not all of the \nsanctions. A partial snapback of multilateral sanctions could be \ndifficult to obtain because the United States would require the \ncooperation of other nations.\n\n  If the U.S. insists on snapback of all provisions, which it can do \nunilaterally, the Europeans, Russians or Chinese might feel it is too \nsevere a punishment and might not comply.\n  Those who argue for the agreement say it is better to have an \nimperfect deal than nothing. When you consider only this portion of the \ndeal, it is indeed better to have inspections and sanctions snapback \nthan nothing, but even for this part of the agreement, the weaknesses \nwith both of those processes make this argument less compelling.\n  Second, we must evaluate how this deal would restrict Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment after 10 years. In my view, if Iran's true intent is to get \na nuclear weapon, under this agreement it simply must exercise \npatience. After 10 years, it can be very close to achieving that goal. \nIran would be stronger financially, better able to advance a robust \nnuclear program. Unlike its current unsanctioned pursuit of a nuclear \nweapon, Iran's nuclear program would be codified in an agreement signed \nby the United States and other nations.\n  Finally, we must consider the nonnuclear elements of the agreement. \nThis aspect of the deal gives me the most pause. For years Iran has \nused military force and terrorism to expand its influence in the Middle \nEast by actively supporting military or terrorist actions in Israel, \nSyria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Gaza.\n  Under this agreement, Iran would receive at least $50 billion in the \nfuture and would undoubtedly use some of that money to create even more \ntrouble in the Middle East and perhaps beyond. The hardliners could use \nthese funds to pursue an ICBM as soon as sanctions are lifted and then \naugment their ICBM capabilities in 8 years after the ban on importing \nballistic weaponry is lifted. Restrictions should have been put in \nplace limiting how Iran could use its new resources.\n  Using the proponents' overall standard, not whether the agreement is \nideal or whether it is better to have it or not have it, it seems to \nme, when it comes to the nuclear aspects of the agreement, within 10 \nyears we might be slightly better off with it. However, when it comes \nto nuclear aspects after 10 years and nonnuclear aspects, we would be \nbetter off without it.\n  Ultimately, in my view, whether one opposes or supports the \nresolution of disapproval depends on how one thinks Iran will behave \nunder this agreement--whether contact with the West and a decrease in \neconomic and political isolation will soften Iran's hardline positions \nor whether the current autocratic regime views this deal as a way to \nget relief from onerous sanctions while still retaining their designs \non nuclear arms and regional hegemony.\n  No one has a crystal ball. No one can tell with certainty which way \nIran will go. It is true, Iran has a large number of people who want \ntheir government to decrease its isolation from the world and focus on \neconomic advancement at\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\nhome, but this desire has been evident for 35 years. Yet Iranian \nleaders have held a tight and undiminished grip on Iran with little \nthreat.\n  Who is to say that this same dictatorship will not prevail for \nanother 10, 20 or 30 years? To me, the very real risk that Iran will \nnot moderate and will instead use the agreement to pursue its nefarious \ngoals is too great; therefore, I will vote to disapprove the agreement, \nnot because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to \nchallenge the path of diplomacy, it is because it is far too likely \nthat Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to \nachieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately \nretaining nuclear and nonnuclear power. It is better to keep U.S. \nsanctions in place, strengthen them, enforce the secondary sanctions on \nother nations, and pursue the hard, trident path of diplomacy once \nmore, difficult as it may be.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe the vote to disapprove is the \nright one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I thank the Democratic whip for yielding \ntime to me and for his extraordinary leadership on this issue and tell \nhim how proud I am of him and my other colleagues, no matter where we \ncome down on this issue.\n  I have a little bit of a different approach to the serious matter \nthat is before us. During the first week or two of the August recess, I \ndid something that I suspect none of my colleagues did; I actually read \nthe Iran deal and a lot of the materials that relate to the agreement. \nAfter putting it down, my mind wandered back to another time and place \nwhere there was an intense effort to end years of hostility and \nmistrust in the Middle East.\n  As Governor of Delaware and chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation, I led a trade delegation in 1999 of business leaders, \ngovernment officials, and citizens mostly from Delaware, many of them \nJewish, and we went to Israel in the summer of 1999. We went looking to \nstrengthen economic and cultural relations between Delaware and Israel.\n  Briefed by U.S. Department of State officials before departing on our \nmission, I also went looking for an opportunity to encourage Israeli \nand Palestinian leaders to seize the day and change the leadership in \nIsrael in order to try and negotiate the two-state solution that always \nseemed just out of reach.\n  Those opportunities came sooner than I ever expected. Shortly after \nwe landed there, we were whisked off in Israel to a sprawling outdoor \nFourth of July celebration that was hosted by the U.S. Ambassador to \nIsrael. Among the guests there that day were former General Ehud Barak, \nwho was about to become Prime Minister of the country, and Bibi \nNetanyahu, the man he defeated. The other guests included the widow and \ndaughter of the late Yitzhak Rabin, Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, \nformer Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, General Ariel Sharon, and a \nremarkable assemblage of who's who in Israel.\n  I spoke briefly that day with Ehud Barak and at length with him \nseveral days in his office after he had officially assumed his new \nduties as Prime Minister. The second conversation focused on the \nnegotiations which lay ahead with Yasser Arafat, shepherded by the \nClinton administration, to try to reach a land-for-peace deal once and \nfor all with the Palestinians.\n  Ironically, a few days later, our delegation was invited to Ramallah \nto join Arafat and members of his leadership team for an extended \nlunch. Over that meal, I sat with Arafat and I shared with him the new \nPrime Minister's earnest desire to complete the work begun by former \nPrime Minister Rabin before his assassination. I urged Arafat to set \naside generations of conflict and distrust in an effort to find common \nground with the Israelis that would ultimately provide greater security \nfor Israel and better relations with its neighbors in return for \nPalestinian statehood. The conversation seemed to go well. A few days \nlater back in the States, I shared as much with the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The negotiations that ensued over the course of the next year \nultimately presented Arafat with the best land-for-peace proposal the \nPalestinians would ever receive. In the end, they turned it down. \nDennis Ross, who played a key role in the negotiations for the \nadministration, would later tell me that ``Arafat simply could not take \nyes for an answer.''\n  Sixteen years have passed since then. Another transformative \nopportunity has presented itself, and this time to America and to our \nfive negotiating partners--the British, the French, the Germans, the \nRussians, and the Chinese as well as the people of Iran. We have a \nchance to ensure that the Iranian hopes of developing a nuclear weapon \nare put on the shelf for years--maybe forever.\n  The Iranians have a chance to bring to an end the crippling economic \nsanctions that the coalition we lead has imposed on Iran for years, and \nthe Iranians have another opportunity; that is, to shed their status as \na pariah among the nations of this world and assume a position worthy \nof their history and their culture.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have had countless meetings with people from \nDelaware and beyond our borders who fall on both sides of this issue. \nSome are vehemently opposed to any deal with Iran and others believe we \nabsolutely must have a deal in order to avoid a war.\n  I came to support this agreement only after considering all of these \npoints of view, reviewing the text of the deal again and again, \nhundreds of additional pages of supporting documents, and taking in \ndozens of briefings from experts on Iran and nuclear proliferation.\n  Two years of negotiations have produced an agreement that Israeli \nPrime Minister Netanyahu and most of our Republican colleagues \ndenounced almost as soon as the ink was dry on it and well before they \never read it. They said America should reject the deal and negotiate a \nbetter one. Well, to that I think you say: Good luck.\n  Last month, along with a number of my colleagues, I met here in \nWashington with ambassadors and representatives of the five nations \nthat were our negotiating partners. To a person they argued--\npersuasively I thought--that this is a deal we should not reject. In \neffect, they urged us to learn from Arafat's mistake and this time take \nyes for an answer.\n  They are not the only ones who believe we should support this deal. \nThere are dozens of former Israeli national security and military \nofficials, including retired Israeli Navy Admiral Ami Ayalon. He is \npictured here. He was effectively the CNO of the Israeli Navy--the \nperson in charge of the Navy in the last decade. I am an old Navy guy. \nI am a retired Navy captain. I spent 23 years in the Navy. I was \ninterested in what he had to say when he came to my State.\n  Here is what he said, among other things: ``The Iran deal is the best \npossible alternative from Israel's point of view given the other \navailable alternatives.''\n  Now, look, he is one significant Israeli leader who believes this is \nthe right thing for Israel. As it turns out, there are dozens, and \nactually scores, of former Israeli military leaders and intelligence \nleaders who agree with him--not all but a lot, and we should listen to \ntheir voices. I have certainly listened to him.\n  To those who think there are dangerous people in Iran who want this \ndeal so they can exploit it, I remind them that the Revolutionary Guard \nis vehemently opposed to this deal. A lot of people I have talked to in \nDelaware in recent weeks think that, well, the Revolutionary Guard, the \nbad guys and hardliners in Iran, if you will, are for it. As it turns \nout, they are not for it. It is quite the opposite.\n  Here is a photograph of Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander \nof Iran's Revolutionary Guard. He said: ``We'll never accept it.'' That \nis not exactly a voice of endorsement for this agreement. I think this \nis all the more reason we should vigorously enforce this agreement \nthrough the intrusive inspections regime it mandates for the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to make for years to come, in order \nto ensure that the Iranians comply with every element required of them \nby this deal.\n  This deal blocks four pathways to a bomb. I will mention what they \nare:\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\nfirst of all, the uranium facility in Natanz, blocked; the uranium \nfacility at Fordow, blocked; weapons-grade plutonium, blocked; covert \nattempts to make a bomb, blocked; intrusive and uncomfortable \ninspections; sanctions relief only after Iran meets its obligations. If \nthey cheat, the harsh economic sanctions snap back. Who can snap them \nback like that? We can, the United States, and any of our negotiating \npartners as well. We don't need their concurrence. We can do it alone.\n  Iran currently has 10,000 kilograms of enriched uranium and nearly \n20,000 centrifuges, that puts them 2 or 3 months away with a nuclear \nbomb. Without a deal, it stays that way. With a deal, however, that \nenriched uranium stockpile must shrink to 300 kilograms and Iran must \ncut their number of centrifuges by two-thirds. And the ones they end up \nwith are not the advanced centrifuges, they are actually the most \nelementary centrifuges. That change blocks their pathway to a bomb, \nkeeping them at least 1 year away for the next 15 years or maybe \nlonger.\n  Our negotiating partners also made the following critical points \nrepeatedly. If at the end of the day the agreement is implemented and \nthe Iranians violate its provisions later on, we will know it. We will \nknow it by virtue of our own intelligence, the intelligence of our \npartner nations, and the intelligence of the Israelis as well. If it \nbecomes apparent that the Iranians have cheated, any of the six of our \nnations can mandate the reimposition of an international economic \nsanctions regime against Iran, the same crippling sanctions that \nbrought them to the table 2 years ago and to this hard-fought agreement \ntoday.\n  Madam President, 35 years ago, the United States imposed sanctions \nagainst Iran that were largely unilateral. It was just us. Then we \nbegan ratcheting it up over time.\n\n  Unilateral sanctions by the United States were clearly a nuisance to \nIran, but they did not bring Iran to the table. Only sustained, \nmultilateral sanctions, joined in by our five negotiating partners and \nothers around the world, succeeded in bringing Iran to the table in a \nmood to talk. In fact, under the agreement that has been negotiated, if \nnecessary, they could be set up by the United States in their entirety \nat our request--our request--if we are convinced the Iranians are \ncheating. This agreement guarantees that if they are ever needed again, \nany of the six of us could pull the trigger and reimpose them. \nConversely, if the United States rejects this agreement, we not only \nlose the ability to know that the Iranians are pursuing the development \nof a nuclear weapons capability, we will also lose the support of the \nrest of the world in reimposing sanctions in the event that a future \ngovernment in Iran elects to pursue a nuclear weapons program. I don't \nknow about my colleagues, but that makes no sense to me--no sense. It \nalso makes no sense to our negotiating partners.\n  Almost every American who was alive on 9/11, which we will \ncommemorate tomorrow, remembers the horrifying images of that tragedy. \nTo make matters worse, we had to endure the spectacle throughout the \nday and night of tens of thousands of Arabs across the world taking to \nthe streets to celebrate the death of thousands of Americans. Lost \namong those images, however, was a remarkably different gathering that \ntook place in another nation. It took place in, of all places, Tehran, \nthe capital of Iran. There that night, thousands of Iranians came \ntogether in a candlelight vigil in solidarity with the United States. \nMost Americans have no idea that ever happened. I have never forgotten \nit.\n  A half-dozen years later in New York City, I would meet an Iranian \nleader named Javad Zarif, living there with his family. He was the \nIranian ambassador to the U.N. We didn't have relations with them and \nwe still don't. But the Iranians have for some time had an ambassador \nthere to the U.N. and he lives in New York City.\n  Zarif was educated, it turns out, at San Francisco State University \nand the University of Denver. I remember thinking when I met him that \nhe spoke flawless English--better than I--and he knew more about \nAmericans than most Americans. I think his kids were educated here as \nwell.\n  Impressed, later on, after I came back to Washington, DC, I spoke to \nhim and I said: Why don't you come to Washington and meet some of our \ncolleagues to give them a chance to get to know you and to have a \ndialogue.\n  He said: The George W. Bush administration won't let me come. They \nwon't let me leave New York City.\n  So I said: Well, that is easy to fix, and I met with the Bush \nadministration. Well, it wasn't easy to fix, and they wouldn't relax \ntheir travel ban.\n  So I later would ask Zarif in a conversation we had--this is when \nAhmadinejad was the President of Iran, saying the holocaust was a \nfigment of the imagination and the leaders of Israel should be blown \noff the face of the Earth. I said to Zarif: How do you get along with \nyour President Ahmadinejad, and his response was: Not good.\n  He said: Ahmadinejad doesn't trust me. I am not going to be here much \nlonger.\n  And he was right. The next time I reached out to him, he was gone. He \nwas gone, seemingly without a trace. I found out years later he had \nbeen recalled to Iran and had returned to private life writing, \nlecturing, and largely staying out of sight.\n  As Ahmadinejad's second and final term began to wind down, a campaign \nto determine who would replace him ensued. A reformer named Rohani put \nhis hat in the ring. Most people had never heard of him, at least not \nhere. And most people in Iran said he would never have a chance to even \nget elected or run. Well, he got to run, and not only did he get to \nrun, he won more votes than the other five candidates combined. In the \nend, he did serve.\n  Later on, the question was what kind of cabinet would he put together \nto surround himself as the leader of Iran. And what he did--we were \nwatching to see who would be minister of this or that over there. So \nwhen Rohani submitted the names of the Iranian parliament, his \nsubmission for Foreign Minister was my friend, Zarif. You could have \nknocked me over with a feather. I never saw it coming, never imagined \nit would come. The man who had gone on to lead the Iranians in \nnegotiations with our five negotiating partners over the past 2 years \nis a man I have known for a half a dozen years or more.\n  Our negotiating team has been led superbly by Secretary of State John \nKerry. By his side, however, for much of the past year has been a less \nwell-known Cabinet Secretary, our Energy Secretary Ernie Moniz, who \nwould end up playing a key role among all of the members of a very \ntalented and dedicated team.\n  Dr. Moniz has never sought elected office. I first met him almost a \ndecade ago at MIT where he was a leader and a professor in physics. He \nwas regarded as one of the world's experts on all things nuclear. He \ntestified one day at a field hearing I held at MIT focusing on spent \nfuel rods from nuclear plants. Later, I came back and people said: What \nis he like? And I said: This guy Moniz is a genius. And by God he is.\n  It turns out he is not just a genius; he leads a bunch of these \nnational labs where people who are just as smart as he is know all \nkinds of information, including all things nuclear--more so than any \nother country in the world. As it turns out, they were harnessed to \nhelp us in this negotiation--the national labs--led by Ernie Moniz.\n  As it turned out, ironically, among the graduate students at MIT \nduring Dr. Moniz's distinguished career, there was a young Iranian \nnamed Akbar Salehi. Later Salehi would return to his country and, as \nfate would have it, ultimately become Dr. Moniz's Iranian counterpart \nin the negotiations with the U.S.-led team. As it turns out, Salehi's \nthesis adviser at MIT was one of Ernie Moniz's closest friends at MIT, \nand thus was created maybe not a bond, but a connection, and a shared \ntrust that went back to both Ernie Moniz, a former professor at MIT, \nand a former graduate student, Salehi at MIT.\n  It didn't take long for Secretary Moniz to make a profound impression \nduring the negotiations. Shortly after he joined the team earlier this \nyear, he gave the Iranians what several members of the U.S. team would \nlater describe to me as a tutorial in all things nuclear, making it \nclear that the Iranians had ``more than met their match.'' Adding Ernie \nMoniz to our team was I think a stroke of genius, not only bringing him \nhere, but the national labs as well. In the countless\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\nmeetings he has participated in with House and Senate Members, he has \nbolstered the credibility, probably as much as anybody, of the \nagreement--and the confidence of many in it--in ways that almost no \nother American could do.\n  Much has been made of whether we can trust the Iranians to do what \nthey have committed to do. John Kerry, Ernie Moniz, and the other \nmembers of our team have made clear that the agreement they and our \nfive partners from the other nations have hammered out with Iran is not \nbased on trust. Let me say that again: It is not based on trust. It is \nbased, as we have already heard on this floor, on mistrust. We realize \nthat some future Iranian regime may well ponder whether to violate the \nagreement and launch another pilot program to develop another \nnonpeaceful nuclear capability. If they actually attempt to do that, \nthe key questions are these: Will we know it? Are the consequences for \nIran severe enough to deter them from going forward with it? I am \nconvinced the answer to both those questions is yes.\n  Today, Iran has much more than the hardline Revolutionary Guard whose \ninfluence has begun to wane. Iran today is a nation of 78 million \npeople. Their average age is 25. Most of them were not alive in 1979 \nduring the Iranian revolution. They don't remember the brutal Shah we \npropped up for years and allowed to come to our country when his regime \nfell. This new generation of Iranians is ready to take yes for an \nanswer. I think we should too. This is a good deal for America and our \nallies, and that certainly includes Israel, one of our closest allies. \nI think it beats the likely alternative that there could well be war \nwith Iran, hands down.\n  I will close with this brief conversation. About a year and a half \nago I was up in New York in a house that Senator Durbin had actually \nvisited with me, as well as a couple of others where Zarif used to \nlive. We had the opportunity to talk about the upcoming negotiations. I \nsaid: Zarif, you and Iran have a choice. You can have a strong, vibrant \neconomy for your country again, or you can have a nuclear weapons \nprogram. You cannot have both. And we are not going to accept a nuclear \nweapons program.\n  We have the ability to know if they cheat. If they cheat, we have the \nability to put right back in place these same crippling economic \nsanctions. If that doesn't do the job, we have other alternatives at \nour disposal. Nothing is off the table.\n  Sometimes around here we talk about voting our fears or voting our \nhopes. I am prepared to vote my hopes, for our Nation and the Iranians \nas well. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague, the \nSenator from Delaware. That was a very thoughtful presentation. The \nSenator from Delaware has a personal interest in and has made a \npersonal commitment to this issue. I thank him for his insight.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, earlier this week I announced that I \nwill reluctantly support the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action and \noppose the resolution of disapproval, despite some very serious \nreservations.\n  I did not reach this position easily or quickly. Although there are \nmany positive aspects to this deal, this agreement also has flaws that \nI believe need to be addressed in the months and years ahead.\n  The congressional review period has served a very useful purpose. My \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have raised very important points \nabout this deal as we were briefed by experts and administration \nnegotiators. I commend Senators Cardin and Corker for their bipartisan \nefforts to establish this review and for affirming Congress's role in \nshaping our Nation's foreign policy.\n  After this debate is over, it is my hope that moving forward the \nSenate will forge bipartisan consensus and act with unity of purpose. \nWe must work together and take action against Iran if they fail to live \nup to their obligations under this agreement, and we must work on \nlegislation and multinational and lateral efforts to combat Iran's \nsponsorship of terrorist activities, arms smuggling, and hegemonic \nambitions.\n  We need to look no further than the humanitarian crisis emanating \nfrom Syria to see the havoc and chaos that Iran and its proxies are \nwreaking on an already troubled region.\n  We need to provide robust oversight and work together to stem the \nproliferation of nuclear material, especially from nascent nuclear \nstates and from Iran in particular. Nearly 20 countries produce safe \nnuclear power without domestic enrichment. America's longstanding \npolicy is that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty does not provide \nthe right to enrich uranium.\n  While in the short term this agreement helps reduce Iran's capacity \nto enrich and eliminates the vast majority of their Iranian stockpile, \nI am concerned that in the long term other nations will view this \nagreement as a precedent that will lead to increased proliferation of \nnuclear enrichment and the potential for other nations to emerge as \nthreshold nuclear states.\n  Just a few years ago, the United States signed and ratified a 123 \nAgreement with the United Arab Emirates that would help them build \nnuclear power capabilities while explicitly preventing them from \nenriching uranium on their soil.\n  The United States must take a leadership role in setting a threshold \nof acceptable levels of enrichment of uranium for the safe production \nof nuclear energy. As more nations look to meet growing energy needs \nwhile minimizing carbon output, a comprehensive policy to ensure only \nsafe levels of uranium enrichment with strong international safeguards \nis critical to global security.\n  No nation faces a more severe threat than Iran's nuclear ambitions \nthan the State of Israel. For decades, the Iranian regime has made it \ntheir mandate to eliminate the Jewish State. We must be united in \nensuring that this never happens. We must always be ready to act to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and smuggling arms to its \nproxies in the region.\n  As the Middle East falls deeper into chaos, our alliance with Israel, \na nation that shares so many of our values, has never been more \nimportant. America must reaffirm our longstanding commitment to \nIsrael's security by renewing our memorandum of understanding, \nproviding Israel with defense capabilities in order to cement its \nqualitative military edge in the region, and bolstering Israel's \nability to initiate deterrence against Iran.\n  The JCPOA is not the end of our multilateral efforts against Iran and \nits illicit behavior. America must work with our allies to initiate \nmultilateral sanctions against Iran for its terrorist activities, \nespecially its funding of Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  We also need to set clear understandings of how Iran will be \nsanctioned for minor violations of this agreement that will not \ninitiate the snapback of full sanctions. We must continue working in a \ncoordinated fashion to ensure unity in purpose against Iran's nuclear \nambitions, terrorist activities, and efforts to destabilize the region. \nWe must also continue pressing for the release of all U.S. hostages \ncurrently imprisoned in Iran, including Amir Hekmati. Congress must \naddress these issues.\n  In 2009 Congress debated whether to pursue sanctions or diplomacy \nwith Iran first, with military force always being the last resort but a \nnecessary final deterrent. I was proud to cosponsor the effort to pass \nsanctions in 2009 and help pass additional sanctions in the years \nsince. As a new Member of the Senate, I joined a group of bipartisan \nSenators ready to pass additional sanctions against Iran as they \ncontinued to drag out negotiations. Iran needed to know that the \npatience of the United States was not limitless.\n  The JCPOA is a product of complex negotiations and painstaking \ncompromises. But let's be clear. Either rejecting or accepting this \ndeal comes with a set of distinct risks. However, those who oppose this \ndeal have been accused of supporting war over diplomacy, and those who \nsupport this deal have been likewise portrayed as supporting \ncontainment and capitulation. Foreign policy is rarely so simple, and \nit is certainly not so simple in this case.\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\n  As leaders of this great Nation, we owe it to our citizens and the \nmen and women in uniform to never let ourselves become so fractured by \npartisan politics on issues of such importance to national security. I \nlook forward to working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to \nprotect the interests of our allies and the safety and security of this \ngreat Nation and to ensure that the United States of America remains \nboth united in our goals and indivisible in our purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I want to talk about this arrangement and \nagreement with Iran and cover several points and what I think are \nimportant realities that have not been emphasized in this debate, but \nfirst I would like to address the issue of the 60-vote margin.\n  First, I think it should be on the record that the minority leader \noffered to the majority leader a unanimous consent agreement that there \nwould be no filibuster on the motion to proceed and there would be a \n60-vote threshold required for final passage of the bill. As I \nunderstand it, that offer was rejected. That means the only alternative \nis to go the technical rule of the filibuster in order to require a 60-\nvote margin.\n  It is absolutely clear from the legislative record of the Corker-\nCardin bill that everyone involved in that discussion, including the \nSenator from Tennessee, understood that a 60-vote margin would be \nrequired in the passage of this legislation. There is no question about \nit. There are quotes in the Record. Everyone understood that from the \nbeginning of the consideration of the Corker-Cardin bill.\n  Finally, every major issue that has come before this bill since I \nhave been here has required 60 votes, whether it was immigration or \nbackground checks or extension of unemployment benefits or the minimum \nwage. All of those have required a 60-vote threshold. That has been the \nstandard in this body. We could debate whether that should or should \nnot be the standard, but it is, it has been, and this is not a time to \ndecide we are going to arbitrarily abandon that.\n  I must say I am sort of amazed to hear people discussing this as if \nthis is some kind of new imposition of a rule, and it reminds me of \n``Casablanca\": I am shocked--shocked--to understand that there might be \na 60-vote requirement on this piece of legislation.\n  That has been the standard for this body certainly for as long as I \nhave been here and for some time longer. As I say, we can discuss \nwhether that should be the standard, but that is what it is, and no one \nshould be surprised that is the way we are proceeding here today.\n  OK. Let's talk about the agreement--five quick realities.\n  No. 1, Iran is a nuclear threshold state today. There is a lot of \nargument. I sat through the long debate yesterday afternoon about what \nhappens in 2030, what happens in 15 years, and would Iran be somehow a \nlegitimized nuclear threshold state. They are a nuclear threshold state \ntoday. The risk to the world is imminent. It is not in 15 years; it is \ntoday. That is why this agreement is so important--because basically it \nfreezes and rolls back Iran's nuclear capabilities for at least the \nnext 15 years and probably longer.\n  The No. 2 reality: Iran is a rogue nation. It foments terrorism \naround the world. It is a state sponsor of terrorism. Everyone knows \nthat. Under this agreement, as has been pointed out, because of the \nnature of the negotiations, which were ``roll back your nuclear program \nin exchange for relief from the sanctions,'' they will indeed receive \nrelief from the sanctions, and that will give them additional funds for \ntheir economy and possibly for their nefarious purposes. But I would \nsubmit that the only thing worse than a rogue Iran is a rogue Iran \narmed with nuclear weapons. That is the essence of this deal. It \nprevents their opportunity to gain nuclear weapons, to create \nsufficient fissile material. It rolls back what they already have.\n  I should point out that they became a nuclear threshold state during \nthe imposition of various sanctions regimes. So it is clear that \nsanctions in and of themselves are never going to prevent their \nachievement of becoming a nuclear weapons state.\n  No. 3, this is a multilateral agreement. All the discussion around \nhere acts as if it is the United States and Iran, Obama and the \nAyatollah. It indeed involves the world's major powers. It involves \nGreat Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, and other countries that \nhave helped to enforce those sanctions and make them effective. If we \nwalk away from this deal, we are doing so alone.\n  We had an extraordinary meeting before the recess with Ambassadors \nfrom the P5+1 countries. They made it clear that they had accepted this \nagreement and that if we rejected it, their willingness to go back to \nthe table, reimpose the sanctions, reinforce the sanctions--I believe \none of the Ambassadors used the term ``far-fetched''--it is not going \nto happen.\n  The sanctions are going to erode starting now, no matter what we do \nin this Congress. I can't figure out any way that a weaker sanctions \nregime--which is inevitable because other countries involved in the \nsanctions have already started to make moves toward doing business with \nIran--I don't see how a weaker sanctions regime is ever going to bring \nIran back to the table to get a better deal.\n  Reality No. 4: This agreement is flawed. It is not the agreement I \nwould prefer. There are elements that I think could be improved. I wish \nthe 15 years was 20 or 30 years. I wish the 24 days was 12 days or 8 \ndays or 1 day. But this is the agreement that is before us. And the \nanalysis could not be strictly of the agreement itself and within its \nfour corners, but compared to what? That is really the basic question \nhere--not whether this a good deal or a bad deal. The question is, How \ndoes this deal, no matter what its flaws, compare with the alternatives \nthat are out there? In all of the drama and all of the argument and all \nof the speeches and rallies that we have heard, no one has yet come up \nwith a credible alternative. I have not yet heard a credible \nalternative. The only thing I hear is this: We will reimpose sanctions \nand bring them back to the table and get a better deal. It is going to \nbe very hard to reimpose those sanctions without the support of our \ninternational partners. If we enter into the deal and Iran cheats, then \nwe can bring the international partners back with us, but to do so--to \ntry to think that we could do so now is just unrealistic. I wish there \nwere a better alternative. I also wish I could play tight end for the \nNew England Patriots, but it is not going to happen. It is simply not \nrealistic. There is no credible alternative.\n  Finally, we have to talk about what happens after the deal. Congress \nhas a responsibility. The administration has a responsibility. We \ncannot trust Iran. Everyone knows that. No one argues that.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the IAEA. I serve on the \nIntelligence Committee. We had a briefing just yesterday morning with \nthe heads of our intelligence agencies. It is not just the IAEA that is \ngoing to be watching this agreement, it is the world's intelligence \ncommunity, and we have significant capability to know if they are \ncheating over and above and in addition to anything the IAEA brings to \nthe table. This is not trust; this is verification based upon the \nIAEA's worldwide experience but also based upon the considerable \nintelligence assets of the United States and other countries that are \nsupporting us in this effort.\n  Finally, there are risks. I understand that. There are risks on both \nsides. There are severe risks. This is not an easy call. It is one of \nthe hardest decisions I have ever had to make. But if you analyze the \nalternatives and weigh the risks, I believe the risks of not going \nforward with this agreement are significantly greater than the risks of \ngiving diplomacy a chance going forward with this agreement, which can \nbe verified. If there is cheating, it can be caught, No. 1, and \npunished, No. 2, and if the agreement doesn't work, we have the same \noptions we have today.\n  This is a difficult decision. It is one that has weighed on this body \nand on this country. But I think this is a tremendous opportunity for \nus to avoid a nuclear-armed Iran and secure at least that part of a \npeaceful Middle East and more secure world.\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me thank my colleague from Maine for \nhis thoughtful presentation.\n  I would like to ask how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am going to yield to the Senator from \nOhio. I hope 7 minutes is adequate. If it is not, I would ask unanimous \nconsent to extend that and offer time to the other side or whatever is \nnecessary.\n  I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank you, Madam President, and I thank the assistant \nDemocratic leader.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of the international agreement \ndesigned to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. No one in \nthis body trusts Iran. No one in this body disputes that Iran is the \nleading state sponsor of terrorism, that it denies Israel's right to \nexist, and that it destabilizes the Middle East and violates the human \nrights of its people. That is why we need to prevent a nuclear-armed \nIran, which would pose an exponentially greater danger to the security \nof the United States, to our longtime important ally Israel, and to the \nentire world. This is the only viable option.\n  As Senator King said, no one has answered the question of what \nhappens if we reject this agreement. Well, of the hundreds of calls I \nhave made and the dozens of briefings and discussions I have had with \npeople on both sides of the agreement--from Israeli officials, to \nAmerican security people, to activists, engaged citizens on both sides \nof this--nobody has answered the question: What do we do if this \nagreement is killed in the Congress? What would follow? What is the \nalternative?\n  I am incredibly proud of the diligent work my Democratic colleagues \nhave done over the last 6 weeks in researching, examining, and \nquestioning this deal. There was no knee-jerk reaction on our side \nwhere people all went the same way almost immediately when the \nagreement came out. People on the Democratic side of the aisle listened \nto experts, and they listened to stakeholders. We came to thoughtful, \ninformed decisions.\n  I made my decision after serious study of the agreement's contents, \nafter listening to Ohioans on all sides of this, after consulting with \nnuclear experts, such as the Energy Secretary and Nobel Prize-winning \nphysicist Secretary Moniz. I attended hours of briefings from the \nPresident, from the Energy Secretary, from Treasury Secretary Lew, from \nSecretary of State Kerry, and other administration officials. I \nconsulted U.S. intelligence officials, outside arms control experts, \nand met for over an hour with Israel's Ambassador to the United \nStates. I met with all five of the Ambassadors of the P5+1 countries; \nthose who have been long-time allies of ours from France, England, and \nGermany; those from China, and from Russia, who are allies on this \nissue, if not a number of others. All--every one of them individually, \ncollectively, warned that the United States--it would be the United \nStates which would be isolated internationally if Congress rejects this \nagreement.\n\n  Many of my colleagues talk about Iran's sponsorship of terrorism, its \nhuman rights abuses, and its pursuit of ballistic missiles. These are \nlegitimate concerns, but they are not the focus of this agreement. Of \ncourse we would love to solve those issues. Sanctions on those issues \nwill remain in place, but that was not the focus of this nuclear \nagreement.\n  Let's be clear. When I hear opponents say that Iran 10, 15 years from \nnow would be a threshold nuclear state--maybe they will, maybe they \nwill not. That is certainly debatable. It is not debatable that Iran is \na nuclear threshold state right now. They are 2 to 3 months away from \nbeing able to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. That is a \nfact. They are 2 to 3 months away from being able to produce enough \nfissile material for a nuclear weapon.\n  The agreement provides for comprehensive restrictions today--\nbeginning when Congress allows this agreement to move forward, to block \nIran's pathway to a bomb. They include reducing Iran's installed \ncentrifuges by two-thirds for at least 10 years, cutting its stockpile \nof enriched uranium by 98 percent for 15 years, reconfiguring its \nplutonium reactor to render it inoperable and deny Iran a source of \nweapons-grade plutonium.\n  To verify Iran's compliance, the deal requires 24/7 access to all \ndeclared nuclear sites. The United Nations inspectors will say that of \nthe 120 country inspections they have done, this is the most \ncomprehensive and the most intrusive. The deal provides time-certain \naccess to all suspicious sites in Iran. It provides for a permanent \nprohibition on Iran acquiring or developing a nuclear weapon. It \nprovides a permanent ban on nuclear weapons research and a permanent \ninspection regime for their nuclear program.\n  If Iran violates the deal, the agreement gives the United States \nextraordinary power to snap back both U.S. and international sanctions \nwithout fear of veto by other nations. The President made clear that if \n10 or 15 or 20 years from now Iran tries to build a bomb, this \nagreement ensures the United States will have better tools to target \nit. Americans fundamentally don't want another war in the Middle East. \nAmericans strongly prefer a diplomatic solution, which this agreement \nis all about, that ensures that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon.\n  At the beginning of my remarks, I spoke about the serious way, with \ngreat gravitas, that Democratic after Democratic Senator--the serious \nway we pursued coming to a decision on this. Let me contrast for a \nmoment on this, one of the most significant national security issues \nCongress will face in a generation. I have been in the House and Senate \nfor 20 years now. This will be one of the two most important decisions \nI have made on foreign policy. The first was my vote against the war in \nIraq. It was clearly the right vote, even though at the time there was \npublic support for it.\n  We know that the information we were presented was not exactly right \nin the end, even though there was huge support in Congress and a lot of \npublic support for going into war with Iraq. I thought about that a \nlot. I made a decision that I thought the Iraq war would be disastrous \nfor our country. That decision clearly was right. It was not so \npartisan back then, although we had a President that certainly pushed \nus and a Vice President, especially, that pushed us into that war.\n  But this agreement should not be subject to the kind of reflexive \npartisan attacks we have seen in recent months. Just a few months ago, \n47 of my Republican colleagues signed a letter signaling their \nopposition to the emerging deal--not just that, they signed a letter to \nthe Ayatollah--to the leader of the enemy, Iran--suggesting that the \ndeal was not quite on the up-and-up because of the President of the \nUnited States. They signed a letter that was teaching the Ayatollah, if \nyou will, some American civic lessons. Imagine, if Democrats in the \nSenate in the early 1980s had written a letter to President Gorbachev \nsaying: Don't negotiate with Ronald Reagan. Imagine if we had done \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Imagine if that had happened. So we start off with 47 \nRepublicans writing to the Ayatollah, saying, fundamentally: Don't \nnegotiate with President Obama. We have seen now not a single one of my \ncolleagues is in support of this agreement, even though Secretary \nPowell supports it, even though former Senator Lugar, who was as \nrespected as anybody in this country as a former Republican Senator, \nsupports it. It is not just disappointing that not a single one of my \nRepublican colleagues supports this, but the first day the agreement \ncame out, I heard talk radio saying: Read the agreement. Read the bill. \nThe first day this agreement came out, 19 Republicans--on that first \nday--came out in opposition to this agreement. There is no way they \ncould have read it. I know how complicated this agreement is. I have \nread it. I assume that every one of my Democratic colleagues, in an \narduous, focused, difficult, persistent way, studied this issue. Then I \nsee what happened on the other side of the aisle\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\nwhen it was--as Timothy Crouse said the press does in the ``Boys on the \nBus--`` if one of them flies off the telephone wire, they all fly off \nthe telephone wire.\n  That is what happened. I was just so disappointed. Senator Corker is \nhere, one of the people who did not sign that letter and one of the \npeople who thought about this issue. But what I saw in the contrast of \nthe way we looked at this, it was pretty disturbing.\n  I will conclude. My time is running out. This agreement will matter \nfor our country. It is clearly in our national interests. I think there \nhas been no good answer offered on what happens if we walk away. That \nis why I ask my colleagues to vote no on the next vote coming in front \nof us.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator for his \ncomments. Just so we know how we are organized on this side for the \nnext hour--and I think we are about evened up on the time, maybe 3 \nminutes more needs to come our way but roughly even. For the next 30 \nminutes, we have Senator Coats, one of our outstanding foreign policy, \nnational security Senators, who served as an ambassador; 15 minutes for \nSenator Grassley; and 15 minutes for Senator Roberts.\n  I thank you so much for being here and your incredibly responsible \nway of facing this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator Corker for \nhis diligent efforts, as it consumed literally hundreds, if not \nthousands, of hours as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in helping guide us through this very important, very \ndifficult process.\n  I was on this floor earlier saying this is an issue that rises above \npartisan politics. This is something that each of us as a Senator has \nto weigh carefully. I don't know how many hours and how much time I \nhave spent reading through, parsing through, trying to analyze and \nunderstand this agreement, its side annexes and everything connected \nwith it. I would like to now say to my colleagues, perhaps with an \nappeal that they at least, at the very least, set aside: The deal is \ndone. You lost. Therefore, we are not even going to allow a vote on \nthis matter.\n  This is one of the most historic, consequential measures that anyone \nin this Chamber will ever be confronted with. I know for me it is one \nof the most historic because of the consequences that may occur if we \ndon't get this right. It is important that we debate this, have ample \ntime to go through every bit of this, and have each Member weigh \ncarefully what we hear from each other and what we come to understand \non the basis of our own personal examination. I hope that will be the \ncase. To deny us the opportunity to even let our yes be yes or our no \nbe no before the public I think would be a tragic mistake.\n  I would like to go back a little bit and talk about my history with \nall of this. When I returned from my ambassadorship to Germany and \nactually had to deal with this as one of many different issues--because \neven back then there was great concern among both the United States and \nthe German Government over Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons \ncapability. I engaged in a number of discussions and diplomatic efforts \nthere in working with our allied country Germany on this issue. But \nwhen I did come back, I suppose partly because of my engagement there, \nI was asked by the Bipartisan Policy Center that had just been formed \nto chair a task force on this very issue, the Iranian pursuit of \nnuclear weapons.\n  We obviously wanted this to be bipartisan, so I recruited my fellow \nSenate colleague Chuck Robb, then a retired Senator from Virginia. \nTogether we cochaired that effort. Later we were joined by retired 4-\nstar General and Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe Chuck Wall. \nWe put together a who's who of experts on the Middle East and experts \non nuclear capabilities. We had renowned experts from across the \nspectrum come and present to us.\n  All of that resulted in three major reports titled: ``Meeting the \nChallenge, U.S. Policy Towards Iranian Nuclear Development''; the \nsecond one, ``Meeting the Challenge, Time is Running Out''; the third, \n``Meeting the Challenge When Time Runs Out.''\n  There is a treasure trove of information here about how Iran has \nviolated U.N. treaty resolutions, violated the nonproliferation treaty \nagreement. We have talked about the consequences of all of this and \nmade recommendations to the administration, whatever administration \nthat would be. As it turns out, these recommendations went both to a \nRepublican administration under President George W. Bush and to the \nObama administration under our current President.\n  Clearly, we have outlined--and in the interest of time I will not be \nable to go back through all of this. But let me just state a couple of \nthe conclusions here relative to all of this. Absent necessary \nleverage, we believe it unlikely that Supreme Leader Khamenei will \nreciprocate President Obama's conciliatory gestures in a meaningful \nway.\n  First of all, we endorsed diplomacy to its ultimate, but we \nrecognized that diplomacy has its limits. You can sit at a table and \nnot come to agreement for decades. We had been trying diplomatic \nefforts with Iran and they were not succeeding. So then we talked about \nthe necessity of having sanctions, ever-ratcheting, tightening \nsanctions, to bring Iran to the table. Included in that was the threat \nof the use of force if all else failed.\n  None on that committee were warmongers. We wanted to do everything \npossible to prevent conflict in this in solving this problem. So we \nlaid out a long framework. Perhaps if this continues into next week, I \nwill be able to go through some of this framework, but the key on this \nis stated here somewhere. The key to this was that you had to have a \ncombination of tough diplomacy, which we had years of, and we were \ngoing to continue that, backed up by ever-ratcheting sanctions, to show \nIran that there was a price to pay for not coming to agreement, and \nthen backed up ultimately by the threat of force if we could not secure \nan agreement, which would reach the goal.\n  The goal was to prevent Iran from having nuclear weapon capability, \nknowing the destabilization that would take place in the Middle East, \nthe historic impact this would have, and consequences this would have \nif we allowed that to happen.\n  Let me move on to what I believe are major problems with this deal. \nWe know Iran's misbehavior, its violation of six U.N. treaties that it \nagreed to, its violation of the nonproliferation treaty, its support \nfor terrorism. It is a bad actor, perhaps the world's worst bad actor, \nengaging in weaponization that killed American troops. We are dealing \nwith a rogue nation here.\n  I don't know how my colleagues react to this, but when they cut a \ndeal with the United States, they are cheering on the streets of \nTehran. And the Supreme Leader came out yesterday and basically said: \nWell, don't worry, Israel won't be around in the next 25 years. They \nwill be wiped off the map. We have already said ``Death to Israel'' and \nalso ``Death to the Great Satan, the United States.'' This is the party \nthat we just negotiated an agreement with.\n  Now, if we had negotiated an agreement that achieved our goals, I \nwould say good for us. Finally, the sanctions worked. We came up with a \ngood agreement. But I have read through this document and parsed over \nevery word, tried to find every meaning. I serve on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and earlier I served on the Armed Services \nCommittee. I have had more than a decade of experience in this.\n  I spent almost the entire weekend carefully reading this, hoping that \nwe had achieved, if not all, at least some of the most important goals \nwe had.\n  But to my dismay, we ended up not achieving any of those goals. The \ngoal was to prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons capability that \ncould break out and totally destabilize the Middle East. What we have \ncome up with is an agreement that puts them on a path to do exactly \nthat, justified now by this agreement, justified by the Security \nCouncil at the U.N.\n  I said there were two major things that needed to be talked about \nbefore we talk about some of the specifics: First is the false claim \nthat we must choose between accepting this failed agreement or war, and \nthe second is\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\nthat the agreement prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  This is the sales pitch from the White House. This is the sales pitch \nthat is being made to the American people, and neither of these is \ntrue.\n  It has to be a desperate administration that has chosen to force this \nagreement on us by arguing that it is a choice between this deal and \nwar. I am disgusted by the administration's sales strategy for this \nagreement and those who are led down the path of belief that the only \noption here is war, and therefore, no matter what we gave away, this \ndeal is better than the alternative.\n  This false choice is among the most infamous, cynical, and blatantly \nfalse manipulations the Obama administration has used to distort this \nimportant debate, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves for using \nthis tactic.\n  In fact, the false argument masks a far more valid argument that this \ndeal makes future war far more likely, not less. By abandoning the tool \nof economic sanctions, in giving away a strong, principled negotiating \nposition, the administration's desperate tactic is reducing our options \nwhen Iran does go nuclear, as we have put them on the path to do.\n  President Obama and Secretary Kerry have repeatedly said over the \npast year: No deal is better than a bad deal. They never argued that \nany deal is better than no deal, yet that is what they ended up \nconceding.\n  We had the strength of the six most powerful countries in the world--\nthe United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, China, and Russia--\nsitting at one side of the negotiating table. On the other side of the \nnegotiating table was Iran, crippled by sanctions and oil falling into \nthe range of $40 a barrel, costing more to extract and sell than they \ncould get back. They were desperate to achieve some kind of relief from \nthese sanctions.\n  We had the negotiating leverage. We gave away that leverage in these \nnegotiations, desperate to conclude any deal whatsoever so that we \ncould avoid making some difficult decisions down the line in terms of \nwhat we had said we must do.\n  Four Presidents--including this President, two Democrats, two \nRepublicans--said it is unacceptable for Iran to achieve nuclear \ncapability. We gave that away just to get them at the table. Just to \nget them at the table, we took off the use of any force, any leverage \nor additional sanctions or continuing sanctions in order to get to the \ntable--not negotiating to get what we needed, but just to get to the \ntable.\n  The administration has accepted, in my opinion, a deeply flawed deal \nand then set it in motion with a U.N. Security Council resolution on \nthe next day, well before Congress could even respond to it.\n  Thank goodness Senator Corker and Senator Cardin were able to \nconvince their colleagues on a 98-to-1 vote to give Congress the right \nto have a say in this issue. Had that not happened, the President, by \nnot declaring this a treaty, by declaring this simply an executive \nagreement, the President would have locked this thing in even before we \nhad a chance to read it, before the American people even had a chance \nto know what it was except for what the President told them it was or \nthe Secretary of State told them that it was.\n  So we are having this debate thanks to these two men, these two \nleaders--one a Republican and one a Democrat--who had the courage to \nstand up to this President and say: No, the American people deserve to \nhave a say.\n  And, boy, what a say it is. I don't know about others. My mail is \nrunning 10 to 1 against this. Maybe I am talking to the wrong people, I \ndon't know, but the more they learn about this agreement, the more they \nsay: Are you crazy? We gave up that? For what? What did we get back?\n  I want to go over some of that, trying to move through this because I \nknow time is of the essence here, but this idea that war is the only \nalternative--and then the sales pitch that I have heard so many of my \ncolleagues and others who support the deal say: You know, I am for this \nbecause this prevents Iran from having a nuclear bomb. It is just the \nopposite. It gives Iran the pathway to have a nuclear bomb. This has a \nsunset clause in it, and it releases all the sanctions. It has a sunset \nclause that says after 15 years they can do whatever they want to do. \nWe cannot reimpose sanctions. What kind of a deal is that? But the \nfalse narrative that this will not allow that--the agreement, even the \nannexes say we have to help Iran achieve nuclear research, nuclear \nresearch that can help them move toward this.\n  I looked at the annex and said: Surely, I am reading this wrong. We \nare committed to help them? And if other nations, say Israel, want to \ntake action against this because they think they are going to be \nextinguished from the face of the Earth--as the Iranians have told them \nthat is going to happen--if they want to take action, we actually are \nrequired to convince the Israelis not to do that. We side with the \nIranians.\n  I mean, you can't write this script. This is beyond comprehension. So \nthose two false narratives alone ought to be reason to say: Wait a \nminute. Let's not go forward with this deal. Surely we can find a way \nto negotiate a better deal for us.\n  Our Bipartisan Policy Center committee--I want to read from this \nbecause we looked into this very question, and this was the conclusion: \nEven if Iran were to honor all of its obligations and fully comply with \nall the restrictions in the agreement--JCPOA--the deal would not \nprevent a nuclear Iran indefinitely. Starting in year 13, Iran will be \nable to break out, produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon \nin about 10 weeks, down from 1 year. In year 16 Iran would obtain \nnuclear weapons capabilities in a breakout time of less than 3 weeks.\n  That was the conclusion--not of Republicans--that was the conclusion \nof a bipartisan group of experts, chaired by a Republican and a \nDemocratic former Senator at the time.\n  And what we have said actually has come true. The sunset clause \nshould, by itself, be enough to persuade, hopefully, a majority of us \nto reject this deal. This doesn't make sense.\n  If President Bush in 2001 had presented to the American people this \nsame deal with Iran and secured the votes to pass this deal, today Iran \nwould be having breakout--unrestricted breakout, assisted by the \nagreement. And we are going to call that a diplomatic victory?\n  Fifteen years is going to go by very fast. They are going to have \nbreakout capability much earlier than that and could easily--if you \nread the agreement--easily declare that we have breached the agreement, \nthey are pulling back, and therefore they are going forward. And they \nwill have well over $100 billion to achieve that effort. They will have \nsanctions relief--total sanctions relief. They will be able to export \nall of the oil that they want, and Iran wins.\n  There are some particular problems with this, and they have been \nlisted by people on the right, Charles Krauthammer, and on the left or \nat least in the middle, David Brooks. The New York Times is not exactly \na Republican rag, and David Brooks is not necessarily far rightwing. \nThey are basically saying: Every single major goal that we had going \ninto this agreement has been given away in a desperate attempt to \nachieve any agreement so that we don't have to deal with this. What we \nhave to deal with can be pushed down the road.\n  So on that basis I went through the agreement and looked at some of \nthese areas. I would like to identify for the record those that we had \nthe leverage to achieve--a goal, a stated goal by the administration \nand by others negotiating to achieve--and we caved on every one of \nthem.\n  First, verification inspections. Most people understand that anytime, \nanywhere means anytime, anywhere. Actually, now it means--well, a \nminimum of 24 days if Iran agrees with us initially that we should go \nthrough this convoluted process where Iran helps make the decisions. It \nis like giving Tom Brady and the Patriots the right to determine \nwhether or not the footballs were deflated. I am from Indiana, it is \nthe Colts, and they whipped us in the Super Bowl. I am probably biased \nin that statement.\n  On the other hand, just to simplify it for people, if you have an \nadversary that you don't trust and you want to have an ability to find \nout if whether or not what they do and say is true, you don't say: Go \nahead, check it yourself, then tell me what you think, and\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\nwe will take that for an answer. So, talk about caving anytime, \nanywhere on inspections.\n  The administration also argued this principle of short notice. \nSecretary Kerry, when asked this at one of our meetings here, basically \nsaid: No, we never pursued such a goal; and, indeed, we never heard of \nit.\n  I, along with every one of us here was relieved when the \nadministration announced--I don't know if it was Secretary Kerry or one \nof his team supporters--announced inspections anytime, anywhere, and \neverybody said: Oh, OK, at least we have that.\n  Now we learn no American can be part of the inspection team. Now we \nlearn that a U.N. independent agency will do inspections, and now we \nhave learned that military and former weapon manufacturing and research \nfacilities are off limits, and we are not even allowed to inspect them.\n  So anywhere, anytime has become a farce. How can you possibly--that \nin and of itself would be reason not to vote for this agreement. How go \ndo you go home and say to people: Anytime, anywhere is a scrubbed \nversion of 24 hours a day at a minimum as long as Iran agrees.\n  It doesn't take somebody with a Ph.D. or a law degree--or even a \nSenator or a Congressman who has delved into these issues--for people \nto say, are you nuts? Who would sign a deal like that?\n  Uranium enrichment--we caved there. Then talk about one of the key \nweaknesses is the agreement that the centrifuges are to be disconnected \nand only stored feet from their original position. They can be \nreintroduced into the enrichment system when the earlier expiration \ndates of the deal occur, whenever the Iranians choose to move quickly \ntoward nuclear capability.\n  This involves some highly technical stuff, but the bottom line is \nalmost all aspects of these enrichment details in dispute are in \ndispute by experts who understand the technical application of all of \nthis, and they are not persuaded by the misleading leadership coming \nout of the administration--once again another cave.\n  Fordow. What is Fordow? Fordow is a facility at which some nuclear \ntechnology pursuit was being undertaken, and we wanted to be able to \nshut that down.\n  But the Iranians said: No, no, I don't think so.\n  So we said: OK, let's cave on that; let's move onto something else.\n  The same applied to military dimensions and undisclosed military \nfacilities. So Secretary Kerry is faced again with Iranian \nintransigence and explained his new position now. He no longer was \nfixated on the past: That was something that we talked about months \nago. I am not fixated on that anymore. So scratch that one off. Don't \nworry. Keep Fordow. Keep Fordow open, no problem. What is next?\n\n  Sanctions relief. This agreement does not generally relieve sanctions \npressure as originally intended. Rather it abandons the sanctions \nregime entirely all at once. Indeed, the multilateral sanctions are now \nalready gone. European nations and others are flocking into Tehran to \nsign long-term agreements that will never be subject to sanctions if \nthey are snapped back. We lost again. So the re-imposition of \nsanctions, if we find out something is wrong here, is a farce. It is \nnot implementable.\n  I talked about snap-back here, so I am going to move forward from \nthat. This is one I mentioned before, but I still can't comprehend it.\n  The deal obligates the P5+1--that is the six of us, the six nations \nthat were negotiating--to actually help Iran build up its nuclear \ninfrastructure during the 15 years before they achieve a 3-week \nbreakout. So we are actually helping them construct their nuclear \ninfrastructure, which then can easily be converted to breaking out for \na nuclear weapon. And in return for altering their timetable for \nnuclear industrial development, the Iranians secured not just \ninternational acceptance of that activity but actual assistance in \npursuing it.\n  That is incredible. We are actually helping Iran get to the bomb? As \nwe hear from some of our colleagues and others who support this \nagreement, they say: I am voting for this because this prevents Iran \nfrom getting the bomb. Read the agreement. It is not easy to read. It \nis not fun to read. But it is alarming to read.\n  I was in the Senate during the 1990s and the negotiations with North \nKorea, and actually, Wendy Sherman, the principal negotiator along with \nSenator Kerry of this agreement, was the principal negotiator in the \nNorth Korea agreement. I remember being told on this floor through the \nPresident of the United States, then President Clinton and his \nSecretary of State and others: Don't worry; we have total verification \nprocedures in place. If they cheat on us, we are going to know it. And \nwhen we know it, we are going to stop it. Well, here it is 2015, and \nNorth Korea has somewhere between 20 and 40 nuclear weapons sitting on \ntop of ballistic missiles, and we didn't know it.\n  That made me a skeptic going into this thing because it is like deja \nvu here. We are being told the same thing: Don't worry; we will know if \nthey cheat. We will be able to do something to stop them.\n  This is the assurance that this is a good deal. So that is a hard \nsale for me. It is a no sale for me. I didn't end up voting for that \nbecause I had some real suspicions about whether that would take place. \nBut that actually ought to be a lesson for all of us here--that \nsomething that is promised by the President of the United States and \nhis Secretary of State and his negotiating team won't necessarily come \ntrue and be the case. So the promises that have been made about what \nthis agreement is and what it isn't and what we will be able to do I \nmeasure by what didn't work out really well in North Korea, and yet the \nsame negotiator that negotiated that helped negotiate on this.\n  I don't know if my colleague from Tennessee is standing because I am \nrunning long on this, but I have a lot more I would like to say. I am \ngoing to try to move to a couple of last things here.\n  Some prominent people have been noted here as favoring the deal. \nWell, I think Henry Kissinger is someone who probably has some \nexperience, at the age of 90-some years and a lifetime in diplomacy. I \ndon't have to give his credentials. And George Shultz also has some \ncredibility on this. So if you want to listen to one side on this, you \nought to listen to the other. These individuals have said:\n\n       Previous thinking on nuclear strategy assumed the existence \n     of stable state actors. . . . How will these doctrines \n     translate into a region where sponsorship of nonstate proxies \n     is common, the state structure is under assault, and death on \n     behalf of jihad is a kind of fulfillment?\n\n  Sadly, their views have been largely ignored and not mentioned by \nanybody else. So if they are going to mention their guys, we are going \nto mention our guys.\n  Look, the last thing I want to say here before I conclude is there \nhasn't been much discussion about the consequences for Israel, our \ndemocratic ally in the region, which I think should be a core issue. \nPrime Minister Netanyahu was here and spoke to a joint assembly of \nCongress. He received standing ovations for standing tall and standing \nhard and saying the very future existence of my nation is at risk here. \nHe made the point that a bad deal is not better than no deal, that a \nbad deal could be worse than no deal, and that there are ways around \nthis.\n  We cannot ignore the major risk that Iran will follow through with \ntheir often-repeated threats of obliterating the State of Israel--a \nthreat that was just repeated by the Supreme Leader yesterday.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank my colleagues.\n  In conclusion, with this agreement, we have paid too much and gained \ntoo little. The risks are not adequately acknowledged and not \neffectively addressed. I cannot support this agreement. I cannot \napprove the misguided desperation that led to it.\n  I cannot understand those who claim this is a great victory for \ndiplomacy nor those who turn a blind eye to its obvious failings \nbecause of the appeal of party discipline nor those who have fallen \nprey to the Obama administration's manipulation of the deal with the \nU.N. prior to Congress having any say in this.\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\n  When I read about the gloating, the boastful joy in Iran--in Tehran, \ntheir capital--that all their needs were met and none of their redlines \nwere crossed, I despaired. I despaired because this misadventure has \nbeen a failure of vision, a failure of will, and a historic failure of \nleadership. I fear these failures will lead to great suffering.\n  We have seen this before. Peace at any price is not peace. Peace at \nany price sometimes leads to tragic consequences. In the last century \nwe saw the loss of tens of millions of lives because the goal was to \nseek peace at any price. We cannot make that mistake again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. Again, Madam President, I thank my colleague very much \nfor his passionate comments and his concern from day one about this \nagreement.\n  I think we ran over a little bit. I know Senator Brown of Ohio ran \nover. If I can ask how much time remains on our side, I think we maybe \ngo to 1:04 p.m., at least, or something like that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-eight minutes for the majority.\n  Mr. CORKER. So I know you all each asked for 15. If we could make it, \ninstead, 14 each, so it is equally divided, Senator Roberts will enjoy \nthat. This will be equally divided between our distinguished Senator \nGrassley and Senator Roberts, and I thank them for letting me intervene \nand thank them both for being here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this is a critically important debate \non a nuclear deal that is going to have long-lasting impacts on our \nnational security and the security of our friends and our allies. This \ndebate is happening because 98 Senators expressed the desire to have a \nsay on this agreement. This process will allow the American people to \nspeak through their elected representatives, and I can say the American \npeople overwhelmingly oppose this agreement. New public opinion polls \nreleased in just the last few days indicate that Americans in general \nare opposed to this deal by a margin of 2 to 1. Only 21 percent support \nit.\n  I participated in meetings with constituents in 25 of Iowa's 99 \ncounties during the August work period. The message I received was \noverwhelmingly in opposition to this agreement. That is the same \nmessage I am hearing from Iowans who have written or called since the \ndeal was announced in July.\n  After many weeks of studying the terms of the Iranian deal, also \nhearing from experts and attending classified briefings, and engaging \nin dialogue with my constituents, my initial skepticism has been \nconfirmed. I have come to the conclusion this agreement presented to us \nis a bad deal that will not increase our national security or the \nsecurity of our friends and allies and should be rejected.\n  The United States began the negotiations from a position of very real \nstrength. The international sanctions were obviously hurting Iran, and \nIran wanted out from under those sanctions. The sanctions regime that \nCongress put in place over the objections of President Obama drove Iran \nto the negotiating table.\n  The administration, leading up to the negotiations and throughout the \nentire process, outlined the conditions for a good deal. President \nObama and Secretary Kerry both made important statements about the \ngoals of the negotiations. The goal was, of course, to dismantle Iran's \nnuclear program. Secretary Kerry himself said in the fall of 2013 that \nIran has ``no right to enrich,'' and that a good deal with Iran would \n``help Iran dismantle its nuclear program.''\n  Despite all these assurances that negotiations would include \n``anytime, anywhere'' inspections, the deal falls real short. President \nObama negotiated away from these positions over the course of these \nnegotiations.\n  This agreement accepts and legitimizes Iran as a nuclear threshold \nstate. Iran will not dismantle many important parts of its uranium \nenrichment infrastructure, contrary to past U.S. policies that Iran not \nbe allowed to enrich.\n  Iran also is permitted to continue a vast research and development \nprogram. Many of the significant limitations expire after 10 short \nyears, leaving Iran an internationally legitimate nuclear program.\n  Iran could fully abide by this deal and be a nuclear threshold state, \ncontrary to what we were promised by this administration and the \ninitial goals that were announced by the President.\n  Now, with respect to inspections, international inspectors will not \nhave anytime, anywhere access. They will have what is termed ``managed \naccess.'' In fact, the deal provides Iran with a 24-day process to \nfurther delay--we know what will happen--and hide prohibited \nactivities. Iran has a track record of cheating, otherwise I couldn't \nsay those things. They have cheated on past agreements. This deal \nallows Iran to stonewall the inspectors for up to 24 days.\n  The agreement also includes side agreements between Iran and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency that we can't review. Even the \nadministration has not seen them. And people in this country expect us \nto read before we vote.\n  Of course, we can read the agreement, but we can't read side \nagreements that the law requires be given to the Congress to read under \nthis special law. So we are going to be voting on things which we \nhaven't seen and which the law says we should see.\n  The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which passed the Senate 98 to \n1, requires the administration to provide to Congress access to all \n``annexes, appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing \nmaterial, documents, and guidance, technical or other understandings \nand any related agreements'' as part of our agreement with the \nPresident. It seems in this case we are being asked to put our faith in \nthe Iranian regime to not cheat, contrary to what we know about them.\n  Iran has not provided details on the past military dimensions of its \nnuclear program even though the U.S. position was, very simply, that \nIran had to come clean about that history before any sanctions relief. \nIt is critical, for a robust verification regime to work, that the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency have a full accounting of Iran's \npast efforts and stockpiles. Yet it appears that Iran will be allowed \nto supervise itself by conducting its own inspections and collect \nsamples from its secretive military facility in Parchin, where much of \nthe military dimensions of its nuclear program had been carried out.\n  I also oppose the last-minute decision to lift the embargo on \nconventional arms and ballistic missiles. GEN Martin Dempsey, Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in July that ``we should under no circumstances \nrelieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and \narms trafficking.''\n  They didn't listen to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So \nunder this agreement, after just 5 years the conventional arms embargo \nwill be lifted. After just 8 years the ballistic missile embargo will \nbe lifted. Iran has long sought the technology to develop \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, which would be a direct threat to \nthe United States and our allies. And Iran's past arms trafficking to \nthe Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist organizations has long \nthreatened the State of Israel and other Middle Eastern allies as well, \nand it of course threatens stability--very much so--in the region.\n  Once Iran has complied with the initial restraints on its nuclear \nprogram, many sanctions will be lifted. This will release somewhere \naround $100 billion of frozen Iranian assets. The lifting of sanctions \nand release of these funds will only exacerbate Iran's support for \nterror and tradition of terror, with Iran having access to tens of \nbillions of frozen assets to bolster its conventional military and \nfurther support global terrorism.\n  Even Obama administration officials have said that Iran is likely to \nuse some of the funds to purchase weapons and fund terrorism that would \nthreaten Americans and Israelis. Now, isn't that something--this \nadministration negotiating an agreement where it is assumed that we are \ngoing to give them further resources to support efforts to kill \nAmericans and Western Europeans.\n  The concept of ``snapping back'' these sanctions is another issue \nthat has been discussed. These sanctions also appear less effective on \nthe issue of snapping back than originally claimed. The complicated \nprocess to reimpose sanctions is unlikely to work\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\neven if Iran fails to comply with the agreement. Iran views snapback \nsanctions as grounds to walk away from the agreement, so any effort to \nreimpose sanctions will be regarded by all parties as to whether or not \nto dissolve the agreement and impose sanctions.\n  I support a robust diplomatic effort that will prevent Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapons capability, but I also strongly disagree \nwith proponents of this agreement who argue that the only alternative \nto this deal is war. That, of course, is a false choice and \nintellectually dishonest.\n  Iran came to the negotiation table because it desperately sought \nsanctions relief. If this deal were rejected, we could impose even \ntougher sanctions, allowing our diplomats to negotiate a better deal \nthat would more adequately safeguard our Nation's security interests \nand that of our allies. A better deal would not legitimize Iran as a \nnuclear threshold state, it would not trade massive sanctions relief \nfor limited temporary constraints, and it would not provide concessions \nthat will trigger a regional nuclear arms race.\n  If we reject this deal, we could push for an international agreement \nthat would truly dismantle Iran's nuclear program and verifiably \nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\n  A better deal would not ignore Iran's past bad behavior. Iran has for \nmany years been the most active state sponsor of terrorism. Iran has an \negregious record of human rights violations and the persecution of \nreligious minorities. It continues to imprison U.S. citizens. At least \n500 U.S. military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan are directly linked to \nIran and its support for anti-American militants.\n  This agreement will free up tens of billions of dollars in frozen \nIranian assets without addressing any of these issues. We know Iran \nwill use some of that money to support terrorist activities throughout \nthe Middle East, and those are extended into the United States and \nWestern Europe. Iran provides support for the brutal Assad regime in \nSyria, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and provides weapons, funding, and \nsupport to Hamas and Hezbollah.\n  This deal appears to be the result of desperation on our side for a \ndeal--any deal--and the Iranians knew that and took advantage of our \nweakness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will put the remainder in the Record.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, he may conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This deal is a result of President Obama's philosophy \nof leading from behind. As a result of this philosophy, we now have \nenemies who don't fear us and friends and allies who don't follow us \nbecause they question our credibility and they question our leadership. \nWe have a more dangerous world because of it.\n  President Obama himself said that it is better to have no deal than a \nbad deal. This deal has far too many shortcomings and will fail to make \nAmerica and our allies safer. It will not prevent Iran from developing \nnuclear weapons, while providing a windfall that will allow them to \nramp up their bad behavior.\n  Obviously I oppose this deal, and I hope we can send a signal to the \nadministration and Iran that we need a deal that improves our national \nsecurity and the security of our friends and allies in the region and \nresponds to the common sense of the American people who, through the \npolls, have shown they know this to be a bad deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, we all come here to make a difference, \nand we have on the floor two Senators who have done just that--Senator \nCorker and his counterpart on the Democrat side, Senator Cardin, who is \na good friend of mine. Both are good friends of mine. History will note \nin salutary terms what both of them have contributed in regard to \nleadership, perseverance, and trying to make a bad situation much \nbetter. I thank them for that.\n  I rise today concerned, disheartened, and fearful about the vote--or, \nto be more accurate, not even having a vote--regarding the issue before \nus that affects our national security and that of others worldwide.\n  We have before us the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an \nExecutive agreement whose original goal was to prevent Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear-armed state. In keeping with our constitutional \nresponsibility and Senate tradition, what we should have before us is a \ntreaty, but we do not. Were the Senate taking up a treaty, we could be \nhaving debate on rational, commonsense, and effective amendments that \nwould protect our country and reduce the flames of turmoil in the \nMiddle East and in Europe, but we are not. We are voting on a \nresolution of disapproval, and we may well end up voting not to vote at \nall--a probability I find inexplicable and outrageous. In the Senate's \n226-year history, it has taken up almost 1,900 treaties and only \nrejected 22, many of which have dealt with subjects of much less \nconsequence.\n  I deeply regret that the administration would not even consider the \nSenate allowing a vote on this crucial foreign policy and national \nsecurity issue as a treaty. During debate on the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act in April, I voted in favor of Senator Johnson's amendment to \ndo just that. We had the opportunity. The Senate failed to seize it.\n  I believe this agreement to be deeply flawed, and our failure to \ntruly debate and fix what is in it represents an abrogation of our \nresponsibilities--this in the face of an agreement or a ``deal'' that \nis already adversely affecting the daily lives and well-being of \nindividuals all around the world. Refugees throughout the Middle East \nrecognize the United States is yielding both power and persuasion to \nIran, and they are fleeing for their lives.\n  As if failure to consider this agreement is not enough, now consider \nthe fact that there are those in this distinguished body who will try \nto block cloture and in doing so prevent even a simple yes-or-no vote \non the resolution. Talk about an upside down, ``Alice in Wonderland'' \nexercise.\n  The Senate has already voted 98 to 2 to have a vote, and yet we stand \nhere today ready to abrogate that vote.\n  So, my colleagues, what are we doing? We are simply debating a flawed \nagreement submitted to us by the President. We are not amending or \nvoting on the agreement at all; we are just debating. The path which we \ntake today--a detour into a box canyon, achieving nothing--has been \nforced upon us by the very same people who made the Senate swallow the \nnuclear option.\n  Where on Earth has the Senate gone? Well, the President has been \nbreaking arms and political legs, urging my colleagues to use Senate \nprocedure and deny Senators the right to vote. It is pretty simple: The \nPresident doesn't want the Senate to vote no on what he considers his \nforeign policy legacy.\n  However, on occasion, the Senate has put partisanship aside and \ndebated issues of deep conviction and diverging opinions. This should \nbe one of those times, but it is not. We should find a path forward \nthat enables bipartisan accord as a legislative body. That path always \nstarts when respect trumps partisanship. I regret that is not today, \nnot this week, not this issue, not this President.\n  Given the fact that we are where we are, I think it is imperative \nthat we fully understand how Iran interprets this agreement. The shoe \nis on the Iranian foot, and judging by the statements of their leaders, \nthey believe it fits just fine.\n  We have heard in detail from Secretary Kerry. We have heard from and \nbeen lectured by the President. But Members should also know what \nIranian President Hasan Ruhani and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei told the \nIranian people after the agreement was finalized. The difference is \nboth pertinent and remarkable. Speaking before his constituency in \nTehran, President Ruhani perfectly articulated where the United States \nbegan these so-called negotiations and where the United States made \nenormous concessions. According to him, we did not negotiate at all, we \nconceded.\n  It is a paradox of enormous irony that in order to know the truth \nabout this agreement--highly praised by this administration and well-\nreceived by a determined minority in this Senate--to learn the \nunfortunate truth about who negotiated and who conceded, we have\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\nto read and understand the remarks of President Ruhani of Iran to get \nthe full picture.\n  President Ruhani stated that in the beginning, the United States \ncapped the number of centrifuges to 100. Today, Iran is allowed over \n6,000. Where original restriction and oversight were set for 20 years, \ntoday it is 8. With regard to research and development, the United \nStates abandoned any limits on developing systems for enriching \nuranium. Instead, Iran is free to develop centrifuges to the highest \nlevel they desire--the IR-8. The administration placed a redline on \nheavy water production at the Iraq facility. Today the reactor will \ncontinue operating and produce heavy water.\n  We said sanctions would be lifted incrementally. Today they are \nvirtually nonexistent. Soon Iran will receive a windfall of \napproximately $100 to $150 billion for whatever use it wishes--read, \nterrorism; read, anti-missile defense systems. Of greatest importance, \nwhat happened to the inspections regime? This administration said \nanytime, anywhere, but Iran walked away holding the key to who, how, \nand when inspectors will get in.\n  It is not so much what we in the United States know or believe. It \nis, rather, what Iran believes, in the words of their President and \nSupreme Leader. Their remarks not only put into absolute focus what the \nIranian Government understands as their responsibility in regard to \nthis agreement, but it also puts into perspective which side demanded \nand which side conceded.\n  The administration will argue President Ruhani's statements are but a \nshow for the Iranian public; that Iran wants to claim they can become a \nstable influence in the Middle East. Sure, tell that to Israel. But the \nquestion remains, are we voting on an agreement or are we voting on \nconcessions? According to President Ruhani, it is the latter.\n  Perhaps the proud boasting of President Ruhani is one thing, but the \nvows of the Ayatollah are quite another. His speech--punctuated by \ncheers of ``Death to America,'' ``Death to Israel''--vowed that \nregardless of the deals' approval, Iran would never stop supporting \ntheir friends in Palestine, Yemen, Syria, Iraq or Lebanon; the exact \nplaces Iran had been found backing terrorist organizations, which led \nto its listing as a State sponsor of terrorism by the State Department. \nBut I have just listed the concessions and vows that Iran's leaders \nhave made public. What about the ones that will never be revealed--the \nagreed-upon arrangements between Iran and the United Nations' \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\n  Today all Senators should be gravely concerned about these \nnegotiations and agreements. Do we have access? No. Do we have \ninformation? No. Do we have transparency? No. Do we know what processes \nwill be allowed? No. Well, actually we do.\n  Under the agreement's dispute resolution mechanisms, this agreement \nsets up a tortured path that does not just involve the much publicized \n24-day waiting period. After 24 days, any dispute would be referred to \na joint commission where there will be a 15-day waiting period. Then \nthe dispute would be referred to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs with \nanother 15-day day waiting period. Finally, the dispute would end up \nbefore an advisory board with--you guessed it--another 15-day waiting \nperiod. All of this, of course, can be delayed if the parties agree on \nan extension for further discussion, which they will.\n  Instead of resolution, we have an unending series of switchbacks to \nget to the top of a mountain which in fact we will never see. ``The \ndefinition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and \nexpecting different results.'' We have tried IAEA inspections with Iran \nbefore, and they failed miserably. It seems nothing short of insane to \nsay that we can trust Iran today.\n  This deal does more than give Iran the power to self-regulate, \nfilibuster, and avoid inspections. It gives Iran the ability to remain \nunaccountable and rogue. This debate is not just about what the \nadministration, this body or the American public thinks of an agreement \nwith Iran, this is also very much about what the Iranians think we have \nand will accept.\n  I worry that we are looking at this so-called agreement through rose-\ncolored glasses, based on hope and the misguided idea that any deal is \nbetter than no deal because the alternative is war. Why do I say \n``rose-colored glasses''? It is because civilized nations do that--\nnations such as America. We naturally want to believe that disaster and \nchaos will not happen but unfortunately they do.\n  Now, 14 years ago tomorrow, while heading into work I heard the news \nof the World Trade Center being attacked. My heart fell and my stomach \nchurned because as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee at \nthat time, I had been repeating over and over again that the oceans no \nlonger protected us and the nature of warfare was dramatically \nchanging.\n  At the time of the attacks, coming up on 395, I could see black smoke \nbillowing from the Pentagon. I knew the Capitol would be next. If it \nwere not for the heroes of flight 93 who made the declaration ``let's \nroll'' a national rolling cry, my instincts would have been right and \nthe Capitol would have been hit. The probability is I would not be \nmaking these remarks today had that happened.\n  Madam President, my colleagues, everybody watching, close your eyes. \nImagine the terrible ramifications had that plane hit the Capitol. \nWhere we sit today would have been rubble. Imagine that happening \ntomorrow.\n  Throughout our history, periods of peace, stability, and prosperity \nhave unfortunately been the aberration, not the norm. As a result, we \nhave learned the hard way, as Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice \nin so many conflicts throughout our history. Around the world, we have \nwitnessed man's inhumanity to man: the Holocaust, Cambodia, Rwanda, and \nnow with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and their savage caliphate \nthreatening almost indiscriminately against all those who do not \nsubscribe to their Sharia law, and especially to our best ally in the \nregion, the State of Israel.\n  My colleagues, despite our best efforts, our hope, our optimism, and \nthe siren song, ``It can't happen,'' I would only remind you that \nhistory tells us that it has happened, and it will happen again unless \nwe have the courage to take off the rose-colored glasses and come to \nthe realization with regard to the consequences of what we are doing \nor, more aptly put, not doing and whom we are dealing with. Today we \nare dealing with a State sponsor of terrorism and they will continue. \nIran will become a nuclear-armed state.\n  As we mark the 14th anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks and \nloss of over 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, I want to make it \nclear that I do not trust Iran, and I will never support concessions \nwhich will allow them to become a nuclear-armed state.\n  It is my hope to vote yes on the resolution of disapproval. As my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Cornyn emphasized yesterday: Every \nSenator here should have----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The majority's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. CORKER. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Every Senator should have the opportunity to vote on \nthis issue, given the irony that Iran's leadership has given that power \nand privilege to its own Parliament. At least give me and others the \nprivilege today, as a Senator, to cast the most important vote of my 35 \nyears in public service.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I understand we have 60 minutes under Democratic control. \nI would ask unanimous consent that up to 7 minutes be available to \nSenator Merkley, up to 7 minutes to Senator Manchin, up to 6 minutes to \nSenator Donnelly, up to 18 minutes to Senator Franken, and up to 5 \nminutes to Senator Hirono, and up to 10 minutes to Senator Markey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the United Sates, our citizens, our \nPresident, and I believe every single Member of Congress stand united \nin our commitment to block Iran from securing a nuclear weapon. The \nquestion we\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\nare debating is the pathway that is best for ensuring that outcome. Is \nthe international agreement negotiated between Iran and the P5+1 \nnations the best strategy for blocking Iran's potential pursuit of a \nnuclear weapon or is there some other route that yields better \nprobability, better outcome? That is the issue we are considering.\n  Over the last month, I have explored the strengths of every argument \nand counterargument. I have met with policy experts, intelligence \nanalysts, advocates, and the Ambassadors of our partner nations. I have \nsought and received the counsel of Oregonians on both sides of this \nissue. Taking all of this into account, this deal is the best available \nstrategy for blocking Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  The plan's strength is that for 15 years it creates an effective \nframework for blocking Iran's three pathways to securing a nuclear \nweapon: the uranium path, the plutonium path, and the covert path. It \nblocks the uranium path by requiring Iran to dismantle two-thirds of \nits centrifuges; more importantly, to reduce its stockpile of enriched \nuranium by 97 percent; and to limit enrichment of uranium to 3.67 \npercent--far below the 90 percent required for a nuclear weapon.\n  It blocks Iran's plutonium pathway by requiring Iran to pull the core \nof its Arak reactor and to fill it with concrete, to build any \nreplacement reactor with a design that will not produce weapons-grade \nplutonium, and to forgo the reprocessing of spent fuel which is \nessential to the plutonium path. The agreement also blocks a covert \npath to a bomb by imposing extensive inspections and monitoring. This \nincludes providing onsite inspections anywhere a violation is \nsuspected. Unprecedented procedures have been put in place to guarantee \nthat Iran cannot indefinitely stall these inspections, including \nsetting a maximum number of days for access and number of days that is \nguaranteed to ensure that we can, with confidence, detect any work with \nradioactive materials. The result--attested to by 75 nonproliferation \nexperts and diplomats in a recent letter--is that it is ``very likely \nthat any future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a \nclandestine program, would be detected promptly.''\n  As many have pointed out on the floor today, the agreement is not \nwithout shortcomings. It has not sustained the current U.N. ban on \nIran's importation of conventional arms. Iran could acquire \nconventional arms up to 5 years and missile technology after 8 years.\n  It does not dictate how Iran can spend the dollars it reclaims from \ncash assets that are frozen. It does not permanently maintain bright \nlines on Iran's nuclear research or nuclear energy program, lifting the \n300-kilogram stockpile limit and 3.77 percent enrichment limit after 15 \nyears. These exclusions are trouble.\n  It is possible, perhaps probable, that Iran will use some of that \nadditional cash and access to conventional arms to increase its support \nfor terrorist groups. It is possible that Iran will use a nuclear \nresearch program and a nuclear energy program as the foundation for a \nfuture nuclear weapons program. That is a substantial concern.\n  For this reason, many have come to this floor and argued the United \nStates, instead of implementing this agreement, should withdraw from it \nand negotiate a better deal. The prospects for that possibility, \nhowever, are slim.\n  Our P5+1 partners--and I have met with all of their Ambassadors to \nexplore this issue--have committed the good faith of their governments \nbehind this agreement. They believe this is the best path, the best \nopportunity to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. They plan to \nhonor the deal they have signed on to with or without the United States \nas long as Iran does as well. Iran has every reason to honor this \nagreement, even if the United States rejects it because agreement \nfulfills Iran's goal of lifting the international sanctions and it sets \nthe stage for valuable trade and investment partnerships.\n  If Iran were to follow this course, it would gain many benefits while \nleaving the United States at odds with the balance of our partners, \nundermining, in a dramatic international fashion, American influence \nwith strategic and security consequences throughout a large spectrum. \nOn the other hand, if Iran exits this agreement and responds to its \nrejection by the United States, our country then is the one that stands \nin the pathway of a potential diplomatic solution to this incredibly \nimportant international security issue. It will be the United States \nblocking a plan with high confidence of stopping Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear bomb. Furthermore, the international support for economic \nsanctions would fray, giving Iran some of the economic relief it is \nseeking without the burden of intrusive inspections.\n  In short, this course would shatter diplomacy, impact and diminish \nAmerican leadership, and shred our economic leverage, increasing \nreliance on one leftover tool--military options--while at the same time \ndramatically diminishing our confidence in the actual state of Iran's \nnuclear program. Less information, more reliance, and less confidence \nwould be a dangerous combination.\n  The most effective strategy for blocking Iran's access to a nuclear \nbomb is to utilize this agreement and maximize American participation \nto hold Iran strictly accountable, not through the first 15 years but \nthrough the next decades that follow, where Iran is still completely \nconstrained by its commitment to never develop a nuclear weapon.\n  After 15 years, Iran will be subject to the deal's requirement that \nit will never ``seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.'' And \nIran will continue to be subject to ongoing intensive monitoring and \nverification by the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.\n  We, the United States, can greatly strengthen this framework. The \nUnited States should use a massive intelligence program to back up the \nplan in the first 15 years and strengthen the IAEA's monitoring after \nthe first 15 years. The United States should lead the international \ncommunity in defining the boundary that constitutes the difference \nbetween a nuclear research program and a nuclear energy program versus \na nuclear weapons program. Those bright lines that are diminished are \nreplaced with a commitment that has to be defined, and it is through \nparticipation and agreement that the United States can ensure that the \ninternational community sustains a clear line and enforces that clear \nline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. In conclusion, no foreign policy choice comes with \nguarantees. The future, whether we approve or reject this deal, is \nunknowable and carries risks. But this agreement, with its verification \nand full U.S. participation, offers the best prospect for stopping Iran \nfrom acquiring a nuclear weapon at any point here forward, and for that \nreason I will support it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, when I go home to my beautiful State of \nWest Virginia, I have always said that if I can't explain it, I can't \nvote for it.\n  When this process began, I was supportive of the diplomatic efforts \nled by Secretaries Kerry and Moniz. I have always believed that to \ntruly be a superpower, you must engage in superdiplomacy. Whenever I am \nable, I will choose diplomacy over war because the stakes are so high \nfor West Virginia and our entire country.\n  In our State of West Virginia, we have one of the highest rates of \nmilitary service in the Nation, participation-wise. But as I struggled \nwith this decision, I could not ignore the fact that Iran, the country \nthat will benefit most from the sanctions being lifted, refuses to \nchange its 36-year history of sponsoring terrorism.\n  For me, this deal had to be about more than preventing Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon for the next 10 to 15 years. For me, this \ndeal had to address Iran's terrorist actions. Without doing so, it \nwould reward Iran's 36 years of deplorable behavior and do nothing to \nprevent its destructive activities.\n  In fact, even during the negotiating process that we have been \nwatching unfold, it has continued to hold four American hostages, \nsupport terrorism\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\naround the world, breed anti-American sentiment, and acquire arms from \nRussia. The continued actions by Iran and its recent activities with \nRussia have proven to me that when we catch Iran violating the \nagreement--and I believe we will--I have grave doubts that we will have \nunified committed partners willing to prevent Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon.\n  I also cannot, in good conscience, agree to Iran receiving up to $100 \nbillion in funds that everyone knows will be used--at least in some \npart--to continue funding terrorism and further destabilize the Middle \nEast. Lifting sanctions without ensuring that Iran's sponsorship of \nterrorism is neutralized is dangerous to regional and American \nsecurity.\n  The administration has accepted what I consider to be a false \nchoice--that this is only about nuclear weapons and not terrorism. \nHowever, the fact of the matter is that we are concerned about Iran \nhaving a bomb because, in large part, it is the world's largest state \nsponsor of terror. Asking us to set aside the terrorist question is \nirresponsible and misses the point.\n  Over the last 36 years, Iran has carried out thousands of acts of \nterror that have killed thousands of innocent lives, and not just in \nthe Middle East but around the world. They have defied international \nsanctions and treaties, continued to call for an attempt to violently \ndestroy the State of Israel, bombed diplomatic buildings, and murdered \ninnocent civilians. On top of it all, Iran is directly responsible for \nthe deaths of hundreds of U.S. soldiers. This regime has shown no signs \nthat its deplorable behavior will change, and the deal does nothing to \nguarantee that behavior change.\n  The deal places real constraints on Iran's nuclear program for the \nnext 10 to 15 years. After that term, Iran will be able to produce \nenough enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in a very short period of \ntime. While I hope its behavior will change in that span, I cannot \ngamble our security and that of our allies on the hope that Iran will \nconduct itself differently than it has for the last 36 years. It is \nbecause of that belief and a month of thoughtful consideration that I \nmust cast a vote against this deal.\n  I do not believe that supporting this deal will prevent Iran from \neventually acquiring a nuclear weapon or from continuing to be a \nleading sponsor of terrorism against Americans and our allies around \nthe world. To those who are upset by my deliberations, I will simply \nsay that the decision to pursue diplomacy is every bit as consequential \nas the decision to pursue war, and in many cases--possibly even this \none--the choice to abandon the first path leads inevitably to the \nsecond. I, like most Americans and West Virginians, have already seen \ntoo much American sacrifice in the Middle East to push us down the path \ntowards war. However, I don't believe a vote against this deal forces \nus to abandon the diplomatic path. We must continue to pursue peace but \non terms that promise a lasting peace for the United States and our \nallies.\n  I met with and spoke to every national security expert I could. I \nattended every secured briefing that was made available to me. I spoke \nwith representatives of every Middle Eastern country, and most \nimportantly, I listened to the good citizens of West Virginia. I thank \nall of my constituents who reached out to my office and to the many \nadvisers who took their time to help me reach this decision.\n  I will continue to listen to my constituents, and I will support a \npath towards peace and diplomacy over war and aggression. But make no \nmistake about it. I will vote to use all of our military might to \nprotect our homeland whenever it is threatened, defend our allies \nwhenever they are put in harm's way, and to prevent Iran from acquiring \na nuclear weapon.\n  To be a superpower I believe you must possess superdiplomatic skills, \nand I believe we can use these skills to negotiate a better deal. We \nneed a deal that citizens of West Virginia, our country, and the world \nknow will make us safer.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, as Indiana's Senator, my top priority \nand most fundamental responsibility is to ensure the security of the \npeople of Indiana and our Nation, as well as the security of our \nfriends and allies, including Israel and the Gulf States. It is through \nthe lens of these solemn obligations that I have carefully reviewed and \nevaluated the proposed nuclear agreement.\n  In making this decision, I bring to bear not only my responsibilities \nas a Senator but as the ranking member of the Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces, overseeing our Nation's own nuclear \narsenal and global nonproliferation efforts, and my convictions as a \nstrong supporter of Israel and my concerns as a Hoosier who has \nattended the funerals of too many young men and women lost protecting \nour Nation in this conflict-ridden region.\n  After exhaustive assessment and careful thought, I determined that \ndespite my questions about Iran's intentions, the most responsible \ncourse of action is to give this agreement the opportunity to succeed. \nIt is not the agreement I would have written, but it is the one we have \nto make a decision on, and I believe the alternative is much more \ndangerous to our country and to Israel.\n  While reasonable people can disagree on the substance of the \nagreement, we can all agree that a nuclear-armed Iran poses an \nunacceptable threat to global security and the Iranian leadership \nshould not and cannot be trusted. The question then becomes this: How \ncan we most effectively eliminate Iran's nuclear threat?\n  This agreement rolls back Iran's nuclear capabilities, shrinks its \nprogram, and gives us unprecedented access with the most intrusive \ninspections and verification regime ever put into place. Iran must get \nrid of 98 percent of their stockpiled uranium, more than two-thirds of \ntheir centrifuges, and the existing core of their heavy water plutonium \nreactor.\n  These measures not only give us the opportunity to restrain Iran's \nnuclear capabilities but also, according to our military leadership, \nimprove the effectiveness of our military option should that one day \nbecome necessary. Without this agreement, we risk the worst of both \nworlds. The united front we have formed with the international \ncommunity against Iran's nuclear program would break apart, the \nagreement would dissolve, sanctions relief would flow into Iran from \nthose countries that are no longer willing to hold the line, and Iran \nis left with tens of thousands of centrifuges capable of producing \nhighly enriched uranium, a heavy water reactor capable of producing \nweapons-grade plutonium, and a breakout time of just 2 to 3 months.\n  While I support this agreement, I also recognize that the only true \nguarantee that Iran will never become a nuclear-armed state is the \nsteadfast resolve of the United States and our allies to do whatever is \nnecessary to stop them and to put in place the policies to make that \nhappen. With or without this deal, the day may come when we are left \nwith no alternative but to take military action to prevent Iran from \ncrossing a nuclear threshold. The burden and danger would, as always, \nbe on the shoulders of our servicemembers, who put their lives on the \nline for our country.\n  Indiana is home to the Nation's fourth largest National Guard \ncontingent, with more than 14,000 Hoosiers standing ready to serve \ntheir communities and our country. These men and women and the \nthousands of Hoosiers who serve in the Reserves and on Active Duty \nacross the country and around the world have been called to serve time \nand time again. They have done so with honor and distinction. They make \nup the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen, and I have \nevery confidence in their ability to meet any challenge put before \nthem.\n  If the day does come that I am faced with a vote on whether to \nauthorize military action against Iran, I owe it to our Armed Forces \nand to the people of Indiana to have tried all other options to stop \nIran before we consider putting our servicemembers into harm's way.\n  We stand ready to take military action if needed, but we owe it to \nthe young men and women who protect our country on the frontlines--from \nTerre Haute, Angola, Evansville, and Indianapolis--to at least try to \nfind a peaceful solution. They should be able to expect at least that \nmuch from us here in\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\nthe Senate, and if that solution does not succeed, they stand ready.\n  While I share the concerns expressed by the agreement's critics about \nwhat may happen 10 years or 15 years or 20 years from now, I cannot in \ngood conscience take action that would shift the potential risks of \n2026 and 2031 to 2016.\n  I believe this agreement is, as my predecessor and friend, former \nU.S. Senator Richard Lugar, recently said, ``our best chance to stop an \nIranian bomb without another war in the Middle East.'' I owe Senator \nLugar and my other fellow Hoosier, former Congressman Lee Hamilton, a \ngreat debt of gratitude for their input and expertise throughout this \nprocess.\n  This deal will not resolve every problem we have were Iran. It must \nbe part of a comprehensive strategy to counter the broader threat Iran \nposes through their support for terrorists and other proxies across \nSyria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere.\n  I remain committed to working with my colleagues and friends on both \nsides of the aisle to confront these challenges with a clear, decisive \nstrategy in the Middle East.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express strong support \nfor the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the diplomatic agreement \nthat the United States and our international partners reached with Iran \nin July. I urge my colleagues to support the agreement and to reject \nthe resolution of disapproval.\n  This is not a decision I came to lightly. Since the agreement was \nannounced, I have consulted with nuclear and sanctions experts inside \nand outside the government, Obama administration officials, including \nSecretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, \nAmbassadors from the other countries who negotiated alongside of us, \nour intelligence communities, advocates for Israel on both sides of the \nissue, my constituents in Minnesota, and, of course, with my colleagues \nin the Senate.\n  Many have expressed reservations about the agreement, and I share \nsome of those reservations. It is not a perfect agreement, but it is a \nstrong one. Many people have said no deal is better than a bad deal, \nbut that doesn't mean that the only deal we can agree to is a perfect \ndeal. The last perfect deal we got was on the deck of the USS Missouri. \nWhat a cost we had to pay for that, including the only use of a nuclear \nweapon in war--actually, two weapons.\n  This agreement is, in my opinion, the most effective, realistic \noption available to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon anytime \nin the next 15 years and beyond. Iran must never, ever have a nuclear \nweapon. And after 15 years, we will still have every option we \ncurrently have, up to and including the use of military force, to \nprevent Iran from getting a bomb. Moreover, while critics have eagerly \npointed out what they see as flaws in the deal, I have heard no \npersuasive arguments that there is a better alternative.\n  The agreement imposes a series of physical limits on Iran's nuclear \nprogram, especially its production of the fissile material it would \nrequire to make a bomb. The agreement's verification provisions are \nextremely strong, with 24/7 monitoring of and unfettered access to \nIran's nuclear sites and ongoing surveillance of Iran's nuclear supply \nchain.\n  Let me briefly review the central limits on its nuclear program that \nIran has agreed to and the verification provisions. Together they are \ndesigned to prevent Iran from trying to get a nuclear weapon and to \ndetect them, if they do, with enough time to respond forcefully and \neffectively.\n  The agreement will prevent Iran from using weapons-grade plutonium as \nthe fissile material for a nuclear weapon by requiring Iran to redesign \nand rebuild the Arak nuclear reactor, which, if completed as planned, \ncould have produced enough weapons-grade plutonium for one or two bombs \neach year. Under the agreement, it won't be able to do that. Iran has \nto pull out the core of the nuclear reactor and fill it with concrete \nto destroy it. And Iran can't get any sanctions relief until it does \nthat.\n  The agreement also significantly reduces and limits Iran's production \nof uranium which, in its highly enriched form, can also be used in a \nbomb. Iran currently has about 19,500 centrifuges capable of enriching \nuranium, and it has stockpiled about 10 tons of low-enriched uranium. \nUnder the agreement, Iran has to go down to about 5,000 first-\ngeneration centrifuges for enriching uranium and down to 300 kilograms \nof low-enriched uranium--a 98-percent reduction. Iran does not get any \nsanctions relief until it does that.\n  Right now, it would take Iran about 2 to 3 months to get one weapon's \nworth of weapons-grade uranium. That is called the breakout time. The \nlonger the breakout time is, of course, the better. This agreement will \nincrease the breakout time to 1 year for the first decade. Because of \nthe inspections included in the agreement, if Iran tried to cheat at \ntheir nuclear facilities and dash for a bomb, we would catch them \nalmost instantaneously and have more than enough time to respond \neffectively. Iran's nuclear facilities will be subject to 24/7 \nmonitoring and unfettered access by the inspectors of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA. Limitations on Iran's nuclear \nfacilities and strict verification make it impossible for Iran to dash \nfor a bomb at its known nuclear facilities for the next 15 years.\n  But the verification provisions are also important for another \nreason. They make it much more difficult for Iran to be able to go for \na bomb in secret as well. Beyond the 24/7 monitoring of and unfettered \naccess to Iran's nuclear sites, international inspectors will also be \nguaranteed access to any site in Iran that they have suspicions about, \nincluding military sites.\n  Now, a lot has been made about a provision in the agreement for \nresolving disputes when the IAEA seeks to access suspicious sites in \nIran. That process can take up to 24 days. A lot of confusing and \nmisleading things have been said about this. First of all, it is \nimportant to again emphasize that there is continuous monitoring at \nIran's declared nuclear sites and unique safeguards on Iran's nuclear \nsupply chain. That is not what the 24-day controversy is about.\n  Where the 24 days come in is in those cases where Iran disputes the \nIAEA's demand for access to a suspicious, undeclared site. People have \nexpressed concerns that 24 days is too long. Prime Minister Netanyahu \nhas likened this to giving a drug dealer 24-days' notice before you \ncheck his premises, saying that is a lot of time for a drug dealer to \nflush a lot of drugs down the toilet.\n  But here is the problem for Iran and the problem with this criticism. \nYou can't hide radioactive material such as uranium. It leaves traces \nbehind, and they can be detected for far, far longer than 24 days. One \nnuclear expert has said:\n\n       If Iran were to flush the evidence down the toilet, they'd \n     have a radioactive toilet. And if they were to rip out the \n     toilet, they'd have a radioactive hole in the ground.\n\n  Uranium-235 has a half-life of over 700 million years, and the half-\nlife of uranium-238 is over 4 billion years. The IAEA will catch Iran \nafter 24 days.\n  Now, it is true that there are some activities--related to weapons \ndesign, for example--that don't use nuclear materials and are much \neasier to hide. That is a genuine challenge that inspectors and our \nintelligence efforts will face. But the fact is that you can move a \ncomputer that you are doing design work on in 24 seconds or erase stuff \nin 24 milliseconds. I am sure it is actually a lot faster than that. \nBut Iran is still not allowed to conduct those activities under the \nagreement and will face severe consequences if they get caught.\n  So the bottom line is that the IAEA's guaranteed access to suspicious \nsites will help support the verification of the agreement.\n  Perhaps more importantly, we will also have ongoing surveillance of \nIran's nuclear supply chain. That means that in order to make a nuclear \nweapon in the next 15 years, and even beyond, Iran would have to \nreconstruct every individual piece of the chain--the mining, the \nmilling, the production of centrifuges, and more--separately and in \nsecret. And it would have to make sure it didn't get caught in any of \nthe steps. This agreement--plus our own comprehensive intelligence \nefforts--would make it exceedingly unlikely that Iran\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\nwould be able to get away with any of that. And Iran would therefore \nrisk losing everything it gained from the deal and the reimposition of \nsanctions, to say nothing of military attack.\n  We don't have to trust the regime's intentions to understand the \nreality it would face. Attempting to cheat on this agreement would \ncarry an overwhelming likelihood of getting caught and serious \nconsequences if it does.\n  We still have work to do to diminish the threat Iran poses to our \nnational security and, of course, to the safety of our allies in the \nMiddle East, beginning with Israel. As sanctions are lifted, the non-\nnuclear threat to the region may very well grow. We will need to \nbolster our support to regional counterweights such as Saudi Arabia. \nAnd, of course, we will need to maintain our terrorism-related \nsanctions, which are unaffected by the deal.\n  We also need to work very closely with Israel, our greatest friend in \nthe region, in order to assure its security. As a Jew, I feel a deep \nbond with Israel. As a Senator, I have worked very hard to strengthen \nour country's bond with that nation and to bolster its security, and I \nwill continue to do that. A nuclear-armed Iran would be a truly grave \nthreat to Israel, and so I believe this agreement will contribute to \nthe security of Israel because it is the most effective available means \nof preventing Iran from becoming nuclear armed, so do a number of very \nsenior Israeli security experts, including some of the former heads of \nIsrael's security services.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this deal represents a significant \nstep forward for our own national security.\n  One concern has been raised about what happens after year 15 when \nmany of the restrictions in the deal expire. Well, there will still be \nmajor checks on Iran's nuclear program after that date. Under the deal, \nIran will be subject to permanent, specific prohibitions on several of \nthe steps necessary to build a bomb. Iran's nuclear program will still \nbe subject to heightened monitoring by the IAEA and Iran's nuclear \nsupply chain will still be subject to uniquely intrusive monitoring, \nwhich will limit Iran's ability to divert nuclear materials and \nequipment to a secret program without being detected.\n  Iran must never, ever have a nuclear weapon. We will still have every \noption we currently have, up to and including the use of military \nforce, to prevent that from happening.\n  But we also must begin now to make the case to the world that the \ndanger posed by an Iranian nuclear weapon will not expire in 15 years, \nand remind Iran that should it begin to take worrisome steps, such as \nenrichment inconsistent with a peaceful program, we stand ready to \nintervene.\n  That said, we don't know what the world will look like in 15 years. \nAs long as this regime holds power, Iran will represent a dangerous \nthreat to our security. But it is possible that by 2031, Iran may no \nlonger be controlled by hardliners determined to harm our interests. \nMore than 60 percent of Iran's population is now under the age of 30. \nThese young Iranians are increasingly well educated and pro American.\n  We don't know how this tension within Iran will work out. But I think \nif we reject this agreement, we will lose this opportunity with the \npeople of Iran. If we back out of a deal we have agreed to, we will \nonly embolden the hardliners who insist that America cannot be trusted. \nWe will be doing self-inflicted damage to American global leadership \nand to the cause of international diplomacy.\n  What is more, the alternatives that I have heard run the gamut from \nunrealistic to horrifying. For example, some say that should the Senate \nreject this agreement, we would be in a position to negotiate a better \none. But I have spoken to the Ambassadors or Deputy Chiefs of Mission \nof each of the five nations who helped broker the deal with us, and \nthey all agree that this simply would not be the case. Instead, these \ndiplomats have told me that we would not be able to come back to the \nbargaining table at all and that the sanction regimes would likely \nerode or just fall apart completely, giving Iran's leaders more money \nand more leverage and diminishing both our moral authority throughout \nthe world and our own leverage. That is just the reality. And of course \nIran would be able to move forward on its nuclear program, endangering \nour interests in the region--especially Israel--and making it far more \nlikely that we will find ourselves engaged in a military conflict \nthere. If Iran cheats on this agreement and we are a part of it, we \nwill have a say in the international response. If we are not a part of \nthis agreement, we will not.\n\n  Now, most opponents of the agreement do not seek or want war with \nIran--even if opposition to the agreement makes such a war, in my \nopinion, more likely--but some of them do. One of my colleagues \nsuggested that we should simply attack Iran now--an exercise he \nbelieves would be quick and painless to the United States. In fact, he \ncompared it to Operation Desert Fox, intimating that it would be over \nand done with in a matter of days. But this is pure fantasy, at least \naccording to what our security and intelligence experts tell us, and it \nis certainly not the lesson anyone should have learned from the \ndisastrous invasion of Iraq.\n  The Middle East is an unstable, unpredictable, largely unfriendly \nregion. We know that military undertakings in the region are likely to \nbring very painful, unpredictable consequences. That is partly why we \nshould give diplomacy a chance. Yet, a number of my colleagues and \nothers were intent on opposing such a diplomatic solution even before \nthe agreement was reached.\n  In March----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent for another 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In March, 47 of my Republican colleagues took the unprecedented step \nof sending a letter to Iran's leaders just as these sensitive \nnegotiations were nearing an accord. It was a clear attempt to \nundermine American diplomacy and signaled that they would oppose any \ndeal with Iran, no matter what the terms. So it is not surprising that \nthese critics now oppose the finished deal, but it is disappointing \nthat they refuse to acknowledge, let alone take responsibility for the \ndire consequences that would almost certainly result from killing it.\n  It is possible that there would not be a war if we reject the \nagreement, but what seems undeniable is that if we and we alone were to \nwalk away from an agreement that we negotiated alongside our \ninternational partners, that would be a severe blow to our standing and \nour leadership in the world.\n  Diplomacy requires cooperation and compromise. You don't negotiate \nwith your friends; you negotiate with your enemies.\n  Indeed, no one who is for this deal has any illusions about the \nIranian regime, any more than the American Presidents who made nuclear \narms agreements with the Soviet Union had illusions about the nature of \nthe Communist regime there.\n  For a long time, it looked as if our only options when it came to \nIran would be allowing it to have a nuclear weapon or having to bomb \nthe country ourselves. This agreement represents a chance to break out \nof that no-win scenario. To take the extraordinary step of rejecting it \nbecause of clearly unrealistic expectations, because of a hunger to \nsend Americans into another war, or, worst of all, because of petty \npartisanship would be a terrible mistake.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to prevent this resolution of \ndisapproval from moving forward and to vote in support of the \nagreement.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction that we have agreed to with our international partners and with \nIran. This agreement, implemented effectively, is the best option we \nhave to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  I sit on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. We have had \nnumerous hearings. I have engaged with the administration. I have met \nwith our international partners. I have studied the deal itself. I have \nread the commentary and analyses from all different perspectives. I \nhave asked hard\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\nquestions. I have reached my conclusions based on the facts before us. \nThis decision was not easy and should not be easy.\n  Like every Member of this body, I am committed to Israel's security. \nI am concerned about the alarming statements against Israel and Iran's \nsupport for terrorism. These concerns are real and valid.\n  Nuclear proliferation is one of the most consequential national \nsecurity matters facing the world. Clearly, a nuclear Iran is \nunacceptable to all of us. So I would expect that any agreement to stop \nIran from getting a nuclear weapon would be given serious, thoughtful \nconsideration. Yet, there are those in this body and elsewhere who \noppose even the idea of a diplomatic solution--at least one negotiated \nby the Obama administration. They have made clear their intention to \noppose the agreement even while the negotiations were taking place.\n  For the first time I am aware of in U.S. history, dozens of Senators \nsigned an open letter to a foreign government--the government of an \nadversary, no less--stating that any agreement reached by this \nadministration would be undone. Before the actual ink was put to paper \non the agreement, that was their message. Then, within hours of the \ndeal's announcement, the same voices that opposed negotiations in the \nfirst place started denouncing it as a bad deal. Some claimed we could \nget a better deal. Others said that no deal was preferable, despite the \nfact that Iran was within 2 to 3 months of getting a nuclear bomb. I am \nfairly certain these people hadn't read the deal before they made such \nstatements at the very outset. That is not how we should conduct \nforeign policy. Our national security, the security of Israel, and the \nstability of the Middle East are too important to turn into campaign \nads or political rhetoric.\n  As we prepare to vote this afternoon, I would ask my colleagues to \nset politics aside and focus on the facts. The fact is, this agreement \nis the best option we have to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  First, we reached this agreement with the backing of our \ninternational partners, including China and Russia. I, along with some \nof my colleagues, met with Ambassadors of these countries, and I asked \nthem point-blank: Would you come back to the table to bargain for \nanother agreement if the United States walked away?\n  They said: No. There already is an agreement. It is the one that \nCongress should be supporting.\n  The Ambassador to the United States from the UK also said no.\n  I would remind my colleagues that after decades of U.S. unilateral \nsanctions against Iran, it was the weight of international sanctions \nthat forced Iran to the table. We need our partners to make this deal \nwork, and our partners have committed that if we choose this path, they \nwill stand with us, they will be with us.\n  Second, the terms of this agreement, implemented effectively, cut off \nIran's ability to create a bomb. Their uranium stockpiles will be all \nbut eliminated. We will have unprecedented oversight over the entire \nnuclear supply chain.\n  The U.S. intelligence community has indicated that it will gain \nvaluable new insights through this agreement. Indeed, with the \ninformation that can be garnered through this agreement, our \nintelligence community will be able to provide information that will \nenable us to make sure Iran stands up and abides by the provisions of \nthis deal.\n  We will have veto authority of what goes into Iran and we will know \nwhat comes out of Iran.\n  These unprecedented oversight provisions have the support of arms \ncontrol experts, nuclear scientists, diplomats, and military and \nintelligence leaders, all of whom believe this deal will make the \ndifference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Finally, this agreement isn't about trust. The deal \nrequires verification that Iran is cooperating before sanctions can be \nlifted. If Iran cheats, we can snap back sanctions with international \nsupport. We can initiate military operations if we need to. Let me \nrepeat. The deal before us does not prevent the United States from \ntaking military action if needed.\n  This agreement is not perfect; however, rejecting this deal means \nrisking our international cooperation, our security, and our ability to \nprevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  Based on the facts before us, this agreement deserves our support. \nLet's put politics aside. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing \nthe resolution before us today. I urge my colleagues to support the \nagreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, for more than half a century, the United \nStates has led global efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. \nSince the 1970s, the international community has set rules and \nprocedures to prevent these weapons from spreading, particularly to \nunstable regions plagued by international and civil war.\n  Today, the world faces precisely this challenge in Iran. A nuclear \nweapon in the hands of Iran is a very real and dangerous threat not \nonly to Israel and the entire Middle East but to all of humanity.\n  We are in unanimous agreement that Iran must never become a nuclear \nweapons state. Iran has given us good reason to be skeptical of its \nintentions. It has misled the world about its nuclear program, is a \nstate sponsor of terrorism, and is a destabilizing force in the Middle \nEast. With nuclear weapons, the threat posed by Iran would increase \nexponentially. Because of these factors, we cannot ever trust Iran or \never give it a free pass on its destabilizing activity in the region \nand around the globe. As we speak today, Iran has the capability to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon within 3 months. With the Iran nuclear \nagreement, that will no longer be possible.\n  I believe that our negotiators achieved as much as possible and that \nif the agreement they negotiated is strictly implemented, it can do the \njob. On the other hand, if we walk away now, our diplomatic coalition \nwill likely fall apart and the prospects for any renewed efforts would \nnot be promising.\n  Together with many other Senators, I met with the Ambassadors of the \nfive countries that joined in the effort to reach this agreement--Great \nBritain, France, Germany, China, and Russia. Their message was unified \nand crystal clear: If the United States walks away right now, we will \nbe on our own and they will not come back to the table.\n  I acknowledge that the agreement carries risks, but, as recently \nstated in a letter signed by 29 leading American nuclear scientists, \nincluding six Nobel laureates, this agreement contains ``more stringent \nconstraints than any previous negotiated nonproliferation framework.''\n  The agreement puts strict limits on Iran's nuclear program for the \nnext 15 years. It reduces Iran's existing nuclear program to a fraction \nof its current size. It virtually eliminates Iran's plutonium \ncapabilities and reduces its uranium capability by two-thirds. It \npushes back the time required before Iran would be capable of building \na nuclear bomb from 3 months to more than 1 year.\n  As I said earlier, this agreement is not based on trust. It imposes \nthe most invasive, stringent, and technologically innovative \nverification regime ever negotiated. The agreement empowers inspectors \nto use the most advanced and intrusive methods to monitor Iran's \ncompliance. This verification system will provide an unprecedented \namount of reliable information and insight into Iran's nuclear program, \nensuring that if Iran ever tries to develop a nuclear weapon, we will \nfind out about it in time to stop them.\n  After 15 years, under both this agreement and the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, Iran will remain bound never to seek nuclear \nweapons. In paragraph 3 of the agreement, Iran categorically makes the \nfollowing binding obligation: ``Under no circumstances will Iran ever \nseek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.''\n  Under the agreement, Iran will be required to give the IAEA detailed \nplans for how it intends to develop nuclear technology for peaceful \nuse. It will remain forever subject to IAEA inspection to verify that \nit never seeks nuclear weapons or engages in any nuclear weapons-\nrelated activities. If the\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\nIAEA ever finds anything suspicious--not just in 10 or 15 or 25 or 40 \nyears but forever--then it will be the IAEA's duty to promptly report \nits suspicions to the world. The IAEA's ability to verify Iran's \ncompliance is the key to this agreement.\n\n  It will be critical to provide international inspectors with the \nsupport they require to detect, investigate, and respond to any \nsuspicious nuclear activity before Iran has time to cover up the \nevidence.\n  With our support, the IAEA can and must aggressively investigate any \nindication of Iranian nuclear weapons activities and report promptly \nand unequivocally if Iran cheats. Likewise, we must be prepared to \nreact at any time if the IAEA sounds the alarm.\n  I supported the tough sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable in the first place. There are mechanisms in this agreement to \nsnap back sanctions quickly and prevent a Chinese or Russian veto.\n  Even without nuclear weapons, Iran poses very real risks, \nparticularly to Israel, our closest friend in the region, and to our \npartners in the Arabian Peninsula. The administration has assured us \nthat it is working closely with regional partners to enhance their \nsecurity. Congress must be an active, insistent, and bipartisan partner \nin this effort, both with this President and his successors.\n  We must increase our security assistance to Israel to unprecedented \nlevels. I have always been a strong supporter of Israel. When Saddam \nHussein was developing nuclear weapons in 1981, I supported Israel's \ndecision to bomb the Osirak reactor. When Israel needed more funding \nfor a missile defense system in 2010, I voted to accelerate the \ndevelopment of the Iron Dome system. When Hamas attacked Israel in \n2012, I supported its right to self-defense. We must continue to ensure \nIsrael's qualitative military edge in the region and promptly finalize \nour new 10-year memorandum of understanding to cement our security \nassistance commitments. Likewise, we must strengthen our relationships \nwith all of our regional partners. The countries of the Arabian \nPeninsula require our assistance to counter threats from Iran.\n  Our cooperation in ballistic missile defense and countering violent \nextremists through intelligence sharing and interdiction must continue \nand be enhanced. Over the past 2 months, I have consulted with many \nstakeholders, groups, advocates, and concerned constituents on both \nsides of this debate. Without exception, their passion is born of an \nunwavering desire to secure a lasting peace for the Middle East, \nIsrael, the United States, and the world. This is a passion I share.\n  The world has come together in a historic way. With the agreement, we \ngain much, but most importantly, we avoid missing the significant \ndiplomatic opportunity to ensure that Iran never emerges as a nuclear \nweapons state. With this agreement, we will maintain the international \nsolidarity that will enable us to reimpose sanctions if Iran ever does \ntry to get a nuclear weapon. We will keep and continue to improve all \nof our capabilities required to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear \nweapons state, including a military option.\n  I thank Secretary Kerry, Secretary Moniz, and the entire U.S. \nnegotiating team for their tireless efforts and service to our country \nin helping reach this agreement. I also thank President Obama for his \nleadership and commitment to diplomacy.\n  I urge the Senate to come together to support this diplomatic effort \nto prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon--not just this month \nor this year but forever. We must be ever-vigilant to ensure that every \npart of this agreement is verified.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Congress presently has the heavy \nresponsibility to conduct a thorough and rigorous review of the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. After numerous briefings from \nofficials involved in the negotiations, consultation with scientific \nand diplomatic experts, meetings with Rhode Islanders, and a great deal \nof personal reflection, I have decided to support the plan. I do so \nbecause it blocks the pathways through which Iran could pursue a \nnuclear weapon, establishes unprecedented inspections of Iran's nuclear \nfacilities and other sites of concern to the international community, \nand preserves our ability to respond militarily if necessary. The \nagreement also ensures the international sanctions regime against Iran \ncan snap back into place if the Iranian Government reneges on its \ncommitments.\n  This agreement, reached by the United States, United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, China, Russia, and Iran, establishes strict and comprehensive \nmonitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify \ncompliance and prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The \nagreement does not take any options off the table for President Obama, \nor for future Presidents. It ensures no sanctions relief will be \nprovided unless the Iranian Government undertakes a series of \nsignificant steps to satisfy IAEA requirements.\n  This agreement is the product of a joint effort among six sovereign \ncountries, which working together have more force and effect than \nseparated. I am encouraged that the other countries party to this \nagreement have committed to enforce this agreement and to ramp up \nenforcement of other international agreements against Iran's terror \nactivities. I have also heard their warnings that if we walk away from \nthis agreement before even giving it a try, the prospect of further \nmultilateral negotiations yielding any better result is ``far-\nfetched.'' Joining with other world powers in this important effort \nbears a price in the United States' ability to negotiate unilaterally. \nThat should be a surprise to no one. Critics of this agreement fail to \nacknowledge the leverage and strength behind a unified, international \neffort to block Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and no one has \noffered a credible alternative that would lead to a nuclear weapons-\nfree Iran.\n  This hard-fought bargain is the product of the canny determination of \nSecretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary and nuclear physicist \nErnest Moniz, and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy \nSherman, and of many months of hard work on the part of many dedicated \nAmerican officials. It is also a testament to President Obama's \nsteadfast resolve to reach a diplomatic solution to one of the most \npressing security challenges of our time.\n  As more than 100 former American Ambassadors emphasized in their \nletter to the President endorsing the agreement, ``the most effective \nway to protect U.S. national security, and that of our allies and \nfriends, is to ensure that tough-minded diplomacy has a chance to \nsucceed before considering other more costly and risky alternatives.''\n  This agreement is also supported by more than two dozen leading \nAmerican scientists, who found the deal to be ``technically sound, \nstringent, and innovative'' in its restrictions on Iran's nuclear \ncapabilities and its monitoring and verification of Iran's compliance \nwith the agreement.\n  By eliminating Iran's ability to gain a nuclear weapons capability \nfor at least a decade, the deal allows the United States and the \ninternational community to focus needed energy and resources on other \ncritical challenges Iran poses to the region, such as its support for \nHezbollah and Syrian President Bashar Assad, as well as its human \nrights abuses.\n  Bilateral cooperation between the United States and Israel will be as \nimportant as ever as we go forward. This should include tangible \ndemonstrations of support for Israel through deepened military and \nintelligence cooperation. President Obama has already declared his \nintention to provide ``unprecedented'' levels of military financing and \nequipment to Israel, on top of the record support already in place.\n  As former Israeli Deputy National Security Advisor Chuck Freilich has \nsaid, ``The agreement, a painful compromise, not the one the U.S. or \nanyone else wanted, but the one it was able to negotiate, serves \nIsrael's security.'' This conclusion is echoed in the words of \nofficials from our Gulf Cooperation Council partners, like Qatar's \nForeign Minister Khalid al-Attiyah, who said ``This was the best option \namong other options,'' and ``we are confident that what they [the \nnegotiators] undertook makes this region safer and more stable.''\n  I appreciate the thoughtful input of the many Rhode Islanders with \nwhom I\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\nmet and who have reached out to me with opinions on both sides of this \nissue. It is, of course, a hallmark of our great democracy that we can \nopenly and civilly debate these important questions. So too, I believe \nthat through international engagement we can encourage a freer and more \nliberal society to emerge from the grip of the ayatollahs. That, with \nstrong multilateral efforts to contain Iran's continuing mischief in \nthe surrounding Middle East, provides the prospect of this becoming an \nhistoric turning point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have been watching this debate as \ncarefully as I possibly can. I think it has been very thoughtful. I \nthink it is interesting that Members of this body have read the same \nagreement and come to different conclusions. It is not surprising. \nThere are a lot of complications in this. Nobody can really know \nexactly how everything is going to turn out. So it does not surprise me \nthat people have come to different conclusions.\n  I also agree with the Members of this body when they say this is \nprobably one of the most important votes they will ever take. We are \ntalking about a nuclear Iran and how we can potentially prevent that. \nThat, obviously, would be a threat to world peace.\n  I know that sitting back in Oshkosh, WI, well before I ever became a \nSenator, I heard Members of parties declare definitively: We cannot \nallow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Well, the sad fact is, I think \nthis agreement puts it on a path to obtaining that weapon.\n  I also agree with President Obama in his speech really chastising \nthose of us who don't agree with him when he says this is a pretty \nsimple decision. I think it is a pretty simple decision. I just come at \nit from a totally different perspective and obviously draw a completely \ndifferent conclusion from that.\n  Let me read a couple quotes that have been brought forth by Members \nof this body during this debate.\n  First:\n\n       Most importantly, this agreement cannot be based on hope or \n     trust. History belies both in our experience with Iran. This \n     deal is not the agreement I have long sought.\n\n  Another Senator:\n\n       We are legitimizing a vast and expanding nuclear program in \n     Iran. We are, in effect, rewarding years of deception, \n     deceit, and wanton disregard for international law.\n\n  Another Senator:\n\n       This agreement with the duplicitous and untrustworthy \n     Iranian regime falls short of what I had envisioned.\n\n  Yet another:\n\n       This deal is not perfect and no one trusts Iran.\n\n  In my 4\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, I have been trying to find those \nareas of agreement. I agree with those comments. But what is kind of \nsurprising about all of those quotes, these are quotes from individual \nSenators--I won't name them--Senators who are going to vote to approve \nthis awful deal. I think something else we can all agree on is that \nIran is our enemy.\n  Let me read a couple other quotes.\n\n       Early this year, after his congregation broke out with a \n     death to America chant, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei \n     said: Yes, of course. Yes, death to America, because America \n     is the original source of this pressure. Death to America. \n     Death to America.\n\n  Then only 2 days ago the Supreme Leader said: I say that you Israelis \nwill not see the coming 25 years. And, God willing, there will not be \nsomething named the Zionist regime in the next 25 years.\n  So I agree that we cannot trust Iran. We cannot trust the Supreme \nLeader. I agree that Iran is our enemy. So my decision to vote for \ndisapproval of this deal rests on a very simple premise: Why in the \nworld would we ever enter a deal that will give tens of billions and \neventually hundreds of billions of dollars to our enemy, our avowed \nenemy--an enemy that I have to remind this body was responsible, \nbecause of their IEDs, for the killing of 196 troops in Iraq and many \nmore wounded and maimed, a regime that back in the late 1970s took 52 \nU.S. hostages for 444 days? That regime has not changed its behavior in \nall these intervening years. They are our enemy. Again, let me point \nout, why in the world would we ever agree to a deal that will \nstrengthen our enemy's economy and our enemy's military? It seems \npretty obvious. I agree with President Obama. This is a simple \ndecision. But I disagree. He thinks it is a good deal. I think it is a \nvery bad deal.\n  In my remaining time--I want to be respectful of my colleagues--I do \nwant to talk about what this debate and what this vote is actually \nabout. This is not a straight up-or-down vote to approve an \ninternational agreement that would be deemed a treaty. This body gave \nup our ability to deem this a treaty and provide advice and consent \nwhen we voted on my amendment to deem it a treaty.\n  President Obama, on his own authority, his article II powers, said: \nNo, something this important, this consequential is not a treaty, it is \nan Executive agreement, and I can go it alone. And he basically did \nuntil the Senators from Tennessee and Maryland came together and \nrecognized the fact that a key part of this deal is the waiver or \nlifting of the congressionally imposed sanctions that we put in place--\nagainst the President's objection, by the way--in 2012. What this \ndebate is all about is whether President Obama can retain that waiver \nauthority.\n  Regardless of how this turns out, President Obama, again, has \nnegotiated this deal. He has run to the United Nations Security Council \nand gotten them to agree to it. The process will be put in place to \nlift those sanctions from the United Nations that, by the way, were put \nin place in resolutions that would have required the suspension or \nhalting of the uranium enrichment capability, which is not part of this \ndeal, unfortunately.\n  So it is extremely important for the American people to understand \nthat we are not debating and we are not going to be voting on the \nactual deal itself. We are going to be voting on something that has \npretty weak involvement, pretty minor involvement, because President \nObama has pretty well blocked us, blocked the American people from \nhaving a voice on a deal which is so important, so consequential, and \nwhich I believe is going to be so damaging to America's long-term \ninterest, a deal which I believe really will put Iran on a path to \nobtaining a nuclear weapon. We are going to be lifting the arms \nembargo. We are already lifting the embargo on ballistic missile \ntechnology. And let me reiterate that we are going to be injecting tens \nof billions and eventually hundreds of billions of dollars to \nstrengthen the economy and the military of our avowed enemy.\n  It is a simple decision for me, which is why I will vote to \ndisapprove this very bad deal.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for \nhis comments.\n  I rise today in opposition to this agreement. I do so because I \nbelieve it is bad for our country and bad for the world.\n  There are very few votes we take here in the Senate that have such a \nprofound effect on our national security and the kind of world our kids \nand our grandkids are going to inherit as this upcoming vote we will \ntake next week on this nuclear deal.\n  Over the past couple of months, I have taken the time to read the \nagreement carefully. I have attended the classified briefings. I have \nlistened to my colleagues. I have talked to a lot of experts on both \nsides of the issue. I did take my time in coming to a decision because \nI was hopeful that we would be able to have an agreement that I could \nsupport and others could as well.\n  I have also listened to my constituents back home in Ohio. They have \nlooked at this agreement too. They understand what is at stake. They \nhave strong views on it. My calls and letters and emails are \noverwhelmingly opposed.\n  Through the process, what I did was I measured the agreement not \nbased on just some abstract concept I might have, I actually based it \non the actual objectives and criteria that were set out by the \ninternational community, the United Nations, and the United States of \nAmerica, our government. I looked at it based on the redlines we had \ndrawn. One of my great concerns about this agreement is that those \nredlines have not been honored. The broad\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\ngoal, of course, the biggest redline is that Congress, the Obama \nadministration, the United Nations Security Council--everyone was very \nclear: Iran must stop and dismantle its nuclear weapons program. That \nis the most basic redline.\n  You have to remember that when Congress on a bipartisan basis enacted \nthese crippling sanctions on Iran, it was not just to bring Iran to the \ntable, which was the result, it was actually to get them to abandon \ntheir nuclear weapons program. That was the point.\n  I supported tougher sanctions to give leverage to the Obama \nadministration even though, seriously, they did not want that leverage. \nThey resisted Congress increasing those sanctions. In fact, they \ninitially opposed any role for Congress in reviewing the agreement.\n\n  The Senator from Tennessee is here, the chairman of the committee, \nand he will tell you they are somehow reluctant even for Congress to \nhave a role here, even to help them to be able to negotiate a better \nagreement. That was probably an indication of where we were going.\n  Despite that resistance, serious sanctions were enacted and Iran did \ncome to the table. I had hoped then that with firm U.S. leadership--\nleading from the front, not from behind--we would be able to bring the \ninternational community along to ensure that we did meet the criteria I \ntalked about earlier, longstanding, U.S.-international criteria. \nUnfortunately, after reviewing the terms of this agreement, it is \nexplicitly clear that these redlines, these objectives, the criteria we \nhave set out, have not been met.\n  We now have an obligation to reject this deal and begin to restore \nthe consensus, both at home and abroad, that the Iranian Government \nmust be isolated economically and diplomatically until it agrees to the \nlongstanding terms on which the United States and the international \ncommunity have long insisted. Some will say that is fine, but that is \nimpossible. I respectfully disagree.\n  I respectfully quote President Obama, who has said repeatedly that no \nagreement is better than a bad agreement; meaning keeping the sanctions \nin place is better than a bad agreement. I believe that is where we \nare. This is a bad agreement.\n  Among the many serious flaws of this deal is the fact that Iran can \ncontinue research and development on more advanced centrifuges and can \nresume enrichment in 15 years, providing, at best, only temporary \nrelief. Inspections, one of the most important safeguards we have, are \nnot anywhere, anytime, as was talked about by the administration. Under \nthis deal, Iran can delay the inspection of suspected nuclear sites for \nup to 24 days--and there is even a process to get to those 24 days. If \nthe Iranians cheat, as they have in the past, we would have to employ a \nconvoluted process to convince the international community to restore \nsanctions, a process I don't think we can rely on.\n  It is also important to note that other than reimposition of \nsanctions, the agreement does not specify any clear mechanism to \nenforce outcomes of the dispute resolution process, nor does it \nidentify penalties for failure to comply. This means that the only \nrealistic preagreed punishment for any violation--no matter how big or \nhow small--is full reimposition of sanctions.\n  In a way, as I look at this, this is like having the death penalty as \nthe only punishment for all crimes. I don't think that is realistic. I \ndon't think you are going to get the international community to go \nalong with that. That is why I worry about the compliance and the \nsanctions.\n  Given that only a full-blown Iranian violation would likely convince \nenough countries to reimpose all sanctions, I don't think the agreement \nprovides the concrete tools to address less overt but still subversive \nforms of Iranian cheating that are designed to test international \nresolve and establish a new baseline for acceptable behavior. By the \nway, based on past behavior, this is likely.\n  In addition, of course, the inspections regime is subject to side \ndeals between the United Nations, the International Atomic Agency, and \nIran that none of us are allowed to see. This is contrary, by the way, \nto the Iran review act that was passed by Congress and was signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States. The language of that \nlegislation is pretty clear. It requires the law to transmit to \nCongress ``the agreement as defined in subsection (h)(1) including all \nrelated materials and annexes.''\n  Then, when it talks about what that means it means, it says \n``including annexes, appendices, codicils, side agreements, \nimplementing materials, documents, guidance, technical or other \nunderstandings,'' and so on and so forth. It is all here. That is in \nthe agreement that we had with the President of the United States \nbecause it was part of the review act that he signed into law.\n  Based on recent press reporting, of course we are also hearing that \nIran will be allowed to self-inspect, use its own inspectors and \nequipment to report on possible military dimensions of past suspected \nnuclear activity at one of its most secretive and important military \nfacilities at Parchin.\n  Allowing a country accused of hiding a secret and illegal nuclear \nweapons program to implement verification measures for a facility where \nthis program is believed to have been hidden certainly undermines the \nPresident's claim that the Iran deal ``is not built on trust, it is \nbuilt on verification.''\n  Perhaps, most troubling is that this agreement ends Iran's \ninternational isolation without ending the behavior that caused Iran to \nbe isolated in the first place.\n  As the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, based on our own \nState Department analysis, Iran's nuclear program is just one part of a \nbroader strategy that is dangerous and destabilizing. According to some \nestimates, of course, Iran will receive up to $150 billion in sanctions \nrelief early in the agreement--by the way, with or without sustained \ncompliance--which will encourage the Iranians to cause trouble, to \nfurther support terrorist groups they sponsor.\n  National Security Advisor Susan Rice acknowledged something that I \nthink is pretty plain. She said:\n\n       Iran is sending money to these groups now while they're \n     under sanctions and they'll have more money to do it when \n     sanctions are relieved.\n\n  Within 5 years, the agreement lifts the embargo on conventional \nweapons and lifts the ballistic missile embargo within 8 years--a last-\nminute concession to Iran in the rush by the administration to get to \nyes. At a minimum, this deal will ensure that Iran remains a threshold \nnuclear power but with a new set of tools and more resources to hurt \nour interests and those of our allies in the region, including Israel.\n  I believe it is clear that the deal, as currently written, will set \nup a conventional arms race in the Middle East. The President says the \nalternative to this deal is war. In fact, a Middle East bristling with \narms will increase the risks of war--increase the risks of war because \nof this deal.\n  I have been involved in international negotiations. As U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, I understand they can be tough. I know both sides have \nto make concessions, but I also know that does not mean the United \nStates of America concedes on fundamental principles, on the redlines. \nWe have to have the courage to stand behind our legitimate public \npronouncements, whether it is with the use of chemical weapons by the \nAssad regime in Syria, whether it is the violation of both Minsk cease-\nfire agreements by the Russians and their proxies in eastern Ukraine or \nour commitment that Iran must stop and dismantle its march toward \nnuclear weapons. These are all things you negotiate. These are all \nthings you have to be firm on and tough on. It is not easy, but as \nAmericans that is what we do.\n  There was a speech written that was never given, that was meant to be \ngiven on November 23, 1963. It was the day John F. Kennedy was \nassassinated. He said in that speech about America's role: Our \ngeneration, our Nation, by destiny--rather than choice--are the watch \nguards on the walls of world freedom.\n  That is who we are. We have to be tough in these negotiations and \nstand tall. Other countries look to us to be tall, to help build the \nconsensus. That is what we had to do, and I believe we did not do in \nthis what I am sure was a very difficult negotiation.\n  We have to honor our redlines. If we expect them to be effective in \npromoting peace and stability, we must lead. In particular, we have to \nsay\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\nwhat we mean and mean what we say if we are going to stop nuclear \nproliferation. The way this agreement developed I think will encourage \nother countries who are interested in pursuing nuclear weapons to say: \nI don't care what the U.N. says. I don't care what the United States \nsays. What I see here is everything is negotiable. That is the message, \nI am afraid, this agreement will send.\n  The administration's position is that the only alternative to this \nagreement is war. That is what they are saying. As noted, if anything, \nI think this agreement will further destabilize an already turbulent \nregion, but there is an alternative. The alternative to this bad deal \nis a better deal. Supporters of this agreement have compared this \nagreement to Ronald Reagan's arms control negotiations with the \nSoviets.\n  I want to just touch on that for a moment because I have heard a lot \nof that on the floor. I take a very different lesson from that analogy \nto Ronald Reagan. President Reagan succeeded by raising the pressure, \nnot reducing it. He increased the cost of bad behavior until that \nbehavior changed. He didn't strike a deal unless it fulfilled the core \ngoals he had laid out, his redlines. He didn't want a deal for a deal's \nsake, and he was patient. At the Reykjavik summit in 1986, Ronald \nReagan walked away from what would have been a major nuclear \ndisarmament treaty with the Soviets because he felt the costs to U.S. \nnational security were too high. He was criticized for walking away, \nbut he kept trying. He held firm, and 1 year later he successfully \nconcluded negotiations on the intermediate nuclear forces treaty.\n  This body must not sign off on an agreement that fails to honor our \nredlines, that strengthens Iran's destabilizing influence in the \nregion, and does nothing to address the behavior that threatens our \nallies and our legitimate national security interests in this country.\n  We should reject this agreement with Iran and tighten those sanctions \non a bipartisan basis. The President should then use the leverage that \nonly America possesses to negotiate an international agreement that \ndoes meet the longstanding goals of the United Nations, of the \ninternational community, of the United States of America, of this \nCongress, and of the President himself.\n  We can't afford to get this one wrong, folks. We owe it to our \nchildren and grandchildren to get this right. As I noted in the \nbeginning of my remarks, this is about what kind of a world they are \ngoing to inherit.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in rejecting the deal \nand pursuing a better way.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, for 23 years as a member of the House \nForeign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I \nhave had the privilege of dealing with major foreign policy and \nnational security issues.\n  Many of those have been of a momentous nature. This is one of those \nmoments.\n  I come to the issue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with \nIran as someone who has followed Iran's nuclear ambition for the better \npart of two decades.\n  Unlike President Obama's characterization of those who have raised \nserious questions about the agreement or who have opposed it, I did not \nvote for the war in Iraq, I opposed it--unlike the Vice President and \nthe Secretary of State who both supported it. My vote against the Iraq \nwar was unpopular at the time, but it was one of the best decisions I \nhave ever made. I have not hesitated to diplomatically negotiate with \nour adversaries or enemies, as is evidenced, for example, by my vote \nfor the New START treaty with Russia.\n  I also don't come to the question as someone--unlike some of my \nRepublican colleagues--who reflexively opposes everything the President \nproposes.\n  In fact, I have supported President Obama--according to Congressional \nQuarterly--98 percent of the time in 2013 and 2014. On key policies--\nranging from voting for the Affordable Care Act to Wall Street reform, \nto supporting the President's Supreme Court nominees, defending the \nadministration's actions in the Benghazi tragedy, shepherding within 1 \nvote for the authorization for use of military force to stop President \nAssad's use of chemical weapons when I was chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, to so much more--I have been a reliable \nsupporter of the President, but my support is not and has not been \ndriven by party loyalty but rather by principled agreement, not \npolitical expediency. When I have disagreed, it is based on principled \ndisagreement.\n  The issue before the Senate now is whether to vote to approve or \ndisapprove the agreement struck by the President and our P5+1 partners \nwith Iran. This is one of the most serious national security, nuclear \nnonproliferation arms control issues of our time. It is not an issue of \nsupporting or opposing the President. This issue is much greater and \ngraver than that, and it deserves a vote.\n  With this agreement, I believe we have now abandoned our long-held \npolicy of preventing nuclear proliferation, and we are now embarked not \nupon preventing it but on managing it or containing it, which leaves us \nwith a far less desirable, less secure, and less certain world order.\n  So I am deeply concerned that this is a significant shift in our \nnonproliferation policy and about what it will mean in terms of a \npotential arms race in an already dangerous region.\n  Why does Iran, which has the world's fourth largest proven oil \nreserves, with 157 billion barrels of crude oil, and the world's second \nlargest proven natural gas reserves, with 1,193 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas, need nuclear power for domestic energy?\n  We know that despite the fact that Iran claims their nuclear program \nis for peaceful purposes, they have violated the international will, as \nexpressed by various U.N. Security Council resolutions, and by deceit, \ndeception, and delay advanced their program to the point of being a \nthreshold nuclear State.\n  It is because of these facts and the fact that the world believes \nIran was weaponizing its nuclear program at the Parchin military base--\nas well as developing a covert uranium enrichment facility in Fordow, \nbuilt deep inside a mountain, raising serious doubts about the peaceful \nnature of their civilian program--and their sponsorship of state \nterrorism that the world united against Iran's nuclear program.\n  So in that context let's remind ourselves of the stated purpose of \nour negotiations with Iran. Simply put, it was to dismantle significant \nparts of Iran's illicit nuclear infrastructure to ensure that it would \nnot have nuclear weapons capability at any time. We said we would \naccommodate Iran's practical national needs but not leave the region \nand the world facing the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran at a time of \nits choosing. In essence, we thought the agreement would be rollback \nfor rollback. You roll back your infrastructure, we roll back our \nsanctions. At the end of the day, what we appear to have is a roll back \nof sanctions and Iran only limiting its capability but not dismantling \nit or rolling back.\n\n  What did we get? We get an alarm bell should they decide to violate \ntheir commitments and a system for inspections to verify their \ncompliance. That, in my view, is a far cry from dismantling.\n  Now, while I have many specific concerns about the agreement, my \noverarching concern is that it requires no dismantling of Iran's \nnuclear infrastructure and only mothballs that infrastructure for 10 \nyears. Not even one centrifuge will be destroyed under this agreement. \nFordow will be repurposed, Arak redesigned. The fact is everyone needs \nto understand what this agreement does and does not do so they can \ndetermine whether providing Iran permanent relief in exchange for \nshort-term promises is a fair trade.\n  This deal does not require Iran to destroy or fully decommission a \nsingle uranium enrichment centrifuge. In fact, over half of Iran's \ncurrently operating centrifuges will continue to spin at its Natanz \nfacility. The remainder, including more than 5,000 operating \ncentrifuges and 10,000 not yet functioning, will merely be disconnected \nand transferred to another hall at Natanz, where they could be quickly \nreinstalled to enrich uranium.\n  Yet we, along with our allies, have agreed to lift the sanctions and \nallow\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\nbillions of dollars to flow back into Iran's economy. We lift \nsanctions, but even during the first 10 years of the agreement Iran \nwill be allowed to continue R activity on a range of centrifuges, \nallowing them to improve their effectiveness over the course of the \nagreement.\n  Clearly, the question is: What did we get from this agreement in \nterms of what we originally sought? We lift sanctions, and at year 8 \nIran can actually start manufacturing and testing advanced IR-6 and IR-\n8 centrifuges that enrich up to 15 times the speed of its current \nmodels. At year 15, Iran can start enriching uranium beyond 3.67 \npercent, the level at which we become concerned about fissile material \nfor a bomb. At year 15, Iran will have no limits on its uranium \nstockpile.\n  This deal grants Iran permanent sanctions relief in exchange for only \ntemporary--temporary--limitations on its nuclear program. Not a rolling \nback, not dismantlement, but temporary limits. In fact, at year 10, the \nU.N. Security Council resolution will disappear, along with the dispute \nresolution mechanism needed to snap back U.N. sanctions and the 24-day \nmandatory access provision for suspicious sites in Iran.\n  The deal enshrines for Iran and, in fact, commits the international \ncommunity to assisting Iran in developing an industrial-scale nuclear \nprogram, complete with industrial-scale enrichment.\n  Now, while I understand this program will be subject to Iran's \nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons, I think it fails to appreciate Iran's history of deception in \nits nuclear program and its violations of the NPT. It will, in the long \nrun, if we believe there is a violation, make it much harder to \ndemonstrate that Iran's program is not in fact being used for peaceful \npurposes because Iran will have legitimate reasons to have advanced \ncentrifuges and a robust enrichment program. We will then have to \ndemonstrate its intention is dual use and not justified by its \nindustrial nuclear power program.\n  Within about a year of Iran meeting its initial obligations, Iran \nwill receive sanctions relief to the tune of $100 billion to $150 \nbillion, not just in the release of frozen assets that don't amount to \nthat amount, but also in renewed oil sales of another million barrels a \nday as well as relief from sectoral sanctions in the petrochemical, \nshipbuilding, shipping, port sectors, gold and other precious metals, \nand software and automotive sectors.\n  Iran will also benefit from the removal of designated entities, \nincluding major banks, shipping companies, oil and gas firms from the \nU.S. Treasury list of sanctioned entities. ``Of the nearly 650 entities \nthat have been designated by the U.S. Treasury for their role in Iran's \nnuclear and missile program or for being controlled by the government \nof Iran, more than 67 percent will be delisted within 6 to 12 months,'' \naccording to testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  For Iran, all this relief comes likely within a year, even though its \nobligations stretch out for a decade or more. Considering the fact it \nwas President Rouhani who, after conducting its fiscal audit after his \nelection, likely convinced the Ayatollah that Iran's regime could not \nsustain itself under the sanctions and knew that only a negotiated \nagreement would get Iran the relief it critically needed to sustain the \nregime and the revolution, the negotiating leverage was and still is \ngreatly on our side.\n  However, the JCPOA, in paragraph 26 of the sanctions heading of the \nagreement, says, ``The U.S. Administration, acting consistently with \nthe respective roles of the President and the Congress, will refrain \nfrom reintroducing or reimposing sanctions specified in Annex II, that \nit has ceased applying under this JCPOA.''\n  I repeat: The United States will have to refrain from reintroducing \nor reimposing the Iran sanctions act that we passed unanimously, which \nexpires next year and was critical in bringing Iran to the table in the \nfirst place.\n  In two hearings I asked Treasury Secretary Lew and Under Secretary of \nState Wendy Sherman whether the United States has the right to \nreauthorize sanctions to have something to snap back to, and neither \nwould answer the question, saying only it was too early to discuss \nreauthorization.\n  But I did get my answer from the Iranian Ambassador to the United \nNations who, in a letter dated July 25 of this year, said:\n\n       It is clearly spelled out in the JCPOA that both the \n     European Union and the United States will refrain from \n     reintroducing or reimposing the sanctions and restrictive \n     measures lifted under the JCPOA. It is understood that the \n     reintroduction or reimposition, including through extension \n     of the sanctions and restrictive measures will constitute \n     significant nonperformance which would relieve Iran from its \n     commitments in part or in whole.\n\n  The administration cannot argue sanctions policy both ways. Either \nthey were effective in getting Iran to the negotiating table or they \nwere not. Sanctions are either a deterrent to breakout or a violation \nof the agreement or they are not. Frankly, in my view, the overall \nsanctions relief being provided, given the Iranians' understanding of \nrestrictions on the reauthorization of sanctions, along with the \nlifting of the arms and missile embargo well before Iranian compliance \nover years is established, leaves us in a weaker position and, to me, \nis unacceptable.\n  If anything is a fantasy, it is the belief that snapback without \ncongressionally mandated sanctions, with EU sanctions gone and \ncompanies from around the world doing permissible business in Iran, \nwill have any real effect. As the largest state sponsor of terrorism, \nIran--which has exported its revolution to Assad in Syria, the Houthis \nin Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, directed and supported attacks against \nAmerican troops in Iraq--will be flush with money not only to invest in \ntheir domestic economy but to further pursue their destabilizing \nhegemonic goals in the region.\n  If Iran can afford to destabilize the region with an economy \nstaggering under sanctions and rocked by falling oil prices, what will \nIran and the Quds Force do when they have a cash infusion of more than \n20 percent of their GDP--the equivalent of an infusion of $3.4 trillion \ninto our economy?\n  And if there is a fear of war in the region, it will be one fueled by \nIran and its proxies, exacerbated by an agreement that allows Iran to \npossess an industrial-sized nuclear program and enough money in \nsanctions relief to significantly continue to fund its hegemonic \nintentions throughout the region.\n  This brings me to another major concern with the JCPOA, namely the \nissue of Iran coming clean about the possible military dimension of its \nprogram. For well over a decade, the world has been concerned about the \nsecret weaponization efforts conducted at the military base called \nParchin. The goal we in the international community have long sought is \nto know what Iran accomplished at Parchin, not necessarily to get Iran \nto declare culpability but to determine how far along they were in \ntheir nuclear weaponization program so that we know what signatures to \nlook for in the future.\n  David Albright, a physicist and former nuclear weapons inspector and \nfounder of the Institute for Science and International Security, has \nsaid, ``Addressing the IAEA's concerns about the military dimensions of \nIran's nuclear programs is fundamental to any long-term agreement . . . \nan agreement that sidesteps the military issue would risk being \nunverifiable.''\n  The reason he says an agreement that sidesteps the military issues \nwould be unverifiable is because it makes a difference if you are 90 \npercent down the road in your weaponization efforts or only 10 percent \nadvanced. How far advanced Iran's weaponizing abilities are has a \nsignificant impact on what Iran's breakout time to an actual \ndeliverable weapon will be.\n  The list of scientists the P5+1 wanted the IAEA to interview were \nrejected outright by Iran. After waiting over 10 years to inspect \nParchin, they are now given 3 months to do all of their review and \nanalysis before they must deliver a report in December of this year.\n  How the inspections and soil and other samples are to be collected \nare outlined in two secret agreements the U.S. Congress is not privy \nto. The answer as to why we cannot see those documents is because they \nhave a confidentiality agreement between the\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nIAEA and Iran which, they say, is customary, but this issue is anything \nbut customary.\n  Let me quote from an AP story of August 14:\n\n       They say the agency will be able to report in December. But \n     that assessment is unlikely to be unequivocal because chances \n     are slim that Iran will present all the evidence the agency \n     wants, or give it the total freedom of movement it needs to \n     follow up the allegations. Still, the report is expected to \n     be approved by the IAEA's board, which includes the United \n     States and other powerful nations that negotiated the July 14 \n     agreement. They do not want to upend their July 14 deal, and \n     will see the December report as closing the books on the \n     issue.\n\n  It would seem to me what we are doing is sweeping this critical issue \nunder the rug.\n  Our willingness to accept this process in Parchin is only exacerbated \nby the inability to achieve anytime, anywhere inspections, which the \nadministration always held out as one of those essential elements we \nwould insist on and could rely on in any deal. Instead, we have a \ndispute resolution mechanism that shifts the burden of proof to the \nUnited States and its partners to provide sensitive intelligence, \npossibly revealing our sources and methods by which we collected the \ninformation, and allow the Iranians to delay access for nearly a \nmonth--a delay that would allow them to remove evidence of a violation, \nparticularly when it comes to centrifuge research and development and \nweaponization efforts that can be easily hidden and would leave little \nor no signatures.\n  The administration suggests that other than Iraq, no country was \nsubjected to anytime, anywhere inspections. But Iran's defiance of the \nworld's position, as recognized in a series of U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, does not make it any other country. It is their violations \nof the NPT and the Security Council resolutions that created the \nnecessity for a unique regime and for anytime, anywhere inspections. \nThe willingness to accept these limitations are a dangerous bellwether \nof our willingness to enforce violations of the agreement as we move \nforward.\n  If what President Obama said in his NPR interview of April 7, 2015--\n``a more relevant fear would be that in year 13, 14, 15 they have \nadvanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that \npoint breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero''--is true, \nit seems to me, in essence, this deal, at best, does nothing more than \nthat kick today's problem down the road for 10 to 15 years. At the same \ntime it undermines the arguments and evidence of suspected violations \nwe will need because of the dual-use nature of their program to \nconvince the Security Council and the international community to take \naction.\n  It is erroneous to say this agreement permanently stops Iran from \nhaving a nuclear bomb. Let us be clear. What the agreement does is to \nrecommit Iran not to pursue a nuclear bomb--a promise they have already \nviolated in the past. It recommits them to the NPT treaty--an agreement \nthey have already violated in the past. It commits them to a new \nSecurity Council resolution outlining their obligations, but they have \nviolated those in the past as well.\n\n  So the suggestion of permanence in this case is only possible for so \nlong as Iran complies and performs according to the agreement because \nthe bottom line is, this agreement leaves Iran with the core elements \nof its robust nuclear infrastructure.\n  The fact is, success is not a question of Iran's conforming and \nperforming according to the agreement. If that was all that was needed, \nif Iran had abided by its commitments all along, we wouldn't be faced \nwith this challenge now. The test of success must be, if Iran violates \nthe agreement and attempts to break out, how well will we be positioned \nto deal with Iran at that point?\n  Trying to reassemble the sanctions regime, including the time to give \ncountries and companies notice of sanctionable activity, which had been \npermissible up to then, would take up most of the breakout time, \nassuming we could even get compliance after significant national and \nprivate investments had taken place. That, indeed, would be a fantasy. \nIt would likely leave the next President, upon an Iranian decision to \nbreak out, with one of two choices: Accept Iran as a nuclear weapons \nstate or take military action. Neither is desired, especially when Iran \nwill be stronger, economically resurgent, a more consequential actor in \nthe region, and with greater defensive capabilities, such as the S-300 \nmissile defense system being sold to them by Russia.\n  So the suggestion of permanency in stopping Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon depends on performance. Based on the long history of \nIran's broken promises, defiance, and violations, that is hopeful. \nSignificant dismantlement, however, would establish performance up \nfront, and therefore the threat of the capability to develop a nuclear \nweapon would truly be permanent, and any attempt to rebuild that \ninfrastructure would give the world far more than 1 year's time.\n  The President and Secretary Kerry have repeatedly said the choice is \nbetween this agreement or war. I reject that proposition, as have most \nwitnesses--including past and present administration members involved \nin this issue--who have testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and who support the deal but reject the binary choice between \nthe agreement or war. If the P5 had not actually achieved an agreement \nwith Iran, would we be at war with Iran today? I don't believe so.\n  I believe we can still get a better deal, and here is how: We can \ndisapprove this agreement without rejecting the entire agreement. We \nshould direct the administration to renegotiate by authorizing the \ncontinuation of negotiations and the joint plan of action--including \nIran's $700 million-a-month lifeline, which to date has accrued to \nIran's benefit to the tune of $10 billion--and pausing further \nreductions of purchases of Iranian oil and other sanctions pursuant to \nthe original JPOA. Iran will continue to want such relief as well as \navoid a possible military attack, so they are incentivized to come back \nto the negotiating table.\n  We can provide specific parameters for the administration to guide \ntheir continued negotiations and ensure that a new agreement does not \nrun afoul of Congress. A continuation of talks would allow the \nreconsideration of just a few but a critical few issues, including the \nfollowing:\n  First, the immediate ratification by Iran of the Additional Protocol \nto ensure that we have a permanent international agreement with Iran \nfor access to suspect sites.\n  Second, a ban on centrifuge R for the duration of the agreement to \nensure that Iran won't have the capacity to quickly break out just as \nthe U.N. Security Council resolution and snapback sanctions are off the \ntable.\n  Third, close the Fordow enrichment facility. The sole purpose of \nFordow was to harden Iran's nuclear program to a military attack. We \nneed to close the facility and foreclose Iran's future ability to use \nthis facility. If Iran has nothing to hide, they shouldn't need to put \nit deep under a mountain.\n  Fourth, the full resolution of the ``possible military dimensions'' \nof Iran's program. We need an arrangement that isn't set to whitewash \nthis issue. Iran and the IAEA must resolve the issue before permanent \nsanctions relief, and failure of Iran to cooperate with a comprehensive \nreview should result in automatic sanctions snapback.\n  Fifth, extend the duration of the agreement. One of the single most \nconcerning elements of the deal is its 10- to 15-year sunset of \nrestrictions on Iran's program, with off-ramps starting after year 8. \nWe were promised an agreement of significant duration, and we got less \nthan half of what we are looking for. Iran should have to comply for as \nlong as they deceived the world's position, so at least 20 years.\n  Sixth, we need agreement now about what penalties will be \ncollectively imposed by P5+1 for Iranian violations, both small and \nmidsized, as well as a clear statement as to the so-called grandfather \nclause in paragraph 37 of the JCPOA, to ensure that the U.S. position \nabout not shielding contracts entered into legally upon reimposition of \nsanctions is shared by our allies.\n  Separately from the agreement but at the same time, we should extend \nthe authorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, which expires in 2016, to \nensure that we have an effective snapback option.\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\n  We should immediately implement the security measures offered to our \npartners in the gulf summit at Camp David, while preserving Israel's \nqualitative military edge.\n  The President should unequivocally affirm and Congress should endorse \na declaration of U.S. policy that we will use all means necessary to \nprevent Iran from producing enough enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb, \nas well as building or buying one, both during and after any agreement. \nAfter all, that is what Iran is committing to. We should authorize now \nthe means for Israel to address the Iranian threat on their own in the \nevent Iran accelerates its program.\n  We must send a message to Iran that neither their regional behavior \nnor nuclear ambitions are permissible. If we push back regionally, they \nwill be less likely to test the limits of our tolerance toward any \nviolation of a nuclear agreement.\n  The agreement that has been reached failed to achieve the one thing \nit set out to achieve--it failed to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear \nweapons state at a time of its choosing. In fact, in my view, it \nauthorizes and supports the very roadmap Iran will need to achieve its \ntarget.\n  I know the administration will say that our partners will not follow \nus, that the sanctions regime will collapse and that they will allow \nIran to proceed--as if our allies weren't worried about Iran crossing \nthe nuclear weapons capability threshold anymore. I heard similar \narguments from Secretary Kerry when he was chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, as well as from Wendy Sherman, David Cohen, and \nothers, when I was leading the charge to impose new sanctions on Iran. \nThat didn't happen then, and I don't believe it will happen now.\n  Despite what some of our P5+1 Ambassadors have said in trying to \nrally support for the agreement--clearly, since they want this deal, \nthey are not going to tell us they are willing to pursue another deal, \nechoing the administration's admonition that it is a ``take it or leave \nit'' proposition--our P5+1 partners will still be worried about Iran's \nnuclear weapons desire and the capability to achieve it, and the United \nStates is the indispensable partner to ultimately ensure that doesn't \nhappen.\n  They and the businesses from their countries and elsewhere will truly \ncare more about their ability to do business in a U.S. economy of $17 \ntrillion than an Iranian economy of $415 billion. And the importance of \nthat economic relationship is palpable as we negotiate T-TIP, the \nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement.\n  At this point, it is important to note that, over history, Congress \nhas rejected outright or demanded changes to more than 200 treaties and \ninternational agreements, including 80 that were multilateral.\n  Whether or not the supporters admit it, this deal is based on hope--\nhope that when the nuclear sunset clause expires, Iran will have \nsuccumbed to the benefits of commerce and global integration; hope that \nthe hardliners will have lost their power and the revolution will end \nits hegemonic goals; and hope that the regime will allow the Iranian \npeople to decide their fate, unlike the green revolution of 2009. Hope \nis part of human nature, but unfortunately it is not a national \nsecurity strategy. The Iranian regime, led by the Ayatollah, wants \nabove all to preserve the regime and its revolution, so it stretches \nincredulity to believe they signed on to a deal that would in any way \nweaken the regime or threaten the goals of the revolution.\n  I understand this deal represents a tradeoff, a hope that things may \nbe different in Iran in 10 to 15 years. Maybe Iran will desist from its \nnuclear ambitions. Maybe they will stop exporting and supporting \nterrorism. Maybe they will stop holding innocent Americans hostage. \nMaybe they will stop burning American flags. Maybe their leadership \nwill stop chanting ``Death to America'' in the streets of Tehran. Or \nmaybe they won't.\n  I know that in many respects it would be far easier to support this \ndeal, as it would have been to vote for the war in Iraq at the time. \nBut I didn't choose the easier path then, and I am not going to now. My \ndevotion to principle may once again lead me to an unpopular course, \nbut if Iran is to acquire a nuclear bomb, it will not have my name on \nit.\n  It is for these reasons that I will vote for cloture and to \ndisapprove the agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, just inquiring--it is my understanding \nthat Senator Warner and Senator Coons are to speak now. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order to that effect.\n  Mr. CORKER. It is my understanding that we have agreed to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is under the control of the Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. CORKER. How much time is left? That is really what I was getting \nat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democrat leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Tennessee through the \nChair, it is my understanding that we have two 5-minute segments now. \nSenator Warner and Senator Coons each claim 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. It is my understanding, then, that we will have that and \nthen we move to an alternating session until the time of the vote. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is equally divided time until the vote, \nafter the time allotted for the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. CORKER. And there is 10 minutes left on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Virginia can proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in speaking \non the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  While this deal is far from perfect, I believe it is the best option \navailable to us right now for preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon.\n  I share many of the concerns with this agreement that have been \nexpressed by my colleagues, but the choice I ultimately had to make was \nbetween accepting an imperfect deal or facing the serious ramifications \nthroughout the world if Congress rejects a deal that has the support of \nthe international community, including many of our allies.\n  As I reviewed this agreement, I kept two fundamental questions in \nmind: No. 1, does this agreement advance the goal of keeping Iran free \nof nuclear weapons, and No. 2, is there a viable alternative that would \nbe superior to this deal?\n  As many colleagues before me have outlined, this deal outlines a \nsignificant reduction in Iran's fissile material stockpile, reducing \ntheir uranium stockpile by 98 percent. It restricts Iran's production \ncapacity and completely removes their ability to produce weapons-grade \nplutonium. It further limits Iran's research and development \nactivities. These reductions and restrictions on Iran's nuclear \ninfrastructure will extend Iran's breakout time from a matter of months \nto at least 1 year over the next 15 years.\n  This agreement also established a verification regime that includes \ncontinuous inspections. With the assistance of our intelligence \ncommunity, verification goes beyond the four corners of this agreement. \nWhat this means is that we will have significantly more information \nabout Iran's nuclear program with this deal than we would have without \nit.\n  The other major question we have to ask is, Is there a viable \nalternative to this deal? I have given those opponents numerous \nopportunities to convince me there was a viable alternative. The \nconclusion I have reached is that there is not.\n  I have been a strong supporter of tough international sanctions that \nhelped bring Iran to the negotiating table in the first place. Since I \nhave been in the Senate, I have supported every important piece of \nsanctions legislation passed by Congress. But during my deliberations, \nI spoke with representatives of many foreign governments--not the EU or \nthe P5+1 entirely but also those nations, particularly in Asia--about \nwhether they would be\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\nwilling to uphold sanctions to pressure Iran if we turned this deal \ndown. In virtually every case, the response I got from allies was that \nif Congress were to reject this deal, the vast international sanctions \nthat we have in place would fall apart. As we saw in the literally \ndozens of years prior, just U.S. unilateral sanctions alone are not \nenough.\n  I have determined that moving forward with this international \nagreement is our best option now to advance U.S. and world security.\n  I know we have other Members who want to speak, but let me add a \ncouple of final comments.\n  While I support this deal, I believe there are additional actions \nCongress can and should take to strengthen it. I want to make sure that \nwe--the United States--have the ability to respond to any Iranian \nactivities with all means at our disposal.\n  While the inspections provided in this deal will give us better \ninsight, there is more we can do. I am working with my colleagues--both \nsupporters and opponents of the deal--on efforts to shore up its weaker \npoints. I will work to clarify that Congress retains the ability to \npass sanctions against Iran for nonnuclear misbehavior. My hope is that \nin future legislation, we will spell out that this agreement will not \nshield foreign companies if sanctions must be reimposed because of \nIranian violations. And I will seek more reporting from the \nadministration, including on how Iran uses any funds received through \nsanctions relief.\n  Moving forward, I will work with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure Israel's security. I will press the administration and \nwork with my colleagues to ensure that Israel preserves a qualitative \nmilitary edge. I will look for ways to strengthen our commitments to \nIsrael and support additional efforts to stop Iran from advancing both \nthe nuclear agenda and from other efforts to destabilize the region.\n\n  Let me assure you that this agreement is the beginning and not the \nend of our combined international efforts to keep Iran free--not just \ntoday and not just for the next 15 years but forever--from having a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Before my colleague from Delaware speaks, I want to thank him for his \nefforts and many of us who spent a great deal of time the last few \nweeks of August talking about how we could build upon this agreement to \nmake it stronger. He received assurances from the President and \nletters. I know that he and I and others are working on how we can even \nmove beyond those assurances to make sure that we can look back on this \nagreement and recognize that we move not only the issue of peace but \nthe issue of security going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from the \ngreat State of Virginia and a number of other colleagues who have \ndedicated a great deal of time to reflecting and to consulting together \nabout what is the wisest and best path forward. The Senator from \nMaryland who is ably leading the floor debate and is the minority \nranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee and my colleague, and \nthe Senator from Colorado, who will speak following me, are among many \nwhom I have closely consulted. As was just remarked upon on the floor \nby the talented Senator from Virginia, this is a deal with flaws and \nwith challenges that we must work together to address. I am hopeful and \neager to find that path with the administration and with my colleagues \nto ensure that we do everything we can to deploy the full measure of \nAmerica's military and economic capabilities to ensure the security of \nIsrael and to ensure that this agreement--now that it is clear it will \nmove forward--is fully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly implemented.\n  I want to rise briefly to address what I understand is now a \nscheduled cloture vote at 3:45 today. On critical and historic issues \nsuch as the nuclear agreement with Iran, I think the American people \ndeserve to know how their individual Members of Congress--whether in \nthe Senate or the House--will vote as their representatives. Over the \nyears that I have served here, there have been far too many issues that \nwere decided by a procedural vote--by a cloture vote--rather than by \ngetting to the substance of the underlying issue. I think the American \npeople deserve better than to have a critical issue such as this \ncomplex deal ultimately resolved with a procedural vote.\n  As we proceed to that vote later today, I wanted to let those who are \nwatching know that is not the end of debate on this issue. If the \ncloture vote fails, as I believe it will, it means we will simply \ncontinue the debate and may take up another vote or several votes next \nweek.\n  This morning leader Reid made a fair offer to Senator McConnell, the \nmajority leader, on this floor to have a single up-or-down vote by a \n60-vote margin, to clearly show the American people how every Member of \nthis Chamber feels about this deal--to allow us to vote on the \nsubstance. It is my hope that the majority leader will reconsider and \nthat either today or next week we will have the opportunity to have \nthat up-or-down vote and to let the American people know exactly where \neach of us stands and then get to the demanding and difficult work of \nbuilding a bipartisan coalition to deal with the challenges of this \ndeal, to insist on effective deterrence of Iran's nuclear ambitions and \nto find a path together to joining the international community that is \njoined in the implementation of this deal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the agreement the \nP5+1 powers reached on Iran's nuclear program.\n  I was an early cosponsor of the bill that gave Congress an \nopportunity to evaluate the agreement. Because of that legislation, we \nhave had extensive discussion and debate. This Chamber has a history of \nvoting on critical national security issues at a 60-vote threshold, and \nI would have preferred an up-or-down vote on the merits. But, as too \noften happens, politics have prevailed, and this will likely be the \nonly vote we will have on this agreement. So this vote serves as the \nvote on the substance.\n  In 2003, Iran was operating approximately 164 centrifuges and had \nvirtually no enriched uranium. By 2009, when the current administration \ntook office, Iran had between 4,000 and 5,000 centrifuges installed.\n  Over the next few years, Congress passed increasingly tough sanctions \nthat the administration, to its credit, set out to implement. As a \nmember of the banking committee in 2010, I helped write and pass those \nsanctions.\n  By 2013, even in the grasp of the toughest international sanctions \nregime, Iran's nuclear program had raced forward.\n  The country had 19,000 centrifuges installed, 10 bombs worth of \nenriched uranium, and 2 to 3 months' breakout time to a bomb.\n  The harsh reality is that today Iran stands on the threshold of a \nnuclear weapon.\n  So we have to weigh the agreement against this set of facts.\n  Our goal throughout this process has been clear: to prevent Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  Like many Members of this Chamber, I have undertaken an exhaustive \nreview of the agreement and a lengthy consultation process.\n  This included briefings from our own national security and \nintelligence experts, international verification experts, regional \nexperts, former Israeli military and intelligence officials, and the \nP5+1 Ambassadors as well as Israel's Ambassador to the United States.\n  My conclusion is that the JCPOA is more likely to prevent Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon than the plausible alternatives. For that \nreason, I will vote to support the agreement.\n  It is no surprise to me that there are sincere, heartfelt differences \nof opinion about the merits of this deal. I have deep concerns about \nwhat the shape of Iran's nuclear program could look like beyond the 15 \nyear horizon. But I also believe that implementation of this agreement \nis the best of bad options.\n  If Congress rejects this agreement, Iran will receive billions of \ndollars of sanctions relief and there will be no oversight of its \nnuclear program. That is an unacceptable result.\n  Some have argued that the United States could reject this agreement \nin favor of returning to the negotiating table. But this logic only \nholds if the\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\ninternational coalition holds, and everything I heard this summer tells \nme that won't happen.\n  While this agreement has flaws, it is clearly better than the \nalternatives. The agreement is the best option for preventing Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon, and it maintains all of our options to \nrespond to a move by Iran to break out to a bomb.\n  The agreement doesn't eliminate the deep concerns I hold about Iran's \nhorrific acts of terror and its hegemonic pursuits, but all of Iran's \nmalevolent acts would only be more dangerous if backed by a nuclear \nweapon.\n  We must also help our closest ally in the region, the State of \nIsrael, defend itself. Let me be clear. The survival of the State of \nIsrael is essential to the security of the Jewish people, and, as far \nas I am concerned, Israel's survival is essential to our humanity.\n  For these reasons and for our own security, we cannot allow Iran to \nacquire a nuclear weapon, and we must be crystal clear that we will use \nforce to prevent it from doing so. In fact, we will have more \ncredibility to use force if this agreement is in place, and we will \nhave more legitimacy when we work to build an international coalition \nto respond to Iranian cheating.\n  There are risks to the successful implementation of the agreement, \nand the President and Congress must now work to make it stronger. I \nhave worked with others in the Senate to push the administration toward \nthat goal.\n  Since the announcement of the agreement, I have also worked with \nSenator Cardin to develop a legislative package to address the \naccumulated shortcomings of our policies towards Iran and to strengthen \nthe agreement.\n  Among other measures, our legislation will ensure that we track the \nresources Iran obtains from sanctions relief and work with our regional \npartners to counter conventional Iranian threats. It also invests in \nour intelligence capabilities and provides Israel deterrence to ensure \nIran cannot shield covert systems and facilities, no matter how deeply \nthey are buried.\n  As we implement this agreement, we must set in place a strategy with \nour partners to ensure that Iran appreciates the consequences of its \nviolations, for the next 15 years and beyond.\n  My grandparents, John and Halina Klejman, and my mother Susanne \nKlejman had everyone and everything they knew taken from them in the \nHolocaust. Yet, as my grandmother always told me, they were the lucky \nones--they had the chance to rebuild their shattered lives in a country \nthat accepted them and let them succeed beyond their wildest dreams.\n  We live in dangerous times, and whether you support the agreement or \nnot, we must develop a cohesive strategy for U.S. policy in the Middle \nEast that addresses the grave security concerns in the region. Separate \nfrom Iran's nuclear program, the region is threatened by war, sectarian \nviolence, a terrible refugee crisis, and acts of barbaric brutality \nthat belong to another century. We should seize this opportunity to \nplay a constructive role in addressing these threats.\n  Our young men and women in the Armed Forces have been asked to \nsacrifice so much. None of us can have any doubt that, if called upon \nagain, they would rise to any challenge, anywhere in the world. We \nhonor their courage and spirit of sacrifice by exhausting diplomatic \noptions before we turn to military ones. This isn't a sign of weakness \nbut proof of our strength. And it will help us rally our allies to our \nside if ultimately we need to turn to military action.\n  Our primary objectives are to prevent Iran from having a nuclear \nweapon, make sure Israel is safe, and, if possible, avoid another war \nin the Middle East. This agreement represents a flawed but important \nstep to accomplish those goals. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now \ngoing to have brief comments, alternating between the two sides. We \nwill begin with Senator Gardner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee for his work to get us to this point, the \ncountless hearings he has held, the briefings that we have had to fully \nunderstand the fine details and to scrutinize every aspect of the \nagreement that is now before us. I also wish to thank the ranking \nmember and the Senator from New Jersey for their tireless efforts on \nthe committee when it comes to the process that is before us.\n  Make no mistake. There is not a single Member in this body, in the \nSenate or House of Representatives, or the American public who would \ncomplain about the President's initial goals--the goals he laid out as \nrecently as October of 2012, as he began negotiations with Iran.\n  I quote the President:\n\n       Our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up \n     its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that \n     have been in place. . . . But the deal we'll accept is--they \n     end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\n\n  But the deal we got from the administration is anything but the \nstraightforward ending of a nuclear program. I have listened very \ncarefully to the hearings we have held. I have listened to the \nclassified briefings. I have studied the language of the text--language \nthat says things such as this: ``Requests for access pursuant to \nprovisions of this JCPOA will be made in good faith, with due \nobservance of the sovereign rights of Iran, and kept to the minimum \nnecessary to effectively implement the verification responsibilities \nunder this JCPOA.''\n  Senator Collins from Maine a couple of days ago said it very well: \n``Not only will Iran retain its nuclear capability, but also it will be \na far richer nation and one that has more conventional weapons and \nmilitary technology than it possesses today.''\n  This doesn't end the nuclear program as the President stated was his \ngoals. It continues it. It paves a patient pathway to an industrialized \nnuclear complex in Iran. With the blessings of the world community, a \nflourishing economy, a lifting of the conventional arms embargo, a \nlifting of the ballistic missile embargo--and that is a good deal for \nus?\n  Over the last several days, I have heard colleague after colleague \nwho are supporting this deal come to the floor to say things such as: \nThis deal is flawed. It is not the best. It needs improvement. Since \nwhen did a bad option in the Senate become the only option in the \nSenate? Since when did second, third, fourth, fifth best for this \ncountry become the best for this country?\n  Several months ago I had the opportunity--as have many colleagues--to \nvisit with Prime Minister Netanyahu to talk about the dance of \nporcupines created by entering this deal--the nuclear tripwire that \nwill be set up because this does not end Iran's nuclear program. \nThrough this deal, we have given up the golden nuggets of leverage that \nwe had with Iran--our leverage of sanctions that were beginning to \nwork. In fact, in the briefings that we have all attended, analysts \nhave said that our sanctions are eroding support for the regime daily, \nhurting their economy, devaluing their currency, and bringing them to \nthe table. Yet the deal that we have allows continued uranium \nenrichment, repeal of U.N. resolutions, and removal of the Iran nuclear \nissue from their agenda. That is the benefit of the bargain that the \nUnited States is about to enter into.\n  We heard talk over the past several days about status quo versus \nhypothetical. Here is the status quo that we will be entering into: a \nstatus quo that in 5 years allows conventional arms to resume in Iran, \na status quo that will allow ballistic missiles to resume in 8 years \nand advanced centrifuge research to continue.\n  As the chairman of the committee stated yesterday, talking about how \none IRH centrifuge could replace vast numbers of the current \ncentrifuges they have today, they will be allowed to keep apparently \nall for radioisotope purposes.\n  Why do they need ballistic missiles and conventional arms for \nradiation treatment? We have desanctioned and delisted numerous \nindividuals, people who were the fathers of the Iranian nuclear \nprogram, the A.Q. Khan of Iran, delisted, desanctioned under this deal.\n  Conglomerates of companies like IKO are delisted and desanctioned \nunder this deal. These are a group of companies that were sanctioned in \n2003 not\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\nbecause of nuclear arms-related issues but because of their threat to \nthe world financial system. That conglomerate is now desanctioned under \nthe terms of the deal. Sure, the United States gets to sanction them on \nour own, but as we heard today, yesterday, and the day before, the \nsanctions the United States has apparently aren't enough, and that is \nwhy we have to enter into this deal. Yet we have, as Juan Zarate said, \nthe Sword of Damocles holding over Iran's head with the snapback \nprovisions that apparently are good enough when we do them on our own.\n  One of the things that hasn't been talked about very much over the \npast several weeks is a letter that Secretary Kerry sent to every \nSenator on September 2. I think that was around the same day that \nenough votes were achieved to block or sustain the President's \nfilibuster.\n  In the first paragraph of this letter that every Senator received, \nthere are two sentences that I want to make sure everybody here \nrecognizes.\n\n       We share the concern expressed by many in Congress \n     regarding Iran's continued support for terrorist and proxy \n     groups throughout the region, its propping up of the Asad \n     regime in Syria, its efforts to undermine the stability of \n     its regional neighbors, and the threat it poses to Israel.\n\n  In the very next sentence, Secretary Kerry goes on to say:\n\n       We have no illusion that this behavior will change \n     following implementation of the JCPOA.\n\n  We have no illusion that Iran's behavior will change. That is the \nstatus quo.\n  The letter goes on to detail what we are going to do once this deal \nis entered into:\n\n       Additional U.S.-GCC working groups are focused on \n     counterterrorism, military preparedness . . . and the goal of \n     building political support for multilateral U.S.-GCC \n     ballistic missile defense (BMD) cooperation.\n\n  So we are going to enter into some deals to fight ballistic missiles \nthat this deal allows in 8 years.\n  The letter goes on to say that we will push back against Iran's arms \ntransfers. Conventional arms embargoes will be lifted in 5 years. The \nletter then goes on to say that we will work on Iran's Missile \nTechnology Control Regime guidelines about the transfer of sensitive \nsystems, such as ballistic missile technology, and yet this deal allows \nballistic missiles in 8 years.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       U.S. support for Israel and our Gulf partners has never \n     been a partisan issue, and we believe these proposals would \n     receive wide bipartisan support.\n\n  This is a partisan deal with bipartisan opposition, and I will submit \nthat the only element of bipartisanship on the Senate floor today is \nthe opposition.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to invoke cloture. The American people \ndeserve to know where the United States Senate stands and deserves to \nknow where their Members of the Senate stand with the United States.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in accordance with the law, Congress has \nbeen reviewing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for the past 53 \ndays. I have spent countless hours reading, being briefed and poring \nover the intelligence. I have diligently worked to make an informed \ndecision, one that weighs risk and considers a future 10, 15, 25 years \nfrom now. Without question, this vote is among the most serious I have \ntaken. This vote has monumental and enduring consequences.\n  Throughout my review of this deal, my questions have been: How does \nthis deal affect the safety and security of the United States? And how \ndoes this deal affect the safety, security and viability of Israel?\n  For all my time in both the House and Senate, I have been an \nunabashed and unwavering supporter of Israel. I have persistently \nsupported the sanctions that brought Iran to the table. I have been \ninsistent on foreign aid and military assistance to Israel that \nmaintains its qualitative military edge on missile defense. With the \nhorrors of the Holocaust in mind, I have been deeply committed to the \nneed for a Jewish homeland, the State of Israel, and its inherent \nability to defend itself, and for the United States to be an unwavering \npartner in Israel's defense. I have been and always will be committed \nto those principles.\n  I took an extensive review of this deal. I took a workman-like \napproach, covering every aspect of the deal: military, intelligence, \ndiplomatic, economic. I actually read the deal, both the classified and \nthe unclassified annex. I met the U.S. diplomats, nuclear experts and \nthe national security staff who negotiated the deal. I actively \nparticipated in every classified and unclassified briefing available to \nme. I took the additional step of traveling to Vienna to meet with the \nDirector General of the IAEA and his technical staff to evaluate for \nmyself, first hand, the inspection and verification requirements. I \nhave listened to my constituents, including leaders in the Jewish \ncommunity. I did my homework.\n  Throughout, I asked the tough questions. And I questioned the answers \nto those questions. These were my key questions: No. 1, does this \nagreement block the four pathways to a nuclear bomb: highly enriched \nuranium at Natanz, highly enriched uranium at Fordow, weapons grade \nplutonium, and covert attempts to produce fissile material? No. 2, is \nit verifiable? No. 3, do inspections work to detect overt and covert \nviolations of the agreement? No. 4, what is the impact of a 24-day \ndelay to get an inspection? No. 5, does the IAEA have the capacity to \nimplement the agreement? No. 6, what sanctions will be lifted, when and \nunder what conditions? No. 7, do snapback sanctions really have a snap? \nNo. 8, if we reject this deal, what are the alternatives that would be \neffective and achievable?\n  The answer to my first question--does it block the four pathways to a \nnuclear bomb?--is yes. This deal sufficiently blocks the four pathways \nto get to a bomb. There is no shortcut to a nuclear bomb. This deal \nfundamentally addresses that fact.\n  First, it blocks Iran's ability to have weapons-grade plutonium. The \nArak reactor would be redesigned. Spent fuel would be sent out of Iran \nin perpetuity. Efforts to use Arak for weapons-grade plutonium would be \ndetected.\n  Second, it drastically cuts Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities by \nreducing Iran's inventory of active centrifuges at Fordow and Natanz. \nThe deal also monitors the uranium supply chain and procurement channel \nfor 25 years.\n  Third, it reduces Iran's uranium stockpile below levels needed to \nmake a single bomb. It cuts the uranium stockpile by 98 percent, to 300 \nkilograms, for 15 years. It puts uranium enrichment of the remaining \nstockpile at 3.67 percent.\n  Fourth, by blocking the pathways, it makes it very difficult for Iran \nto develop a separate covert program.\n  In answering my second and third questions--is it verifiable? do \ninspections work to detect overt and covert violations of the \nagreement?--I have found that this deal provides sufficient \nverification and inspection mechanisms. The IAEA has extensive access \nto Iran's declared nuclear sites, making the detection of violations \nand a covert program more likely. The IAEA also has direct access to \ncentrifuge manufacturing sites to conduct inspections on short notice. \nUnder Iran's additional protocol, the verification and inspection \nprocess has also been scientifically reviewed and validated by the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's nuclear scientists and endorsed by 29 of the \nNation's top scientists, including several Nobel prizewinners who \ndescribed the inspection process as ``innovative and stringent.''\n  In answer to my fourth question--what is the impact of a 24-day delay \nto get inspections?--the IAEA will have daily access to Iran's declared \nnuclear facilities: Natanz, Arak and Fordo. The 24-day process would \napply to undeclared sites only. These would be sites where the IAEA \nsuspects Iran is conducting covert nuclear activities.\n  In answer to my fifth question--does the IAEA have the capacity to \nimplement the agreement?--I would say, yes. After visiting the IAEA in \nVienna and delving into the organization, I believe that it has \nsufficient expertise to implement this deal. But all nations involved \nin its funding, including but not limited to the United States, have to \nbe aggressively involved in monitoring the resources of the \norganization.\n  In answer to my sixth question--what sanctions will be lifted, when \nand under what conditions?--the parts of\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\nthe agreement that would lift sanctions are among its most complicated \nand controversial elements. I would have preferred a glidepath over a \n3-year period, or longer, for sanctions relief. Under the agreement, \nhowever, no sanctions will be lifted until Iran takes key steps: limits \nits uranium enrichment program, resolves issues with possible military \ndimensions, converts the Arak facility, and allows for proper \ninspections. And these steps must be certified by the IAEA, which will \ndeliver its key assessment of possible military dimensions on December \n15.\n  When these requirements are met, the U.S. will lift sanctions in key \nsectors: oil and gas; banking and financial services; insurance \nrelated; shipping, ship building and transport; gold and precious \nmetals; software; and people, including international travel visas. \nThat process will take 6 months to 1 year. The sanctions are lifted, \nnot terminated, and can be snapped back, per the agreement.\n  Which takes us to my seventh question--do snapback sanctions really \nhave a snap? Russia, China, India, and our European partners were very \nactive members of the negotiations with a common interest in Iran not \nhaving a nuclear weapon. I believe they would support a snapback in \nsanctions if a violation was identified and verified. But the snapback \nsanctions mechanism, while innovative, is untested.\n  Finally, I have asked if we reject this deal what the alternatives \nare that would be effective and achievable. I have considered the \nalternatives very closely, but in the end, they don't present a more \nviable option to this deal. The two alternatives are more sanctions or \nmilitary action.\n  Some have suggested we reject this deal and impose unilateral \nsanctions to force Iran back to the table, but maintaining or stepping \nup sanctions will only work if the sanction coalition holds together. \nIt is unclear if the European Union, Russia, China, India, and others \nwould continue sanctions if Congress rejects this deal. At best, \nsanctions would be porous or limited to unilateral sanctions by the \nU.S., but these are the same reasons that the efficacy of the snapback \nprovision is questioned. If you don't think snapback works, enhanced \nsanctions won't work either.\n  There are also those who have proposed military action as an \nalternative to end Iran's nuclear program, but taking military \nairstrikes against Iran would only set the program back for 3 years. It \nwould not terminate the program. Iran would continue to possess the \nknowledge of how to build a bomb and could redouble its resolve to \nobtain a weapon, completely unchecked. Iran would almost certainly use \nHezbollah or other proxies to attack Israel or conduct terrorist or \ncyber attacks against U.S. interests. The military option is always on \nthe table for the United States. We are not afraid to use it. But \nmilitary action should be the last resort, since it will have only \ntemporary effects versus the longer term effects of this deal.\n  No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian \nregime. I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \nis the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb. \nFor these reasons, I will vote in favor of this deal. However, Congress \nmust also reaffirm our commitment to the safety and security of Israel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, please advise both sides of the time \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 11 minutes 20 seconds, \nDemocrats have 5 minutes 5 seconds.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, over the past 5 months, we have learned \nmuch about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and the intentions of \nIran's ayatollahs. We know the nuclear deal will release billions of \ndollars to the terrorist-sponsoring Iranian regime. We know Qasem \nSoleimani and other terrorists who have killed Americans will be \nrelieved of international sanctions. We know the side deals between the \nIAEA and Iran--side deals we have yet to see in this Senate--may \nentrust the Iranian regime to collect its own verification samples at \nits most secret nuclear facilities, allowing Iran to monitor itself \ninstead of insisting on real, verifiable, and independent inspections.\n\n  We know the right to enrich at all, which this administration \nconceded early on in these negotiations, will trigger an arms race in \nthe Middle East. Just this week, the ambassador from the United Arab \nEmirates told the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that \nif this deal goes through, the UAE may no longer abide by its \nnonproliferation agreements and may begin an enrichment program. I fear \nSaudi Arabia, Turkey, and other countries may follow suit.\n  We know the ayatollahs--fresh from the negotiating table at Vienna--\ncontinue to lead Quds Day crowds in chants of ``Death to America'' and \nissue threats at our president and our people.\n  And, yes, we know that the deal will begin to expire in a mere 10 to \n15 years, unleashing a nuclear-capable Iran on the world, free of \ninternational sanctions, with a healthier economy, and without the \nrestraints that American diplomacy has painstakingly cultivated over \nthe past decade.\n  But, in the end, our vote on the Iran nuclear deal won't turn on any \nof these particulars. Ultimately, this vote isn't about specific \ncentrifuge numbers or enrichment levels or the exact scope of sanctions \nrelief. No, it is simpler than that.\n  This vote is about history. It is about the responsibility of this \nSenate and the greatest Republic in history. It is about where we want \nthe course of history to lead for our children and our grandchildren.\n  This vote is not about a party or a President. After all, the \nIranians chant ``Death to America,'' not ``Death to Democrats,'' not \n``Death to Republicans,'' not ``Death to our President,'' but ``Death \nto America.'' Just this week, the Iranians again labeled America the \nGreat Satan.\n  So this vote is about empowering an evil, terror-sponsoring regime \nand continuing this history or seizing the moment to change history. If \nthis deal is approved, in just a few years, Iran may test a nuclear \ndevice, as North Korea did in 2006, just 12 years after a similar \nnuclear agreement. With a rumbling explosion that will shake the Earth, \nIran may announce its status as a nuclear power and the opening of a \nsecond nuclear age that our Nation has struggled so long to prevent.\n  If Iran goes nuclear, history will not remember kindly the Senators \nwho supported this nuclear deal. It won't remember your hand-wringing, \nyour anguished speeches, your brow-furrowing. It won't remember your \ngullible beliefs about the flawed inspection system or unworkable \nenforcement mechanisms. It won't remember your soft rationalizations \nthat this deal is ``better than nothing'' or ``the only alternative to \nwar.''\n  History will remember your vote and only your vote. It will remember \nthat you opened the gate to Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. It will \nremember you as the ones who flipped the strategic balance of the \nMiddle East and the world toward the favor of our enemies. And it will \nremember you, this Senate and this President, as the ones who, when \ngiven the chance to stop the world's worst sponsor of terrorism from \nobtaining the world's worst weapon, blinked when confronted with this \nevil.\n  A world menaced by a nuclear-capable Iran is a terrifying prospect. \nOver the past three decades, Iran has waged a low-intensity war on the \nUnited States and our partners. Iran has financed and trained Hezbollah \nand Hamas terrorists to do its bidding as their proxy. Iran fueled the \nvirulent insurgency whose roadside bombs and suicide attacks devastated \nIraq and sadly killed or maimed thousands of American troops. And Iran \nhas sowed unrest throughout the Middle East and propped up Syrian \ndictator Bashar al-Assad, creating a crisis that has engulfed the \nentire region and that is fast spreading beyond its borders and other \nparts of the world.\n  Iran has done all of this without nuclear weapons. Should it be \nallowed to continue enrichment and conduct research and development on \nnuclear technology--as this deal lets it--the ayatollahs will grow even \nmore brazen, fearsome, reckless, and insulated from conventional forms \nof deterrence and pressure. Upon the expiration of this deal--or its \nrepudiation by the ayatollahs at a time of their choosing--\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nIran's strategy of terror and intimidation will become nuclearized.\n  That is the world we may face in a few short years because of your \nvotes. That is the threat we will confront if you bestow your blessing \non a nuclear program run by the anti-American, anti-Israel, Jihadist \nregime in Tehran.\n  So we should soberly recognize that the context of this vote isn't a \ndebate that is fast coming to a close. The context isn't demagoguery or \nbackroom pressure from a lameduck President, and it isn't the effect of \nthis vote on our political fortunes.\n  The context for this vote is the broad sweep of history.\n  In late 1936, Winston Churchill spoke on the years of British \nappeasement in the face of German rearmament. He observed:\n\n       The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing \n     and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to a close. In \n     its place we are entering a period of consequences.\n\n  Churchill's words are as true today as they were then. We are \nentering a period of consequences. Because of your vote today, the \nconsequences may well be nuclear. God help us all if they are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that shortly we will have a \nchance to vote. I would have preferred the vote to be on the final \npassage of the resolution with the 60-vote threshold. I regret that was \nnot agreed to.\n  I will vote what I think is in the best interest of our country, to \nkeep Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state, and our best chance to \navoid a military option. I have already indicated that I intend to \noppose the agreement and I have given my reasons on the floor and I \nwill not repeat them at this moment.\n  But I wish to speak about what happens after this vote is over and \nwhatever votes take place next week, with the deadline being next \nThursday. At that time, I hope everyone here recognizes that it is \nimportant for us to put division aside. I wish to remind some of my \ncolleagues of what happened 14 years ago on a vote with Iraq, the \nauthorization for force. I voted against that resolution. And when that \nvote was over, Democrats and Republicans, proponents and opponents, \njoined together to support our troops and our mission under the \nleadership of President Bush to give America the best chance for its \nforeign policy to succeed.\n  So when the votes are over, I hope that Democrats and Republicans, \nproponents and opponents of the plan will work towards congressional \ninvolvement. Working with the President gives us our best opportunity \nto prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state and gives us the \nleast risk of using a military option. I say that because my colleague \nfrom Maryland outlined that very clearly. A military option--although \nwe must have that option in our quill--a military option will not solve \nthe problem and it has a lot of collateral consequences.\n  I hope we can work together, because that is what is in the best \ninterest of the U.S. Senate. That is what is in the best interest of \nthe United States of America.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Corker and all members of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and the U.S. Senate to see how \nCongress can work together with our President so that we can achieve \nthat goal.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know the Senator from \nTennessee would like to close on this matter.\n  I think everything that needs to be said about the details of this \ndeal has already been said. I do want to be recorded for history's \npurposes, although I know what is going to happen in regards to this if \nit goes through. Iran will immediately use the money in sanctions \nrelief to begin building up its conventional capabilities. It will \nestablish the most dominant military power in the region outside of the \nUnited States, and it will raise the price of us operating in the \nregion. They are going to build anti-access capabilities, rockets \ncapable of destroying our aircraft carriers and ships, continue to \nbuild these swift boats, these fast boats that are able to swarm our \nnaval assets so that it will make it harder and harder for U.S. troops \nto be in the region. They will also work with other terrorist groups in \nthe region to target American service men and women. They may or may \nnot deny that they are involved, but they will target us and raise the \nprice of our presence in the Middle East until they hope to completely \npull us out of that region. They will also continue to build long-range \nmissiles capable of reaching the United States. Those are not affected \nby this deal, and they will continue to build them as they have been \ndoing.\n  Then, at some point in the near future, when the time is right, they \nwill build a nuclear weapon, and they will do so because at that point \nthey will know that they have become immune, that we will no longer be \nable to strike their nuclear program, because the price of doing so \nwill be too high.\n  This is not just the work of imagination; it exists in the world \ntoday. It is called North Korea, where a lunatic possesses dozens of \nnuclear weapons and a long-range rocket that can already reach the \nUnited States, and we cannot do anything about it. An attack on North \nKorea today would result in an attack on Tokyo or Seoul or Guam or \nHawaii or California. So the world must now live with a lunatic in \npossession of nuclear weapons.\n  This is the goal Iran has as well--to reach a point where they become \nimmune to any sort of credible military threat because the price of a \nmilitary strike would be too high, and then they become an established \nnuclear weapons power. Never in the history of the world has such a \nregime ever possessed weapons so capable of destruction.\n  Iran is led by a supreme leader who is a radical Shia cleric with an \napocalyptic vision of the future. He is not a traditional geopolitical \nactor who makes decisions on the basis of borders or simply history or \nbecause of ambition. He has a religious apocalyptic vision of the \nfuture--one that calls for triggering a conflict between the non-Muslim \nworld and the Muslim world, one that he feels especially obligated to \ntrigger. And he is going to possess nuclear weapons? This is the world \nthat we are on the verge of leaving our children to inherit and perhaps \nwe ourselves will have to share in.\n  So I want to be recorded for history's purposes if nothing else to \nsay that those of us who opposed this deal understood where it would \nlead, and we are making a terrible mistake. I fear that the passage of \nthis deal will make it even harder for us to prevent it. I hope there \nis still time to change our minds.\n  But here is the good news. Iran may have a Supreme Leader, but \nAmerica does not. In this Nation, we have a republic, and soon we will \nhave new leaders, perhaps in this chamber but also in the executive \nbranch. I pray on their first day in office they will reverse this deal \nand reimpose the sanctions and back them up with a credible threat of \nmilitary force, or history will condemn us for not doing what needed to \nbe done in the world's history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a lot has been said about the impact of \nthis agreement. I would like to speak for a moment about the impact of \nno agreement. What if the Republicans and those who oppose this \nagreement have their way and this agreement goes away? Iran is still a \nnuclear threshold state. If you have your way and stop this agreement, \nthe result will be literally leaving in Iran the capacity to build 10 \nnuclear weapons today. And the timing on that: 2 to 3 months before \nthey have the fissile material for a nuclear weapon--if you have your \nway and kill this agreement.\n  That is some holiday surprise, that if we walk away from this \nagreement, this effort for inspection, Iran could develop a nuclear \nweapon. That is the reality. If you have your way, there will be no \ninspectors. Iran will be closed off to the world. How can that possibly \nmake the Middle East safer for Israel or for any other country in the \nworld? How can it make it safer if we as a coalition who have worked so \nhard to build this agreement fail in the effort?\n  What I have listened for during the last 3 days of debate is any \nsuggestion from the other side of the aisle about\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\nwhat is the alternative to this agreement. Now, some have been bold \nenough to say it is military, and we shouldn't wince at the prospect of \na military solution. One Senator on the other side of the aisle said 4 \ndays is all we need to take them out; we will take care of Iran. I have \nheard that before, I say to my friends. I heard it before the invasion \nof Iraq where we were going to be greeted as liberators, and it would \nbe a matter of weeks before our troops would be coming home. It didn't \nturn out that way.\n  What we are trying to do and what the President is trying to do is to \nstart a diplomatic process to avoid the military option, to avoid a \nwar. That is why I am supporting it. I think it is the right thing to \ndo. I am sorry that the vote we are about to cast here is a procedural \nvote. Twice, Senator Reid has asked Senator McConnell to give us a \nstraight, up-or-down, clean vote on this question of disapproval by a \n60-vote margin, and twice Senator McConnell has objected and insisted \ninstead on this procedural vote. We know where everyone stands. \nEveryone in this chamber has publicly declared where they stand on this \nmatter. That should be the rollcall that we take next. Unfortunately, \nwe are faced with a procedural rollcall.\n  I will close by saying one word about the Members on this side of the \naisle. For 6 weeks I have contacted them--and in fact harassed them--\nasking them what they were going to do on this important question. For \nany people who are critical of this Senate, believing it is too \nsuperficial and too partisan, I will tell you that on this side of the \naisle they took their time, they read the agreements, they were briefed \nby the intelligence agencies and Department of Defense, and they made \nup their mind and announced their position publicly. It is a proud \nmoment for this institution because I think that is what we all believe \nto be our responsibility.\n  As we close this debate, I ask those who support the agreement to \nvote no on the cloture motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, before I make closing comments, I ask \nunanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum call with respect to \nthe cloture vote this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking the vast \nmajority of this body for the fact that over--for four times since \n2010, Members of this body almost unanimously passed sanctions that \nbrought Iran to the table--people on both sides of the aisle. I want to \nthank people for that.\n  I want to thank this body for another reason. When we realized that \nthe President was going to negotiate with Iran and do so through what \nwas called a nonbinding political commitment and that he was going to \ntake this agreement directly to the U.N. Security Council--he was not \ngoing to cause it to be a treaty, but he was going to cause it to be an \nagreement that he could execute without our involvement--because of the \nfact that we brought Iran to the table through the sanctions that we \ncollectively put in place, we rose up and we passed a bill on a 98-to-1 \nbasis that allowed us to go through this process we are going through \ntoday.\n  I want to thank Senator Cardin, who has been an outstanding ranking \nmember. I want to thank Senator Menendez before him, who was an \noutstanding chairman and ranking member.\n  What this agreement said we would do is we would debate. I want to \nstop there and say that I think we have had a dignified debate. People \non both sides of the aisle have handled themselves as Senators, and I \nam very proud of that.\n  The other piece of that was that we would vote, that we would let the \npeople of this country know where we stood. We have a bipartisan \nmajority that disapproves of this deal. The most substantial foreign \npolicy people on the Democratic side oppose this deal. Always we have \nknown that yes, we were going to do this under regular order, and under \nregular order what that means is there is this procedural vote where \nthe Senate decides that debate has ended and we are going to move to a \nfinal vote. We are at that juncture, and I ask my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle that on a 98-to-1 basis voted to allow us to \nvote to now vote yes on this cloture motion, to allow the Members of \nthis Senate, who have handled themselves so responsibly, to be able to \nrecord on a majority basis where we stand on this issue.\n  The majority of the people in the Senate believe that this deal that \nhas been negotiated is not in the national interest of this country, \nwill not make our Nation or the Middle East safer, and I hope that all \nof us are going to have that opportunity to vote after we pass this \nprocedural hurdle. I hope that all Members will vote to allow this to \nproceed to a final vote within the next few days.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 2640.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, James Lankford, Kelly \n           Ayotte, John Thune, Cory Gardner, Mike Crapo, Ron \n           Johnson, Joni Ernst, Tom Cotton, James M.

Inhofe, Mike Rounds.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the issue before us is of immense \nconsequence to our country. The American people are entitled to a real \nvoice and to know where their elected Senators stand on this important \nissue.\n  Until recently, this was a principle Members of both parties seemed \nto endorse rather overwhelmingly. In fact, not a single Democrat--not \none--voted against the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. We all recall \nit passed 98 to 1. They told us this was an issue too important for \npolitical games.\n  This is what one Democratic colleague said just last week:\n\n       As a caucus that was opposed to games with filibusters over \n     the last four years, I would think it would be really \n     regrettable if we didn't ultimately go to the floor and cast \n     our votes for or against this deal.\n\n  But that was last week, apparently. Democratic Senators just voted to \nfilibuster and block the American people from even having a real vote \non one of the most consequential foreign policy issues of our time.\n  It is telling that Democrats would go to such extreme lengths to \nprevent President Obama from even having to consider legislation on \nthis issue. If the President is so proud of this deal, then he \nshouldn't be afraid.\n  We all know the amount of time the administration has spent here \nasking all of these guys to take a bullet for the team--and, of course, \nthe team is Team Obama. They all wanted to have a say. When it came \ntime to have a say, they said it was more important that the President \nnot have to veto a resolution of disapproval--more important to him \nthan to them.\n  This is a deal that was designed to go around Congress and the \nAmerican people from the very start. We all remember the President \ndidn't want to submit it to us at all. It was going to be an executive \nagreement, it is still an executive agreement, and he didn't want us to \nhave any say at all.\n  Senator Corker and Senator Cardin worked together and developed a \nproposal--overwhelmingly proposed and supported--to give us a chance to \nweigh in on this important deal.\n  It would empower Iran to maintain thousands of centrifuges and to \nbecome a recognized nuclear-threshold state, forever on the edge of \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. That is what is before us.\n  It would effectively subsidize Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Assad regime \nin Syria--which, by the way, is now going to apparently include a \nRussian military base in Syria--by showering tens of billions of \ndollars on their benefactors in Tehran.\n  It would leave Iran with an enrichment capability just as the Iranian \nleadership is again calling for Israel's destruction and praying every \nday for our destruction. This deal is sure to have many consequences \nthat will last well beyond this administration.\n  Yet as things presently stand, it would limp along with little or no \nbuy-in or input from Congress or from the American people--who we know \noverwhelmingly opposed the deal in spite of the President's best \nefforts to sell it to them. This shouldn't be an acceptable outcome for \nour friends on the other side, even those who support the deal. I \npredicted earlier--and I predict again today--we are going to have a \nraft of new bash-Iran proposals introduced by our friends on the other \nside, who are going to be born again Iran bashers.\n  So let me make it clear to all of our colleagues, we have voted, we \nare going to vote again, but we are voting on the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act. We are not going to be taking up bills that have \nfewer than enough cosponsors to override a Presidential veto. If we \nwant to make a law, as we did with Corker-Cardin, show us enough \ncosponsors to make a law, but we are not interested in using floor time \nfor get-well efforts over on the other side to try to fool their \nconstituents into thinking: Oh, I really, really was serious about \nIran, in spite of the fact that I voted for the deal that you hate.\n  We only have so much floor time in the Senate. We are going to try to \nuse it on serious proposals that have a chance of becoming law, and my \nassumption is the President is not going to want to revisit this issue. \nHe got what he wanted. He is not going to want to revisit this issue. \nSo if we want to do anything further about this Iranian regime, bring \nme a bill with enough cosponsors to override a Presidential veto, and \nwe will take a look at it.\n  Otherwise, the American people will give us their judgment about the \nappropriateness of this measure 1 year from November because this is \nnot an ordinary issue. This is an issue with a real shelf life. This is \na regime that is still going to be there a year and a half from now.\n  And, of course, as we know, it is an Executive agreement only. So if, \nperchance, there is a President of a different party, I would say to \nour Iranian observers of the debate that it will be looked at anew \nbased upon Iranian behavior between now and then.\n  As others have said, the Iranian Parliament is apparently going to \nget to weigh in. I heard the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee say that. I guess they are going to get a vote.\n  But our friends on the other side want to employ a procedural device, \nwhich, as the Democratic leader has pointed out, is commonly used here, \nbut the question is, on what kind of measure is it used?\n  This is no ordinary measure. This is different.\n  So we will have another opportunity to see whether we want to move \npast this procedural device.\n  The President is proud of the deal. I don't know why he would be \nreluctant to veto a resolution of disapproval that is put on his desk. \nHe is having press conferences about it. He is bragging about it. He \nthinks this is really great.\n  I don't know what they are protecting him from. I would think he \nwould have a veto ceremony and invite all you guys to join him and \ncelebrate. What are you protecting him from?\n  We will have a chance next week, one more chance, to allow him to say \nhow he feels about the resolution of disapproval. We know how he feels \nabout it already. For the life of me, I can't get why he is reluctant \nto veto this resolution of disapproval, in effect, underscoring again \nwhat a great deal he thinks it is for America.\n  So we will revisit the issue next week and see if maybe any folks \nwant to change their minds and give us a chance to remove the \nprocedural roadblock and give the President what he has been asking \nfor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to be as respectful of my friend as I \nneed to be, but let's speak reality.\n  We are in a Congress that is dominated by the Republicans. They \ncontrol the House by a large margin, and they control the Senate by a \nlarge margin.\n  The legislation that is before this body was proposed, legislated, \nand brought to us by Republican leadership. It is their legislation, \nnot ours.\n  I didn't spend all my time in my office visiting with people today; I \nwatched the speeches. It was stunning--the nonreality that is facing my \nRepublican friends. They dwelled, a number of them, on what is going on \nin the Middle East. Not once--not once--did anyone mention the worst \nforeign-policy decision ever made by our great country, the invasion of \nIraq. It has destabilized that part of the world for a long, long time \nto come. For what? So\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\nmy friends can blame all the problems in the Middle East on the \nPresident, but they are blaming the wrong person. We can't take what we \nhave because they want to rewrite history. History is as it is, and \npeople are writing history as it is.\n  Now the part of history that they are trying to rewrite is history \nthat is taking place in this body. We offered, on two separate \noccasions, publicly before the American people and in this body: Do you \nwant a vote? We will let you have a vote. Both times it was objected to \nbecause in the convoluted reasoning, I guess, of my friend, he thinks \nthat people who are watching all of this have no common sense and can't \nunderstand the English language.\n  We offered to have a vote on this on two separate occasions. It was \nobjected to both times. Now, the inane response is you are \nfilibustering this. I know why there are filibusters because we have \nhad to file cloture more than 600 times because of filibusters by the \nRepublicans. Never in the history of the country has there ever been \nanything close to it.\n  Now, what were most of those filibusters on? On motions to proceed. \nOn this legislation that came before this body, we said we don't need a \nvote on a motion to proceed, go to the bill, go to it. We also said, as \npart of the agreement, let the leader offer the first amendment, and he \ndid that.\n  Now, a 60-vote threshold, my friend talks as if: Oh, wowee, where in \nthe world did this come from? Why would they ever consider 60 votes on \nthis?\n  First, I know it is late in the day. I didn't bring the subject up, \nbut my friend the Republican leader is talking about a world that \ndoesn't exist anymore. And who created this world that doesn't exist \nanymore? My Republican friends.\n  This is July 30, 2011, from Senator McConnell:\n\n       Now, look, we know that on controversial matters in the \n     Senate, it has for quite some time required 60 votes. So I \n     would say again to my friend, [that is me] it is pretty hard \n     to make a credible case that denying a vote on your own \n     proposal is anything other than a filibuster.\n\n  A little while later:\n\n       I wish to make clear to the American people Senate \n     Republicans are ready to vote on cloture on the Reid proposal \n     in 30 minutes, in an hour, as soon as we can get our \n     colleagues over to the floor. We are ready to vote. By \n     requiring 60 votes, particularly on a matter of this enormous \n     importance, it is not at all unusual. It is the way the \n     Senate operates.\n\n  Another one, a few months later:\n\n       Mr. President, I can only quote my good friend [that is me] \n     the majority leader who has repeatedly said, most recently in \n     early 2007, that in the Senate it has always been the case we \n     need 60 votes. This is my good friend the majority leader \n     when he was the leader of this majority in March of 2007, and \n     he said it repeatedly both when he was in the minority or \n     leader of the majority, that it requires 60 votes certainly \n     on measures that are controversial.\n\n  There is no question the measure before this body--using the words of \nmy friend the Republican leader--is something that is important. There \nis no question that this measure has been controversial. Also, using \nhis words, is this legislation of enormous importance? I think so. At \nleast that is my mind.\n\n  Quoting from a little while later:\n\n       So who gets to decide who is wasting time around here? None \n     of us have that authority to decide who is wasting time. But \n     the way you make things happen is you get 60 votes at some \n     point, and you move the matter to conclusion, and the best \n     way to do that is to have an open amendment process. That is \n     the way this place used to operate.\n\n  And I say ``used to operate.'' That is my own editorial comment.\n  Two or three months later:\n\n       Madam President, reserving the right to object, what we are \n     talking about is a perpetual debt ceiling grant, in effect, \n     to the President. Matters of this level of controversy always \n     require 60 votes. So I would ask my friend, the majority \n     leader--\n\n  Referring to me as the majority leader--\n\n     if he would modify his consent request and set the threshold \n     for this vote at 60?\n\n  I am not going to be reading these forever, but I will read one more:\n\n       Well, as we all know, it takes 60 votes to do everything \n     except the budget process. We anticipate having a vote to \n     proceed to the 20-week Pain-Capable bill sometime before the \n     end of the year as well.\n\n  That was just the early part of August of this year.\n  So, Mr. President, my friend is in a dire situation, and I understand \nthat. The House is in a terrible state of disarray. They do not know \nwhat they are going to do. On one hand, what they say they are going to \ndo is--the President can't send the papers to them. So they want to \nhave a vote on that. The papers didn't come to them. And then they turn \nright around and are going to vote on a resolution of approval. I guess \nthey do not need the papers for that. Then they are going to vote on \nmore sanctions. Then they don't know what they are going to do. It is \nvery unusual, when one party controls both branches of the bicameral \nlegislature, that they do not know how to work together, but obviously \nthey are not working together here. So I understand my friend's \nfrustration. This is a situation where he has lost the vote, and it is \na situation where he is simply not in touch with reality as it exists.\n  So I want to say to everyone within the sound of my voice that the \nSenate has spoken and has spoken with a clarion voice and declared that \nthe historic agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon \nwill stand. That is what this agreement is all about. It is about \nwhether Iran should have a nuclear weapon. And the countries you \nwouldn't think would be involved in supporting something such as this--\nthey know the importance of it themselves, and they agreed to go along \nwith this agreement. They helped us negotiate it. China, Russia--they \nagreed to it. The Senate has spoken with a clarion voice and declared \nthat this historic agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon will stand.\n  So I say, my fellow Americans--and I say that with all respect for \neverybody who is out there listening or will read about this--our \nallies and negotiating partners around the world should know that \ntoday's outcome was clear, decisive, and final. There is now no doubt \nwhatsoever that the United States Congress will allow this historic \nagreement to proceed. Efforts by opponents to derail this agreement \nwere soundly rejected by a margin much larger than anyone thought \nachievable even a few days ago.\n  Any future attempts, as my friend is talking about, to relitigate \nthis issue--I guess we will be in a position like with the Affordable \nCare Act. Are we going to try to repeal it 60 times? Are we going to \ntry to break that record? Any future attempts to relitigate this issue \nin the Senate will meet the same outcome and will be nothing more than \nwasted time--time we can't afford to waste with a government shutdown \nlooming in a matter of weeks, more of the disarray of my friends the \nRepublicans. We are not making up closing government. The government \nwas closed 2 years ago for almost 3 weeks. So we take those threats \nseriously. And I would hope we could get around to doing something \nabout that rather than having wasted cloture motions on something on \nwhich we agreed to have a vote. Filibusters are an effort to stop \ndebate. We said when I came in here Tuesday--Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday--if you want more time than that to debate, go ahead and do \nit. We are not in any way stopping debate, as was done by my Republican \ncolleagues hundreds of times in years past. So this can be relitigated. \nLet's do it over 60 times to try to break the Affordable Care Act \nrecord, if you choose, but this matter is over with. It is something of \nsuch importance, but we should move on to something else. We have so \nmuch to do in this body--so much to do.\n  We have our highway situation that is deteriorating. We have hundreds \nof thousands of bridges that are in a state of disrepair and need \nrefurbishing and some of them need to be replaced. Today I met with the \nregional transportation authority, someone who represents 80 percent of \nthe population in our State. We are in desperate shape all over Nevada \nas far as doing something about highways, but we are not doing anything \nabout highways, we are fiddling around on that patching stuff. We had \nsomething done, and I was happy to get that done.\n  We have cyber security issues. As we are here talking right now in \nthis body, we have groups, individuals, and countries trying to hack \nus--they are not trying; they are doing it. We have not had the ability \nto get cyber security legislation before this body. It is something we \nhave brought up as an afterthought. We have Senator Burr and Senator \nFeinstein and the bill they\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\nproduced. It is not my favorite. I think we could do better than that. \nBut I support their legislation. We have to do something. Let's start \nsomeplace doing something that is important for the American people.\n  So I say to everyone here that it is time we move on to something \nelse. This matter is over. You can continue to relitigate it, but it is \ngoing to have the same result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the Democratic leader frequently \nreminded me when he was the majority leader, the majority leader always \ngets the last word.\n  I enjoyed hearing the Democratic leader's history lesson, going back, \nas I recount--I am sure I will leave some out--to the Iraq war \nresolution, which he voted for, as did Hillary Clinton, to a recitation \nof past debates from ObamaCare, to you name it, including complaining \nabout highways, a bill Senator Boxer and I worked on and actually \npassed that he voted against, which hopefully will soon be in \nconference, but none of that has anything to do with what is before us \ntoday.\n  The issue before us today is the Iran nuclear agreement. We know how \nthe American people feel about it. They are overwhelmingly opposed to \nit. We know how the Israelis feel about it. They are overwhelmingly \nopposed to it. We know our Sunni-Arab allies are now visiting the \nRussians to talk about arms purchases because they do not trust us \nanymore. We know the President wanted to transform the Middle East, \nand, by golly, he has. Our friends don't trust us and our enemies are \nemboldened.\n  So the issue is not over. The Democratic leader saying the issue is \nover doesn't make it over.\n  This agreement and the foreign policy of this administration is best \nsummed up by Jimmy Carter. A couple of months ago, he was asked to sum \nup the Obama administration's foreign policy, and this is almost a \ndirect quote. He said he couldn't think of a single place in the world \nwhere we are in better shape now than we were when the President came \nto office. That is Jimmy Carter.\n  Foreign policy will be a big issue going into 2016, and this \nagreement is a metaphor for all of the mistakes this President has \nmade. You name the area of the world, and you will see the results. So \nno amount of saying the issue is over makes it over. It is still on the \nfloor of the Senate. We will have an opportunity again next week to \nmove past this procedural snag to give all Members of the Senate an \nopportunity to vote up or down on a resolution of disapproval, which we \nknow is supported on a bipartisan basis.\n  And I end with this: There is bipartisan opposition to this deal--\nbipartisan opposition to this deal. Only Democrats support it. So if \nthe President is so proud of it, I can't figure out what these folks \nover here are protecting him from.\n  You guys should all be invited down to the veto signing. Break out \nthe champagne, celebrate, take credit for it. You own it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one last thing. I recognize my friend is \ngoing to be next, and I am going to be very short here.\n  I am glad my friend brought up my vote on Iraq. I have stated on \nnational TV, I have stated every chance I get that the biggest mistake \nI ever made in my public service was voting for that bill. And I \nlearned it quickly. It was just a matter of a few short months after I \nvoted that I realized I had been misled in voting for that. But that \ndoesn't matter. I voted for it, and, as some say in some circles, I \nhave repented publicly for having done that. So my feeling about the \nIraq war has not changed, the mere fact I had voted for that.\n  I would also say this in closing: I hope the one thing we can agree \non here as Democrats and Republicans is that the ability of Iran for \nthe next 15 years to build a nuclear weapon is pretty well taken care \nof. No one has to agree with that part of my statement, but the one \nthing I hope we can agree on--I would hope we would work together to \nmake sure we continue, as indicated in the letter Senator Kerry wrote \nto everybody, all of us, and the Cardin legislation--I hope everyone \nwill take a look at that because, as I said in a statement I gave on \nTuesday morning, I have looked at what was suggested in the Kerry \nletter to make Israel more safe and more secure and some of the \nsuggestions that Senator Cardin had in his outline. These are things on \nwhich I hope we can work together. Put this to one side for the time \nbeing. Let's hope in the future we can work together to make sure the \nonly true democracy in that part of the world, this ally of ours, is \nsafe and secure. And we will continue everything we can to make sure \nthey are, I repeat, safe and secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no question the Israelis need \na lot of reinforcement, no question they need to know for sure we are \non their side because this administration has just entered into an \nagreement that by all objective standards could even threaten their \nvery existence. So I think there is no question the Israelis need every \nreassurance we can possibly give them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I want to rise and offer some thoughts on \nthe comments we just heard from the majority leader and from our \nleader. I want to say a word about process, and I want to say a word \nabout partisanship.\n  Let me start with a word to all of my colleagues. I respect your \nposition on this deal however you voted. I am not here to stand and \nname-call or chastise anybody who reaches a different position on this \nbill than I do because it is a hard matter, and I don't think we serve \nthe body well by challenging folks who reach a different position.\n  Let me say a word about process. The allegation has been made on the \nfloor in recent days that this vote, including the vote that was just \ntaken, was somehow a procedural blocking of the vote on the deal. That \nis just not the case.\n  I was one of the coauthors of the review act that is currently before \nus, and as we worked on the act in the Foreign Relations Committee, \neveryone understood that it would take 60 votes to pass either a motion \nof approval or disapproval. We worked on the act in January and \nFebruary--months before a framework was on the table. Democrats wanted \na 60-vote threshold for a motion of disapproval, but Republicans wanted \na 60-vote threshold for a motion of approval, and that was the \nunderstanding of everyone in the committee when we cast a 19-to-0 vote \nto pass this in early April, and it was clearly understood when we cast \na 98-to-1 vote on the floor of this body.\n  A 60-vote threshold was understood. It was so clearly understood that \nthat is the way we do things around here that 47 Members of the Senate \nput that in a letter to the leaders of Iran. So this is not an unusual \nthing to ask for a 60-vote threshold. In fact, the Democrats have asked \ntwice in last 3 days: Let's have an up-or-down vote on the motion of \ndisapproval with a 60-vote threshold--and our request for a vote on the \nmerits has been twice blocked by the majority.\n  I hope we will have a chance to vote on the merits again next week \nunder the 60-vote threshold that we all agreed to, but regardless of \nwhether we do or whether we don't, this is a completely transparent \nvote because all 100 Members of the Senate have indicated what their \nposition is. I respect everybody's position, but it is very clear, and \nthe clear rule is, under the review act we just passed, by this vote \nthis deal will now go forward as we agreed it would a few months back.\n  Partisanship. The majority leader suggested the position that is \nbeing taken on this side of the aisle is just to protect the President. \nI find that insulting. That is basically saying that on this side of \nthe aisle my colleagues didn't do the work to dig into the deal. So let \nme just say a word about my colleagues--my colleagues in the minority \nin this body.\n  This deal was announced on the 15th of July. Did anyone on this side \nof the aisle run out and take a position on the deal within hours after \nit was out? Did anyone on this side of the aisle say, yes, I know what \nI am going to do and\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nI haven't even read the bill. Has this side of the aisle in lockstep \nall taken exactly the same position with respect to this bill? No.\n  On this side of the aisle, we haven't approached it in a partisan \nway. On this side of the aisle, every Member took the time to master \nthe details and make their own decision. Some announced their decision \na few days after the deal was announced, some announced their decision \n7 weeks after the deal was announced. On this side of the aisle there \nis a difference of opinion--42 of us support the deal, 4 of us do not \nsupport the deal--but we respect each other's opinions, and we have \napproached it as a matter of conscience.\n  So I categorically reject the statement and the implication by the \nmajority leader that this is just something over here that is being \ndone casually to protect the President. I would ask my colleagues in \nthe majority: Compare the diversity of opinion and the time it took to \nreach an opinion and the respect that we have for each other's \nposition--compare that on this side of the aisle with your own track \nrecord on this bill, with the speed with which people announced that \nthey were opposing it, some even admitting they were opposing it before \nthey read it.\n  Contrary to the claim of the majority leader that there is no \nbipartisan support for this deal, I have to say, Senator John Warner, \nRepublican, 36-year Member of the Senate, chair of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, wrote with Senator Carl Levin, former chair of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, ``Why Hawks Should Support the Iran \nDeal''; Brent Scowcroft, National Security Advisor for two Republican \nPresidents and general, strongly supports this deal; GEN Colin Powell, \nRepublican, Secretary of State, strongly supports this deal. There is \nbipartisan support for this deal. It is just that in this body the \nminority has been willing to have differences of opinion and respect \nthose differences and not approach this in a partisan manner. That is \nnot exactly the case with respect to the other side. I applaud my \ncolleagues for treating this as a matter of conscience, for reaching \nthe conclusions they reached, even differences of opinion, and \nrespecting each other's views.\n  Under the terms of the review act, as we agreed to it, we have now \ntaken a vote. Unless the majority will allow us to have a vote on the \nmerits, pursuant to the 60-vote threshold, this vote will stand and the \ndeal will go forward. I hope we can vote on the merits. I hope the \nmajority will agree to let us do what we agreed to do when we passed \nthe review act just a couple of months ago.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I was not planning to speak--I know \nSenator Capito is next in line--but I am really disappointed in my \nfriend from Virginia indicating that somehow people on this side of the \naisle did not study this deal, did not spend time understanding the \ndetails, and somehow people on this side of the aisle, in a knee-jerk \nway, made their decision. That is an insult, not something I would \nexpect--not something I would expect to come from my friend on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I have enjoyed so much working with him and I will continue to. I \nrespect him greatly. But, look, I don't want to start tit-for-tatting \nthis. Certainly Senator Feinstein came out immediately in support of \nthis, Nancy Pelosi came out immediately in support of this, and no \ndoubt there were some people on this side of the aisle that did the \nsame. I came out in opposition for this after--after--two Democrats had \ncome out in opposition. So I wish those comments had not been made.\n  We had 12 hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee, well attended \nby people on both sides of the aisle. I just take offense that somehow, \nbecause there is bipartisan opposition and only partisan support--that \nsomehow those who support are more bipartisan. Now, I don't know. That \nis a leap I have not heard.\n  I have said hundreds of times that if this deal achieved what the \nPresident said it was going to achieve, I would be voting for it. If \nthis dismantled Iran's nuclear program, I would be voting for it. If \nthis didn't industrialize their program, I would be voting for it. He \nsaid it would end their nuclear program. There would be 100 votes on \nthe floor for that. This is a far cry from that.\n  So I am sorry to have this kind of conversation on the Senate floor, \nbut I have to say I have sat here listening to the speeches. I think \npeople on both sides of the aisle have thought a great deal about this. \nI do think there has been extreme pressure. My friends on the other \nside of the aisle have told me they have never been addressed in such a \npersonal manner by the administration--never. So, yes, there has been \npressure. I understand that, by the way. If the shoe were on the other \nfoot, it would be taking place. I got that.\n  But, look, I think the debate has been thoughtful. I think, by and \nlarge, the vast majority of people on both sides of the aisle have been \nthoughtful. After the debate we have had, I am discouraged that my \nfriend on the other side of the aisle would indicate that somehow \nbecause there is bipartisan opposition--bipartisan opposition--the most \ninformed Members on the other side of the aisle, the ranking member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and the former ranking member and \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, are voting against that--\nand because we happen to agree with the leading Members on the \nDemocratic side, we are partisan? So I am sorry.\n  Now, back to the procedure. There is no question--I have said this \nover and over--I understand regular order, and this bill was drafted \nunder regular order. I got it. I understand that certainly the \nprocedures in this body are that cloture is to end debate, and that \ntakes 60 votes. I got it. It doesn't take but about a week here to \nunderstand the importance of cloture.\n  So I have always known, and I have said this, that a threshold to get \nus to a place for final passage was going to be 60 votes. But we also \npassed the bill with 98 votes that said we wanted to vote. One Senator \nwas missing who supported it. It would have been 99 to 1.\n  So, look, I understand there can be debate about filibuster and all \nof that, but to say there was some preagreement--I mean, the text of \nthe deal, the text of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act says that \nwe are going to go through regular order. We caught a lot of grief over \nthat as a matter of fact. I am sorry.\n  A lot of people on our side wanted a privileged motion. We understand \nthe leader on the other side didn't like privileged vehicles because he \nfelt he lost control of the floor. We discussed that thoroughly last \nJanuary.\n  So, look, I understand how cloture is used. I understand how cloture \nis used. I got it. I understand it takes 60 votes, people in here \nsaying, yes, we agree that we should end debate and, yes, we want to \nmove on. I know that hasn't happened today. I understand a lot of times \ncloture is used as a vote, as you just indicated you believe that it \ndoes, but I just want to say, again, there has been no agreement. We \nunderstand the threshold. We understand the hurdle. We understand we \ndidn't achieve it today. But to say that Members on this side somehow--\nbecause we agree with the leading Members on the other side that this \ndeal doesn't accomplish the goals the President said he wanted to \nachieve, that that makes us partisan, I am sorry, I disagree.\n  We had many discussions in our office about the merits of this and \nthe demerits of this. The fact is, I do think this agreement is fatally \nflawed. I am despondent over the fact that when we had a boot on the \nneck of this rogue nation that is the No. 1 exporter of terrorism \naround the world--when we had a boot on their neck--we gave away our \nleverage, and in 9 months--in 9 months--they are going to have all \ntheir money back, the major sanctions relieved, and no apparent change \nof behavior. Even Secretary Kerry in his letter to us said he doesn't \nexpect that.\n  So, look, I am disappointed that we have agreed, that the \nadministration has agreed, and that, unfortunately, a minority of \npeople in this body agree, and they have kept us from being able to \nsend a disapproval to the President to veto. I am disappointed, when an \nagreement has been agreed to by this the President and by others that \nallows them to industrialize their nuclear program and gives them \nincredible--incredible--economic access.\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\n  I think maybe the Senator might have responded to some recent \ncomments on the floor. I hope that is the case. But I haven't seen \nanything but dignity on this floor over the last several days, people \nbeing incredibly knowledgeable--which they never would have been \nwithout this bill that the Senator from Virginia helped us bring about, \ncrucial, in helping make that occur.\n  But what has happened here is everybody in this body now knows more \nabout this than they ever would have. Everyone has taken the time, I \nthink, to understand this in great detail. And just because there are a \nfew people who come out quickly on our side and on your side--and on \nyour side--that doesn't diminish the fact that people have arrived at \ntheir decisions based on conscience as to whether they support it or \nnot. I am disappointed, on the other hand, that we weren't able to move \nbeyond cloture and to a final vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  My understanding is Senator Capito now has the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, could I ask my friend to yield to me for 2 \nminutes? And I apologize to my colleague, but two of my favorite \nmembers of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Through the Chair, two of my favorite members of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee who have been critically important \nto us having this debate on foreign policy--Senator Kaine and Senator \nCorker--they are two Members I deeply respect.\n  Let me just make this observation. I think Senator Corker is \nabsolutely correct. As a result of Senator Kaine and Senator Corker--\nand I am proud of the role I played--the Members of the United States \nSenate have had more information about a major foreign policy issue \nthan in the history of this country. We have had the exposure to \nclassified briefings. We have had the incredible opportunity to try to \nunderstand the JCPOA and to make our independent judgments on that. So \nI think this process has worked the way it should work.\n  I share disappointment that we couldn't go to a vote on the merits \nwith a 60-vote threshold because I think that was what was anticipated, \nand we all understood it was going to take 60 votes to move this. I \nthink it would have been better if we went directly to that type of a \nvote rather than what has gone forward. So I just want to underscore \nthat.\n  The other point I want to underscore--and I agree with Senator Corker \nand Senator Kaine--is that many Members of the Senate, in a relatively \nshort period of time, made a decision. They didn't think it was a close \ncall, so they made their judgments. In reality, it was a lot more \nRepublicans than Democrats. But that was the case. A lot of Members \ntook a lot of time to try to understand this and really labored on the \nissue. I know that because I made my official position known just about \na week ago, and I know in talking to many colleagues the process they \nwent through.\n  I don't question the motives of any Member. I think each Member is \ntrying to do what they believe is in the best interests of our country. \nI know the two Senators--I know them personally. I am just making my \nown observations. I know that is how they believe also. But I do think \nthe process we set up lent itself to getting the material, waiting for \nthe hearings, listening to the administration make their point, reading \nthe classified documents, trying to understand how the IAEA interacts \nin the review process--that it was important to understand all of that \nbefore drawing a conclusion.\n  I applaud most Members of the Senate who dove into it in order for \nthat to be the case. I needed to make that point. I can tell you this: \nWith Senator Corker and Senator Kaine, I really feel blessed to serve \non the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I think our country is well \nserved by both. I know that we are going to work together to provide \nour country the strength it needs to deal with the international \nchallenge and to carry out the responsibility of the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, before I start my formal remarks, I would \nlike to make a few comments about what has occurred in terms of the \ncloture vote and in terms of some of the discussion that we have had \nmost recently.\n  I wanted to react, first of all, to something the minority leader \nsaid in his remarks. He basically said that we, as Republicans, are \ntrying to rewrite history. He went into a long explanation of why he \nbelieved that. It really struck me, with these young folks who are \nsitting right here in front of us. We are not trying to rewrite \nhistory. We are trying to write a future for these young kids that is \nsafer, that is strong, where we as the United States are making \nagreements that are in their best interests--not just for tomorrow or \nthe next 5 years or 6 years but the next 30, 35, 40 years. I am not \ninterested in rewriting history. But writing history for the future I \nam interested in.\n  The other reaction I have is that I am very disappointed in what has \nhappened here, that we can't have a straight up-or-down vote. When I \nwas in the West Virginia Legislature, in the house of delegates, \nbelieve it or not, our votes were not taken. They were voice votes, \nexcept in very rare occasions when we would have a rollcall. We all \nknow the difference between a voice vote and a rollcall vote. A \nrollcall vote is a part of history. People see exactly what you are \nintending and how you are going to vote. On a voice vote, you can \nalmost say: Well, I voted yes or I voted no. Nobody can really pin you \ndown on that.\n  I was one of the few Republicans in the house of delegates who voted \nin favor of making every single vote we had a rollcall vote. I am \npleased to say, the legislature didn't change it that year but they \nfinally did change it.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, everybody knows what everybody is \ngoing to do on this vote. I don't understand what the controversy is to \nmove forward over the procedural motions and to then have that vote to \nhave it as a part of history. This is your rollcall vote. This is your \nvoice on this Iran agreement. I hope next week the body changes its \nmind, we move forward, and we have an affirmative vote on the motion of \ndisapproval.\n  Today I want to talk, obviously, about these issue because I have \ndeep concerns about them. I believe that this debate should revolve \naround three key questions. Will this agreement eliminate Iran's path \nto a nuclear weapon? Will it improve the security situation in the \nMiddle East? Will it make America safer for the young, for us, and for \nthe future generations?\n  Unfortunately, after much study I have concluded that the answer is \nno to all of these questions. I do not believe the President's \nagreement would make America safer or our allies safer. To the \ncontrary, the agreement will provide Iran with the resources to \ncontinue to finance terror throughout the Middle East and around the \nworld.\n  Even if Iran were to comply with this agreement in full, this deal \nvirtually guarantees that Iran will become a nuclear threshold nation \nwith an industrial nuclear program. We know that. It is legitimized in \nthis agreement. Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism. \nEverybody has said that in this body. It is acknowledged nationwide. \nThe windfall of cash that will flow to Iran--the signing bonus and the \ncontinuing impact of sanctions relief under this deal--will only \nincrease its ability to prop up the Syrian regime, finance Hezbollah, \nand threaten America's allies such as Israel.\n  One of the actions you learn when you grow up is that past behavior \nis a great predictor of future action. Even as its own economy has been \nhampered by the economic sanctions and the pressure from those \nsanctions brought Iran to the table, in the name of ``our people are \nsuffering''--whether it is food or whether it is economic conditions--\nwhat have they been doing? They have been financing terror in their \nregion. Terrorism is a priority for them, even as their own people are \nsuffering.\n  National Security Advisor Susan Rice agrees. She says: ``We should \nexpect that some portion of that money would go to the Iranian military \nand could potentially be used for the kinds of bad behavior that we \nhave seen in the region up until now.''\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\n  That is the National Security Advisor. The President and the \nSecretary of State have said that the sanctions will snap back into \nplace if Iran violates this agreement. I have been in Washington now \nfor 15 years. I have never seen anything snap anywhere in the Halls of \nCongress. We know that the current sanctions against Iran cannot be \neasily snapped back. We know that. It doesn't even pass the sniff test, \nas we say.\n  It took more than a decade for the United States, working with our \nallies, to construct the sanctions that brought Iran to the table. This \ntype of effective sanctions regime cannot be brought back over and \nover. I have listened to a lot of speeches. A lot of my colleagues on \nboth sides, no matter how they voted, what they believe, have said \nexactly the same thing. On another note, we need to examine the end of \nthe international restrictions on selling ballistic missile technology \nto Iran and the end of the conventional arms embargo contained in this \nagreement.\n  The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in July that ``under no circumstances should we \nrelieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and \narms trafficking.'' The administration chose to reject this advice. It \nreally surprised many of us who did not know that these were even on \nthe table. We didn't even know they were part of a bargaining chip that \nanybody was going to play.\n  The President's agreement would remove all international limitations \non Iran's missile program in 8 years, contradicting early promises from \nthe administration that restrictions would remain in place. Ballistic \nmissiles are not a necessary component of a peaceful nuclear program. \nIran's continued efforts to improve this technology should send a clear \nmessage to this Chamber of their intentions. In addition, the arms \nembargo on conventional arms will be lifted in 5 years.\n  Indeed, Iran's President said last month: ``We will buy, sell and \ndevelop any weapons we need and we will not ask permission or abide by \nany resolution for that.''\n  The end of the arms embargo and ballistic missile restrictions will \nstrengthen Iran's ability to threaten Americans, our allied forces, and \nour citizens. The President's agreement does not contain the necessary \nenforcement measures to protect future generations from a nuclear Iran. \nAny agreement worthy of congressional approval should include rigorous, \nimmediate inspections of suspected nuclear sites.\n  Senior administration officials publicly called for ``anywhere, \nanyplace''--I heard it repeatedly--inspections. Yet the President's \nagreement fails to live up to that. Indeed, Iran can block access to \nsuspected nuclear facilities for 24 days or even longer. We have not \neven seen these side deals. This is part of the discussion. The bill \nthat we passed that said that we were going to have the right to debate \nthis says explicitly in the language that the side agreements were to \nbe turned over to Congress for our inspection before we made this vote.\n  Finally, those who support ratifying the Iran agreement frequently \nargue that the only alternative is war. I disagree. I reject that \nnotion. Under that false misguided premise, the American people are \nbeing told we should simply accept any deal, regardless of how flawed \nit may be. When asked if our only option was the agreement or war, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that ``we have a range of \noptions.''\n  The President's agreement does not live up to the administration's \nprior statements on important items such as inspections, elimination of \nadvanced centrifuges, and ballistic missiles. A better agreement with \nIran could be forged from the positions taken by senior administration \nofficials during the negotiation.\n  A better deal was possible. The American people should accept nothing \nless. Some argue that we should approve this deal, despite its faults, \nand then use the threat of separate legislation or tough talk to keep \nIran in check. To me that is just seeking cover. Those of us who are \ngoing to vote in agreement with this Iran deal are then going to turn \naround in a week, 10 days or 2 days and say: Let's get tough on Iran on \nthis. Let's make sure we protect Israel. Let's give more military aid \nto Israel. All of the rhetoric you are already hearing we can do now. \nWe can do that now by disagreeing with the Iran agreement that the \nPresident has put forward. The better course for us is to reject this \nagreement and reopen negotiations.\n  I believe that stronger sanctions could also force Iran to accept a \nbetter agreement that will improve the security of the Middle East and \nthe world. The danger to the United States, Israel, and other American \nallies posed by Iran is real. As the current refugee crisis and prior \nacts of terror clearly demonstrate, instability and violence in the \nMiddle East reverberates into other parts of the world.\n  I do not believe that the President's agreement reduces that threat \nof violence or adds to the stability of the region. Instead, the \nagreement will strengthen Iran's position--you can already tell by \ntheir swaggering bravado of rhetoric that we hear--and leave the United \nStates with fewer ways to combat nuclear proliferation. For those \nreasons, I will vote to reject the President's nuclear agreement with \nIran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today for the 110th time to ask \nmy colleagues to wake up to climate change. Long after today's debate \nhas died down, it will still be looming and threatening. We stand now \nat the precipice of an environmental catastrophe. The burning of fossil \nfuels has unleashed a flood of carbon pollution that is pushing the \nclimate system planetwide into conditions that are unprecedented in \nhuman history. It has already permanently altered the world that we \nwill leave to future generations. If we keep sleepwalking through this \nand allow the carbon flood to continue, we will leave even bigger \nchanges and risk absolute catastrophe.\n  Last month marked the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. When \nthat storm made landfall in Southeast Louisiana on August 29, 2005, it \nwas a category 3 hurricane. Katrina's 125-mile-per-hour winds pushed a \nmassive storm surge before it that overtopped New Orleans' systems of \nlevees and flooded the city. By the end, Katrina killed an estimated \n1,200 people and caused more than $100 billion in damage. Images of \nbroken levees, flooded streets, and people stranded on their rooftops \nare seared into our national memory. This natural disaster--compounded \nby manmade errors--showed how vulnerable we are to major storms and how \nvigilant we must be in planning for these extreme events.\n  We can't say that climate change caused Katrina, but we do know that \nclimate change increases the risk posed by future storms. The oceans \nare warming, and warmer water temperatures load the dice for more \nintense storms and heavier rainfall. Meanwhile, sea levels rise on the \nshores of the gulf coast and the Southeastern States. Storm surges \nriding in on higher seas will push even more floodwater inland. For \nthose who suffered in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, we owe them \nto learn from that catastrophe and take to heart the human threat we \nface from climate change--lost lives, lost property, and scarred \ncommunities. But that seems unacceptable to some on the Republican \nside. That would be admitting to the scale of the problem, would oblige \nthem to offer a solution, and would offend the fossil fuel industry. \nThe polluters' grip on the Republican Party is remorseless.\n\n  President Obama went to New Orleans to honor the memory of those lost \nin Katrina and to hail the city's resurgence. But get this: Before the \nPresident's visit, Louisiana Governor and Republican Presidential \ncandidate Bobby Jindal sent a letter to President Obama urging him not \nto talk about climate change, not to insert what he called ``the \ndivisive political agenda of liberal environmental activism.'' Really? \nSo when is it OK to talk about climate change, and what does Governor \nJindal have to say about it? ``I'm sure that human activity is having \nan impact on the climate,'' he said. ``But I would leave it to the \nscientists to decide how much, what that means, and what are the \nconsequences.'' Sounds to me like just another version of that \nRepublican climate denial classic, ``I'm not a scientist.''\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\n  OK, Governor. Let's leave it to the scientists. The scientific \ncommunity has determined that human activity is responsible for just \nabout all of the warming we have observed around the globe since the \n1950s.\n  In 2012, scientists from Louisiana State University and the Southern \nClimate Impacts Planning Program, which is a consortium of researchers \nfrom NOAA, LSU, Texas A, and the University of Oklahoma, reported on \nthe risks climate change poses for Louisiana and the gulf coast. \nThrough their research, they found the following:\n\n       Over the past century, both air and water temperatures have \n     been on the rise across the region.\n       Rising ocean temperatures heighten hurricane intensity, and \n     recent years have seen a number of large, damaging \n     hurricanes.\n       In some Gulf Coast locations, local sea level is increasing \n     at over 10 times the global rate, increasing the risk of \n     severe flooding.\n       Saltwater intrusion from rising sea levels damages \n     wetlands, an important line of coastal defense against storm \n     surge and spawning grounds for commercially valuable fish and \n     shellfish.\n\n  I don't need to tell the Presiding Officer the importance of the fish \nand shellfish industry to the State of Louisiana.\n  The study's lead author, Hal Needham, said:\n\n       Climate change is already taking a toll on the Gulf Coast, \n     but if we act now to become more resilient, we can reduce the \n     risks, save billions in future costs, and preserve a way of \n     life.\n\n  I certainly don't need to tell the Presiding Officer about the way of \nlife.\n  Dr. Needham continues:\n\n       The Gulf Coast is one of the first regions to feel the \n     impacts of climate change.\n\n  Sea level rise is already an immediate problem for Louisiana, and it \nis one that is going to get rapidly worse.\n  This chart comes from the New Orleans Times-Picayune. It shows how \nsea level rise will inundate the Louisiana coast. This area on the \nchart is New Orleans. Red areas, such as these, will be lost underneath \n1 foot of sea level rise, 2 feet of sea level rise will inundate the \norange areas, and the yellow areas will be lost and will disappear \nunder water at 3.3 feet--1 meter--of sea level rise.\n  According to analysis from the Risky Business Project, mean sea level \nat Grand Isle, LA, will likely rise up to 2.4 feet by 2050. That takes \nus over the orange. It will rise up to 5.8 feet by 2100--i.e., at the \nend of this century. All of the red, all of the orange, all of the \nyellow, and more will be inundated. The Risky Business Project \nestimates that by 2030, almost $20 billion in existing coastal property \nin Louisiana will likely be below mean sea level. People own that \nproperty. That is $20 billion that will be lost. That is a lot to ask \npeople to pay. By 2050, that number--the value of lost land to sea \nlevel rise--increases to between $33 billion and $45 billion.\n  The science is clear. Just look to the scientists at LSU, Tiger \nscientists. The threat is real. Yet, for Governor Jindal, climate \nchange should not be mentioned. It is inconvenient.\n  Republican Presidential candidates--except one, the senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina--would rather avoid any talk of it. They all \nprotest the President's Clean Power Plan to limit carbon emissions from \npowerplants, but which of them offers an alternative? None. And, like \nhis fellow candidates, Governor Jindal's stated position is to have no \nplan.\n  State and national scientific agencies and experts, local officials \naround the country, corporate leaders, military professionals, \nphysicians and health care professionals, and faith leaders are all \ntelling us this is a problem and begging us to wake up. Yet, the \nRepublican Presidential candidates and, frankly, the Republican Party \nhere in the Senate have nothing--nothing. They don't even want to talk \nabout it.\n  The American people are in favor of action. Polling from Stanford \nUniversity and the New York Times shows that two-thirds of Americans, \nincluding half of Republicans, favor government action to reduce global \nwarming, and two-thirds, including half of Republicans, would be more \nlikely to vote for a candidate who campaigns on fighting climate \nchange. So why doesn't the GOP have a climate plan?\n  Regular Louisianans are doing their part to rebuild their State's \nnatural defenses. Common Ground Relief, a Lower Ninth Ward-based \noperation aimed at creating resilient gulf coast communities, has been \nplanting marsh grass and trees--about 10,000 trees every year--in the \nwetlands and barrier islands along the Louisiana coast. Those natural \nbarriers can absorb some of the power of big storms and take some of \nthe pressure off the new levees. Last July, New Orleans mayor Mitch \nLandrieu joined Pope Francis at the Vatican to discuss global \nchallenges, including climate change. Mayor Landrieu recalled the \nmemory of Katrina. I will quote him:\n\n       We have now become a warning to all the others. Neglected \n     environmental degradation has consequences. The poor are hit \n     the hardest and they suffer the most. The levees broke, the \n     water flooded in, and in the blink of an eye, the Gulf of \n     Mexico surged over the rooftops of a great American city. \n     Thousands of us, many of the most vulnerable who couldn't \n     find a way to evacuate the city, were left behind as if their \n     lives did not have value.\n\n  We know that we are loading the dice for more damaging weather with \nour relentless carbon pollution. To pretend this threat does not exist \nis to put property at risk, to put communities at risk, and to put \nAmerican lives at risk. And incidentally, it is also to put our heads \nin the sand.\n  Eventually the Republican Party is going to have to break itself free \nfrom the clutches of the fossil fuel industry. They are going to have \nto. They are losing the American people, their own young voters. And \nthey are going to have to rise up to their duty to serve the people of \ntheir States and of this country. It is my hope that when they get \naround to doing that, it won't be too late, but it is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The esteemed Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice for the \nbipartisan disapproval of the President's nuclear agreement with Iran \nthat we have been debating all week and that we will continue to \ndebate. I do so in the spirit that resulted in 83 U.S. Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle writing a letter just last year to the \nPresident of the United States. This letter hasn't gotten a lot of \nattention in this debate, and I certainly think it should.\n  In that spirit, the Senate, in an incredibly bipartisan way--by the \nway, several of those Senators are still here. There were 41 Democrats, \n41 Republicans, and 1 Independent who signed this letter to the \nPresident of the United States saying: These are the strategic goals we \nwant in this agreement, these are the goals we should have for the \nsecurity of the United States, and these are the goals we think will \nprotect America and our allies. None of these have been met in the \nnuclear agreement we have been debating. This letter says that Iran \nmust dismantle its nuclear weapons program and it must be prevented \nfrom ever having a path to a nuclear bomb. It also states that Iran \nshould have no inherent right to enrichment.\n  I commend my colleagues to reread this letter. The President's \nnuclear deal clearly does not meet the goals that are laid out in the \nletter. Nonetheless, it has become clear that a number of Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle are going to vote to support the \nPresident's agreement despite having signed that letter. That is going \nto be a personal decision for them, but if you are a signatory, you \nought to take another look at the letter you signed to the President \nand the American people in 2014.\n  I will lay out a few of my concerns about the deal. I think many of \nmy colleagues have done a fantastic job this week. I don't want to name \nnames, but there are so many on both sides of the aisle--again, \nbipartisan--who have raised their concerns about the President's \nIranian nuclear deal.\n  One of the biggest frustrations I think so many of us have seen as we \nhave done our sacred duty in this body--to read the agreement, to \nunderstand the details, to go to all of the hearings and briefings, to \nreach out to experts in the field--as we have raised questions about \nthis agreement, what we don't get is straight talk. What we have been \ngetting, unfortunately, is spin.\n  I think Senator Coats did a great job yesterday of explaining how \nthis agreement is filled with ambiguities, with language that allows it \nto mean so many different things to so many different people, including \nIranians. Let\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nme provide a few examples that many of us have raised and that I have \nspoken on the floor about in the past, but I think they are important \nenough and they bear repeating.\n  First, Secretary Kerry came and said to us: There is no grandfather \nclause in this agreement. So we see Europeans rushing now to invest in \nIran. The Secretary said there is no grandfather clause. Here is what \nparagraph 37 of the agreement says:\n\n       In such an event that sanctions are reimposed, the \n     provisions in this paragraph would not apply with retroactive \n     effect to contracts signed between any party in Iran or \n     Iranian individuals and entities prior to the date of \n     application.\n\n  That sure sounds like a grandfather clause to me, but we are told it \nis not.\n  Second, there has been much talk about this snapback provision, but \nthere is no provision in this agreement that says ``snap back.'' We \ntalked about how we are going to immediately increase sanctions \novernight.\n  I had the opportunity to be a part of the Bush administration's team \nthat was economically isolating Iran. We went around the world to our \nallies--we had to threaten, in many cases, our European and other \nallies to divest out of Iran. That is how we got the economic isolation \nof Iran. It took years to do this. It took years. Yet, this \nadministration is saying: Overnight, despite the fact that European \ncompanies are already in Tehran investing, we are going to snapback \nsanctions overnight. It is not a snap. Divestiture out of Iran is a \nslog, and it will take years, again. The snapback is a fallacy.\n  Finally, Senator Ayotte and others have done a great job of raising \nquestions about a basic scenario that is laid out--very important--with \nregard to other paragraphs in this agreement. In an important \nhypothetical, which is actually very likely, we have asked Secretary \nKerry and Secretary Lew--a number of us: Let's assume sanctions are \nlifted. In six to nine months, the economy starts humming, the Annex II \nsanctions are lifted, is Iran still a sponsor of terrorism--the world's \nlargest sponsor of terrorism--and they commit an act of terror. This \nbody goes to reimpose sanctions; whoever the next President is agrees \nbecause of some heinous act of terrorism. What Iran can do is cite \neither paragraph 26 or paragraph 37 that states: ``If sanctions are \nreinstated, in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to \ncease performing its commitments'' under the entire agreement.\n  So what happens? We resanction Iran for a terrorist action that they \nare likely to take. They say: Hey, we can legally walk. Read paragraph \n26. Read paragraph 37. Read our letter to the U.N. Security Council. It \nis all laid out there. They walk, legally; the sanctions are lifted, \nthey are still the No. 1 sponsor of terrorism in the world, their \neconomy is humming, and they are on the verge of getting a nuclear \nweapon.\n  We have asked that question to the administration leaders who \nnegotiated this deal time and time again, and they have never given us \nan answer as to why that is not a correct reading of this agreement--\nbecause it is.\n  These are just a few examples. Many of my colleagues have done an \noutstanding job of looking at different parts of this agreement and \nexpressing our concerns, but just as important is what our constituents \nthink. What do Alaskans think? What do the American people think? Like \nall of my colleagues, I spent my recess back home in Alaska, and I \nspoke to hundreds of my fellow Alaskans at townhall meetings, \nroundtable discussions, our State fair.\n  Remarkably, I did not have one Alaskan come up to me saying: I really \nthink you should support that Iranian nuclear deal of the President's. \nEvery single interaction I had was in opposition to this agreement, and \nit was visceral, particularly among Alaska veterans. We are a proud \nState. We have the largest number of veterans per capita of any State \nin the Union. But whether they were recent vets from Iraq or \nAfghanistan or Vietnam vets, they literally would look at me and say: \nWhat on Earth are we doing? Help me understand that, Senator Sullivan. \nWhat are we doing? Visceral.\n  During this debate this week, even some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle--they are not big supporters--are using terms such as \n``seriously flawed,'' ``deeply flawed,'' ``serious concerns,'' ``falls \nshort in many areas.'' Across the country, Americans are overwhelmingly \nopposed to this deal by a margin of 2 to 1. And the more the public \nknows about the deal, the more they dislike it. These poll numbers in \nterms of support are dropping. Right now, the latest poll, 21 percent \nof Americans--that is it--support this deal.\n  The people are wise. They elected us to listen, and we should do so. \nThey might not know all the details as some of us do, but they know--\nthey know--I saw it from my constituents--that something is \nfundamentally wrong with this agreement.\n  So we have to ask ourselves why. Why? Why are Americans--the more the \nPresident and John Kerry talk about this agreement, the more Americans \nbecome opposed to it. And why are even the supporters, as we saw this \nweek, so tepid in their support?\n  Now, all negotiations require compromise. All negotiations require \nconcessions. We all know this. We have negotiated. In fact, many of my \ncolleagues, particularly on the other side, emphasize this. Concessions \nare part of what we do. They are part of an agreement, but at a certain \npoint, concessions become humiliations. If they are too significant and \ntoo frequent, concessions are humiliations. No one likes to be \nhumiliated, but especially proud citizens of a great Nation like the \nUnited States do not like to be humiliated.\n  That is what I believe is going on here. This, I believe, explains \nthe visceral reaction we have seen in opposition to this deal. \nAmericans feel that our concessions not just to any country, but to the \nworld's No. 1 sponsor of terrorism, have gone so far that they are \nhumiliating to our great country. People feel that our concessions have \ngone so far, it is as if we are treating Iran as an equal, and Iran is \nnot an equal to the United States of America.\n  I first started to realize this and sense it during a closed briefing \nwith Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. She was sent to brief the \nSenate on the secret side deal between the IAEA and Iran involving the \ninspection regime at the Parchin military facility, long suspected as \nIran's premier nuclear weapons facility. Senator McCain spoke about \nthis briefing yesterday. For those of us--again, Democrats and \nRepublicans--who went to this briefing, it was pretty remarkable, and I \nam not saying that in a positive way. It was actually unbelievable to \nhave a senior member of the Obama negotiating team first begin the \nbriefing by telling us she had seen this secret side deal, but she \ndidn't have a copy of it, and she wasn't allowed to have a copy of it \nbecause it was just between Iran and the IAEA. So the Iranians had it, \nthey were reading it, but not us. No matter that the President had just \nsigned a law--the Corker-Cardin law--that required the administration \nto provide this agreement to the Congress. No matter that the United \nStates is a board member of the IAEA--not only a board member; we are \nthe country that came up with the idea of the IAEA. This was an \nAmerican initiative in the 1950s. Our board member could have demanded \nthis agreement, but we were told it was just between Iran and the IAEA.\n  This, of course, was an affront to the law, to the American people, \nbut the worst was yet to come. Under Secretary Sherman then actually \ndescribed the substance of this secret side deal, the essence of which \nwe all know now because it was eventually leaked to the press. Here is \nthe essence of that side deal: Iran will conduct the inspections at the \nParchin nuclear facility by themselves, with no one else present. Let \nme repeat that. No one else is allowed in that facility. Iran will \nconduct the inspections by itself. They will take air samples. They \nwill take environmental samples. She was literally describing Iranian \nofficials with a camera filming themselves in the facility with no one \nelse there, and they were going to give this film and these samples--\nwhose chain of custody we can't trust--to IAEA officials, who are not \nallowed in the facility.\n  Every jaw in that room dropped, every Senator--Democrat, Republican. \nI remember looking around the room. We couldn't believe it. Heads were \nshaking. The U.S. Senate was stunned.\n  After claims by the President that his agreement had the most \nintrusive inspection regime ever, after being told by the President \nthat his agreement\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\nhad nothing to do with having to trust Iran--it wasn't about trusting \nIran--we are told in a briefing by one of his top negotiators that with \nregard to the most suspicious nuclear weapons facility site in Iran, \nthe Iranians will inspect themselves.\n  The AP broke the story, and when they did, they stated that the \nsecret side deal at Parchin will ``let the Iranians themselves look for \nsigns of the very activity they deny--past work on nuclear weapons.''\n  Let me repeat that. This is the AP. The side deal--that we are \nagreeing to, by the way, in the Senate, or that some of my colleagues \nare--will ``let the Iranians themselves look for signs of the very \nactivity they deny--past work on nuclear weapons.''\n  This secret side deal is absurd on its face. This secret side deal \nwill let Iran cheat with impunity. This secret side deal is fully and \nunequivocally based on trusting the Iranians, regardless of what the \nadministration officials say about the deal. And this secret side deal \nis not just some kind of concession; it is a humiliation. The IAEA has \nnever done this with any country, ever--especially a country that is a \nserial cheater and continues to be the world's No. 1 sponsor of \ninternational terrorism.\n  For these reasons alone, as Senator Perdue mentioned yesterday, the \nSenate should reject the President's deal. It certainly doesn't square \nwith many of the demands in the March 2014 Senate letter from 83 U.S. \nSenators last year, one of which was: We believe Iran must fully \nresolve concerns addressed in the United Nations Security Council \nresolutions, including any military dimensions of its nuclear \nprogram. Well, that is not going to happen in Parchin. We believe Iran \nmust also submit to a long-term and intrusive inspection and \nverification regime--83 Senators said this to the President. That is \nnot going to happen at Parchin either. But these kind of absurd \nconcessions go much further than the Parchin inspection side deal, and \nthey are the driving force for why so many Americans reject this deal \nso overwhelmingly.\n\n  When we agreed to lift sanctions on General Soleimani, the head of \nthe Quds Force, that wasn't a concession, that was a humiliation. \nSenator Ernst said last night it was a slap in the face to our \nveterans, many of whom were killed by IEDs supplied by General \nSoleimani.\n  When the leader of Russia, one of our so-called international \npartners, met with General Soleimani recently to discuss arms \ntransfers, that wasn't a concession, that was an outrage.\n  When the United States, in the President's agreement, states that it \nwants ``a new relationship with Iran'' and they don't respond in kind \nin the agreement but respond by saying ``Death to America'' in their \nweekly chants, that is not a concession, that is a humiliation.\n  When we agree in the agreement to ``protect Iran from nuclear \nsecurity threats, including sabotage''--that is in the agreement--that \nis not a concession, that is an outrage.\n  When the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says that under no \ncircumstances should Iran ever obtain ballistic missiles and only days \nlater the Secretary of State agrees to lift the ban on ballistic \nmissiles and conventional weapons, that is not a concession, that is an \nabdication.\n  When we go into minute detail in this agreement--dozens of pages on \nour obligations to lift sanctions, including our obligations to \nliterally import Iranian pistachios--that kind of detail--yet we can't \nget four American hostages released, that is not a concession, that is \na humiliation.\n  Finally, when we give the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism \nupfront relief and tens of billions of dollars in a signing bonus and \nwe are told by administration officials that certainly Iran is going to \nuse some of those proceeds to conduct terrorism activities against \nAmericans and our allies, that is not a concession, that is a \nsurrender.\n  It is a culmination of the so-called concessions that give our \nconstituents the sinking feeling that the President's agreement is \ndecidedly not in our interest. That is dangerous for our country, and \nit is the scope and number of these concessions that solidify the sense \nthat during these negotiations we have slowly and subtly ceded our \npower to a country that just recently was considered the world's No. 1 \npariah state.\n  When these negotiations began, every country in the world was \nstanding against Iran and international sanctions were crippling them. \nThat is what brought them to the table, as Senator Corker mentioned \nearlier today. And guess what. This was due not to the international \ncommunity's leadership, not to China, not to Russia, not to the \nEuropean Union, this was due to the leadership of the United States of \nAmerica, the Members in the Democratic Party and Republican Party of \nthe Congress, and members of the Bush administration and the Obama \nadministration. That is what brought them to the table--American \nleadership, Congress, and the executive branch working together.\n  Remarkably, the deal the President and the administration have \nnegotiated has flipped all of this on its head. It is incredible that \nwe are at this point, as if we are treating Iran as an equal, blessed \nby all the world's great powers. Make no mistake, we are, as Senator \nCardin and others mentioned--this deal legitimizes Iran's nuclear \nprogram and it blesses Iran as a threshold nuclear power.\n  So the question has to be asked: Why not stick the original goals set \nout by the Senate just a year ago, in 2014, in the letter to the \nPresident to dismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities, to prevent them \nfrom having enrichment capability.\n  Well, according to the President, he has stated, ``There is no one \nwho thinks that Iran would or could ever accept that, and the \ninternational community does not take that view that Iran can't have a \npeaceful nuclear program.''\n  The Congress of the United States and the Senate of the United States \nthought that just a year ago. So it is remarkable that the President \nsays now there is no way we can get that done. Why not go back to Iran \nand the P5+1 and get a better deal, one without the serious flaws that \nso many Members, Democratic and Republican, have stated over the last \nweek?\n  In a remarkable interview with the Atlantic Monthly, Secretary Kerry \ntalks about how, if we sought a better deal, if he went back and sought \na better deal--a deal, by the way, that 83 Senators said we needed to \nhave--we would be ``screwing Iran and the Ayatollah, and we will be \nconfirming the Ayatollah's suspicion that the United States is \nuntrustworthy.'' That is a quote from the Secretary of State of the \nUnited States. In another interview, Secretary Kerry said he would ``be \nembarrassed'' to go out and try for a better deal.\n  What is most remarkable of all is that in attempts to sell this deal \nto the Congress and the American people, the President and his team no \nlonger emphasized that Iran, the world's biggest sponsor of terrorism, \nis isolated, is a pariah state, but instead they emphasized that our \nmost important ally in the Middle East, Israel, is, and so, too, is the \nCongress, and so, too, will be the United States if we don't approve \nthe President's deal.\n  On August 5, the President stated that ``every nation in the world \nthat has commented publicly supports this agreement, except Israel.'' \nAnd U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, our Ambassador, recently stated, \n``If we walk away, there is no rewrite of the deal on the table. We \nwould go from a situation in which Iran is isolated to one in which the \nUnited States is isolated.''\n  This rhetoric represents a fundamental shift in a world view. We have \nbeen debating this Iranian deal for the past week, but we really are \ndebating America's role in the world. There is a world view that is \ntaking hold with this administration, one where America is no longer \nthe leader of the free world but a player as part of an international \npartnership, one where we don't lead by example but are being led by \nothers, one where we are leading from behind, one where we are \nembarrassed--that is in the Secretary of State's words--rather than \nsteadfast, and one where we are more worried about ``screwing'' the \nhead of a pariah state than standing with our most steadfast ally in \nthe region, the nation of Israel.\n  This kind of deal that we are debating today is what an echo chamber \nproduces. This is what happens when you want a deal too badly, when you \nwill\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\nnot walk away from the table during negotiations, when your view of \nAmerica's leadership role in the world is tentative, tepid, and not \nconfident, and this is what happens when you fail to listen to the \nAmerican people. This is what happens. Right turns wrong, good turns \nbad, a country that recently was a pariah state, the largest state \nsponsor of terrorism, is steering the negotiations and welcomed to the \ncommunity of nations, and top officials in the United States of America \nare afraid that we will become isolated if we demand a stronger deal \nthat keeps us and our allies safe. This, in effect, is how bad and \ndangerous policy is made.\n  I would like to conclude by talking about our role with regard to \nthis agreement. History has shown that on most major foreign policy \nissues, when the United States of America is most effective and most \nstrong is when the Congress and the Executive are working together. \nThat is the way our Constitution was structured, and that has been \nAmerica's history since the founding of the Republic. The examples \nabound from this Chamber. The Louisiana Purchase--something important \nto you, Mr. President--passed the Senate, bipartisan majority vote 24 \nto 7; NATO was ratified by bipartisan majority, 82 to 13; the first \nstrategic arms limitations negotiations with the Soviet Union, \nbipartisan majority, 88 to 2; even something as controversial as \nrelinquishing control of the Panama Canal to Panama, bipartisan \nmajority, 68 to 32.\n  More recently in 2010, this body voted to further reduce nuclear arms \nwith the Russians, bipartisan majority, 71 to 26.\n  One common area of agreement is that everybody who has talked about \nthis agreement this week on both sides of the aisle has stated it was \none of the most important national security issues facing the United \nStates in a generation, whether and how and to what degree the world's \nlargest sponsor of terrorism is going to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n  But perhaps for the first time in U.S. history, an agreement that is \nso grave and important for the national security of our great Nation is \ngoing to move forward, not with a bipartisan majority in the U.S. \nSenate but a partisan minority in both Houses. Such result will \nundermine America's strength and I believe shows a profound disregard \nfor our constitutional form of government. Even the Iranian Parliament \nis going to need a majority to pass this agreement, but the world's \ngreatest democracy will not, and I believe that is another humiliation.\n  Finally, just a few hours ago we saw what has been a theme throughout \nthis entire process--how the administration has been dismissive of the \nAmerican people, not wanting a role for the American people through \ntheir representatives in Congress to weigh in on this deal.\n  If the President is so proud of this agreement, he shouldn't be \ndirecting Democrats to filibuster it. I believe the vote we just took \nis a sad day for the U.S. Senate. If this deal was good for the country \nand our allies, I would certainly be gladly supporting it, but it is \nnot, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate knows it. That is why a \nbipartisan majority of this body is voting against it. We are doing so \nbecause it is a bad deal, a deal that will make the world more \ndangerous, and we are doing so because the American people see that, \ntoo, and they are counting on us to protect them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the agreement reached \nin July on Iran's nuclear program.\n  Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is one of the most \nimportant objectives of our national security policy. I have strongly \nadvocated for and supported the economic sanctions that brought Iran to \nthe negotiating table. While the agreement is by no means perfect, I \nhave concluded it is our best available option to put the brakes on \nIran's development of a nuclear weapon, and that is why I support it.\n  I do this with my eyes wide open to the nature of the Iranian regime, \nincluding its human rights abuses, its unjustified detention of \nAmerican citizens, its threats against Israel, and its destabilizing \nactions in the region, including its support for terrorist groups.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have reviewed the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action as agreed to by the P5+1 nations and Iran. I have \nattended briefings with national security and nuclear experts. I have \nspoken with Minnesotans who hold strong views on both sides of this \nissue. Finally, I have met with the Ambassadors from the other five \nnations involved in these negotiations and asked detailed questions \nabout what their countries and others would do if Congress does not \napprove the agreement.\n  After a lot of thought and discussion, I have concluded that an Iran \nin possession of a nuclear weapon would make an already volatile \nsituation much worse by greatly increasing the danger to Israel and our \nother allies in the Mideast. If we were to reject this agreement, Iran \nwould be able to continue all of its destabilizing activities while \ncontinuing its pursuit of the most destructive weapon in the world.\n  I have deep respect for those who hold different views on this \nsubject and acknowledge that this was a difficult decision. As I have \nproven through my votes and my actions since coming to the Senate, I am \ndeeply committed to protecting Israel's security, including full aid \nfunding and support for security measures such as Iron Dome.\n  In conjunction with my support for this agreement, I will push the \nadministration and my colleagues in Congress for additional assistance \nto Israel and our other regional allies to strengthen their security. I \nwill also continue to support efforts to combat terrorist groups in the \nMideast.\n  These are the reasons that led to my decision.\n  First of all, I believe this agreement, while imperfect, curbs Iran's \nability to develop a nuclear weapon. Before negotiations began in 2013, \nwe were moving steadily closer to the nightmare scenario of Iran \nobtaining a nuclear weapon. Even under the pressure of massive economic \nsanctions, Iran was continuing to build its nuclear infrastructure. It \nwas installing more and more centrifuges, accumulating a stockpile of \nenriched uranium, and building a reactor capable of producing spent \nfuel that can be reprocessed into plutonium.\n  That point deserves to be emphasized. The situation prior to the \nnegotiations was not a good one. We had the strongest sanctions regime \nin place, and it has brought Iran to the table, but Iran was still on \nthe path to developing a nuclear weapon. We have heard that without the \nrestrictions imposed on its program, Iran could produce a weapon in as \nlittle as 2 to 3 months. This negotiated agreement will put the brakes \non Iran's development of a nuclear weapon.\n  As recently noted in an open letter by 29 top American nuclear \nscientists, including 6 Nobel Laureates, the agreement contains ``more \nstringent constraints than any previously negotiated nonproliferation \nframework.''\n  Specifically, the agreement requires Iran to first of all give up 98 \npercent of its stockpile of enriched uranium and not enrich uranium to \nthe levels needed to create nuclear weapons. It would require Iran to \ndisconnect two-thirds of its centrifuges, with restrictions on where \nand how it can operate the remaining ones. It limits uranium enrichment \nto a single facility. Fordow, the fortified site that Iran long sought \nto hide from the world, will be converted into a research facility. The \ncore of Arak, the heavy water reactor, will be removed and filled with \ncement, rendering it unusable for the production of weapons-grade \nplutonium.\n  It will open its nuclear facilities to continuous monitoring and \nallow stringent inspections of its uranium supply chain. It will \npermanently commit to never seeking, developing, or acquiring nuclear \nweapons.\n  Second, if Iran cheats on this deal, sanctions can be reimposed or, \nas they say, snapped back. In addition--and this is very important to \nme--U.S. military options remain on the table, just as they were before \nthe deal. We are not bringing back ships. We have not agreed to do \nanything to take the military option off the table. This agreement by \nno means limits or lessens our country's ability to use force against \nIran if it violates this agreement and pursues nuclear weapons.\n  If Iran attempts to develop a nuclear weapon, the terms of this \nagreement\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nwill have given us more information and more limited targets in the \nevent that military action becomes necessary.\n  It should also be noted that this agreement does not in any way \nconstrain the ability of future Presidents or Congresses to authorize \nmilitary force against Iran.\n  Third, rejecting the agreement would lead to a splintering of the \ninternational partnership that has been critical to preventing Iran \nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon, that has been critical to bringing \nthem to the table, and that has been critical to these economic \nsanctions. They would not be nearly as effective if we had done them \nalone.\n  Some have argued that we should reject this deal so we can return to \nthe negotiating table. Yet, I recently met with the Ambassadors \nrepresenting the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China. \nNot one of them believed that abandoning this deal would result in a \nbetter deal. Instead, it would allow Iran more time to build up its \nnuclear infrastructure. The countries that have been our partners in \nthis effort would no longer be unified. The sanctions regime would \nstart to fray, splintering the international consensus on Iran and \nleaving its nuclear program unconstrained.\n  Finally, this agreement must move in parallel with increased \ncommitment to security assistance for Israel and our other allies in \nthe region. In my view, the most troubling issue with this agreement \nthat one my colleagues has addressed is that sanctions relief Iran will \nreceive after it implements key restrictions on its nuclear program \nwill provide it with additional funds, and a certain portion of those \nfunds could be funneled into Iran's destabilizing activities around the \nregion.\n  I am deeply committed to the security of our allies and want to \nensure that we are taking steps, in parallel with this nuclear \nagreement, to enhance our allies' ability to defend themselves. I want \nto see further enhancements of our security assistance to Israel, \ngreater defense cooperation with our Arab allies, and stronger actions \nto counter Iranian militant activities.\n  We are in the midst of discussing other initiatives in this Chamber \nto provide additional assistance and enhance the security of Israel and \nour allies in the region. I will work with my colleagues and the \nadministration as we move forward. That is how I will end. I call upon \nthe administration and all of my colleagues to work together to help \nensure that this agreement works and to help ensure that we provide the \nassistance necessary to protect Israel and our allies.\n  As I said earlier, I have deep respect for people who have different \nviews. We have had a lengthy debate. We have looked at this agreement \nnow for over a month and had time to ask questions of the Energy \nSecretary and the Secretary of State and anyone we could about this \nagreement. So the time is now here where I believe this agreement \nshould be approved. And, again, we have different views. I think it is \nvery important, given the heated nature at times of this debate, that \nwe come together when this is over to stand up for Israel, our beacon \nof democracy in the Mideast, and continue to work together on a \nbipartisan basis on our Mideastern policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the majority leader for \nscheduling this debate about the agreement struck by the Obama \nadministration and the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is \nimportant to highlight right up front what this deal is. It is nothing \nmore than a political agreement between President Obama and the current \nleaders of Iran. This deal does not have the support of the American \npeople, nor will it have the consent of their elected representatives \nhere in Congress. At no point in the course of negotiating this deal \ndid the Obama administration seek the advice and consent of the Senate \nor display any respect for the constitutional limits of the Executive \nin foreign affairs.\n  Nevertheless, I am glad the Senate has been debating this agreement \nbecause this is how the Senate is supposed to function, on the basis of \nopen and robust deliberation. I hope it is how the Senate will function \nwell into the future on matters of national security and domestic \npolicy.\n  But if the debate we are trying to have today could be congressional \ndeliberation at its best, the Obama administration's deal with Iran is \nthe product of diplomacy at its worst. As the negotiations neared \ncompletion earlier this year, President Obama began building his case \nfor the deal on the specious claim that the only alternative to the \ndeal was war.\n  This black-or-white setup--the notion that the art of statesmanship \nis little more than navigating a series of binary either-or \npropositions--is plainly absurd. It misses the mark. We learned this \nfrom the fiasco following the New START treaty in 2010. At that time, \nPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton warned that it was the only way \nto reset the relationship with Russia. But now, 5 years later, we know \nit was, in fact, the starting point for the worst era of U.S.-Russia \nrelations since the Cold War. But the Obama administration has repeated \nthis ``my way or war'' maxim with such faithful devotion and emotional \nconviction that it appears at some point along the way they began to \nbelieve it themselves. They actually started to believe it, even \nthought it was wrong.\n  Just look at the facts regarding this deal.\n  Fact No. 1: The centerpiece of the agreement is the lifting of \nsignificant portions of the multilateral financial, energy, and \ntransportation sanctions currently imposed against Iran. Lifting these \nsanctions--lifting them prior to any meaningful action by Iran in \nexchange--will immediately give the world's largest supporter of \nterrorism access to tens of billions of dollars in currently frozen \nassets. That is just on day one. Welcoming Iran with open arms to the \nglobal marketplace will provide untold future riches to Tehran's \nrevolutionary government.\n  The current sanctions are not perfect, but they are in place for a \nvery good reason: to restrict Iran's access to resources we know its \nradical leaders will use to acquire nuclear weapons and continue \nexporting terrorism not only throughout the region but throughout the \nworld. This is not a matter of speculation. It is not a matter of \nhyperbole. It is exactly what Iran's own leaders have told us in no \nuncertain terms.\n  Those sanctions were originally put in place in response to Iran's \nrepeated violations of previous nuclear agreements. It is complete \nfantasy to believe they can be revived in the future when--not if but \nwhen--they cheat on this deal.\n  Fact No. 2: Nothing in the agreement will prevent Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. It won't. Under the terms of this deal, \nthe Iranian Government will be allowed to conduct research on more \nadvanced nuclear centrifuges after only 8 years. After 15 years, there \nwill be no limits whatsoever on their nuclear fuel production--no \nlimits whatsoever. To believe that this deal will stop the Iranian \nnuclear weapons program requires an act of blind faith. In fact, it \nrequires us to disregard the facts altogether.\n  Fact No. 3: This agreement will increase Iran's access to \nconventional weapons and ballistic missiles. It will do this by \nproviding for the removal of the U.N. conventional arms and ballistic \nmissile technology embargo. If this seems out of place in an agreement \nthat was supposed to be about Iran's nuclear weapons program, well, \nthat is because it is. It is entirely out of place for this type of an \nagreement. It was never supposed to be part of the deal. But you see, \nin the eleventh-hour negotiations, the Ayatollah demanded it, sensing--\nrightly--that the Obama administration was unlikely to object.\n\n  This deal is not the work of savvy negotiation. No, this deal is the \nproduct of desperate capitulation. For years, this administration has \nbeen dead set on reaching a deal, any deal with the mullahs in Iran. \nThat is why they got the deal they did, an agreement that fulfills a \nwish list for the Iranians and the sprawling network of terrorist \ngroups that depend on their largesse, including Hezbollah, Hamas, the \nHouthis in Yemen, and Bashar al-Assad's tyrannical regime in Syria.\n  And what does the United States get in exchange? Well, we get a \npromise from the Ayatollah to abandon Iran's 35-year quest for \ndeliverable nuclear\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\nweapons--weapons they crave for the explicit purpose, as they put it, \nof wiping Israel off the face of the Earth and fulfilling the \naspiration of their infamous motto ``Death to America.''\n  Evidently, this is good enough for the Obama administration and for \nthe supporters of this deal, but it is not good enough for the American \npeople--not even close.\n  In fact, the public opposes the proposed deal by a 2-to-1 margin, but \nnot because they are clamoring for war with Iran. The truth is that \nmost Americans would prefer a diplomatic solution to the problems posed \nby Iran's apocalyptic, nuclear, ambitious theocracy. But this is not a \ndiplomatic solution. This diplomacy won't solve anything.\n  I would note that the public's overwhelming opposition to the Iran \ndeal did not catch the Obama administration by surprise. In fact, \npublic opposition to the deal was one of the primary reasons why the \nadministration decided not to submit the agreement to the Senate for \nratification as a treaty.\n  When Secretary Kerry testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee just a few weeks ago, I asked him to explain why the \nagreement with Iran was not submitted to the Senate as a treaty for \nratification--ratification requiring two-thirds of the Members of this \nbody who support it. His answer was, in effect, to say that the deal \ndoes not amount to a treaty because it is a multilateral agreement, one \nthat involves more countries than just Iran and the United States.\n  But the inclusion of multiple parties to an international agreement \nhas absolutely no bearing whatsoever on whether it can be considered a \ntreaty. There is no shortage of examples of this, of examples of \nmultilateral agreements that have been ratified by the Senate, \nincluding the Chemical Weapons Convention, including the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty.\n  In fact, as I pointed out to Secretary Kerry at the time, the State \nDepartment's own Web site provides a definition of the word ``treaty'' \nthat includes multilateral agreements, which is why I think the more \nhonest and troubling answer was the one that he provided just 1 day \nearlier when Congressman Reid Ribble of Wisconsin asked Secretary Kerry \nthe exact same question: Why does the Obama administration not consider \nthe Iran deal to be a treaty?\n  This was Secretary Kerry's response to that question asked just 1 day \nearlier in the other body. Secretary of State John Kerry said as \nfollows:\n\n       Well, Congressman, I spent quite a few years trying to get \n     a lot of treaties through the United States Senate, and \n     frankly, it's become physically impossible. That's why. \n     Because you can't pass a treaty anymore.\n\n  This is indefensible. Secretary Kerry's appeal to expedience shows an \nignorance of--or disdain for--both principle and precedent. The Senate \nhas not lost the ability to ratify a treaty. No, the Senate is \nperfectly capable of ratifying treaties, as it did 160 times during the \nGeorge W. Bush administration. It is just reluctant to ratify unpopular \ntreaties and treaties that undermine U.S. interests. There is a \ndistinction between these two types of treaties.\n  From the Obama administration's perspective, this is a problem with \nthe Senate. But from the perspective of the Constitution, this is the \npurpose of the Senate, and it is exactly why the framers included the \nSenate in the treaty-making process.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states that the President \n``shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, \nto make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur.''\n  The sharing of the treaty-making power between the Executive and the \nSenate is not a quirk, nor is it optional. It is a constitutional \ncommand. Both branches are essential. They are essential to this \nprocess. Without both branches, you cannot make a treaty and have it \ntake effect.\n  The Executive is best suited to manage negotiations with foreign \nnations, but only legislative consent can grant the kind of broad \npolitical consensus necessary to ensure that the United States lives up \nto the terms of an agreement in the long run.\n  In ``The Federalist,'' Alexander Hamilton defended the sharing of \ntreaty-making power between the Executive and the Senate. He wrote: \n``The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of \nhuman virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests \nof so delicate and momentous a kind, as those which concern its \nintercourse with the rest of the world, to the sole disposal of [the] \nPresident of the United States.''\n  Of course, not all international agreements are treaties, and those \nthat aren't do not need legislative consent in order to go into effect. \nBut, historically, agreements that make long-term commitments or \ninclude significant changes to the United States' relationship to \nanother country have been considered treaties and have, therefore, been \nsubmitted to the Senate for approval.\n  As I see it, the Iran deal fits both of these categories quite \ncomfortably. The terms of the deal purport to extend well beyond \nPresident Obama's remaining time in office. According to the \nadministration's own reckoning, this agreement will fundamentally alter \nthe relationship between the United States and Iran.\n  People of good faith can disagree about whether the Iran deal should \nbe considered a treaty or merely an executive agreement, though not on \nthe farcical grounds provided by Secretary Kerry.\n  But this debate is worth having. This is the debate that we should be \nhaving. It is worth it for the sake of our national security and for \nthe health of our political institutions, and it is a debate that must \ninclude the Senate, just as the Constitution itself requires.\n  The past few months have been a case study of the dysfunction and the \ndanger that result when the Executive chooses to ignore, instead of \nengage with, the Senate in order to determine whether an international \nagreement should be considered a treaty.\n  The President's go-it-alone approach has become all too familiar in \nthe realm of domestic policy.\n  President Obama has spent much of the last 6\\1/2\\ years justifying \nhis will-to-power Presidency on the basis of expediency. Constitutional \nrestraints and historical precedent have only slowed--never stopped--\nthe President's routine abuse of power to unilaterally impose his \ndomestic policy preferences on the country. Now, with this Iran deal \nfailing to receive the support of even half of the Senate, the \nPresident appears willing to extend his imperial Presidency, even to \nthe area of foreign policy.\n  We must do everything in our power to stop this Iran agreement from \nreceiving congressional sanction. The facts are clear. This is a bad \ndeal for global security, it is a bad deal for our allies--including, \nespecially, Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East--and it is a \nbad deal for the American people. But we must also learn from this \nexperience.\n  Later this year, the Obama administration will negotiate a major \nclimate change agreement, what will be known as the Paris Protocol. \nAlready the administration has indicated it does not intend to submit \nthe protocol to the Senate for ratification, even though the agreement \nwould call for a significant expansion of the already broad powers of \nour Federal regulatory regime.\n  It would empower unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to seize even \nmore control over the American energy sector and insert themselves ever \nfurther into the everyday lives of the American people.\n  On account of its expected size, scope, cause, and effect on the \nAmerican economy, failure to submit the Paris Protocol to the Senate as \na treaty would be an unprecedented and dangerous abuse of Executive \npower.\n  Now is the time to make clear to ourselves, to the White House, and \nto the American people that the Senate understands and plans to defend \nthe centrality of the treaty-making process to the negotiation of \ninternational trade agreements and the full and rightful role of the \nSenate in that important process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join my colleagues this afternoon in \nspeaking on a joint resolution on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction with Iran.\n  I wanted to make clear my position on this agreement. We use the term\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\n``deal'' in the Senate talking about the Iran deal. I almost feel like \nwe need to put it in quotation marks because in my mind a deal is \nsomething that has been negotiated in give-and-take, back-and-forth, \nand there is an agreement that is relatively evenhanded or fair on both \nsides. I do not believe that this deal is a fair deal. I will support \nthe resolution of disapproval when we have that opportunity for that \nvote.\n  This is not where I hoped I would be on this because I do believe--\nand I do believe strongly--that diplomacy is the way that we solve \ndisagreements around the world. I think that most of us were actually \nvery hopeful when the administration began negotiation some years ago \nwith the aim and with the purpose that Iran would cease its nuclear \nprogram and end its progress toward a nuclear weapon.\n  I believe that our world would be safer if we were able to achieve \nthose goals--without question--and these are goals that the President \nhimself articulated. He stated specifically that this was his aim.\n  But, unfortunately, this agreement fails to meet those goals. Simply \nput, this agreement is not in our national interest.\n  After considerable study and considering the terms of the agreement \nand the views of experts on both sides, the many closed hearings that \nwe had, the many public hearings that were out there, I have concluded \nthat this is not just a bad deal, but I think this is a sad deal. I \nthink this is a sad time for us because of this deal.\n  In fact, this is a deal that borders on capitulation and appeasement, \na deal that rewards nuclear extortion. Those are pretty tough words, \nbut that is where I feel we are--a deal which is far worse than no deal \nat all.\n  I reject, absolutely out of hand, the statement from our President \nthat we have no choice, that it is either this deal or it is war. That \nis a false choice, and I think it is wrong to put it that way before \nthe American people.\n  Certainly, these negotiations were hard. They were very difficult. \nThat is the nature of these negotiations and deliberations.\n  But other options do exist, and we have been on the floor for several \ndays talking back and forth about them. Well, what else is there? Well, \nfirst, there are the sanctions that got Iran to the table in the first \nplace. There are even stronger sanctions that can be imposed. There is \ncontinued diplomacy. It is not an apt description to say it is this \ndeal or it is war.\n\n  Before I discuss my specific objections to the agreement, I would \nlike to place my views on this agreement in context with my views on \ninternational agreements in general. I am certainly not opposed to \njoining with international partners in making the world a better and a \nmore peaceful place. On issues ranging from the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities to the new START treaty, I have \nworked with the administration. I have been there.\n  I approach these issues with an open mind and an open heart, and I \nhave strived to maintain an open mind on this agreement. But quite \nhonestly it is hard, it is really hard, if not impossible, to maintain \nan open heart when it comes to Iran. Iran is not a country that is open \nto resetting relations with a world that clearly is seeking peace and a \ncivil society. Before it entered into this agreement, Iran wasn't \ntalking about a reset here, and it has shown no evidence of changing \nits ways because of where we are with this agreement now.\n  We hear every day that Iran's senior leaders are leading the chant \n``Death to America.'' And they said this before the agreement. One \nwould think maybe now there has been this agreement that tone would \nchange. But no, despite all the efforts of Secretary Kerry and others, \nthey are still chanting ``Death to America'' today. That hasn't \nchanged.\n  In fact, just yesterday the Supreme Leader called again for the \nobliteration of Israel. These are not rabble rousers in the street. \nThese are the leaders in Iran who are calling repeatedly for ``Death to \nAmerica'' and to wipe Israel off the map. Say what you will about the \nreportedly moderate President Rouhani, but the facts speak for \nthemselves.\n  We have The Washington Post's Tehran correspondent who has been in \njail since July of 2014. Iran continues to hold him on trumped-up \nespionage charges, and he is not alone. Iran also holds an American \npastor, a U.S. marine who traveled to Iran to visit family members, and \nit is believed to hold Robert Levinson, who was kidnapped from an \nisland off of Iran's coast. Iran continues to persecute Christians and \nBaha'is in its own country. These are flagrant human rights violations.\n  The facts do not suggest to me this is a regime that is ready for \nreform. I am not speaking about human rights violations that occurred \nat an early time in history. This is here, this is now. These \npersecutions, these human rights violations, these imprisonments are \nright here, right now.\n  If this were not enough to cause one to question whether we can trust \nIran to change its ways, consider this. Iran is a key funder of Hamas \nand Hezbollah, committed to the destruction of the State of Israel. It \nfunds the rockets which are launched into Israel's sovereign territory \nfrom Gaza, southern Lebanon from Syria, and these rockets don't just \nthreaten Iran's sworn enemy, the State of Israel. They also endanger \ncivilian populations in the countries from which they are launched by \ninviting, if not demanding, immediate retaliation from Israel. So one \nhas to ask the question: Is this a nation that is committed to peace \nand good global citizenship? Hardly. It just is not.\n  I think we recognize--and the Presiding Officer, in his capacity \nbefore coming to the Senate, has been engaged in diplomatic \nnegotiations, and he knows that in diplomacy we often end up \nnegotiating with those who don't share our views, don't share our \nvalues. It is important for us to look at what Iran gives the world in \nreturn for this agreement. In light of the progress Iran has made in \nits quest to develop a nuclear weapon, it was imperative to me that an \nagreement--if we were going to get to an agreement--must not simply \narrest Iran's nuclear ambition but require the abandonment of those \nambitions. It had to stop those nuclear ambitions. The agreement before \nus, viewed in absolutely the most favorable light, simply does not \naccomplish this goal. At best we have pushed the pause button. At best \nit puts a pause on Iran's final preparations towards becoming a full-\nfledged nuclear state.\n  And even then, to regard that pause as meaningful requires me to \nsuspend disbelief. I have to suspend my disbelief that Iran can be \ntrusted to live up to the terms of the agreement. I must believe that \neven though Iran is not required to fully disclose the military \ndimensions of its existing nuclear program, the international \nverification mechanisms are indeed effective. I can't do that.\n  I must also believe that other nations will be inclined to \nmeaningfully call out Iran on violations and not simply rationalize \nthem away in order to keep up the appearances this deal is working. I \ndon't think that is going to happen.\n  Each of these assumptions is just a bridge too far. I can't get \nthere. And I hear from Alaskans, as I know my colleague in the Chair \ndoes, when they are asking me: Hey, what happened to these anytime, \nanywhere inspections this administration was promising? Now they are \nnot there. They are asking about these snapback sanctions. It is a \npretty catchy word, but what exactly does it mean? How feasible is it? \nIs it practicable in its implementation?\n  And I can't look at them squarely in the eye and say: Sure, you can \ncount on those snapback provisions to come into play. And even if we \ncould get them back in, we know those sanctions would be weaker, would \nbe less effective than what we have now.\n  Alaskans are also asking: Well, what about these side agreements--\nthese side agreements between Iran and the IAEA--how is it only they \nknow what is going on there?\n  And we can't go back to our constituents, we can't go back to the \ngood people of the great State of Alaska and say with confidence: Yes, \nwe have these provisions on verification that give us that security; \nyes, snapback sanctions are practicable; no, there are no side, secret \nagreements. We can't do that.\n  Before causing the release of billions of dollars in frozen Iranian \nassets and allowing sanctions to expire, I need some clear and \nconvincing and unequivocal evidence this agreement will\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nachieve what it set out to achieve. Ideally, I seek Iran's commitment \nto change its ways, to act as a responsible player on the world stage. \nIt was through sanctions--and we keep hearing this on both sides, \nwhether you support this agreement or do not support this agreement--\nthat Iran was brought to the table in the first place by crippling \nsanctions. We will lose our leverage with Iran once those sanctions are \ndialed back. Whether it is 9 months or longer, we lose that leverage. \nSo I am very concerned about where we are with unfreezing assets and \nreleasing sanctions.\n  Many of us have spoken on the floor here about how Iran will now have \nbillions of dollars to spend creating further chaos in the Middle East \nor arming Israel's enemies or developing rockets which someday might be \nused to deliver nuclear weapons. You can count me as one of the \nskeptics. I do not believe Iran will choose to do good with these \nnewfound sources of revenue. I do not believe that they are going to be \nputting these resources into rebuilding roads and hospitals and \ninfrastructure. I am that skeptic, and I think I join many here in \nnoting what we have seen even under crippling sanctions, when Iran \ndidn't have access to the frozen resources and funds that will be \navailable to them under the deal, they still found a way to direct and \nfinance acts of terrorism throughout the Middle East. Should we give \nthem more money in their hands to do more mischief? Count me as a \nskeptic.\n  As you know, I focus a great deal on the energy issues as the \nchairman of the energy committee. I am very concerned about the \nopportunities this agreement affords Iran's oil sector--opportunities \nthat come at the expense of America's energy producers and our overall \neconomy in the near term. The Energy Information Administration here in \nWashington and the International Energy Agency in Paris estimates that \nlifting sanctions on Iran could raise Iranian output by some 700,000 \nbarrels per day.\n  Now, we recognize that production is going to take some time to ramp \nup and to bring back online--perhaps well into next year and beyond--\nbut it will come. What we do have in place and ready to go is Iran's \nfloating storage facilities. They are ready to go now and to move that \noil out onto the market. And these supplies will do what? They will \nwork to push down global oil prices.\n  We know that will be a good thing for consumers everywhere, but what \ndo we do here in this country? We ban the exports of our oil. In \neffect, we sanction ourselves. So we are going to let Iran have access \nto the global oil market, put some 700,000 barrels a day of oil out \nthere, gain new revenues to help their economy, and also do whatever \nelse they may do--create that havoc and chaos and mischief, and fund \nterrorism.\n  We are going to see oil tankers filling up at Kharg Island instead of \nGalveston. They are going to be setting sail for our allies in South \nKorea, Japan, and elsewhere. Our diplomacy is going to benefit Iranian \nproducers while our antiquated domestic export ban is going to harm \nAmerican producers.\n  This misalignment--and I have outlined it in several white papers out \nthere--can be corrected. We can correct it legislatively, and the \nadministration can correct it. And now that the President claims he has \nhis veto-proof margin of support for the Iran deal, I think there is \neven greater urgency for this Congress to move on this issue. That is \nanother issue, but I think it is important to raise. It is just one of \nthe many issues that I believe demonstrates that Iran is looking at \nthis as a good deal for them. They got the most out of this negotiation \nand gave the least.\n  Iran's strategy of nuclear extortion has not been disabled. To the \ncontrary, it has been rewarded. What do they get? What do they get? \nThey get a pathway to nuclear weapons, ICBM program, conventional \nweapons, sanctions gone, and a stronger economy. It sounds like a \npretty good deal for Iran. It sounds like a pretty good deal for Iran \nbut certainly not for the security of this country and not for the \nsecurity of our allies.\n  I suspect that many of my colleagues, even some who are voting for \nthis agreement, concur with my conclusion that Iran is getting a better \ndeal. We have seen a flurry of comments not only in print but we have \ncertainly heard great discussion on the floor that this agreement is \nflawed, it is not what we wanted, and it is not what we would have \nnegotiated.\n  The comments from colleagues supporting this say we have to take it \nbecause there is no other option here. The President has said it is \nthis or it is war; there is no other option. If you don't like this \nplan, what is your plan? Then they say we can't have the administration \nwalk away because American prestige will suffer if Congress forces the \nadministration to walk away from this deal. This is not about American \nprestige, and this should not be about a President's legacy. This is \nabout our security as a nation.\n  Just this morning, I met with a family with three young girls in high \nschool from Juneau, AK. They were doing a walk-through of the Capitol, \nand they came over to my hideaway. We were talking, and I let them know \nI was finishing the comments on my statement here. We got to talking \nabout this agreement, and they wanted to know my position on it. I \nsaid: Quite simply, I cannot support an agreement that fails to make \nour Nation a safer place, that fails to make the world a safer place.\n  It has been suggested that this agreement is better than no deal; in \nother words, that a bad deal is better than no deal at all. I cannot \naccept this. I cannot accept this, and I don't think this is a \nsituation where we are holding out for the perfect; to use the \nexpression, we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I am not \nlooking for a perfect deal. I am not looking for a perfect deal, but I \nam demanding one that makes our Nation a safer place--safer with the \ndeal than without--and this agreement doesn't do it. I place the blame \nfirmly with the administration.\n  The President did not work with this Congress. He did not throughout \nthe course of the negotiations try to align our expectations with the \ndirection he was taking to determine what a good agreement might look \nlike that we could all concur with.\n  So I am not surprised that this deal remains so unpopular with the \nAmerican public. There are a bunch of polls out there. The latest one \nfrom Pew says only about 20 percent of the American people support this \nagreement. I do think it is important to note that on this floor we do \nhave a bipartisan majority of Members in who oppose this deal. I \nunderstand that is true in the House as well. I think that is \nimportant. And I do think it is unfortunate, with the vote we took just \nhours ago, that we are not able to get to a straight up or down vote on \nthe resolution of disapproval at this point in time. The whole premise \nof the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act--something that 98 of us \nagreed voted for, was that we, as the representatives from our \nrespective States around the country, would be able to speak yea or nay \nto this issue by way of a vote.\n  The American people want Iran out of the nuclear weapons business--it \nis pretty simple--and that means dismantlement. The American people \nwant their President to demonstrate backbone in the negotiations, not \ncapitulation, not appeasement--not appeasement of Iran, whose leaders \nseem to take continued pride in this pattern of unacceptable and often \nreprehensible behavior. This deal simply does not get us there. That is \nwhy I join so many others in opposition.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the privilege of the time on the \nfloor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose this \nagreement with Iran. And they are going to have another chance.\n  Traveling around Wyoming during August and part of September, I \ntalked to hundreds of people. I found four who thought maybe we ought \nto give this a try--until I asked them this key question. I asked: Do \nyou trust Iran? Now, I have 100 percent of the people saying no.\n  A contractor who had done business in Iran said that right after he \nsigned the contract over there, the Iranian who was working the \nnegotiations with him said: You do realize that when you sign the \ncontract is when the negotiations begin. That is whom we are working \nwith on this.\n  Iran's nuclear program is one of the most significant threats facing \nthe\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\nUnited States and the world today. The implications of this deal will \nhave serious consequences for the Middle East and especially our allies \nin the Middle East.\n  Russia and China are especially interested in this deal because of \nhow it changes the international playing field. The President was so \npleased that Russia signed on. Well, of course they did. They get to \nsell unlimited arms and technology. They gave up nothing.\n  Ultimately, this deal will have serious consequences for the national \nsecurity of the United States. I ask you, Do you trust Iran?\n  Several of my colleagues said there is no other alternative. That is \nhow it always is with a contract or a treaty or an agreement. You have \nto vote for or against it. I am very disappointed in our negotiators. I \ndon't think they were negotiators.\n  I remember the President saying we would be able to have inspections \nanytime. That is just as believable as when we were going through \nObamaCare and he said: If you like your insurance policy, you can keep \nit. Nobody got to. This is in that same category, except this is more \nserious. We are talking about world peace. We are talking about \nsecurity.\n  Sanctions brought them to the table. It was leverage. It worked. Then \nwe gave that up so we could sit down and talk to them, and then we \ndidn't leave the table when they wouldn't agree to things that were \nabsolutely needed. What kind of negotiation is that? That is where you \ntrust the Iranians?\n  Iran's goal is to use its nuclear program to extort its neighbors and \nthreaten its enemies, and it has made it very clear that it considers \nthe United States their No. 1 enemy. We cannot afford to make the kind \nof strategic blunder that would give Iran a nuclear weapon. We should \nnot give up the advantages we have that were working to prevent Iran's \nnuclear ambitions. That is why we should oppose this deal. Again I ask: \nDo you trust Iran?\n  President Obama has said that if we don't accept this deal, then the \nonly other option is war with Iran, but this isn't true. I don't think \nanybody believes that. It is the President's way of trying to convince \nthe American people that his way is the only way--just like ObamaCare--\nand that is not true.\n  One of the advantages of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that \nwas passed out of the Senate committee unanimously is that by requiring \nthe President to submit the deal to Congress for review, both the House \nand the Senate as well as the public can see what is in the deal--kind \nof see what is in the deal.\n  I really object to the other side saying we didn't read that. We read \nwhat was available. I reviewed the deal. I have heard the \nadministration's arguments in favor of it, and I don't believe this \ndeal is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. I \ndon't think it prevents them from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  I have heard from experts in diplomacy, from experts in arms control \nand proliferation, from experts in the military, from national security \nand intelligence experts who say that this deal is not the only way to \nprevent Iran's nuclear ambitions. Do you trust Iran?\n  I mentioned that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act is important \nbecause it requires the deal and all its documents to be sent to \nCongress for review, but I do understand there are separate side \nagreements between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency--and \nso far as I can tell nobody from the United States has looked at those. \nThose have not been reviewed by Congress because they haven't been \nsubmitted for our review. I am told these side agreements deal with the \nmilitary dimensions of Iran's nuclear program--the parts of Iran's \nprogram that will allow them to launch a nuclear weapon against Israel \nor American forces in the Middle East or eventually, with enough work, \nanywhere in the world, including America. You don't sell someone a \nweapon whose intent is to kill you. Do you trust Iran?\n  I am deeply concerned that we don't have all the facts about this \ndeal. We need the facts about Iran's military program--facts about how \nconfident the administration can be that Iran is complying with the \nrules. We should not move forward with any agreement until we have a \nfull understanding of all of the components that are part of it and are \nconvinced it is a good deal. Do you trust Iran?\n  Understanding all of the components of this deal isn't just about the \ndocuments that were submitted to Congress; it is also about \nunderstanding what happens when Iran has the freedom and resources to \ngrab for power and position in the region. Do you trust Iran?\n  The administration has said this deal is a pathway to security and \nstability. Unfortunately, this administration has consistently \nmisjudged critical moments in the region--most recently, for not taking \nthe Islamic State seriously and developing a real strategy to defeat \nit. Agreeing to this deal is yet another example of the administration \nmisjudging the difficult and dangerous situation in the Middle East by \nbelieving Iran will not take advantage of the situation to attack our \nallies and undermine American interests.\n  There are numerous ways Iran can take advantage of this deal, such \nas--mentioned frequently--using the huge cash infusion that comes with \nthis deal to support Hezbollah or buying arms from Russia. This \nagreement is not a pathway to peace or stability. It is Iran's \nspringboard to grow into the Middle East's most dangerous bully.\n  There is even a little provision in here that any contracts entered \ninto before snapback can't be broken. How many contracts do we think \nthey will hurry up and do if they get the right to do them? They will \ndo every one they need to do--exactly what they want to do. Do you \ntrust Iran?\n  For more than a decade, the United States and our allies have used \nsanctions effectively to prevent Iran from achieving its nuclear \nambitions. Those sanctions took years to implement and demonstrated the \ncommitment of our international partners to prevent an outcome that \nwould be a disaster. Under this agreement, we would be giving up those \nsanctions in exchange for the hope that we can trust Iran. It sounds to \nme like we are giving up the most important tool we have to prevent a \nnuclear-capable Iran in exchange for nothing. Do you trust Iran?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this deal. It is not the best we can \nget. We will have another opportunity to vote. It ignores the reality \nof the complex and dangerous political situation in the Middle East, \nand it relies on nothing more than hope that Iran will keep its \npromise, despite all the times Iran has failed to do so in the past. It \ntrades an effective system of sanctions that has worked to prevent \nIran's nuclear ambition for nothing. It gives Iran everything it needs \nto pour money and resources into attacking our allies and making the \nregion more dangerous. I don't trust Iran, and I didn't find anybody in \nWyoming who does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention to a \nsituation I have spoken about previously, which is the ongoing \ncrackdown by the Correa Government on what little remains of the \nindependent media in Ecuador.\n  One of the things we have come to expect is that the press--and civil \nsociety organizations that expose corruption and challenge the \nofficially sanctioned version of reality--are the first casualties in \ncountries whose leaders are determined to remain in power at any cost.\n  Ecuador is a prime example. In 2013, President Rafael Correa issued a \ndecree granting the government broad powers to intervene in the \noperations of nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, including dissolving \ngroups on the vague grounds that they have ``compromise[d] public \npeace'' or have engaged in activities that were not listed when they \nregistered with the government. A modified version of the\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\ndecree, which maintains broad powers to close down NGOs, was adopted in \nAugust 2015.\n  On September 7, Ecuador's Communications Ministry opened an \nadministrative process to ``dissolve'' Fundamedios, an organization \nthat monitors freedom of expression in the country. According to \ninformation publicly available, the government contends that \nFundamedios engaged in political activities by publishing information \ncritical of the government--information that would be protected speech \nin any democracy.\n  Every politician knows that unfavorable press attention comes with \nthe territory. Here in the United States we accept it as a necessary \nreality of a free press. But the Correa Government wants to punish an \norganization for publishing news and opinions it doesn't like. \nSilencing the press, like dismantling an independent judiciary, are \nhallmarks of dictatorship. History is replete with examples.\n  Fundamedios, like other independent media and human rights defenders \nin Ecuador, has been a target of the Correa Government for years. Its \nmembers have been subjected to a pattern of harassment and persecution \nfor nothing more than engaging in activities that are protected by the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\n  As long as President Correa is in power it seems that the press and \ncivil society organizations in Ecuador will be under assault. But while \nany president or prime minister with the backing of the police and the \narmed forces can wreak havoc on the institutions of democracy, history \nalso provides any number of examples where, in the end, the public's \ndemand for freedom of expression and government accountability \nprevailed. We are seeing that today in Guatemala, and I have little \ndoubt that the tide will similarly turn against repression in Ecuador.\n  Ecuador is a country blessed with wonderful people including unique \nindigenous cultures, with spectacular geography and extraordinary \nbiological diversity, as found in the Galapagos Islands, and with \nmagnificent colonial architecture. It is also a country with a history \nof military coups and fragile democratic institutions. It is \nregrettable that as President Correa solidifies his grip on power by \nsilencing his critics, the country is taking on more and more of the \ncharacteristics of a police state.\n  Fundamedios has a few days to defend itself before the Communications \nMinistry until a final ruling is issued. Let us hope that wisdom will \nprevail, that the forces of repression in Ecuador will withdraw, that \nthe right of free expression will be reaffirmed, and that Fundamedios \nwill be allowed to continue to operate. There is still time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6597-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6597-S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for September 2015. The report compares current law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine \nwhether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has \nbeen prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee \nand the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  This is the second report I have made since adoption of the fiscal \nyear 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My first filing can be \nfound in the Congressional Record on July 9, 2015. The information \ncontained in this report is current through September 8, 2015.\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \nis below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This \ninformation is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to \nsection 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. For fiscal \nyear 2015, which is still enforced under direction of the Bipartisan \nBudget Act of 2013, BBA, Senate authorizing committees have increased \ndirect spending outlays by $7.8 billion more than the agreed upon \nspending levels. Over the fiscal year 2016 to 2025 period, which is the \nentire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate authorizing committees \nhave spent $3.1 billion less than the budget resolution calls for.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This \ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \nspending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. While no \nappropriations bills have been enacted for fiscal year 2016, \nsubcommittees are charged with permanent and advanced appropriations \nthat first become available in that year.\n  Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for Overseas \nContingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. \nThis separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 \nof S. Con. Res. 11, and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. No \nbills providing funds with the OCO/GWOT designation have been enacted \nthus far for fiscal year 2016.\n  The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting \nthe use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, \nCHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for \noverall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This \ninformation is used for determining points of order under section 3103 \nand section 3104, respectively. No bills have been enacted thus far for \nfiscal year 2016 that include CHIMPS.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress.\n  Because legislation can still be enacted that would have an effect on \nfiscal year 2015, CBO provided a report for both fiscal year 2015 and \nfiscal year 2016. This information is used to enforce aggregate \nspending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. \nCBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal \nyear 2015 exceed the amounts in the deemed budget resolution enacted in \nthe BBA by $8.0 billion in budget authority and $1.0 billion in \noutlays. Revenues are $79.8 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal \nyear 2015 set by the deemed budget resolution. As well, Social Security \noutlays are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2015, while Social \nSecurity revenues are $170 million above levels in the deemed budget.\n  For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are below \nthe budget resolution's allowable budget authority and outlay \naggregates by $886.0 billion and $526.9 billion, respectively. The \nallowable spending room will be reduced as appropriations bills for \nfiscal year 2016 are enacted. Revenues are $104 million above the level \nassumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays are \nat the levels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, \nwhile Social Security revenues are $2 million below assumed levels for \nthe budget year.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently \nshows deficit reduction of $2.0 billion over the fiscal year 2015 to \n2020 period and $6.8 billion over the fiscal year 2015 to 2025 period. \nOver the initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that \nwould increase revenues by $3.9 billion and increase outlays by $1.9 \nbillion. Over the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that \nwould reduce revenues by $1.6 billion and decrease outlays by $8.3 \nbillion. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of \nS. Con.

Mr. President, in a solemn ceremony today, a new visitor \ncenter and museum was opened at the site near Shanksville, PA, where 40 \ncourageous Americans were killed 14 years ago tomorrow attempting to \nregain control of United Airlines Flight 93 from four hijackers. The 9/\n11 Commission Report makes it clear that the hijackers intended to \ncrash Flight 93 either into the White House or the U.S. Capitol \nBuilding.\n  Our individual and collective memories of that horrific day remain \nfresh, and the pain is still very real. But in the minutes, hours, \ndays, and years following the attacks, Americans have showed their \namazing propensity for bravery, sacrifice, selflessness, and compassion \nin an incredible variety of ways.\n  Today, American men and women in this country and abroad stand at the \nready to thwart the plans of those who wish to do us harm. We have an \nobligation to support them and their families during their missions, as \nwell as when their missions end. Congress has a special obligation to \ncare for those still living with the emotional and medical burdens of \nthe attacks. As we begin to craft a new budget for our country, I will \nwork to ensure full funding for the programs that support the first \nresponders who risked their health in the effort to help others.\n  Others have said that the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 \ndidn't test the American character; they revealed it. The terrorist \nattacks were\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\nintended to crush the American spirit; instead, they galvanized it to \nnew strengths. We came together as a nation to grieve. We came together \nas a nation to bury our dead and to care for those who were hurt. We \ncame together as a nation to rebuild. And we came together as a nation \nto pursue those who were responsible for the attacks and bring them to \njustice. We have accomplished a great deal with respect to those \nmissions, but we have so much more to do. We must never become \ncomplacent. We must never lose our resolve.\n  We have a larger mission. President John F. Kennedy was on his way to \ndeliver a speech at the Trade Mart in Dallas when he was assassinated \non November 22, 1963. He was going to say:\n\n       We in this country, in this generation, are--by destiny \n     rather than choice--the watchmen on the walls of world \n     freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our \n     power and responsibility, that we may exercise our strength \n     with wisdom and restraint, and that we may achieve in our \n     time and for all time the ancient vison of ``peace on earth, \n     good will toward men.'' That must always be our goal, and the \n     righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. \n     For as was written long ago: ``except the Lord keep the city, \n     the watchman waketh but in vain.''\n\n  Being ``watchmen on the walls of world freedom'' is an awesome \nresponsibility. There are times when the responsibility seems more of a \nburden than a privilege. There are times when the world's problems seem \nabsolutely intractable and we grow weary of it all. There are times \nwhen we as Americans disagree whether or how we should meet that \nresponsibility.\n  Today, both houses of Congress are involved in a debate about the \nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action--JCPOA--with respect to Iran, a \nState sponsor of terrorism with nuclear ambitions. We have serious \ndisagreements about whether to support the JCPOA. It is important, as \nwe debate this issue, to remember that no one among us is clairvoyant \nor has a total grasp of the truth; no ideology or philosophy has a \nmonopoly on wisdom. No party has complete political acumen. And no \ngroup has exclusive rights to use the word ``patriot''.\n  If we want to honor the men and women on Flight 93 and on the three \nother hijacked jets, if we want to honor the people in the World Trade \nCenter and at the Pentagon, if we want to honor the brave first \nresponders who were climbing up the steps of the Twin Towers as people \nwere streaming down the steps, and if we want to honor the service men \nand women who have given their lives in defense of our Nation, let us \nremember that what unites us as Americans is far more important than \nwhat divides us on particular issues, even an issue as existentially \ncrucial as restraining Iran's worst intentions and lawlessness. We are \nall Americans, each with the desire to see our families, our \ncommunities, and our Nation prosper, and to promote the American ideals \nof peace and freedom and justice to every corner of the Earth.\n  About 100 miles east of Shanksville, there is another field \nconsecrated by the blood of Americans who gave ``the last full measure \nof devotion''--Gettysburg. As President Abraham Lincoln said, it is our \nresponsibility to dedicate ourselves ``to the unfinished work'' which \nothers ``have thus far so nobly advanced''. It is our responsibility to \ndedicate ourselves to the ``great task'' remaining before us, and that \ntask is ``a new birth of freedom''.\n  As we remember and mourn those who died in the 9/11 attacks and those \nwho have died since that dreadful day 14 years ago serving as \n``watchmen on the walls of world freedom'', let us meet our awesome \nresponsibility united, as Americans, all of us patriots in our own way, \nacknowledging that it is our privilege and it is our destiny.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6601-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    OBSERVING THE 21ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Sunday, September 13 marks the 21st \nanniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA. I have zero \ntolerance for domestic violence. No woman in this Nation should live in \nfear for her safety or the safety of her children. These victims need \nto have access to resources that can provide them with help. That is \nwhy I was proud to cosponsor this legislation when it was first enacted \nin 1994, and I am proud to have fought for every single one of its \nreauthorizations since.\n  The far-reaching impact of this legislation cannot be stressed \nenough. It has impacted the lives of millions of people--playing a \ncrucial role in our communities by providing important services to \nthose who are most vulnerable. Since the original VAWA legislation, \nmillions of women have called the National Domestic Violence hotline \nwho were desperate, who were fearful for their lives. When they called \nthat number, they got help. I know that it saved lives.\n  As vice chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the \nCommerce, Justice, Science, CJS, Appropriations Subcommittee, I fought \nto include $479 million in funding in the fiscal year 2016 CJS bill for \nthe U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women--the \nhighest funding level ever for these programs.\n  What is it that these programs do? They coordinate community \napproaches to end violence and sexual assault. They fund victims' \nservices like shelters and a national toll-free crisis hotline. They \nprovide counseling to victims of rape and sexual assault. They help \nprevent sexual assaults from happening on college campuses. They also \nfund legal assistance to victims to be able to get court orders to be \nable to protect themselves from the abuser or from the stalker.\n  Domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking are \ncrimes of epidemic proportions, exacting terrible costs on individual \nlives and our communities. Twenty-five percent of U.S. women report \nthat they have been physically assaulted by an intimate partner during \ntheir lifetimes, one in six have been the victims of rape or attempted \nrape, and the cost of domestic violence exceeds $8 billion each year. \nThese are numbers and statistics, but they also represent real people.\n  In my home State of Maryland, VAWA programs have personally impacted \npeople's lives. For example, ``Rita'' who was married to ``Jamie''--who \nwas physically abusive to her, and then sadly to their four-year-old \nson, and had been arrested on several occasions for dealing drugs--was \nable to get important legal assistance through a VAWA-funded program.\n  Rita obtained a protective order against Jamie, pressed criminal \ncharges against him, and he was found guilty of assault. Jamie is now \nwhere he belongs, locked behind bars.\n  The Sexual Assault Legal Institute, SALI, a program of the Maryland \nCoalition Against Sexual Assault, was able to represent Rita in her \ndivorce proceedings and custody case. Although this case remains \nongoing, through VAWA, the SALI program made it possible for Rita to \nget the important legal services she needed to protect herself and her \nson.\n  This story is just one of the many reasons why it is so important \nthat we continue to invest in programs to combat domestic abuse and \nsexual assault, and help enable victims to rebuild their lives. This is \nwhy I want to recognize 21 years of VAWA as law today, and remember the \ncountless number of lives it has impacted throughout the country. VAWA \nhas put into place so many invaluable programs that are effective and \nrelied upon by so many women and their families in Maryland and across \nthe nation. That is the reason why I will continue to fight for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6601-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6601-S6602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BORIS NEMTSOV\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last night I was honored to pay tribute to \na dear friend and personal hero, the late Boris Nemtsov. Boris Nemtsov \nwas the Russian opposition leader, former Deputy Prime Minister, and \nhuman rights activist who was murdered in February.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have my remarks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, it's a wonderful privilege to \n     introduce a personal hero--whose courage, selflessness and \n     idealism I find awe-inspiring--and ask him to accept an award \n     on behalf of another personal hero, a man of very great \n     courage and selflessness and idealism, Boris Nemtsov.\n       Vladimir Kara-Murza is deputy leader and co-founder with \n     Boris of the People's Freedom Party. He is the leading \n     coordinator of Open Russia. In the U.S., Vladimir was a \n     prominent and very effective advocate for\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\n     passage of the Magnitsky Act, which President Obama signed \n     into last December.\n       Most recently, he has eloquently and persuasively \n     campaigned to expand the act to impose sanctions on those \n     Russian journalists, who are so cowed and corrupted by the \n     Kremlin, they have become indispensable to propagating the \n     lies and atmosphere of hate, fear and violence the regime \n     relies on to maintain power.\n       Vladimir is a brave, outspoken, and relentless advocate for \n     freedom and democracy in Russia. All of his adult life and \n     even as a boy, he has been a steadfast champion for the rule \n     of law, for justice, for truth, for the dignity of the \n     Russian people. And like others in Russia who place the \n     interests of the Russian people before their own self-\n     interest, he has paid a price for his gallantry and \n     integrity.\n       In May of this year, he grew very ill and fell into a coma. \n     As has happened to other Putin critics, Vladimir was poisoned \n     in order to intimidate him or worse. His family brought him \n     to the U.S. for treatment this summer, and we are all very \n     relieved and grateful that he is recovering, and able to be \n     with us tonight.\n       Vladimir, you are an inspiration to the work of this \n     Institute, and to me personally. Your work is crucial to the \n     progress of freedom and justice in the world. You're a credit \n     to your family and your country. You've kept faith with your \n     ideals in confrontation with a cruel and dangerous autocracy.\n       And you have kept faith--honorably and bravely--with the \n     example of your friend and comrade, Boris Nemtsov, who died a \n     martyr for the rights of people who were taught to hate him \n     but who will one day mourn his death, revere his memory, and \n     despise his murderers.\n       Boris Nemtsov is a hero of the Russian Federation. He \n     doesn't need a posthumous Gold Star to deserve that \n     distinction. What worth is a decoration from the hands of a \n     tyrant and the sycophants and crooks who surround him? What \n     meaning would it have? He is beyond the calumnies and scorn \n     and cruelty of his enemies now. Freedom salutes Boris. \n     Justice proclaims him a hero. The truth reveres his memory.\n       Putin could never understand Boris. He could never \n     appreciate how someone could be impervious to threats and \n     slander, to the lure of corruption and the oppression of \n     fear. A man like Putin, who all his life has stood on the \n     wrong side of history, on the wrong side of morality, of \n     goodness, can't comprehend the power of righteousness. He is \n     blind to the supremacy of love. He can't see that all lies \n     are exposed eventually, hate is overcome by love, illicit \n     power decays, while the truth endures forever.\n       The people who killed Boris and the regime that protects \n     them are the enemies of the Russian people. They rob Russia \n     of its wealth, its hopes, its future. They deny the God-given \n     dignity of the people they misrule. They are thieves and \n     murderers. And they are cowards. They fear justice. They fear \n     truth. They fear a society in which ideals and morality are \n     the foundation of law and order.\n       Boris wasn't afraid. He knew his enemies. He knew what they \n     were capable of, but he would not be oppressed. He would not \n     be oppressed by unjust laws or by violence and fear. He was a \n     free man, and bravely so. He was accustomed to danger. But he \n     lived for love and justice and truth. He had been threatened \n     repeatedly and demonized by the regime's propaganda \n     apparatus. Yet when his enemies took his life in the shadow \n     of the Kremlin, they found him walking in the open air, \n     enjoying the evening, unafraid.\n       It was an honor to know him, and among the greatest \n     privileges of my life to call him a friend.\n       For his courage, for giving the last full measure of \n     devotion to his country and his countrymen, IRI awards the \n     2015 Freedom Award to the late Boris Nemtsov. May we long \n     find inspiration in his example. May we take renewed devotion \n     to the cause he died to advance. And may we, too, live \n     unafraid in the open air, for love and justice and truth.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6602-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6602-S6603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF NIH'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN'S \n                                 HEALTH\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 25th \nanniversary of the NIH's Office of Research on Women's Health, which \nwas established on September 10, 1990, to end gender bias in medical \nresearch.\n  It is hard to believe that 25 years ago, women were not included in \nprotocols at the NIH. Faux science said that our reproductive systems \ngot in the way or that we had ``raging hormones.''\n  I was here 25 years ago, as a young Senator representing the great \nState of Maryland. I remember this big ``landmark'' study coming out. \nIt showed that aspirin could help prevent heart attacks and save lives. \nEveryone was so excited. A relatively cheap and widely available \nmedication that could improve cardiovascular health--this was a huge \ndiscovery.\n  But then we looked closer at the study, and what did we find? We \nfound that the study tested the effects of aspirin on more than 22,000 \nmen, but zero women. Zero women. This big, landmark study enrolled only \nmen. How could that be? So we took a closer look, and we found that \nthis study--and the exclusion of women from clinical trials--was not an \naberration. We found that prior to 1989 clinical trials of new drugs \nwere routinely conducted predominantly on men, even though women \nconsume approximately 80 percent of pharmaceuticals in the United \nStates and make up half the population. To add fuel to the fire, a 1992 \nreport by the U.S. General Accounting Office found that less than half \nof prescription drugs on the market had been analyzed for gender-\nrelated response differences.\n  So what we had was a system where medical research was done based on \nmale-only clinical trials, which led to the development of diagnoses, \npreventive measures, and treatments that were commonly used in women, \ndespite never having been studied on women. As you might imagine, this \ndidn't sit well with the women in Congress. It certainly didn't sit \nwell with me.\n  At that time--in 1990--a lot was going on. George Bush the elder was \nin the White House. The gulf war was about to begin. The Hubble Space \nTelescope had just been launched. We didn't have a confirmed NIH \nDirector, and the Human Genome Project had just begun.\n  There was a lot going on in the world. But the women of Congress knew \nthat we had a real problem to solve. At the time, the Congressional \nCaucus for Women's Issues was comprised of myself and then-\nRepresentatives Pat Schroeder, Olympia Snowe, Connie Morella, and many \nothers. On Aug. 22, 1990, Pat, Olympia, Connie, and I sent a landmark \nletter to the Acting Director of NIH, Dr. William Raub, requesting a \npublic meeting to discuss how best to improve Federal research on \nwomen's health. We wanted all the key health people there: all 12 NIH \nInstitute Directors, then-HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, then-Surgeon \nGeneral Antonia Novello, and the beloved Dr. Ruth Kirschstein.\n  Let me speak a moment about Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, a woman who \nprovided direction and leadership to NIH through much of the second \nhalf of the 20th century. She was a daughter of immigrant parents. She \nweathered disgraceful prejudice and stereotyping of women and Jews. But \nthat didn't stop her. Thanks to hard work and perseverance, she went on \nto become a key player in the development of the polio vaccine, the \nfirst woman Director of a major Institute at NIH, and a lifelong \nchampion of the importance of basic biomedical research and training \nprograms that provided opportunity to all talented students. The \ncontributions made by Dr. Ruth Kirschstein to the NIH, to women's \nhealth, and to better health for all are invaluable.\n  But back to September 1990. On Sept. 10, 1990, the women of Congress \ngot our meeting. We drove out to the NIH's Bethesda campus--Connie \nMorella, Olympia Snowe, Pat Schroeder, and Barb all showed up. So did \nTime magazine and the TV cameras.\n  And what do you know. President Bush announced Dr. Bernadine Healy as \nthe first female Director of the NIH. Dr. Healy was a friend, a \ncolleague, and an adviser. She was a gifted physician and a brilliant \nresearcher and administrator. She was also a very special advocate for \nwomen. She was deeply committed to the advancement of women in science \nand biomedical research.\n  It is hard to believe that meeting at NIH happened 25 years ago \ntoday. And it marked the official establishment of the NIH's Office of \nResearch on Women's Health.\n  The NIH Office of Research on Women's Health was established to do \nthree things: ensure that women are included in NIH-funded clinical \nresearch; set research priorities to address gaps in scientific \nknowledge; and promote biomedical research careers for women.\n  Under Dr. Healy, the NIH's Office of Research on Women's Health \nreally came alive. She appointed Dr. Vivian Pinn as its first Director. \nAnd today the Office works in partnership with NIH's Institutes and \nCenters to ensure that women's health research is part of the \nscientific framework at NIH and throughout the scientific community. I \nam so proud of what they have accomplished over the past 25 years.\n  Thanks to the Office of Research on Women's Health, the Women's \nHealth\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\nInitiative was conducted. I remember when Dr. Healy came to me with the \nidea for this study. She needed money to get a study underway looking \nat post-menopausal hormone therapy. I was so proud to work on the \nAppropriations Committee to get Dr. Healy and NIH the money they \nneeded. I worked hand-in-hand with Senators Kennedy, Harkin, and \nSpecter.\n  The Women's Health Initiative had groundbreaking findings that led to \nbig changes in hormone replacement treatment protocols. As a result, we \nhave seen significant reductions in breast cancer rates. We have \nreduced the incidence of breast cancer by 10,000 to 15,000 cases per \nyear. Just think, this study alone--the brainchild of Dr. Healy--has \nhelped save 375,000 lives over the past 25 years.\n  But the Office of Research on Women's Health has done so much more. \nToday, more than half of participants in NIH-funded clinical trials are \nwomen. The office worked with the National Cancer Institute to develop \na vaccine that prevents the transmission of Human Papilloma Virus, HPV, \nresulting in fewer cervical cancer cases. The office worked with the \nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on a landmark \nstudy which showed that giving the drug AZT to certain HIV-infected \nwomen reduced risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV by two-\nthirds. The office has supported major advances in knowledge about \ngenetic risk for breast cancer and discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic \nrisk markers. The office codirects the NIH Working Group on Women in \nBiomedical Careers, which develops and evaluates policies to promote \nrecruitment, retention, and sustained advancement of women scientists.\n  We have come so far over the past 25 years, but we still have a long \nway to go. There remain striking gender differences in many diseases \nand conditions, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, cardiovascular \ndiseases, depression and brain disorders, Alzheimer's disease, \ndiabetes, and addictive disorders. We still don't have enough \ninformation on the involvement of women in clinical research and \ntrials. We still don't have reliable data on how drugs currently on the \nmarket affect women differently than men. And still to this day, women \nare often prescribed dosages devised for men's average weights and \nmetabolisms.\n  As you can see, there remains work to be done. But that doesn't mean \nwe can't take a moment to commemorate how far we have come over the \npast quarter century. I am immensely proud of the work done by the \nNIH's Office of Research on Women's Health and all those who have \nworked day-in and day-out to end gender bias in medical research, \nincluding Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, Dr. Bernadine Healy, Dr. Vivian Pinn, \nand Dr. Janine Clayton, current Director of the office. I very much \nlook forward to what the next 25 years will bring. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6603-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RECOGNIZING RILEY SLIVKA\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want to recognize Riley Slivka, \nof Winifred, MT.

Here, one can view his short film, \nHarvesting Along the Edge in Central Montana, which provides a \ncomprehensive look at the harvesting season.

Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize the 70th \nanniversary of an important entity to Southern Nevada, the Henderson \nChamber of Commerce. I am proud to honor this chamber that contributes \nso much in support of local businesses and Henderson's economy and job \nmarket.\n  Without a doubt, this city's businesses, both small and large, have a \ngreat impact on our State's growth. Through the dedication and hard \nwork of the Henderson Chamber of Commerce, Henderson's business \ncommunity continues to strive and maintain a high quality of life for \nresidents. Even when Nevada's economy took a difficult turn, the \nHenderson Chamber of Commerce intervened, fighting to help local \nbusinesses stay on their feet. It helped owners maneuver through an \nadverse economic climate with innovation, creativity, and ingenuity. To \nsay this chamber has had a positive impact on Southern Nevada would be \nan understatement. The strong foundation it has built will be felt for \nyears to come.\n  Aside from helping local businesses expand and thrive, the Henderson \nChamber of Commerce also offers entrepreneurs opportunities in \nnetworking, marketing, business development programs, ribbon cutting \nceremonies, and career openings. The chamber has 7 members serving on \nthe executive board and 16 others on the board of directors. I am \nthankful for their leadership and for the great things they are doing \nfor businesses in Southern Nevada.\n  For the past 70 years, the Henderson Chamber of Commerce has \ndemonstrated absolute dedication to the great State of Nevada and to \nthe Henderson business community. Without the hard work of those that \nhave served this chamber, the city of Henderson would not have \ndemonstrated the excellent growth that we see today. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring the Henderson Chamber of Commerce on \nits 70th anniversary and in thanking it for all it does to press on and \nfind ways to make the Nevada business community the best it can \nbe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6603-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6603-S6604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING MARIA SHEEHAN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Maria \nSheehan on her retirement after serving as president of Truckee Meadows \nCommunity College, TMCC, for 7 years. It gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize her years of hard work and commitment to making this \ninstitution the best it can be.\n  Ms. Sheehan began working at TMCC in 2008 and took over the top \nleadership position at the community college that same year in July in \nthe midst of a tumultuous economic downturn. Her leadership at the \ninstitution brought stability, creating a reliable administration and \nincreased opportunity for students. During her career, Ms. Sheehan \ncontributed greatly to the growth of TMCC, adding new buildings to the \nfacility, including the Health Science Center at the Redfield Campus. \nShe led the institution as it opened its Veterans Resource Center, an \nincredible resource for veterans wanting to go back to school after \ntheir service. She also spearheaded the complete renovation of the \ncollege's Applied Technology Center, providing students with the \ntechnical training and education needed to help grow Nevada's skilled \nworkforce. In addition, student success rates doubled throughout her \ntenure. No words can adequately thank her for her great contribution to \nNevada's students. Her positive legacy will continue on for years to \ncome.\n  As the husband of a teacher, I understand the important role academic \ninstitutions play in enriching the lives of Nevadans. Ensuring students \nthroughout the Silver State are prepared to compete in the 21st century \nis critical for the future of our country. The State of Nevada is \nfortunate to be home to educators like Ms. Sheehan.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Ms. \nSheehan for her dedication to enriching the lives of Nevada's students \nand in congratulating her on her retirement. She exemplifies the \nhighest standards of leadership and service and should be proud of her \nlong and meaningful career.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \noutstanding service of Meredith Jones, the president and CEO of the \nMaine Community Foundation, who is stepping down after 16 years of \nservice. Meredith has greatly strengthened the Foundation through her \nhard work and dedication, and she has helped Maine citizens immensely.\n  As a nonprofit that seeks to boost Maine's economy through investing \nin education, health, and leadership, the Maine Community Foundation \nhas greatly benefited from Meredith's time as president and CEO of the \norganization. Her work has helped to shape policies that will have a \ntangible impact on Mainers for years to come.\n  Meredith dedicated much of her career to public service, working for \nboth the Maine Health Care Association and the Maine Development \nFoundation before her time at the Maine Community Foundation. With her \nbackground in strategic planning, grantmaking, and fund development \ninitiatives, Meredith was more than equipped to take over as president \nand CEO in January of 2009.\n  Meredith not only successfully navigated the foundation through the \neconomic downturn of 2008-2009 but also helped the Maine Community \nfoundation reach new heights. During Meredith's time, the foundation \nmade over $160 million in grants and scholarship awards, as well as \nincreased charitable funds from $190 million to more than $420 million. \nMeredith worked to prioritize downtown revitalization, higher \neducation, and leadership development, all of which will have a \ntangible impact on Maine's future.\n  I would like to join the Maine Community Foundation in recognizing \nand thanking Meredith for her dedication to the great State of Maine. I \ncannot speak highly enough of Meredith and her successful tenure at the \nfoundation.

Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and \nhonor Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC, \nfor their 133rd anniversary.

A bill to prohibit Federal agencies and Federal contractors \nfrom requesting that an applicant for employment disclose criminal \nhistory record information before the applicant has received a \nconditional offer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Fair Chance to \nCompete for Jobs Act of 2015 or the Fair Chance Act. This bipartisan \nbill has the support of Senators Johnson, Baldwin, Ernst, and Brown, \nand I thank them for their support. Today, a bipartisan House companion \nbill to the Fair Chance Act has also been introduced. I thank \nCongressmen Cummings, Issa, Jackson Lee, Blumenauer, Watson Coleman, \nRichmond, Conyers, and Scott for their leadership on this issue.\n  Everyone deserves the dignity of work and the opportunity for a \nsecond chance to earn a living. But far too many Americans who return \nhome from behind bars have to disclose convictions on their initial \nemployment application or initial job interview that often serve as \ninsurmountable barriers to employment. This legislation would ensure \nthat people with convictions, who have paid their debt to society and \nwant to turn their lives around, have a fair chance to work.\n  By encouraging Federal employers to focus on an individual's \nqualifications and merit, and not solely on past mistakes, the Fair \nChance Act would remove burdensome and unnecessary obstacles that \nprevent formerly incarcerated people from reaching their full potential \nand contributing to society. It would also help reduce recidivism, \ncombat poverty, and prevent violence\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nin our communities by helping people get back to work.\n  In the last 30 years, our prison population has exploded. Since 1980, \nthe Federal prison population has grown by nearly 800 percent and our \ntotal prison population exceeds more than 2.2 million people. Taxpayers \nare wasting billions of dollars on overcrowded prisons that crush \npriceless human potential with lengthy prison terms that have failed to \nmake our communities safer. Yet, more than 90 percent of those \nsentenced to prison eventually get out and return home. Indeed, over \n600,000 people are released from prison each year.\n  Equally troubling, a high number of Americans living in our \ncommunities have criminal convictions. About 70 million people in the \nU.S. have been arrested or convicted of a crime. That means, almost one \nin three adults in the U.S. has a criminal record. In fact, in the \nNation's capital alone an estimated 1 in 10 D.C. residents has a \ncriminal record.\n  The American Bar Association has identified over 44,500 ``collateral \nconsequences''--or legal constraints--placed on what individuals with \nrecords can do once they have been released from prison. Of those, up \nto 70 percent are related to employment.\n  Without a job, it is impossible to provide for oneself and one's \nfamily. Yet, thousands of people with criminal convictions reenter \nsociety each year without employment. According to a recent New York \nTimes/CBS News/Kaiser Family Foundation poll, men with criminal records \naccount for about 34 percent of all nonworking men between the ages of \n25 and 54. In addition, a landmark study by Professor Devah Pager, of \nHarvard University's Department of Sociology, found that a criminal \nrecord reduces the likelihood of a callback or a job offer by nearly 50 \npercent for men in general. African-American men with criminal records \nhave been 60 percent less likely to receive a callback or job offer \nthan those with criminal records. In the land of opportunity, a \ncriminal conviction should not be a life sentence to unemployment.\n  Today, a criminal conviction is a modern day scarlet letter that--\nbecause of the so-called ``War on Drugs''--has had a disproportionate \nimpact on communities of color. For example, African-American men with \na conviction are 40 percent less likely to receive an interview. And \nthe likelihood that Latino men with a record will receive an interview \nor be offered a job is 18 percent smaller than the likelihood for white \nmen.\n  Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens benefits \npublic safety. With little hope of obtaining a decent paying job, \nreturning citizens are often left with few options but to return to a \nlife of crime. A 2011 study in the Justice Quarterly concluded that the \nlack of employment was the single most negative determinant of \nrecidivism. A report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that of \nthe over 400,000 state prisoners released in 2005, 67.8 percent of them \nwere re-arrested within 3 years of their release. And 76.6 percent were \nre-arrested within 5 years of their release.\n  Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens also \nstrengthens our economy. Poor job prospects for people with records \nreduced our nation's gross domestic product in 2008 between $57 billion \nand $65 billion. With an integrated global economy that is becoming \nmore and more competitive, it is imperative that we encourage sound \npolicy that promotes the gainful employment of Americans.\n  A formerly incarcerated person--and later President--named Nelson \nMandela once said, ``For to be free is not merely to cast off one's \nchains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of \nothers.'' The American criminal justice system is predicated on this \nideal, the belief that an individual who has committed a crime can, and \nshould be, reformed into a productive member of society over their time \nof imprisonment. The ideal that, once released from prison, that \nindividual should have the opportunity to enrich himself and his \ncommunity upon his reentry into society.\n  The Fair Chance Act would help fix unemployment barriers for formerly \nincarcerated people and bring America closer to truly being a land of \nopportunity for all. It would ban the Federal Government--including the \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches--from requesting criminal \nhistory information from applicants until they reach the conditional \noffer stage. This bill strikes the right balance. It would allow \nqualified people with criminal records to get their foot in the door \nand be judged on their own merit. At the same time, the legislation \nwould allow employers to know an individual's criminal history before \nthe job applicant is hired.\n  This bill would also prohibit Federal contractors from requesting \ncriminal history information from candidates for positions within the \nscope of Federal contracts until the conditional offer stage. Companies \nthat do business with the Federal Government and receive Federal funds \nshould espouse good hiring practices. The Fair Chance Act would permit \nFederal contractors to inquire about criminal history earlier in the \napplication process if a candidate would have access to classified \ninformation.\n  The legislation includes important exceptions for sensitive positions \nwhere criminal history inquiries are necessary earlier in the \napplication process. Exceptions are included for positions involving \nclassified information, sensitive national security duties, armed \nforces, and law enforcement jobs, and for when criminal history \ninformation for a job is legally required prior to a conditional offer.\n  Finally, this bill would require the Department of Labor, U.S. Census \nBureau, and Bureau of Justice Statistics to issue a report on the \nemployment statistics of formerly incarcerated individuals. Currently, \nno comprehensive tracking of data on the employment histories of people \nwith convictions exists. This provision would change that and allow us \nto better understand the scope of the problem people with convictions \nface when trying to find a job.\n  Many of the reforms in this bill have been urged for years. In 2011, \nthen-Attorney General Eric Holder called for making the Federal \nGovernment a model employer. And the White House's My Brother Keeper's \nInitiative has endorsed fair chance reforms. Earlier this year, I was \nproud to join 26 other Senators in a letter to the President urging an \nexecutive order that would ban Federal contractors from asking job \napplicants about their criminal histories. But more must be done.\n  States and localities have led the way on providing people with \nconvictions meaningful job opportunities, and the Federal Government \nmust catch up. So far 18 States, including Georgia and Nebraska, and \nover 100 cities and counties have taken steps to prohibit government \nagencies from asking job applicants about criminal convictions until \nlater in the process.\n  Some of the Nation's largest companies already have fair chance \npolicies. Companies such as Wal-Mart, Target, Starbucks, Koch \nIndustries, Home Depot, and Bed, Bath and Beyond, have reserved the \ncriminal history inquiry until later in the hiring process. These \ncompanies know that creating economic opportunity for people with \ncriminal history is not just good policy, it's good business.\n  This bipartisan legislation has the support of numerous groups, \nincluding the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, the National Employment Law Project, the \nCenter for Urban Families, Bend the Arc Jewish Action, and the National \nBlack Prosecutors Association.\n  We are a nation built on liberty and justice for all. Once a person's \nsentence has ended, they should not continue to be forever shackled by \ntheir past. That turns the concept of justice upside down. It is \ncontrary to who we are and what we stand for.\n  President George W. Bush once said that ``America is the land of \nsecond chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead \nshould lead to a better life.'' But far too often the road back into \nthe community is paved with poverty, hopelessness, and unemployment. \nWhen President Obama commuted the offenses of 46 drug offenders earlier \nthis year, he also affirmed that ``we have to ensure that as [formerly \nincarcerated people] do their time and pay back their debt to society, \nthat we are increasing the possibility that they can turn their lives \naround.''\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\n  The ideal that America is a place that values second chances is \nbipartisan and rooted deeply in our country's history, and the \nopportunity to turn one's life around is a fundamental principle of \njustice. With the introduction of this important criminal justice \nreform legislation, we aim to fulfill the promise of our great \ndemocracy and make access to the American Dream real for thousands of \nAmericans who have paid their debts to society.\n  The Fair Chance Act would give so many Americans a fair chance to \nobtain Federal jobs or work with Federal contractors. It would improve \npublic safety, boost our economy, and adhere to our shared values of \nliberty and justice for all. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in \nsupporting this important criminal justice reform bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6608-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6608-S6609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 251--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nCONGRESSIONAL REVIEW PROVISION OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REVIEW ACT \n   OF 2015 DOES NOT APPLY TO THE JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION \n ANNOUNCED ON JULY 14, 2015, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT FAILED TO TRANSMIT \n   THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AS REQUIRED BY SUCH ACT, AND THAT THE JOINT \nCOMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION WOULD ONLY PREEMPT EXISTING IRAN SANCTIONS \nLAWS AS ``THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND'' IF RATIFIED BY THE SENATE AS A \n   TREATY WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF TWO THIRDS OF THE SENATORS PRESENT \nPURSUANT TO ARTICLE II, SECTION 2, CLAUSE 2, OF THE CONSTITUTION OR IF \nCONGRESS WERE TO ENACT NEW IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION THAT SUPERSEDES THE \n  MANDATORY STATUTORY SANCTIONS THAT THE JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF \n        ACTION ANNOUNCED ON JULY 14, 2015, PURPORTS TO SUPERSEDE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Toomey, and Mr. Lee) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 251\n\n       Whereas the United States Government has enacted and \n     enforced multiple statutes and regulations that impose \n     comprehensive sanctions on Iran and on companies and \n     individuals doing business with Iran;\n       Whereas Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution \n     provides that the President ``shall have Power, by and with \n     the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, \n     provided two thirds of the Senators present concur'';\n       Whereas Article VI, clause 2 of the Constitution provides \n     that ``This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States \n     which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties \n     made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the \n     United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land'';\n       Whereas, on April 28, 2015, 39 Senators voted for Senate \n     Amendment 1150, the purpose of which was ``To declare that \n     any agreement reached by the President relating to the \n     nuclear program of Iran is deemed a treaty that is subject to \n     the advice and consent of the Senate'';\n       Whereas, according to subsection (a)(1) of section 135 of \n     the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160e), as added by \n     section 2 of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, \n     which the President signed into law as Public Law 114-17 on \n     May 22, 2015, ``[n]ot later than 5 calendar days after \n     reaching an agreement with Iran relating to the nuclear \n     program of Iran, the President shall transmit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees and leadership the \n     agreement, as defined in subsection (h)(1), including all \n     related materials and annexes'';\n       Whereas subsection (h)(1) of such section 135 defines the \n     ``agreement'' that the President ``shall'' transmit to \n     Congress not later than 5 calendar days after reaching an \n     agreement with Iran to include all ``annexes, appendices, \n     codicils, side agreements, implementing materials, documents, \n     and guidance, technical or other understandings, and any \n     related agreements, whether entered into or implemented prior \n     to the agreement or to be entered into or implemented in the \n     future'';\n       Whereas such section 135 further provides that a 60-day \n     congressional review period will commence upon the \n     President's transmittal of the agreement, including all \n     annexes, appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing \n     materials, documents, and guidance, technical or other \n     understandings, and any related agreements, whether entered \n     into or implemented prior to the agreement or to be entered \n     into or implemented in the future;\n       Whereas, on July 14, 2015, the Secretary of State announced \n     a multilateral agreement with Iran and six other nations, \n     labeled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in \n     Annex II of which the United States purports to agree that \n     ``[t]he United States commits to cease the application, and \n     to seek such legislative action as may be appropriate to \n     terminate, or modify to effectuate the termination of, all \n     nuclear-related sanctions as specified in Sections 4.1-4.9 \n     below,'' and Sections 4.1-4.9 specifies the following United \n     States statutes: ``the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (ISA), as \n     amended by Section 102 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \n     Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) and \n     Sections 201-207 and 311 of the Iran Threat Reduction and \n     Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (TRA);

and\n       Whereas, as a result, the President has never fully \n     transmitted to Congress the ``agreement with Iran relating to \n     the nuclear program of Iran'' as defined by such section 135, \n     and specifically did not transmit the full agreement within \n     the timeline mandated by law: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the congressional review provision under section 135 of \n     the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160e), as added by \n     section 2 of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 \n     (Public Law 114-17), does not apply to the Joint \n     Comprehensive Plan of Action announced on July 14, 2015, \n     because the President failed to comply with the transmission \n     to Congress provisions of such section 135;\n       (2) because the President did not transmit to Congress \n     ``all related materials and annexes'' within five days of \n     reaching agreement with Iran, the statutory congressional \n     review provided for in such section 135 did not occur, at \n     least not in the manner envisioned by the members of Congress \n     who voted for Public Law 114-17;\n       (3) in light of the President's failure to submit the \n     entire ``agreement with Iran relating to the nuclear program \n     of Iran,'' including side agreements, to Congress within five \n     days, the congressional review provision of such section 135 \n     by its own terms was not applicable to the partial agreement \n     that the President submitted to Congress, known as the JCPOA, \n     and therefore in order for the substance of what was \n     submitted to Congress to become ``the supreme Law of the \n     Land'' pursuant to Article VI, clause 2 of the Constitution, \n     it would need to be either treated by the Senate as a treaty \n     ``provided two thirds of the Senators present concur'' \n     pursuant to Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \n     Constitution, or Congress would need to enact new \n     implementing legislation that supersedes the mandatory \n     statutory sanctions that the JCPOA purports to supersede;\n       (4) the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and \n     Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA), section 1245 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law \n     112-81), the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of \n     2012 (IFCA), and the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human \n     Rights Act of 2012 (TRA) remain ``the supreme Law of the \n     Land'' unless and until a Senate-ratified treaty or duly \n     enacted statute repeals or otherwise supersedes them and \n     becomes ``the supreme Law of the Land'' pursuant to Article \n     VI, clause 2 of the Constitution; and\n       (5) the Senate, which has the power to consent to treaties \n     under Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, \n     has not and does not consent to the JCPOA, which is therefore \n     not ``the supreme Law of the Land,'' and the President \n     therefore has a constitutional duty to ensure that the Iran \n     sanctions laws, including CISADA, section 1245 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 \n     (Public Law 112-81), IFCA, and TRA, continue to be faithfully \n     executed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/10/senate-section/article/S6609-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2649.
