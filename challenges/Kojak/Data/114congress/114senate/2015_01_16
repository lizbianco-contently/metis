Mr. President, we are looking forward to welcoming \nPresident Obama to the Capitol on Tuesday. The State of the Union is a \nunique opportunity, not just for the President but for our entire \ncountry. If he lays out an agenda that corresponds to the message the \nvoters delivered in November, it could signal a truly productive moment \nfor our country.\n  In November the American people told us they are tired of \nWashington's dysfunction. They told us they are tired of Washington's \nprioritizing the concerns of powerful special interests over their own. \nThey called for a Congress that functions again, and that is just what \nwe have been working toward. They called for Congress to focus on jobs \nand reform, and that is what we have been doing.\n  They also called for President Obama to cooperate with Congress to \nenact a different and better reform agenda for the middle class. On \nthat front, we have some distance to cover, but Tuesday can be a new \nday. This can be the moment the President pivots to a positive posture. \nThis can be a day he promotes realistic reforms that focus on economic \ngrowth instead of spending more money than we have. We are eager for \nhim to do so.\n  There is much we can accomplish for the American people if the \nPresident is willing to work with us. We will be looking for signs of \nthat in the speech he delivers Tuesday night.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Murkowski amendment No. 2, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Markey/Baldwin amendment No. 13 (to amendment No. 2), to \n     ensure that oil transported through the Keystone XL Pipeline \n     into the United States is used to reduce U.S. dependence on \n     Middle Eastern oil.\n       Portman/Shaheen amendment No. 3 (to amendment No. 2), to \n     promote energy efficiency.\n       Cantwell (for Franken) amendment No. 17 (to amendment No. \n     2), to require the use of iron, steel, and manufactured goods \n     produced in the United States in the construction of the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline and facilities.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to an \namendment offered by Senator McCain pertaining to the Merchant Marine \nAct of 1920, popularly referred to as the Jones Act.\n  I will, of course, start by saying that the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator McCain, has a distinguished record of \nsupport for our men and women in the military and cares deeply about \nour national security, but on this amendment I respectfully disagree \nwith our chairman.\n  I wish to take a few minutes this morning to remind my colleagues why \nthe Jones Act is an essential component of our national security policy \nand shipbuilding is a foundational component of American manufacturing.\n  The Jones Act requires that our maritime vessels engaged in shipping \ngoods between U.S. ports must meet three requirements: They must be \nbuilt in the United States, at least 75-percent owned by U.S. citizens, \nand operated by U.S. citizens. The Jones Act helps to shore up our \nnational security by providing reliable sealift in times of war. It \nensures our ongoing viability as an ocean power by protecting American \nshipbuilders. As a result, the Jones Act provides solid, well-paying \njobs for nearly half a million Americans from Virginia to Hawaii.\n  In short, the Jones Act promotes national security and American job \ncreation. Therefore, I am unclear why some of my colleagues are opposed \nto this commonsense law. I don't say this simply as a Member from an \nisland State where we depend on the reliability offered by American \nshippers for fresh food, energy, and other everyday goods, but I say \nthis as a Senator who cares deeply about supporting our strong and \ngrowing middle class and creating American jobs.\n  First, shipbuilding is a major job-creating industry. According to \nthe Maritime Administration, there were 107,000 people directly \nemployed by roughly 300 shipyards across 26 States in 2013. \nAdditionally, shipyards indirectly employed nearly 400,000 people \nacross the country. This amendment would specifically knock out the \nJones Act provision that requires that U.S.-flagged ships be built in \nthe United States, jeopardizing good-paying, middle-class jobs. To me, \nthat is reason enough to oppose this amendment.\n  Secondly, this is not the time to create the instability this \namendment would directly cause. After struggling through tough times, \nAmerica's shipbuilding industry is coming back. Both this Congress and \nthe administration have long stressed the need for creating and keeping \nmanufacturing jobs here at home in the United States. According to the \nNavy League, there are 15 tanker ships being built here in the United \nStates right now and slated to join our U.S. flag fleet. These ships \ndon't create quick-turnaround jobs but hundreds of thousands of well-\npaying, long-term manufacturing jobs. If these ships are not built here \nin U.S. shipyards by U.S. workers, where will they be built? Where will \nthese jobs go? China? Other Asian countries? Europe? The shipbuilding \nindustry in our country is rebounding.\n  Repealing the Jones Act is a step in the wrong direction. Instead of \ndismantling a policy that supports American jobs, Congress should be \nfocused on doing more to promote and grow American jobs and American \nmanufacturing.\n  Repealing the Jones Act's requirement to build ships here in the \nUnited States will unquestionably cost U.S. jobs and weaken our \nposition as a manufacturing leader. Those are two strikes against the \namendment.\n  The third and final strike is the fact that the amendment would \nundermine our national homeland security. The Jones Act's \nrequirements--along with American shipbuilding and the maritime \nindustries they underpin--provide American-built ships and crews for \nuse by the Department of Defense in times of need. It is easy to see \nwhy the Navy and Coast Guard strongly oppose repeal of the Jones Act \nand all of its components.\n  The Defense Department has concluded:\n\n       We believe that the ability of the nation to build and \n     maintain a U.S. flag fleet is in the national interest, and \n     we also believe it is in the interest of the DOD for U.S. \n     shipbuilders to maintain a construction capability for \n     commercial vessels.\n\n  Therefore, there are three strikes against this amendment.\n  If adopted, the amendment would dismantle the Jones Act, costing \nAmerican jobs, hurting American manufacturing, and undermining our \nnational security. I ask my colleagues to stand with me--and I \ncertainly ask the chair of the Armed Services Committee to change his \nmind on this amendment--and nearly half a million middle-class \nAmericans and vote against this amendment if it is brought up for a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know my colleagues are coming to the \nfloor to talk about various amendments. It is likely that on Tuesday we \nwill start voting on at least the pending amendments we have discussed \nso far. I come to the floor today to talk about the proposal by \nTransCanada Corporation and about the fact that, obviously, there are \nsome here who want to give an expedited approval to that and usurp the \nPresident, who needs to review this project in detail to make sure we \nunderstand the interests of various people, property owners, and people \naffected by the pipeline.\n  One particular issue in this debate is why Congress should be \nhurrying to give a special interest permitting go-ahead while the \nPresident still has issues to address and as do the local communities. \nI know many of my colleagues are going to come to the floor to talk \nabout those special interest concerns, as well as the issues of energy \nefficiency, property rights, climate change, and a whole host of \npriorities. But I am here today to talk about an issue I think is \nparticularly important, which is the fact that tar sands has a loophole \nand doesn't pay into the oilspill liability trust fund.\n  Both of my colleagues, Senator Markey and Senator Wyden, are going to \nbe putting forward amendments to close this loophole. As a country we \nhave made sure the taxpayers aren't stuck with the tab of cleaning up \noil spills. The principle behind that is to keep our waters safe and to \nkeep our communities from paying the cost of this pollution. It means \nreally to have commonsense laws on the books providing that polluters \npay for cleanup. So that is the principle that drives the oilspill \nliability trust fund. It is something we have had in place for a while.\n  Basically, what the oilspill liability trust fund means is simply \nthat American taxpayers won't be left holding the bag for the \nresponsibility of spills that happen. We currently in law have a \nloophole that means that companies that produce the tar sands don't \nhave to pay into the trust fund. That is because they are considered as \nsynthetic petroleum. So just by the definition, they basically have had \na loophole. It is important to me, as the United States considers \nwhether a pipeline should be built across our country that would \ninclude these tar sands, which is very thick and heavy material and it \nis often diluted with lighter oil so it can be easier to handle. But \nwhen the spills happen, and it spills in water as we saw with the \nKalamazoo spill, it leaves a thicker oil behind that usually sinks to \nthe bottom of the water. That makes it hugely expensive to clean up and \nreally almost nearly impossible to clean up.\n  These concerns are driving us to make sure that as the United States \nand Canada continue to look at tar sands production, we are getting the \ntechnology in place to deal with this and to get the job done and to \nmake sure that those who are liable for those\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\nkinds of spills are actually paying into a fund that would help clean \nup the mess.\n  That is why it is so important that the Senate take up action on one \nof these amendments, so that we will be paying into the oilspill \nliability trust fund for any pipeline that is carrying this crude \nmaterial.\n  I want to go back to why this trust fund was created and why it was \nso important. The oilspill liability trust fund was created in 1986 as \npart of the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Act. \nThis bill was signed by President Reagan, but it took 4 more years and \na major disaster before the country actually funded the oilspill \nliability trust fund, and that disaster was Exxon Valdez. My colleague \nfrom Alaska will be on the floor later today, and I am sure she could \ntalk a lot about this issue as well. I had many conversations with the \nlate Senator Ted Stevens about this issue, and there were various times \nwhen we increased payments into the oilspill liability trust fund. When \none comes from the State of Washington and Pacific waters and when one \ncomes from Alaska, how we clean up these oil spills is incredibly \nimportant to our economies.\n  What happened in 1989 is that an oil tanker hit a reef and ended up \nspilling 11 million gallons of crude oil. It didn't take long for those \npristine waters of Prince William Sound in Alaska to be impacted. So \nthe impacts of the Exxon Valdez disaster were devastating not just to \nPrince William Sound but to the entire Pacific Northwest, and the total \ncost of that cleanup was $2.5 billion.\n  Ten years ago, a Federal judge ordered Exxon to pay $6.7 billion to \nthousands of Alaskans affected by that oil spill. Fishermen in the \nNorthwest lost more than $300 million as a result of that oil spill. At \nthe time, the livelihood of individuals was impacted and, obviously, \nthe wildlife was impacted. It killed sea otters, harbor seals, and \napproximately 250,000 birds. The images of all this wildlife are seared \ninto our memories even 25 years after the spill.\n\n  When the gulf spill just recently happened, we revisited a lot of \nthose issues because we wanted to make sure we were getting things \nright. It was very interesting to see the environmental effects years \nlater and some of the things that still had not recuperated from the \noil spill in Prince William Sound.\n  In 1990 Congress passed the Oil Spill Pollution Act, and it was \nsigned into law by President Bush. It added sweeping improvements to \nthe oil spill response and held parties responsible. It established the \nmechanism actually to invest in the oilspill liability trust fund. \nSpecifically, the bill said: Let's have a per-barrel tax to raise the \nrevenue for the fund. So today that is an 8 cents per-barrel tax on oil \nproducts.\n  As I mentioned, this was signed into law by President Bush, who \nspecifically praised the funding of the oilspill liability trust fund. \nHe said that ``the prevention, response, liability, and compensation \ncomponents fit together into a compatible and workable system that \nstrengthens the protection of our environment.''\n  The reason I am bringing that up is because if the oilspill liability \ntrust fund was good enough for oil products promoted by a Republican \nPresident, then it ought to be good enough for us in Congress to add \ntar sands. That literally was just not thought of under the current \ndefinition because of the way the definition was written. Because it is \na synthetic fuel, they have a loophole. It is a question whether we are \ngoing to close this loophole or whether we are going to let them pay \nzero into the trust fund.\n  The fund is used to pay for immediate cleanup costs and spills in \nnavigable waters. This is a very important point. Some people would \nsay: Well, aren't people just liable for their own mess, and why don't \nthey just clean it up?\n  I can tell you that in trying to protect Puget Sound and trying to \nclean up the waters off the coast of Washington, you might think it \nwould be easy to figure out where the oil came from. It is not. When \nyou have a busy waterway like Puget Sound, and all of a sudden somebody \nsights an oil slick or oil product in the water, they don't know how \nserious it is. It takes months and months, sometimes years, to figure \nout where the pollution came from.\n  Yes, in the case of Exxon Valdez we had a ship that hit a reef and \ncaused a problem. But in many cases, sometimes you don't know where the \nspill is coming from. A lot of people will say: Well, it wasn't us. Or \nthey start this process. An oil spill needs an immediate response, and \nthat is why we established the oilspill liability trust fund--to have \nan immediate response so that we are not sitting around waiting for \nweeks and months to figure out who did the oil spill, and so somebody \ncan start the process immediately and work with the Coast Guard to \nactually clean it up.\n  You would think this doesn't happen that frequently, but it happens a \nlot more frequently than people realize. That is why an immediate fund \nis important, and that is why everybody who is producing oil should pay \ninto it. Yet there is a loophole in the law, so the per-barrel tax \ndoesn't apply to tar sands.\n  In 2011 the IRS issued a ruling stating that the tar sands imported \ninto the United States were not subject to the excise tax on petroleum. \nThe ruling was actually based on a 1980 House Ways and Means Committee \nreport that crude oil does not include tar sands. As I said earlier, it \nis considered synthetic. Therefore, according to the IRS, it is not \nsubject to the tax.\n  We should simply clean this up and have those responsible for their \nmess also be responsible for paying in to clean it up. When the \noilspill liability trust fund was established, it was intended to be a \nmechanism for all oil spills--not the definition of oil as a product.\n  Congress should fix this next week when we vote on this legislation \nand figure out exactly how to make sure the Commandant of the Coast \nGuard would have the tools to deal with this.\n  I, too, have concerns about the fact that we don't really have the \ntools yet to accurately clean up tar sands. When the Commandant of the \nCoast Guard was before a commerce hearing just a year ago--because I \nhave a great deal of concern about the moving of this product on a \nvariety of transportation means--I asked him about tar sands because \nthe last thing we want to see is product out on our waterways. He said: \nOur technology is not as sophisticated when you have tar sands. They \nare heavier, they sink into the water, into the ocean bottom, so it is \na challenge for us. Once it settles on the sea floor, our technology is \nlacking in that regard.\n  Basically, I am finding that some of the dirtiest oil out there does \nnot pay into the oilspill trust fund, and we don't even have the \nmechanisms for cleaning up. Unfortunately, we learned that lesson very \nhard in the 2010 Enbridge pipeline, which was owned by another Canadian \ncompany, along the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. It ruptured, and it \nspilled 1 million gallons of tar sands into the river.\n  This is a picture of that cleanup and the process, which was $1.2 \nbillion that was spent. So for those of you who don't know Kalamazoo, \nit was an incredible economic, environmental, and historic issue for \nthe people of Michigan. The river was closed for business for 18 months \nafter that spill. More than 35 miles of the river had to be off limits \nbecause it was difficult to clean up.\n  Today, 4 years later, they are still impacted. As I said, the cost \nwas $1.2 billion because they had to dredge the bottom of the river. So \nany oil spill of that magnitude is damaging. Yet, when we look at this \nissue, the fact that these tar sands were sinking to the bottom made \nthat dredging even more serious.\n  It is the reason why we need to make sure these tar sands are taxed \njust as any other oil that is produced in the United States and pays \ninto this trust fund. A Cornell University study found that ``this \nspill affected the health of hundreds of residents, displaced \nresidents, hurt businesses, and caused a loss of jobs'' in Kalamazoo. \nThis study is located online at: https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/\nilr.cornell.edu/files/GLI_Impact-of-Tar-Sands-Pipeline-Spills.pdf.\n  I think it is just the start of what the challenges will be for us \nwhen we allow this kind of tar sands development to move through the \nUnited States. Our spill responders are very skilled. First, they know \nwe need to do everything we\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\ncan to prevent spills, to begin with. They are developing technologies \nto respond to the case of an emergency. They are doing everything they \ncan to use this trust fund.\n  So we need to make sure we are having those who are producing this \nproduct pay into the trust fund. We need to make sure we are closing \nthis loophole. So my colleagues--as I said, Senator Wyden and Markey--\nhave been working on this issue for some time. Senator Wyden, the \nranking member on the Finance Committee, I know he feels very strongly \nthey should be paying into the oil spill liability trust fund and \npaying their fair share of revenue. I know Senator Markey has worked on \nthis issue in the House of Representatives before coming to the Senate.\n  So we need to make sure people understand that dredging is not good \nenough, that our country needs a plan, that we need not just to rush \nthrough this pipeline and basically to think that we have all of the \ntechnology, all of the methods, all of the appropriate emergency funds \nto clean this up. We need to make sure we are not sitting here arguing \nwith a company--a Canadian company--that just wants us to clean up the \nmess and leave the U.S. taxpayer paying the bill.\n  In fact, there was some debate in the Kalamazoo spill whether the \nEnbridge company had hit their liability cap and so the trust fund \nshould pay for it, even though they never paid into the trust fund.\n  So are we going to let the American taxpayers clean up a Canadian oil \nmess at our expense--that we paid in--and everybody is affected by \nthat? I think we should slow down this process and make sure we are \ngetting things like the oil spill liability trust fund right and that \nwe are getting this added to this legislation before it moves out of \nthe Senate.\n  I know my colleagues will get a chance to look at this next week. As \nI said, we will probably start voting early next week on some of these \namendments that are being offered. But I hope my colleagues will close \nthese loopholes and make sure that the U.S. citizen and taxpayer is not \nleft on the hook paying for oil spill responsibility that should be the \nresponsibility of these individual companies. I know we are expecting \nsome of our other colleagues to come to the floor shortly to speak on \ntheir amendments.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, when the new Congress opens there is a \nchoice as to which issues we should start to work on. Would it be \ninfrastructure jobs, clean energy jobs, a minimum-wage increase for all \nof America? No, no. That is not what the new majority decides to bring \nup. No. Instead, it is a Canadian oil export pipeline.\n  Next week I am going to offer an amendment that the Senate will \nconsider to ask whether we will put Americans first or oil companies \nfirst, whether we will keep this oil and gasoline here for Americans or \nsend it to foreign nations to help them instead.\n  If my amendment is defeated, it will make clear this is not an energy \nplan that is ``all of the above,'' it is oil above all.\n  My amendment says that if we build the Keystone Pipeline, we keep \nthat oil here. We keep that gasoline here. We keep the diesel, the jet \nfuel, the heating oil. We keep it all here, because if we send it \nabroad, what are we doing? We are helping Canadian oil companies get a \nhigher price for their oil. We are acting as the middlemen between \ndirty foreign oil and thirsty foreign markets.\n  Without my amendment, there is nothing in the bill or U.S. law that \nwould prevent this oil from being exported. Eighty percent of our \nrefined fuel exports go out of the gulf coast, exactly where Keystone \nwould end, and foreign crude oil--including crude oil from Canada--can \nbe freely reexported.\n  We know what TransCanada's plan is because I asked him at a \ncongressional hearing--a senior TransCanada official--whether he would \ncommit his company to keeping the oil and refined products from \nKeystone in the United States of America, and he said no.\n  Why do the oil companies want to export this Canadian tar sands oil? \nBecause they can get a higher price and make more profit.\n  Tar sands crude in Canada trades for $13 less than the U.S. crude \nbenchmark. The international prices are $3 higher than our prices.\n  If we do all of this, if we build this pipeline and then we send this \noil to foreign countries, then we have turned Uncle Sam into ``Uncle \nSucker.'' Because, make no mistake, without my amendment this bill will \nnot do anything to help people at the pump. It will just serve to pump \nup the profits for oil companies.\n  We shouldn't export in oil, even as we are forced to send young men \nand women to defend oil interests in the most dangerous parts of the \nworld.\n  Let us have that debate. As we import--still--oil from the Middle \nEast, coming into the United States on tankers, this proposal we are \ndebating next week will actually export oil that is already in the \nUnited States. We still import millions of barrels of oil every single \nday.\n  What we hear from the Canadians, what we hear from the oil industry \nis that this is all about energy independence. Energy independence \ncannot, by definition, include the exportation of oil while the United \nStates of America is still importing millions of barrels of oil per \nday. That is heading us away from, rather than toward, the goal of \nenergy independence.\n  That, ladies and gentlemen, is at the heart of the issue of what it \nis that we must understand about this Keystone Pipeline debate. We want \nlower prices for consumers, lower prices at the gasoline pump, lower \nprices for home heating oil, lower prices for diesel, and lower prices \nall across America. It is akin to a tax break that is going into the \npockets of every single American, giving them more spending money \nbecause they are paying much less for oil in all of its forms in the \nUnited States of America right now, and it is giving an incredible \nincentive for economic growth in America.\n  What makes America great? What makes America strong? What makes us \nstrong is when we are strong at home. What makes us strong at home is \nour economy, because the stronger our economy, the stronger the United \nStates is in projecting power across this planet.\n  That is why on this debate the exportation of oil is so central. It \ngoes right to the heart of what we must be discussing and debating in \nour country. This is an incredible opportunity for our country.\n  Let's take it to the next step. The next step includes what is the \ntaxation on the Canadian oil. There is a loophole, believe it or not, \nin the American Tax Code that allows tar sands oil from Canada--such as \nthat that would flow through the Keystone Pipeline--to not pay into the \nFederal trust fund to respond to oilspills in the United States--\nunderstand that?\n  Canadian oil, the dirtiest in the world, coming through the pipeline \nthat the Canadians want to build through the United States, in the \nevent of an oilspill, will not have paid into the oilspill liability \nfund for oilspill accidents in the United States.\n  I wrote to the Treasury Department in 2012 urging them to close this \nloophole through executive action, but their response indicated that \nthey do not believe they have the authority to close this loophole on \ntheir own, and they need legislation to do so.\n  Yet there is nothing in this bill that would close this tax loophole \nfor Keystone tar sands oil. Tar sands oil can be more difficult to \nclean up than regular crude but receives a ``get out of Canada tax-\nfree'' card. That makes absolutely no sense. We are already importing \nmore than 1.2 million barrels per day of tar sands oil into the United \nStates. But oil companies don't have to pay into our cleanup fund to \nimport that dirty oil.\n\n  There are roughly 30 oil companies importing tar sands crude into the \nUnited States. If you are one of those 30 companies, you are getting a \ngreat deal. But if you are one of the hundreds of other oil companies \nout there that do pay into the oilspill trust fund, you should hate \nthis loophole, and the American people should hate that loophole as \nwell because the Canadians and\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\ntheir oil companies are not paying their fair share of the dues to be \nable to participate in our great American society. They want to build a \npipeline like a straw right through the middle of the United States, \nsend the dirtiest oil right down that straw, and if that straw breaks, \nif there is a spill, the Canadians have not contributed to the oilspill \nliability trust fund. Does that make any sense? Does that make any \nsense? Of course it doesn't.\n  That is why this debate is so important. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says this is going to cost the United States of America hundreds \nof millions of dollars because the Canadians escape their \nresponsibility of paying for the accidents. That is why Senator Wyden \nand I are working here to make sure we have an ability to close this \nloophole, and we are working with Senator Cantwell, the ranking member \non the committee. Along with Senator Cantwell, we are going to make \nsure we have this important debate on the Senate floor.\n  I know Senator Cantwell was out here earlier today raising this \nissue, highlighting this issue, pointing out how unfair and unjust it \nis that the Canadians escape their responsibility to pay and that it is \njust another giveaway to the oil industry that ensures this is nothing \nmore than a giveaway to those Canadian companies.\n  I say this on a day when it is being reported there are now 140,000 \npeople in America employed in the solar industry--140,000. There is \nanother 50,000 employed in the wind industry--nearly 200,000 people \nemployed in industries that, for the most part, didn't really even \nexist in a meaningful way 7 years ago. That is how quickly our own \ndomestic wind and solar industries have been developed--creating jobs \nhere in the United States, creating growth here in the United States, \ncreating opportunity here in the United States.\n  So this, colleagues, is really what we should be debating. But once \nagain, when the Republicans are in control, we do not debate all of the \nabove. We don't debate wind and solar and biomass and energy efficiency \nand oil and gas and nuclear. The Republicans always make it one \nsubject, and that is oil above all, not all of the above.\n  So I am looking forward to this debate. It goes right to the heart of \nthe security of our country, the economy of our country, and the \nenvironment of our country. This is the dirtiest oil in the world. This \noil is going to contribute dangerously to the warming of the planet. \nLast year--2014--was the single warmest year ever recorded in the \nhistory of the planet--2014. You don't have to be Dick Tracy to figure \nout this is a problem that we are passing on to the next generations \nwithout the debate this issue must have if we are going to discharge \nour responsibilities to those next generations.\n  The Keystone Pipeline is the central opportunity we are going to have \nto raise this issue of global warming, of the national security of our \ncountry, of making our economy stronger, and of ensuring we discharge \nour responsibility to the next generation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, climate change is one of the greatest \nchallenges of this century. We have a profound choice before us. We can \ndeny that our climate is warming, we can fall behind our economic \ncompetitors, we can ignore the danger to our planet and to our \nsecurity--that is one choice--or we can move forward with the \ndiversified energy portfolio that includes clean energy, with an energy \npolicy that makes sense, that creates jobs, that protects the \nenvironment, and that will keep our Nation strong.\n  There is a lot of work to be done. We can work together, we can find \ncommon ground, become energy independent, move us on a path to energy \nindependence, grow our economy, and fight climate change. But instead, \nunfortunately, our focus today is on the Keystone XL Pipeline. The new \nmajority has not chosen to start with energy policy as a whole or \ninnovation or manufacturing policy or our response to climate change. \nInstead, we are debating on the floor of the Senate just one pipeline \nproject, which primarily benefits another Nation.\n  There is really one basic question. Is the Keystone Pipeline in our \nNation's interest--not Canada's interest or Wall Street's interest but \nour Nation's interest. I do not believe it is. I say this for two \nreasons. First, we are being asked to do something I believe is \nunprecedented--for Congress to step in and promote a bill for one \nprivate-sector energy project, to wave ahead a private pipeline for a \nprivate foreign company so that Canadian oil can be piped to Texas for \nexport to other nations. Again, how does this serve our Nation?\n  We are told it is about jobs. Keystone will create jobs, and, of \ncourse, we are all for that. But how many jobs? About 3,900 temporary \nconstruction jobs. But how many permanent jobs--jobs that American \nfamilies can count on for years to come? Maybe about 50. Yet with all \nthe challenges we face, at home and abroad, this is the priority. This \nis priority No. 1 for the new Republican Congress. This is one choice. \nIt is the wrong choice and the wrong priority.\n  This brings me to my second point. We are at a crossroads in our \nenergy policy. We can still lead the world in clean energy production--\nwind, solar, advanced biofuels--to reduce global warming pollution, to \nbecome energy independent, and to create permanent American jobs. That \nis our future. That should be our priority.\n  New Mexicans are already seeing the impact of global warming. The \nSouthwest is at the eye of the storm, with historic drought, with \nsevere flooding when it does rain, and with more and more wildfires. I \ntalk to farmers and ranchers in my State, and they are struggling. \nAccording to a study at Los Alamos National Laboratory, by 2050--not \nfar away--we may not have any forests left in my State. It will be as \nif New Mexico were dragged 300 miles to the south. Our climate will \nresemble land that is now in the middle of the Chihuahuan Desert.\n\n  I am not a scientist; neither are my colleagues. But the experts at \nLos Alamos National Laboratory and scientists all over the world are \nclear: If we do nothing, it will only get worse. We are already seeing \nthe impact. Recently the Government Accountability Office issued a \nwarning: Climate change will continue to increase costs to taxpayers \nfor the Federal Flood and Crop Insurance Programs. FEMA is already $24 \nbillion in debt due to extreme weather events such as Hurricane Sandy \nand last year's floods in New Mexico. The cost of the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program has increased 68 percent just since 2007. If left \nunchecked, these costs will continue to skyrocket.\n  But this is more than numbers, disturbing as they are. This is the \nburden of climate change on farmers, ranchers, and our communities. The \ndamage is real. The threat is here. But so are the solutions and the \nopportunities, and there are many opportunities. With the right \npriorities, we can encourage the production of clean energy. We can \ncreate a clean energy economy that leads the world. We can create the \njobs of the future right here at home and revitalize rural America.\n  I have long said we need a ``do it all and do it right'' energy \npolicy. That includes traditional energy sources. Oil and gas play an \nimportant role in my State. New Mexico is a leading producer of both \noil and gas. We have strong, independent companies. They employ over \n12,000 New Mexicans. They help pay for our schools and our other public \nservices. They are an important part of the mix, and so are renewables \nsuch as wind and solar. The United States has incredible wind energy \npotential, enough to power the Nation 10 times over. New Mexico has \nsome of the best wind resources in the Nation, enough to meet more than \n73 times the State's current electricity needs. Wind power emits almost \nno carbon pollution. It uses virtually no water. It already saves folks \nin my State 470 million gallons of water a year. The U.S. solar \nindustry employs more than 143,000 Americans--more than coal and \nnatural gas combined. Solar jobs grew 10 times faster than the national \naverage. The majority are in installation, sales, and distribution. \nThose are well-paying local jobs. Those are permanent\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\njobs, and they won't be shipped overseas.\n  Now is the time to build on the momentum and invest in a clean energy \neconomy. Now is the time to create energy at home and jobs at home. \nNow. Not later. And we need to do it before we lose too much of the \nmarket to our overseas competitors in Germany, China, and elsewhere. \nThey can see the future too, and they are going after it.\n  A national renewable electricity standard would help us get there. \nThe proposal I have introduced for many years would require utilities \nto generate 25 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. \nNew Mexico and over half the States already have one. The States are \nmoving in that direction. The Nation needs to move in that direction. \nWe need a national standard. Experts have said a national standard \ncould create 300,000 new jobs. I have pushed for this ever since I came \nto Congress. The House of Representatives has passed it. The Senate has \npassed a version of this three times. We have to get it right. We have \nto do this. Let's get it done.\n  America can lead the world in a clean energy economy. We have the \ntechnology, and we have the resources. We just need the commitment and \nthe cooperation.\n  This is a new Congress. Let's find common ground where we can move \nforward. Just as we invested in the oil industry, we need to invest in \nwind, solar, and biofuels. We should support tax credits for \nrenewables. We should encourage important cutting-edge energy research \nat great institutions such as Sandia and Los Alamos National \nLaboratories. What we don't need is Congress simply acting as a \npermitting agency for a Canadian pipeline.\n  I understand the frustration that this project has been pending for \nso long. I believe the President should make a decision now. The \nnecessary studies have been done. The recent litigation is over. We \nhave debated this project extensively in this Congress and in several \nelections. If the President decides to approve it without some strong \nconditions that mitigate its climate impact, I will be very \ndisappointed. If the President rejects it, the supporters can raise \nthis issue in the next election. But Congress should move on to real, \npressing policy debates.\n  Let's get our heads out of the tar sands and work together for our \neconomy, for our energy independence, and for our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is good to be here on the Senate \nfloor talking about where we are in the process to hopefully finally \nmove toward approval of a permit to allow for construction of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  It has been interesting--the past couple speakers this morning have \nall mentioned that they don't understand why the first order of \nbusiness in this new Congress should be this measure, that there are a \nlot of issues out there. And there certainly are. There will always be \nissues in the Senate. This is what we do. These are all weighty issues. \nBut I would remind my colleagues that one of the reasons we are moving \nearly to the Keystone XL Pipeline legislation is because in many ways \nthis is a bit of unfinished business.\n  It was just 6 weeks or so ago that we had this measure before us on \nthe floor of the Senate. It was before this body for debate--a good \ndebate--led by our former colleague from Louisiana who was absolutely \npassionate--absolutely passionate--in her defense of why this was \ntimely, important, critical that this measure be approved. We had that \ndebate, and unfortunately in the final vote we were shy one vote and so \nwe did not see passage. It was a measure that was in front of us \nbecause it was timely and also because of the work this body had done \nto advance it. The energy committee had hearings, process, and we had a \nbill in front of us.\n  It is the first week of this session, and we have a lot of measures \nthat we will be taking up that are extremely important, but they are \nperhaps not as primed, if you will, for action on the Senate floor \nbecause that legislation hasn't been drafted. The committees have not \nmet to work through some of the legislation that will be before us.\n  So why not move to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline, a measure that \nwill provide for good-paying jobs in this country; a measure that will \nwork to enhance that relationship with our closest friend and ally to \nthe north, Canada; a measure that will help us from an energy security \nperspective when we are able to displace oil coming in from places such \nas Venezuela with oil coming in from Canada. That is a relationship \nthat this Senator would much rather enhance and further.\n  So for a host of different reasons we are on this measure in the \nsecond week of this new Congress. I am pleased we are at this place \nwhere when we reached unanimous consent earlier to proceed to \nconsideration of amendments on this bipartisan bill. It has been \ninteresting. As I have talked to not only colleagues but reporters out \nin the hallways--just people having conversations--and there was a fair \namount of skepticism that if Republicans were to regain the majority, \nwould we return the Senate to what we know as regular order, where \nthere is a processing of amendments and a regular committee process, \nbut that is what we are doing, folks. Those who are observing what is \ngoing on, beginning today, are seeing something that hasn't been seen \naround here in a number of years. It was unfortunate that we hadn't had \nthat process, but it is never too late to do the right thing. It is \nnever too late to get back to a deliberative process that allows for \nthe open exchange and consideration of ideas on the floor.\n  When we talk about an open amendment process, clearly it is not just \nopen for amendments for those of us on this side of the aisle. It is an \nopen amendment process for the full Senate so Members on both sides can \noffer their ideas and work to get votes on them. The majority leader \nhas said several times that this process is going to be open, but it is \nnot going to be open-ended. We are not going to be on this measure for \na full year or even a full month, but we will be taking the time to do \nthe deliberation that I think is important. I think you have already \ngot some people saying: Oh, we are spending enough time on it. It is a \nmixed message with those saying it is not timely, we shouldn't be \ntaking it up, and then others complaining that we have been on it now \nsince last week. I think it is important for Members to know we are \nexpecting to see amendments filed. We are expecting to see Members come \nto the floor to call up amendments. I would encourage Members not to \nwait until the last minute because to use the majority leader's words, \nthis is not going to be open-ended. So let's get to our business and \nlet's get it done.\n  We have three amendments that are currently pending before the body. \nBefore I speak to each of those, I would like to very briefly address \nmy support for the underlying bill from the perspective of Alaska and \nbeing one who is immersed in Alaska's energy process and politics.\n  I heard from more than a couple of folks back home who have seen the \ndebate and discussion playing out, whether it is on C-SPAN or in the \nmedia, and I have been asked: We understand Keystone is in the national \ninterest. We get that. But is it truly in Alaska's best interest? Folks \nback home are a little worried right now. We are seeing the price for \noil sink to lows we have not seen in years, sitting around $46 a barrel \ntoday. It has certainly had an impact on our State's budget--\ndramatically so. It is not just Alaska, I think we are seeing it in \nother oil-producing States. It is good news to have lower oil prices, \nbut it is kind of a double-edged sword for some.\n  The questions that are being asked at home are legitimate, fair, and \nvery important questions such as: OK. How does this fit in with the \nAlaska piece?\n  We certainly have large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly \nenergy projects of a serious magnitude.\n  We have a world-class oilfield in Prudhoe Bay and the connector that \nthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline provides from Prudhoe Bay down to tidewater \nin Valdez, an 800-mile silver ribbon that bisects our State, is truly a \nmodern\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nmarvel. A State can have the resource, but if they don't have the \ninfrastructure to move the resource it doesn't do them much good. It \ndoesn't help their economy and it doesn't help fund education if they \ncannot move it to market.\n  As I mentioned, Alaskans are a little nervous right now. A New York \nTimes article recently described what is happening in Alaska. The \njournalist described it as economic anxiety hanging over the State \nbecause of the drop in the price per barrel of oil. When a State relies \non oil for about 90 percent of its revenues to fund its budget and the \nprice drops dramatically, they notice it.\n  One way to deal with the variations and variables in price is to have \nsufficient production. Alaska is suffering from this economic anxiety \nbecause our oil production, which was over 2 million barrels a day, has \ndropped precipitously over the past couple decades. We are now talking \nabout an oil pipeline that is less than half full. What does that mean \nto a State such as Alaska when the artery for the State's revenues is \nnot pumping at an optimum level? We are in that place right now. As a \nState we are looking at what can we do to make a difference when it \ncomes to production because there will be price variables. As long as \nOPEC is in play there will be price variables we are not able to affect \nas much as we would like.\n  We have the resource. We have an estimated 40 billion barrels of oil \nin our Federal areas, offshore in the Chukchi and Beaufort, on our \ncoastal plain within the NPRA. We are not looking at a situation in \nAlaska where we are running out of oil or about to run out of oil. Our \nproblem straight up is our limited ability to be able to access it. The \nholdback we get, the pushback we get from our own Federal Government, \nthe policies that keep us from being able to access that resource has \nbeen our challenge.\n  Now back to the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline is not \ngoing to be carrying any Alaskan crude. Don't get a mixed message. We \nhave a pipeline. We have already built it. It is waiting to be filled \nback up. The need isn't infrastructure in Alaska but permission--\nconsent from the Federal Government to access our lands, access our \nwaters to achieve that energy potential.\n  When I am talking to Alaskans about the imperative for Keystone and \nhow it intersects with Alaska, there are a couple of messages. The \nfirst one is simple. There is plenty of demand within just the United \nStates for all the oil Canada and Alaska can produce at the same time. \nThe demand is there, even with the surge we have seen coming out of the \nBakken and the amount of increased production we have seen domestically \nin this country. We are continuing to import that oil. Again, it is \nbetter for us to rely more on ourselves. The world view that supports \nthe construction of Keystone XL is the same one that leads to new \nproduction in my State of Alaska; that is, the recognition that \naffordable energy is good. This is my mantra. I keep advertising it. I \nhave a bumper sticker that says ``energy is good.'' Affordable energy \nis good. The understanding is that low prices result when world markets \nare well supplied along with the desire to achieve North American \nenergy independence. This is something I feel very strongly about.\n  Approving the Keystone XL Pipeline is not going to eat into the \nmarkets for Alaska's oil. This is an important message for Alaskans to \nunderstand. In fact, it is going to help us preserve the markets we \nhave because right now our North Slope crude is shipped predominantly \nto the west coast--makes sense, it is in closer proximity--where it is \nrefined into gasoline and other petroleum products for use in the lower \n48.\n  We take it down our 800-mile pipeline, put it to tidewater, and it is \nrefined on the west coast. We enjoy the benefit of it here. But this \nANS crude--Alaskan North Slope crude--as we call it, is now finding \nitself in competition from the shale plays out of the Bakken. So what \nwe are seeing is, without a Keystone XL Pipeline oil, the oil that is \nbeing produced out of the Bakken is finding a home somewhere. It is not \njust sitting there. It is being moved.\n  Where is it being moved to? It is being moved to refineries that have \ncapacity. It is going west. It is going west to those west coast \nrefineries that are used to getting Alaska crude. Keep in mind that as \nit moves west, if we don't have the pipeline, how is it moving there? \nHow are we moving it? We are moving it by rail, predominantly.\n  Again, we will have that discussion about the environmental impacts \nof rail or truck versus a pipeline and the safety and emissions issues. \nIf you want a cleaner way to transport oil, it will be in a pipeline. \nIf you want a safer way to transport oil, it will be in a pipeline. We \nhave had this discussion in the past--and again, so Alaskans \nunderstand--and the Keystone XL Pipeline will benefit us in terms of \nbeing able to continue to send our crude to those west coast \nrefineries.\n  We have heard--I believe repeatedly and incorrectly--that the \nKeystone XL Pipeline is a foreign project that is going to carry \nCanadian oil to the gulf coast. We know where the name TransCanada \nderives from. We know that much of the oil to be transported will be \nfrom Alberta, but I think it is important to acknowledge that we have \nabout 100,000 barrels of Bakken crude that will come from North Dakota \nand Montana and down through the midcontinent. If we have the Keystone \nXL Pipeline constructed, it will avoid the west coast.\n  The last point I will make for the folks back home, for whom I work \nand who are following this issue, is that I really think the Keystone \nXL Pipeline is a test for us. It is a test of whether we as a nation \ncan still review, license, permit, and build a large-scale energy \ninfrastructure project. We are looking at that in Alaska. We need to \nknow that can continue to be done in this country, because if we cannot \ndo it even here in the lower 48, where the costs are lower and there is \nan existing infrastructure that you tie into, which the Keystone XL \nwill--you have the southern leg already completed--if we can't \ndemonstrate that we can get beyond the process of permitting a leg of \nthis pipeline over the Canadian border and into the United States, what \nconfidence do we have that we are going to be able to do other big \nenergy infrastructure projects? That worries me a great deal.\n  When people say that we are rushing this too quickly or that it is \npremature or that we need to let everything play out, I think we need \nto remind ourselves that 6 years is a pretty long time to play \nsomething out. Most companies don't have the wherewithal to wait \nsomething out over the course of 6 years because the cost of \nconstructing this pipeline has not gone down during this intervening \ntime period. If anything, the costs are going up. We know the costs are \ngoing up. We are working on the Keystone XL Pipeline right now, but it \nis just the first step of many I believe we need to take and to do in \norder to improve our energy policies.\n  I will be continuing my conversation with Members to explain how my \nState has an awful lot to offer our country--whether it is increasing \nthe flow of oil in our Trans-Alaska Pipeline or getting production up \nso we are not half full and instead are full, so we can share that \nresource with people throughout the country. As we look to move our \nnatural gas--our amazing quantities of natural gas--that massive \ninfrastructure project is a way in which we can work to advance that \nresource.\n  Alaska has so much to offer the country, but we need to have the \nchance and the opportunity to do so. Our pipeline up north is already \nbuilt. It was completed just after I got out of high school. In fact, I \nwas privileged to have the opportunity to work up in Prudhoe Bay at \nthat time and saw what actually happened out there in the oil fields. \nIt has operated successfully, safely, and efficiently for decades. It \nhas far surpassed what we believed we would be able to ship through \nthat line, but it remains surrounded by billions and billions of \nuntapped oil that can be brought to market, which would then bring in \njobs, generate revenue, and keep prices as low as possible, and \nincrease our security. We all want that.\n  This is a conversation that will continue until the conditions of \nAlaska's Statehood--those promises that were made to us back in 1959 \nwhen we became a State--are fulfilled and we are allowed to produce our \nresources as a State.\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\n  So watching what is going on with Keystone is something that is of \ngreat interest to the folks back home. We will continue to watch it and \nhopefully be encouraged that we do the right thing from a jobs \nperspective, from a revenue perspective, from an economic perspective, \nand an energy-security perspective.\n  We have three amendments which are pending. I was privileged to be \nsitting in the Chair a little while ago when the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts spoke about his amendment. His amendment relates to \nexports from the Keystone XL Pipeline. My colleague from Massachusetts \nis not from a big oil-producing State, as I am.\n  I believe it is fair to say that his State cares a lot about the cost \nof energy. They have cold winters, infrastructure challenges, and other \nissues as it relates to energy, and I appreciate that. But it is \nimportant to understand what my colleague's amendment would do. It \nwould specifically prohibit the export of oil that is brought into the \nUnited States through the Keystone XL Pipeline, as well as the export \nof the finished products made from that oil. It is not just the raw \ncrude that is put into the line. It is what goes down to the refineries \nin the gulf coast and is then refined into products--whether it is \ndiesel or some other product. It is saying that the export of that \nshould be prohibited.\n  Basically, his amendment is a full-on, flat-out statement saying that \nyou can't have any aspect of it--any drop of that--leave this country. \nIt essentially says that all of this--every ounce of this new Canadian \nresource--will be brought into this United States and will stay here.\n  My colleague has raised the concern that the United States should not \nbe that passthrough entity. He used the terminology that it is similar \nto a straw from Canada down to the gulf, and then it goes out the back \nend from there. The President, in a comment, used the term conveyor \nbelt and that the United States should not be that conveyor belt. The \nargument is that we should not just be a passthrough where Americans \nget none of the benefits. Well, if we didn't get any of the benefits, I \nthink we should be talking about that.\n  It is important to know this is not the first time we have had this \ndiscussion or this idea in front of us. Back in early 2012, it was part \nof an amendment that came before the floor. It was defeated 33 to 65. \nWe had many of our Democratic colleagues join with all of the \nRepublicans to reject a statutory ban on exports.\n  I am hopeful this amendment that has been offered and is pending will \nsee the same fate and ultimately be defeated by at least the same \nmargin. I say that because I think it continues to be unnecessary, and \nI strongly believe it takes our export policies in the wrong direction.\n  This is not just Lisa Murkowski saying this takes us the wrong way. \nThe Department of Energy has looked critically at the issue of the \nKeystone XL oil being exported and whether or not that makes sense. In \ntheir analysis--and they state it pretty succinctly--they say: Without \na surplus of heavy oil in PADD 3--that is the gulf coast area--there \nwould be no economic incentive to ship Canadian oil sands to Asia via \nPort Arthur, which is where it is coming out of.\n  The Department of Energy's conclusion--they had a pretty broad \ndiscussion about it. But their conclusion was then reinforced by the \nState Department in its final supplemental EIS for Keystone, which is a \ndocument that everybody should read--granted that it is 1,000 pages \nlong, or thereabouts, but there is a summary that helps to condense so \nmuch of it. In the State Department's final EIS, they say that ``such \nan option''--that being export--``such an option appears unlikely to be \neconomically justified for any significant durable trade given \ntransport costs and market conditions.'' Think about that. I believe \nthese conclusions make some pretty good sense here.\n  The purpose of the Keystone XL Pipeline is to bring Canadian and \nAmerican oil--let's not forget the 100,000 barrels coming out of \nMontana and North Dakota--to the gulf coast. It does not make any sense \nto bring oil all the way--850 miles--to refineries that can refine it--\nremember, these refineries in the gulf coast are set up to deal with \nexactly this type of oil. So we have the line that brings it from the \nnorth to the south where you have refineries that are able to handle \nthis. So tell me why it would make sense to just use this pipeline as a \npassthrough--as a conveyor belt or straw--and then ship it to \nrefineries around the world that will add that transport cost to it. As \nthe State Department EIS said, it would not be economically justified.\n  It is important to understand, again, what is going on down there in \nthe refineries in gulf coast, and the State Department looked at that. \nWhat they found was that the traditional sources of heavy oil used on \nthe gulf coast are declining. Why are they declining? What we \ntraditionally see coming in as imports there--coming in from Venezuela \nand Mexico--has been drawn down or lessened, if you will, for a host of \ndifferent reasons, but not the least of which is because we are \nproducing more here in the lower 48 States in the Bakken.\n  We have talked a lot about the misalignment that is going on within \nour refineries and what is being produced and what we are capable of \nrefining. But again, what we are seeing in the gulf coast is an ability \nto take on more capacity for this heavy oil. The opportunity to refine \nthe product that is coming out of Canada there in the gulf coast \nrefineries is real. It is there.\n  Now, I think it is important to be honest here. I don't want to be \nwritten up in somebody's fact checker. Believe me, we looked at that. \nThere are small amounts of oil from Keystone XL that could be \nreexported as a matter of economic efficiency, but that should not give \nanyone a reason to panic or get everybody all excited. It may come as a \nsurprise to some, but the reexport of Canadian oil that is not \ncommingled with the domestic crude is already completely legal. It is \nalready a routine matter where the Commerce Department just routinely \nsigns off on it. This is no big deal. There is no change in policy that \nis dramatic.\n  The Obama administration has already approved dozens of licenses to \nreexport crude oil all across the world.\n  I think it is important to recognize that this amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Massachusetts would not just block the export of the \ncrude, it would block the export of finished products. As he said, it \nwould be everything. It would be the crude, and it would be everything \nthat is then produced. Every bit we have he would have stay here. But \nblocking the export of finished products would be a reversal of \nexisting law and current practices. And think about it--just from a \npractical perspective, how do we enforce this? How would we \nrealistically enforce this measure of diesel that came from this \nrefinery, from this pipeline here in the lower 48--that we can go ahead \nand export--and this is what we do. It is not any great state secret. \nWe move our refined products, and we do so in a significant way to the \nbenefit of our Nation. So how do we fence off everything that comes out \nof Keystone XL and say: The refined product from this particular \npipeline can't move outside this country. It creates potential havoc, \nand maybe that is the point.\n  I think the Senate should recognize that this amendment is not going \nto improve this bill. I don't think it will change anybody's mind. I \ndon't think it is going to bring new support. I think it is meant to \nkind of poison the well and perhaps ensure that this pipeline will \nnever be built and that it can't operate.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at a couple different documents. I \nmentioned the final supplemental environmental impact statement the \nState Department did. It is an important read for the critical analysis \nthat went into it. I have cited those areas where they speak \nspecifically to the impact of the export. There are others who have \nreviewed not only that but other documents, other outside facts.\n  I mentioned that President Obama had made reference to the conveyor \nbelt theory or tagging Keystone XL as being a conveyor belt for the \noil. He made that statement when he was in Burma in November. His \nspecific words were that it would provide ``the ability of Canada to \npump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it \nwill be sold everywhere else.''\n  So the fact checkers got on President Obama for that and did a pretty \ngood analysis. I felt it was a pretty good\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nanalysis. They laid it out in clear English and ultimately decided that \nthe President was going to be awarded three Pinocchios for that \nstatement. For those who aren't familiar, if a person makes a \nsignificant factual error or obvious contradiction, they get three \nPinocchios.\n  But it wasn't just the Washington Post and Glen Kessler who did this \nassessment. We also had another fact check come out of PolitiFact, and \nthey also rated that statement mostly false on their Truth-O-Meter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these fact checks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2014]\n\nObama's Claim That Keystone XL Crude Would Go `Everywhere Else' But the \n                             United States\n\n                           (By Glenn Kessler)\n\n       ``I won't hide my opinion about this, which is that one \n     major determinant of whether we should approve a pipeline \n     shipping Canadian oil to world markets, not to the United \n     States, is does it contribute to the greenhouse gases that \n     are causing climate change?''--President Obama, news \n     conference at G20 summit, Brisbane, Australia, Nov. 16, 2014.\n       ``Understand what this project is. It is providing the \n     ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our \n     land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere \n     else.''--Obama, news conference, Rangoon, Burma, Nov. 14.\n       Twice during his recent overseas trip, President Obama \n     asserted that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline was designed \n     to take Canadian crude oil to the world markets. The \n     implication of the president's words is that the United \n     States would be simply a conveyor belt for the oil.\n       The pipeline would allow the Canadians ``to pump their oil, \n     send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be \n     sold everywhere else,'' the president said in Burma. The \n     question he faced, he said in Australia, is whether ``we \n     should approve a pipeline shipping Canadian oil to world \n     markets, not to the United States.''\n       The White House did not provide an on-the-record comment.\n       Update: The Natural Resources Defense Council, in a \n     response to this column, said we were relying on ``outdated'' \n     information. It noted that in recent months there has been a \n     jump in unrefined crude oil exports from the Gulf Coast, \n     contradicting the conclusions of the State Department. ``Data \n     from the Gulf Coast today show that some of the tar sands \n     from Keystone XL will be exported internationally before it \n     sees a U.S. refinery,'' the NRDC said. ``some'' at the moment \n     amounts to about 200,000 barrels a day; for reference, a \n     supertanker carries 2 million barrels. We did adjust some of \n     the language concerning exports in response to the NRDC \n     critique.\n\n\n                           the pinocchio test\n\n       The president seriously overstates the percentage of \n     Canadian crude that might be exported if the Keystone XL \n     pipeline is built. He suggests all of it would be exported, \n     without mentioning that it first would almost certainly stop \n     on the Gulf Coast to be refined into products. On top of \n     that, current trends suggest that about half of that refined \n     product would be exported. That is not insubstantial, but it \n     is certainly much smaller than 100 percent.\n       All of this is laid out in the extensive report issued by \n     the State of Department earlier this year. The president \n     might want to study it before he addresses the Keystone \n     question again. In the meantime, he earns Three Pinocchios. \n     We nearly made it Four Pinocchios, but it is correct that at \n     least some of the product would be exported, based on current \n     market conditions.\n\n\n                            three pinocchios\n\n       Is this really the case?\n\n\n                               the facts\n\n       First of all, the president leaves out a very important \n     step. The crude oil would travel to the Gulf Coast, where it \n     would be refined into products such as motor gasoline and \n     diesel fuel (known as a distillate fuel in the trade). As our \n     colleague Steven Mufson reported more than two years ago, the \n     refineries on the Gulf Coast are ``eagerly waiting'' for the \n     Canadian crude, since there isn't enough oil in the area \n     anymore to feed the refineries.\n       ``The modernized Valero refinery [in Port Arthur, Tex.] can \n     turn 310,000 barrels a day of some of the world's worst \n     quality crude oil--such as the bitumen-laden mixture from \n     Canadian oil sands--into gasoline and diesel fuel for cars \n     and trucks,'' Mufson wrote. ``Valero, the largest U.S. oil \n     refining company, would be one of the biggest customers of \n     oil from the Keystone XL pipeline, buying about 150,000 \n     barrels a day.''\n       Indeed, the State Department's final environmental impact \n     statement on the Keystone XL project specifically disputed \n     claims that the oil ``would pass through the United States \n     and be loaded onto vessels for ultimate sale in markets such \n     as Asia,'' saying it was not economically justified. The \n     State Department noted that the traditional sources of crude \n     for the Gulf Coast, such as Mexico and Venezuela, are \n     declining, and so refineries would have ``significant \n     incentive to obtain heavy crude from the oil sands.''\n       So then the question turns on what happens to that oil \n     after it leaves the refinery. Oil is a global commodity, of \n     course, and where it travels often depends on market \n     conditions. In Obama's telling, however, the refined Canadian \n     oil goes ``everywhere else'' and ``not to the United \n     States.''\n       But that's not right either, according to the State \n     Department report. U.S. exports are not affected by various \n     pipeline scenarios but instead by market conditions, such as \n     ``domestic demand versus domestic refining capacity, the cost \n     of natural gas, and refining capacity abroad, including in \n     foreign markets currently importing U.S. refined products \n     such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Europe,'' the report said. \n     The demand for exports, in other words, is completely \n     unrelated to building the Keystone XL pipeline.\n       For the sake of argument, let's look at the percentage of \n     exports currently from the Gulf Coast area, using data for \n     refining output and product exports from the Energy \n     Information Administration. Depending on how you crunch the \n     numbers, the percentage of exports for finished products \n     ranges between 35 percent and 50 percent. The State \n     Department pegged the rate of exports at just over 50 \n     percent, noting that ``this increased volume of refined \n     products is being exported by refiners as they respond to \n     lower domestic gasoline demand and continued higher demand \n     and prices in overseas markets.''\n       In other words, at least half of the oil that is refined on \n     the Gulf Coast stays in the United States. Market conditions \n     could change, of course, but there is little basis to claim \n     that virtually all of the product would be exported. (The \n     Fact Checker has previously noted that, contrary to the \n     claims of advocates of the project, Keystone XL is unlikely \n     to have much impact on gasoline prices.)\n       Opponents of the Keystone project have seized on slides, \n     such as the one below from one of Valero's presentations to \n     investors, to suggest the plan ultimately is to export the \n     production from Canadian oil sands.\n       But Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero, says ``it's a mistake \n     to interpret this to mean that Gulf Coast products would ONLY \n     go to export markets.'' The slide is simply showing the flow \n     of trade, from various refineries; diesel currently is more \n     popular in Europe while gasoline is king in the United \n     States, though demand for diesel is growing in both markets. \n     Day noted that currently the vast majority of the company's \n     products stay in the United States for domestic consumption.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From PolitiFact, Nov. 20, 2014]\n\n Obama Says Keystone XL is for Exporting Oil Outside the U.S., Experts \n                                Disagree\n\n                          (By Lauren Carroll)\n\n       President Barack Obama and many other Democrats think \n     there's little to be gained by building the Keystone XL \n     pipeline.\n       On Nov. 18, Senate Democrats voted down a proposal to build \n     the oil pipeline--which would stretch from Canada to Steele \n     City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline \n     that goes to Texas' coast. But the issue isn't going \n     anywhere. When the new Republican-led Senate takes over in \n     January, it will likely be at the top of their priorities \n     list.\n       Obama and other Keystone critics have argued that the \n     pipeline would have a negative environmental impact, while \n     having little benefit for the United States. For example, \n     constructing the pipeline would result in few permanent \n     American jobs.\n       ``Understand what this project is,'' Obama said at a Nov. \n     14 press conference in Burma. ``It is providing the ability \n     of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down \n     to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That \n     doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices.''\n       Two days later, in Brisbane, Australia, Obama described \n     Keystone XL as ``a pipeline shipping Canadian oil to world \n     markets, not to the United States.''\n       Predicting the effect of the pipeline on gas prices is a \n     little tricky. Experts tend to agree that it could impact gas \n     prices, but the effect would be indirect and minimal. But in \n     this fact check, we're going to focus on the export \n     question--whether or not, as Obama said, Keystone XL's \n     primary destination is beyond the United States.\n       We found that Obama's off the mark.\n\n\n                               Crude oil\n\n       In recent years, the United States has become a net-\n     exporter of refined oil products, like gasoline, jet fuel and \n     asphalt (meaning it exports more products than it imports), \n     according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. \n     However, it is a net-importer of the crude oil it uses to \n     make those products.\n       Keystone XL would transport crude oil from Canada's tar \n     sands through the Midwestern United States down to the Gulf \n     Coast, and there are refineries all along the proposed route.\n       America gets more crude oil from Canada than any other \n     country. Nearly all of Canada's exports go to the United \n     States, and this accounts for about a third of America's \n     total crude oil imports. Much of its oil already makes it to \n     the United States by rail and existing pipelines.\n       We asked several energy economics experts, and they believe \n     that quite a bit--if not most--of the Keystone XL crude oil \n     will be bought and used by American refineries.\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\n       ``It's difficult to say with any certainty, but it is most \n     likely that most would be refined in the U.S.,'' said Kenneth \n     Medlock, an expert in energy economics at Rice University in \n     Texas.\n       A recent State Department report argues that it would not \n     be ``economically justified'' for Canada to primarily export \n     its Keystone XL oil to countries other than the United \n     States, when there are plenty of American refineries to \n     consume it.\n       Some independent refineries--particularly those in the \n     upper Midwest, but also in Texas--are in desperate need of \n     crude oil, said Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow in energy \n     security at the Brookings Institution. Currently, the \n     refineries have to import crude from places like Venezuela \n     and Mexico--though it would be cheaper and better for overall \n     energy security to buy from a North American source, rather \n     than pay high transport costs.\n       On Nov. 17, TransCanada told Reuters, it ``makes no \n     business sense for our customers to transport oil down to the \n     U.S. Gulf Coast, pay to export it overseas but then pay to \n     transport millions of barrels of higher-priced oil back to \n     the U.S. refineries to create the products we rely on.''\n       Ebinger added that many American refineries are geared to \n     use heavy crude, which is what Keystone would transport from \n     Canada's tar sands.\n       There would, though, likely be oil coming through the \n     Keystone XL pipeline in excess of what the American \n     refineries would be able to use, noted Eric Smith, an energy \n     economist at Tulane University. This excess oil could go to \n     other countries capable of refining it. Still, most Keystone \n     oil would stay in North America.\n\n\n                            Refined products\n\n       Some Keystone XL critics have focused on the fact that \n     American refineries could export some of the products they \n     make with the Canadian crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel \n     fuel or asphalt. They argue that because products made in the \n     United States, using Keystone XL oil, will leave the country, \n     the pipeline wouldn't improve domestic energy security or \n     independence.\n       Anti-Keystone XL environmental group Tar Sands Action (part \n     of the larger 350.org) said in a Keystone XL fact sheet, that \n     American refineries will process the oil but, ``much of the \n     fuel refined from the pipeline's heavy crude oil will never \n     reach U.S. drivers' tanks.''\n       However, American oil refineries' product exports are ``not \n     sensitive'' to the addition of a new pipeline, the State \n     Department study says. Export trends are more dependent on \n     demand--both domestically and abroad--as well as the cost of \n     natural gas and foreign refining capacity. American oil \n     refineries are already increasing their exports, and that \n     trend could continue independent of Keystone XL.\n       ``Refined product export levels have already increased and \n     some of the crude used is from foreign sources,'' the report \n     says. ``As this may already be occurring, it may continue \n     with or without (Keystone XL).''\n       Further, the report says, ``The economic viability of \n     exports does increase the demand for crudes in the United \n     States,'' but, ``this demand does not depend on the proposed \n     project.''\n       Even if exports are increasing, the majority of oil \n     products refined in the United States stay in the United \n     States. For example, in 2013, Gulf Coast area refineries \n     produced about 946,000 barrels of finished motor gasoline per \n     day. They exported about one-third of that--323,000 barrels \n     per day.\n       In January, Our friends at the Washington Post's Fact \n     Checker looked at an ad by liberal PAC NextGen Climate that \n     said, ``(China is) counting on the U.S. to approve \n     TransCanada's pipeline to ship oil through America's \n     heartland and out to foreign countries like theirs.'' A \n     spokesman for NextGen told Fact Checker that they were \n     referring to refined product exports, rather than crude oil. \n     Fact Checker gave the ad its lowest rating of Four \n     Pinocchios.\n       Even if Keystone XL isn't built, experts said Canada will \n     find other ways to transport their oil to the United States. \n     Canada already sends crude from the oil sands into the United \n     States by rail and other pipelines.\n       ``I have no doubt that Canada will develop alternate means \n     of monetizing its crude oil, whether that be via expanded \n     rail shipments or by building pipelines to one or both of its \n     coasts,'' Smith said.\n       The longer that politicians debate Keystone XL, the more \n     time Canada has to figure out these alternate means.\n       ``Keystone XL is rapidly becoming irrelevant,'' said \n     Michelle Foss, energy economist at the University of Texas' \n     Bureau of Economic Geology.\n\n\n                               Our ruling\n\n       Obama said, Keystone XL allows ``Canada to pump their oil, \n     send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be \n     sold everywhere else.''\n       The general consensus among experts, as well as the State \n     Department, is that American refineries would be the primary \n     buyers of crude oil transported through the Keystone XL \n     pipeline, by a vast margin. Some Keystone XL critics have a \n     point that American refineries would likely export some of \n     the products that they make with crude oil transported by the \n     pipeline. The State Department says, however, that product \n     exports are already increasing, and that trend would likely \n     continue independent of a new pipeline. Additionally, \n     American refineries tend to keep more products in the country \n     than they export.\n       We rate Obama's claim Mostly False.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Again, I think it is important to have a full \nunderstanding of what we are talking about when we talk about the \nexport of Keystone XL and the imperative that in order for something to \nwork, as the Senator from Massachusetts has suggested that we are just \ngoing to have this passthrough, it has to make sense for those who are \nmoving this product. There has to be economic justification at the \nother end. And what makes sense is to move that product to the gulf \ncoast, where our refineries have the capacity to handle that heavy \ncrude, turn it into product there, and continue to create jobs within \nthat region.\n  I am not going to support the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, which I think is obvious from my statement, but I \nbelieve it is important to give some of the background. I would commend \nto colleagues some of these articles I have referenced.\n  There are two other amendments that are pending before us, and I will \nspeak very quickly to the amendment that has been offered by the \nSenators from Ohio and New Hampshire. They have once again teamed up to \noffer this bipartisan amendment on energy efficiency. They have worked \nvery closely on these issues over the years. We are to the point where \nwe can't think about energy efficiency without thinking Portman or \nShaheen, so I commend my colleagues for their diligence. I have been \nhappy to support them in their efforts, and I am happy, quite honestly, \nthat we will have an opportunity to vote on an amendment that does \nrelate to energy efficiency. It is not the full-on energy efficiency \nbill my colleagues introduced previously, but it is an amendment with \ntext that is identical to the measure that came out of the House, the \nEnergy Efficiency Improvement Act. This is a bill that moved through \nthe House 375 to 36 during the last Congress, toward the end. We tried \nto move it through in the Senate, and we came close to advancing it by \nunanimous consent, but there were still a few outstanding concerns we \ncouldn't get around, so it is back before us once again. But really \nnothing has changed since then, and in my view this is a good reason \nwhy this proposal is really regarded as important and noncontroversial. \nIt is cost-neutral. It contains four provisions, one of which is \nextremely time-sensitive.\n  Sometimes people don't want to get down into the weeds of certain \naspects of what we are dealing with. The time-sensitive provision we \nare dealing with is these energy efficiency standards related to water \nheaters where we have a consent decree from back in 2010 that our water \nheater manufacturers have until April 16 of this year--so actually 3 \nmonths from today--to meet these revised minimum efficiency standards \nfrom DOE.\n  The problem we have is that DOE's standards effectively ban \nproduction of these grid-enabled water heaters that many of our rural \nco-ops use for electrical thermal storage or demand response programs. \nSo instead of saving energy, these revised standards now threaten to \nactually work against these goals. So we have a bizarre, unintended \nconsequence in this situation.\n  We have been working for a couple of years now to address this and to \nfix it, and now it is urgent. Now we have to deal with it because, \nagain, we are at 3 short months. The manufacturers are worried about \nwhat the Congress is going to do. Is it going to be resolved? Should I \nbe building any of these? Thanks to the cooperation of the Senators \nfrom Ohio and New Hampshire, we have an opportunity to have this \nmeasure in front of us once again.\n  There are three other provisions in this amendment that are equally \nnoncontroversial. They all relate to voluntary efficiency programs. One \nfocuses on the efficiency of commercial office buildings. Another \nprovides greater information about energy usage in those buildings. The \nthird looks at energy-efficient government technology and practices.\n  This is one that I hope we will be able to advance without further \ndelay. This is really a commonsense effort to fix a real problem for \nour rural co-ops.\n  More importantly, let's embrace energy efficiency around here. We are \nnow involved in the discussion about\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nincreased production, which is very real. I started off my comments by \ntalking about Alaska's desired contribution to the national energy \neconomy, but I view energy from a three-legged stool perspective: We \nhave increased production. We have all the technologies that are going \nto allow us to achieve our potential with our clean and renewable \nresources, which is hugely important, but we also have the efficiency \nand the conservation piece. We don't talk about that enough around \nhere. We need to do more. Shaheen-Portman is one way to get us there, \nalbeit in a very small way.\n  The last amendment we have pending is an amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Minnesota on the other side of the aisle, who also \nserves on the energy committee. He has introduced an amendment that \nwould require that all of the iron, the steel--that all the \nmanufactured goods that are used to construct Keystone XL be produced \nright here in the United States.\n  I think all of us want to do all we can, certainly, to encourage more \njobs and job creation here in this country and to put in place policies \nthat would allow us to do so. I do appreciate that the Franken \namendment inserts language in the amendment that allows--or I guess it \navoids a conflict with our international trade agreements because we \nknow that could have really threatened the bill. It would actually have \ngiven the President real reason to threaten to veto this bipartisan \nbill. But they have addressed that within the amendment. I also \nappreciate that the amendment allows the President to waive the \nrequirements for American materials based on findings he makes. So that \nis language which is included in it.\n  But I have to tell my colleagues, we are sitting here at 2,310 days \nsince the initial cross-border application was submitted for this \nproject. I was reminded that when the initial application was first \npresented, the President was then Senator Obama. That much time has \nelapsed. So I see this language, and I think it is included in this \namendment in good faith, but I just can't be convinced that the \nPresident would actually exercise this type of a waiver in a timely \nmanner. He certainly hasn't demonstrated it at any point throughout \nthis whole, long, drawn-out process we have been on with Keystone XL \nafter 6 years.\n  So I am going to be opposing this amendment for the same reasons I \nopposed it when we had it in front of us in 2012. It was included as \npart of a broader amendment at that time, but it did fall on a pretty \nstrong bipartisan basis.\n  These are important issues to be thinking about and considering, and \nI did take good time to review this. Again, I think all of us want to \ndo more to encourage job production, job creation. I buy American and I \nbuy local wherever and whenever I can. I strongly support the use of \nAmerican materials in American projects, whether it is in my State or \naround the country. I know the Presiding Officer probably does as well, \nas does the Senator from Minnesota. But in considering whether we here \nin Congress should mandate specific materials for the Keystone XL \nPipeline, I have come down on the side that we should not mandate that.\n  I think we need to look at several things. First off is the \ncommitment that has been made to buy American without any sort of \nmandate, without any requirement coming out of Congress. Fully 75 \npercent of the pipe from this project is going to come from North \nAmerica. That is the commitment that has been made, and I understand \nthat more than half of that--about 332,000 tons--is going to come from \nArkansas alone.\n  Again, this is a commitment that has been made to ensure that America \ndoes derive benefit, that we do see those--direct and indirect--induced \njobs. When you make a commitment, you say that we will pledge a full 75 \npercent of the pipe for the project that is going to come from North \nAmerica. I think that is important. It was important enough that \nTransCanada announced this 3 years ago. So this is not just something \nthey have decided in order to help facilitate this--that we are going \nto say 75 percent. They made this commitment a while ago.\n  Here in Congress we passed the Buy American Act, and that act \nspecifically is applied to projects that are Federally funded. But keep \nin mind here that when we are talking about Keystone XL, this is a \nprivate project. Keystone XL gets no subsidies. It will receive no \ntaxpayer dollars. It will be built to the government's specifications. \nWe have seen that when you look to that final SEIS, where the \nadditional mitigation measures are required once the permit is \napproved. It will be built to government specifications, but I don't \nthink the government should decide what it is actually built with. We \nare going to define the parameters in terms of mitigation, but, again, \nthis is a private project. This receives no Federal funds, and it would \nbe somewhat precedent setting. So I asked the Congressional Research \nService to see if they can identify for me any other projects where the \nCongress has sought to force or direct private parties or a private \ncompany to purchase domestic goods and materials--so all of the \nmaterials that go into it and not just the steel but everything else in \nthere. They have been looking. They have some pretty sharp folks over \nthere at CRS. So far, they have not been able to come up with an \nexample in our laws. I am concerned about this, quite honestly. As much \nas I support ``Buy American'' and making sure that we receive the \nbenefit of these jobs from creating these products, I am concerned \nabout the Congress' setting a precedent here. I think it potentially \nputs us on a pretty slippery slope.\n  If we are going to set the precedent here for Keystone XL and say, \nwell, you have to do it for pipelines, why wouldn't we do it for other \nenergy sources? Is that going to be a requirement we are going to place \non wind turbines?\n  I know some of my colleagues are in some States where they are \nmanufacturing good made-in-America wind turbines. I am all for that, \nbut is that a policy we are going to take on--where we are going to \nsay, no, it is an important industry, it is an important sector, and so \nwe are going to require that it all be made in America? If that is the \ncase, why not on our vehicles? Why not everything?\n  I worry about that. I worry about the precedent. I worry about where \nwe go beyond Keystone XL if that is the requirement. I think it is also \nimportant to listen to the industry's perspective on this position. The \nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute have been a huge supporter of \nKeystone XL for years now. They have 19 different member companies, \nmajor producers such as U.S. Steel. They have 125 associate members.\n  On January 8--actually, right after we came into session--before this \namendment was even filed, the American Iron and Steel Institute sent \nevery one of us a Steelgram reiterating their support for Keystone XL, \nand their letter is pretty definite. They are not nuanced about it. \nThey say:\n\n       It is essential that Congress act to ensure the approval of \n     the Keystone XL Pipeline without further delay.\n\n  I think we should listen to those words. Those words aren't coming \nfrom a TransCanada. They are not coming from an oil company. They are \ncoming from associations and workers around the country who believe \nearnestly and honestly that construction of this pipeline will be good \nfor this country and it will be good for these families. So let's \nlisten to them. Let's agree that 2,310 days and counting is more than \nenough time to make a decision.\n  We saw the Nebraska Supreme Court come out with their determination \nthat the decision that came out of Nebraska was not unconstitutional. \nSo it clears away that excuse, if you will, or that reason to say we \ncan't move forward.\n  There is really nothing holding up a decision at this point in time \nother than the President's unwillingness to move on this issue. I think \nif we want to move forward and provide good jobs--and we have had the \ndebate about how many jobs are really created. Is it the 42,100 that \nthe final SEIS states in terms of direct and indirect jobs?\n\n  If you want just to focus on the permanent jobs, that is definitely a \nmuch lower number--35 to 50 permanent jobs. But you know what. When you \nbuild something, there is the opportunity for good, honest work for \nwell-paying jobs for welders, for truck drivers, for operators. People \nare looking for an opportunity such as this. They want to be\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\npart of building something. I can tell you that in Alaska, when we are \ndebating how we are going to move our natural gas to market and how we \nare going to build this natural gas pipeline that will move this, \nnobody is saying that we can't build this because it is only going to \nprovide temporary construction jobs. That is not what we are talking \nabout. They know that there is benefit there. They are hoping they are \ngoing to be part of that benefit.\n  When we talk about where we are with some of these amendments coming \nforward, I think it is good to have this debate. I think it is good to \nhave this discussion, whether it is talking about exports, because that \nis a legitimate part of the discussion, talking about requirements that \nmay be placed on construction. But I think we have to remember we are \nnot the zoning board here in the Senate or in the Congress. This bill \ndoesn't have anything to do with siting. We are not determining the \nroute. That is what the States do and rightly so. What this 2-page, \n400-word bill does is approve the issuance of that permit to allow for \nconstruction, but we are not the ones determining that this is the way \nthe line goes.\n  I would urge colleagues to look critically at the language and see \nexactly what it does. Understand that when we are talking about the \nbenefits and burdens of a pipeline, it is true that pipelines are not \n100 percent fail-safe. Not much that we build is 100 percent fail-safe, \nbut what we try to do at every turn and at every opportunity is to make \nit as close as possible. But when you look from a safety perspective, \nfrom an environmental perspective, the safest and most environmentally \nsound way to move this oil is in a pipeline. It is not putting it in \nrail to other parts of the country. It is not putting it on the roads \nas we are seeing. Those are the options right now. Whether people in \nthis body or across the Chamber here object, Canada is accessing their \nresource. They are accessing their resource, and they will move their \nresource. Right now the way they are moving it is in a way, quite \nhonestly, that adds to emissions, has greater potential for a spill and \nfor an environmental incident. So I am looking at it from the \nperspective that Canada is going to move that. They have made that very \nclear.\n  In fact, there was an article just a couple of days now, in the Wall \nStreet Journal--and it is talking about the impact of lower oil prices \nand the impact on what is happening in Canada as an oil producer. Are \nthey slowing down their production in response to lower oil prices? \nAbsolutely not. What we are seeing is almost--I don't want to describe \nit as a doubling down because that is an inaccurate phrase--but what we \nare seeing is continued effort within Canada to access their oil \nresources. Some of the statements that are made by some of the Canadian \noil companies are really quite telling. They say that Canadian Natural \nis a company that will ``ensure the oil sands will continue adding to \nthe global oil glut for a long time to come, regardless of the price of \ncrude.'' They go on to say: ``It's not well understood just how robust \nthe oil sands are. If you stopped expansion of the oil sands tomorrow, \nyou would have no decline in the production base for decades . . . But \nfew of the largest producers in Canada envision scaling back production \nat their oil sands operations.''\n  So what we are seeing is there was big investment up front with the \noil sands in Canada and accessing a resource that is plentiful, but if \nyou are to believe some of the statements from these Canadian \ncompanies, they are going to continue to produce their resource, even \nin the face of what we are seeing--declining world oil prices.\n  If Canada is going to continue to produce, how is that product going \nto be moved? I would rather it be moved safely through a pipeline, with \nfewer emissions through a pipeline, and to a part of the country where \nwe are set up to accommodate that resource in our refineries so that we \ncan refine that product to our benefit.\n  To me, that makes sense. So we will have good and--excuse the pun--\nenergetic debate about amendments in these coming days. I think you can \nsee from my comments we are going to have some amendments that I like \nand some that I am not supporting. But what I am looking forward to is \nthe fact that we are at a point that we are describing as regular \norders. We are going to be voting on amendments, perhaps quite a few, \nas we move toward the final passage of this bipartisan bill. I look \nforward to the exchange that we will have.\n  I thank you for your attention, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I am very pleased to join my colleague this morning, the \nchairman of our energy committee. The Senator from Alaska is doing a \nfantastic job leading our energy committee. I so appreciate her \nleadership on the committee, her knowledge of energy. Her words this \nmorning--very well spoken--I think really go to the heart of what we \nare trying to do with this legislation: not only pass important energy \nlegislation for the country but have this open process, open dialogue, \nhave a real energy debate, and not just a debate but give people the \nopportunity to vote.\n  Republican and Democrat alike, we are saying, come on down here, \nbring your amendments, and let's have a serious discussion about energy \nand about building the energy future of this country. Offer your \namendments, make your case, and then let's vote. If you can get 60 \npeople to support your amendment, if you can get 60 votes, that gets \nattached to the legislation. That is the way it is supposed to work \naround here.\n  So we are encouraging our colleagues to join with us and get the work \ndone that the American people want done. So I thank our energy chairman \nfor setting that in motion. That is the right way to do business. That \nis what we are elected to do. We are going to get something done for \nthe American people, who sent us here for that very reason.\n  When you look at what is going on in energy today, you have to feel \npretty good about it. If not, drive over to the gas station to fill \nyour car. Gas prices at the pump are about a dollar lower than they \nwere this time a year ago. If you equated that savings our consumers \nare receiving at the pump to a tax cut, it would be more than a $100 \nbillion tax cut for hard-working Americans. That is pretty exciting. \nThat did not just happen. It certainly did not happen because OPEC or \nanyone else--Venezuela or Russia or anybody--decided they wanted to cut \nus a break, cut hard-working Americans, hard-working taxpayers, \nconsumers, small businesses across this country a break. It happened \nbecause we are producing more energy in this country and we are working \nwith our closest friend and ally in the world--Canada--to produce more \nenergy.\n  On a daily basis we consume about 18 million barrels of oil a day--\noil and oil equivalents--and produce about 11 million of those barrels \nhere domestically. We are up to about 3 million, so of the 7 million we \nimport, about 3 million comes from Canada. So we are down to only \nimporting about 4 million barrels a day from other sources. If we stay \non this track, if we build the necessary energy infrastructure--such as \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline--and we continue to build good business \nclimates and get our companies to invest, to create jobs, and produce \nmore energy, we can get to a point where we truly have North American \nenergy security, meaning we produce more energy here at home and with \nCanada than we consume. Boy, then we will be in the driver's seat--not \nOPEC; America will be in the driver's seat. If we don't do it, if we \nblock projects like we are debating right now, then we will put OPEC \nback in the driver's seat. So when they hear our President say he is \ngoing to continue to block this project, to veto this legislation if we \nare able to pass it with a strong bipartisan majority, that is music to \nOPEC's ears because that puts them right back in the saddle. That is \nwhat they want.\n  But we work for America. That is why we need to continue to move \nforward and build this exciting energy future for our country that we \nare building. It is energy. It is jobs. It is economic growth. This \nproject will create hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue--State, \nlocal, and Federal revenue to help reduce the debt and deficit. That is \na huge and important impact of the project. Of course it is about \nnational security with energy security. So I want to emphasize that\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nagain because that is doing the work the American people sent us here \nto do.\n  For the opponents--there are a couple of things that I heard this \nmorning and that I hear on an ongoing basis. One is that, oh, gee, we \nshould be doing renewable energy instead of fossil fuels.\n  Why not do all of it? Why are they mutually exclusive? How does doing \nthis project in any way prevent us from doing any renewable project we \nought to do? Let's do those renewable projects.\n  In my home State we use steam from coal plants to produce biofuels, \npower biofuels plants. We use the wastewater from some of our \ncommunities in those biofuels plants. We have wind energy. We have \ngeothermal, ethanol, biodiesel. We are now the second largest oil-\nproducing State in the country. We produce 1.2 million barrels a day--\nsecond only to Texas.\n  They are not mutually exclusive. Let's do it all. How does holding up \none enable us to do the other? It does not. So when I hear the argument \nthat ``Well, we ought to do all of those other things,'' good--let's do \nthem. But doing this project helps us. It provides more energy. Heck, \nlet's do the others too. So arguing that we should do renewables is not \nan argument against this project. Fine. Let's do it. Let's do them \nboth.\n  The other argument that I heard this morning and that I hear, of \ncourse, a lot from the critics is the environmental argument. Again, I \nsay look at the facts. Go back to the science. The report itself says \n``no significant environmental impact.'' That is the report done by the \nObama administration, the environmental impact statement that was \ndesigned to look specifically at the environmental impacts. That has \nbeen done over the course of 6 years; not one, not two, not three, but \nfive reports--three draft reports, two final reports. The results are \nright in the report: The Keystone XL Pipeline will have no significant \nenvironmental impact.\n  In fact, we will have higher greenhouse emissions without the \npipeline than we will with it because it would take 1,400 railcars a \nday to move all of that crude into our country, which is what will \nhappen. If somehow the critics manage to block that, then it would go \nto China. We would have pipelines built to the west coast of Canada. \nThe oil would go to China in tanker ships and be refined in refineries \nthat have higher emissions. So however you slice it, without the \npipeline, we would have higher greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  But here is what I want to touch on for just a few minutes today. I \nwill talk about it more next week. Canada is working aggressively to \nget investment in the oil sands to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. \nExxon has a major project up there. Shell has a major project up there. \nThe Exxon project is the Kearl project. The Shell project is the Quest \nproject. In both cases they are bringing down the greenhouse gas \nemissions of the oil sands buy investing in new technologies, in \ncogeneration, and in carbon capture and storage. Hundreds of millions--\nbillions of dollars are being invested along with the Canadian \nGovernment in carbon reduction technologies. Not only does that reduce \nthe carbon footprint of the oil sands, but think about it--as that \ntechnology is developed, what happens? It is adopted in other places. \nIt is adopted here in this country. It might be adopted in China and \nother places around the world. So the advances they make in technology \nin reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in reducing the footprint of this \noil production and finding better ways, more cost-effective, more \nefficient ways, more environmentally friendly ways to produce that \nenergy, that technology then is adopted around the world.\n  In other words, they are finding solutions to some of the concerns \nthat are being raised on the environmental front by the very critics of \nthis project. So instead of stopping that investment and that \nadvancement, why don't we find ways to continue to develop that, which \nis not only a benefit in the oil sands in Alberta, but it is a benefit \nthat we can utilize to produce energy in this country and other places \naround the world. That is true for oil. That is true for gas. That is \ntrue for all fossil fuel energy.\n  See, that is how America has always worked. We create that business \nclimate. We encourage the investment. We get American ingenuity. We get \nAmerican companies to use their entrepreneurial genius to make those \ninvestments to not only create good jobs but to produce more energy, \ngiving us energy security, and deploy the very technologies that give \nus the better environmental stewardship that we want. But when we block \nthese projects, when we prevent the investment, when we will not let \nthem build the infrastructure, we bring all of that to a grinding stop. \nWhy would we do that? It does not make sense.\n  There is not one penny of U.S. taxpayer money going into this $8 \nbillion project. It is private investment. Why would we not want the \nprivate investment that helps build the infrastructure and develop and \ndeploy the technology that gives us better environmental stewardship? \nIsn't that what it is all about? Isn't that why our powerplants and our \nenergy production in this country are light-years ahead of what they \nare doing in countries around the world, where in many cases they are \nstill using third world-type energy approaches? Let's lead the way \nforward in technology. Let's empower that to happen.\n  Because I note that the time is wrapping up here, I will come back to \nthe floor next week. But I am going to talk about the hundreds of \nmillions that are being invested in the Kearl project--Exxon is doing \nthat project--and also in the Quest project, and Shell is doing that \nproject. They are working with the provincial government in Alberta to \ndevelop carbon capture and storage. That is something we talk all the \ntime about wanting to do. Here we have private companies working to put \nhundreds of millions into developing that very technology.\n  Since 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions for the production of oil in \nthe oil sands has come down 28 percent--been reduced almost by one-\nthird. They are continuing to find ways to improve the environmental \nstewardship and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. Isn't that what we \nwant versus continuing, for example, to import oil from Venezuela that \nhas as high or a higher footprint, and you do not have that kind of \ninvestment in new technologies, that kind of investment in better \nenvironmental stewardship.\n  So as we talk about this issue, let's talk about it in a way where we \nadvance the ball and we do it the right way; where we get the energy, \nthe jobs, the economic growth; where we build our relationship with \nCanada rather than saying: No, we are not going to work with you guys. \nAt the same time, we will get better environmental stewardship. We can \ndo it. Let's do it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the critical need for \ncyber security legislation.\n  Computers control nearly everything we use in our daily lives. They \ncontrol our cars, our phones, our water supply, our power grid, our \nfinancial services, our retail networks, our food production and in \nmany respects our military capabilities.\n  Fortunately, our adversaries have not yet succeeded in inflicting \nmajor physical damage on our Nation's interdependent critical \ninfrastructure.\n  That is not to say however they are not vulnerable to persistent \nthreats in cyber space. Look no further than in the ``2014 U.S. State \nof Cybercrime Survey.'' That is a study prepared by \nPricewaterhouseCoopers, the U.S. Secret Service, Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity, and CSO magazine.\n  Of the more than 500 U.S. executives and security experts surveyed, \n77 percent of businesses detected an attempted security breach in the \nprevious 12 months, and 34 percent of these businesses said the number \nof security incidents detected increased over the previous year, with \nan average number of 135 incidents per organization.\n  The report makes many key observations, but let me emphasize a key \nfinding that resonated with me. One thing\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\nis very clear: Most organizations' cyber security programs do not rival \nthe persistence, tactical skills, and technological prowess of today's \ncyber adversaries.\n  Cyber thieves proved their determination just last week when Russian \nhackers amassed over 1 billion Internet user names and passwords, the \nlargest known collection of Internet credentials.\n  In the years following the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. \nDirector of National Intelligence consistently ranked terrorism as our \nNo. 1 threat, but that started to change a few years ago. In 2012 then-\nFBI Director Robert Mueller predicted that ``in the not too distant \nfuture, we anticipate that the cyber threat will pose the number one \nthreat to our country.''\n  He was right.\n  In 2013 and 2014 the intelligence community's Worldwide Threat \nAssessment lists cyber as the top threat to our Nation. Terrorism, \nnuclear proliferation, and unauthorized leaks of classified information \nremain grave threats to our country, but cyber is now our No. 1 threat.\n  Yet it is hard to believe no major cyber security legislation has \nbeen enacted since 2002, when Congress passed the Federal Information \nSecurity Management Act--or FISMA--and the Cybersecurity Research and \nDevelopment Act. Of course, there have been provisions relevant to \ncyber security enacted in subsequent laws but nothing as significant or \ncomprehensive as the laws passed 12 years ago.\n  As we begin a new Congress, let me articulate a few guiding \nprinciples that should be included in any cyber security legislation.\n  First, we must acknowledge the need for the government and the \nprivate sector to cooperate in order to fend off cyber attacks, but \ntoday businesses are reluctant to share critical information out of \nfear of legal repercussions. Congress must provide proper incentives, \nsuch as liability protection, to encourage the private sector to share \ncyber threat information with our government.\n  Next, any cyber security legislation must strike the right balance \nbetween protecting our Nation's computer infrastructure and protecting \nindividual privacy rights.\n  Thus, information sharing between businesses and the government must \nbe tailored to the recipient's actual security responsibilities. \nMoreover, any legislation should avoid overly broad language that could \nclash with privacy protections.\n  Furthermore, a voluntary, nonregulatory approach is most likely to \nyield consensus legislation. The role of DHS and other government \nagencies should be to provide advice and resources to improve our \nNation's cyber security posture, not to pile on additional burdensome \nregulations.\n  Finally, and perhaps most important, we must build a strong cyber \nsecurity workforce in the public and the private sectors. Enacting \ncyber security legislation will mean very little if there are no \ntrained professionals prepared to tackle our Nation's cyber security \nchallenges.\n  In order to build the enduring capabilities capable of protecting our \ncyber infrastructure, we must encourage young people to pursue high-\ntech careers and attract highly skilled workers from around the world.\n  Beyond the civilian realm, the cyber threats we face present critical \nnew challenges to our national security. Arguably, we have not yet \nfaced a similarly novel catalyst for policy formulation and change \nsince the development of our nuclear deterrence strategy more than 60 \nyears ago.\n  As we face this new world of cyber threats, the fundamental question \nremains the same: What is the most efficient and effective means to \ndefend our country, the United States, while remaining true to the \nConstitution at the same time. Answering that question should be the \ncornerstone of the President's cyber security strategy.\n  I was encouraged to hear the President say during his visit to the \nNational Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center earlier this \nweek that ``cyber threats are an urgent and growing danger.'' I \ncertainly share that assessment of the dire nature of this very real \nthreat to our national security.\n  While I applaud the White House for its plans to host a conference on \ncyber security and consumer protection next month, the nature of the \ncyber security threat demands a comprehensive strategy to protect our \nNation.\n  Much work remains to be done on this front, especially from the \nstandpoint of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The urgency of this task was amplified when the Congressional \nResearch Service concluded just this month that ``the overarching \ndefense strategy for securing cyberspace is vague and evolving.''\n  As we face these threats, we must act decisively to ensure that \nbureaucratic barriers do not hinder the development of an effective \nstrategy to counter threats from cyber space. As it stands, there is \nnot a single agency primarily responsible for cyber defense.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is charged with protecting \ncivilian networks and working with the private sector. The FBI and \nSecret Service are responsible for investigating cyber crime, and the \nDepartment of Defense is responsible for defending its own systems and \npartnering to protect the defense industrial base.\n\n  Critically, the Defense Department is only tasked with supporting DHS \nwhen the cyber attack is directed at our homeland. Yet these \ndifferences of responsibility can operate as artificial barriers to the \nefficient and effective cyber defense system.\n  Indeed, the lack of a single organization with direct responsibility \nruns counter to the basic leadership principle of unity of command. It \nbears remembering that these boundaries only exist for our agencies, \nnot the hackers which seek to exploit the limitless terrain of cyber \nspace. In a world in which the lines between cyber crime and cyber \nwarfare are increasingly blurred, we need to ensure that all of our \ndefensive cyber capabilities are brought to bear against the wide \nvariety of threats facing our infrastructure, private and public, \ncivilian and military.\n  Nevertheless, the need for a primary agency of responsibility does \nnot necessarily mean the Department of Defense should be that agency, \neven despite its remarkable capabilities. Such a course would raise \nboth legal and practical concerns.\n  Beginning with the legal issue, as the Supreme Court has stated, \nthere is a ``traditional and strong resistance of Americans to any \nmilitary intrusion into civilian affairs.''\n  The use of the military to enforce the law, with respect to domestic \nhackers or to virtually patrol on private networks is problematic \nbecause of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. section 1835.\n  In addition, the Defense Department's organization to defend against \ncyber attacks might not be the most efficient. Currently, U.S. Cyber \nCommand, which is responsible for the training and equipping of our \ncyber warriors, is also entrusted with the Department's operational \nactivities in cyber space. Such a construct makes sense. Yet unlike a \nunified combatant command, Cyber Command is a subunified command under \nU.S. Strategic Command. Though this configuration has been considered \nand agreed to by the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am still not \nconvinced of its value. Therefore, I also hope the President addresses \nhow our military forces can best be aligned to facilitate the most \nefficient and effective cyber defense possible.\n  But returning to the larger question, if concentrating our efforts \nentirely in the hands of the Defense Department is not advisable, what \nare we to do?\n  One possible solution has been presented by Richard Clarke, the noted \nformer member of the National Security Council, in his book, ``Cyber \nWar.''\n  To be clear, I am not endorsing Mr. Clarke's proposal. We surely do \nnot need another government bureaucracy, but I do believe it is an \nimportant concept to be discussed during future debates on cyber \nsecurity. Specifically, Mr. Clarke argues for a civilian cyber defense \nadministration which would be responsible for protecting ``the dot-gov \ndomain and critical infrastructure during an attack.'' As well as \nassigning those Federal law enforcement agencies personnel responsible \nfor cyber crime to this centralized cyber defense administration, it \nwould only be logical to ask if such an agency could provide other \ncyber defense functions.\n  Accordingly, addressing proposals such as this as part of answering \nthe\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\nquestion as to what is the most effective organization we can employ \nfor cyber security should be a focal point of the President's address.\n  But we should not just place these questions at the President's door. \nThe Senate itself must consider modifying the way it considers cyber \nsecurity legislation and issues.\n  Currently, there are at least five separate Senate committees which \nare responsible for various aspects of cyber security. Therefore, we, \ntoo, have a unity-of-effort issue, and the Senate should consider means \nto concentrate this body's expertise on this critical matter.\n  In conclusion, there are a myriad of questions which our government \nmust address before we are able to state we have the most effective, \nefficient, and constitutional cyber security defense possible.\n  I hope the President fully utilizes the opportunity presented to him \nin his State of the Union Address to answer these important questions--\nand if he doesn't, we have to. So we better solve these problems. I \npresume the President will speak intelligently on these issues and \nhopefully in a way that will unify the country, unify the Congress, and \nget us all working in the same way.\n  We can't afford to let this drag any longer. This is one of the most \nimportant sets of issues we have in our country. It may be one of the \nmost important issues or sets of issues in the world at large.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on January 12 in Saudi Arabia a prominent \nhuman rights lawyer, Mr. Waleed Abu al-Khair, was handed a 5-year \nextension to his 10-year prison sentence. Mr. Abu al-Khair, who is the \nfounder and director of the watchdog group Monitor of Human Rights in \nSaudi Arabia, was also fined, banned from travel outside the county for \n15 years after his release, and his websites will be shut down. What \nwere the crimes that brought about this sentence? He was charged with \nharming the kingdom's reputation and insulting judicial authority, \namong other violations related to his non-violent activism.\n  This case and others like it certainly have harmed the kingdom's \nreputation, and insulted its judicial system, but the fault is not Mr. \nAbu al-Khair's.\n  After years of defending human rights activists as a legal advocate \nin Saudi courts, he was called in front of a terrorism tribunal at the \nend of 2013 for a trial that from its earliest days was declared a \nfarce by human rights organizations. This was not the first time Mr. \nAbu al-Khair was made a target of the justice system, having first \nfaced trial in 2011 for signing a petition that called for government \nreform.\n  During the fifth hearing in front of the terrorism tribunal he was \njailed mid-trial under the January 2014 antiterrorism law, which covers \nverbal acts that harm the reputation of the state. Mr. Abu al-Khair was \neventually sentenced to 10 years for his activism amid growing \ninternational condemnation of Saudi repression. His decision not to \ndisavow his beliefs led to this week's further sentencing.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Abu al-Khair's case is not unique. As more Saudis \nhave begun to speak out against government repression, the monarchy has \nresponded by escalating its crackdown on dissent, including by using \nthe already dubious terrorism tribunal system to punish human rights \ndefenders.\n  It is ironic that while Saudi officials condemned the brutal killings \nof journalists at Charlie Hebdo, and their Ambassador attended the \nrally in Paris, their Justice Ministry was preparing to carry out the \nfirst of 1,000 public lashings of Raif Badawi. Like the cartoonists, \nMr. Badawi has been accused of insulting Islam, and like them and his \nformer lawyer, Mr. Abu al-Khair, he was simply exercising his \nnonviolent right of freedom of expression. Needless to say, his \npersecution has drawn an international outcry, including by many of \nthose who joined the Saudi government in denouncing the attacks in \nParis.\n  The United States and Saudi Arabia have long been strategic allies, \nand we want that relationship to continue. But the fundamental right of \nfree expression cannot be a casualty of convenience. The injustices I \nhave described must be addressed. Not only do these actions violate the \nSaudi government's stated policy and its commitment as a member of the \nUN Human Rights Council to protect human rights, but they are a flawed \nstrategy for discouraging dissent. Ominously, as we have seen in many \ncountries, they may cause critics of the government to resort to \nviolence to achieve their goals.\n  I urge the Saudi government to release Mr. Abu al-Khair and Mr. \nBadawi and dismiss the spurious charges against them. This kind of \nrepression and barbarity have no place in the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/16/senate-section/article/S235-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S235-S236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CORN ETHANOL MANDATE ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to submit an amendment with my \ncolleagues, Senators Toomey and Flake to correct a major problem with \nthe current Renewable Fuel Standard: the mandate for corn ethanol. We \nsee two major problems with continuing to mandate the consumption of so \nmuch corn ethanol each year. The statute currently mandates more corn \nethanol than can be used by the current vehicle fleet and gas stations. \nRoughly 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop is now used to produce \nethanol, artificially pushing up food and feed prices while damaging \nthe environment. This amendment offers a simple fix that addresses both \nproblems: elimination of the corn ethanol mandate.\n  Also, the amendment leaves in place the requirement that oil \ncompanies purchase and use low-carbon advanced biofuels, including \ncellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. This allows the program to focus on \nthe fuels that best address climate change and do not compete with the \nfood supply.\n  Let me highlight a few of the unintended consequences of the corn \nethanol mandate. The policy has led us to use roughly 40 percent of the \nU.S. corn crop not for food but for fuel, nearly twice the rate in \n2006. Using more and more corn for ethanol--in drought years as well as \nyears with bumper crops--places unnecessary pressure on the price of \ncorn.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in June 2014 that \nescalating the volume of corn ethanol as currently required by statute \nwould raise the average price of corn about 6 percent by 2017. That \nwould increase food expenditures by $3.5 billion per year by 2017, the \nequivalent of about $10 per person, which most directly affects \nfamilies living on the margin.\n  Internationally, according to Tufts University researchers, the corn \nethanol mandate has cost net corn importing countries $11.6 billion in \nhigher corn prices, with more than half that cost, $6.6 billion, borne \nby developing countries. Higher corn prices also raise prices \nthroughout the food supply chain by raising the cost of animal feed. \nFor the turkey industry alone, the Renewable Fuel Standard raised feed \nexpenses by $1.9 billion in 2013, according to the President of the \nNational Turkey Federation. For the restaurant industry, a recent \nPrice-Waterhouse-Coopers study projects that the corn ethanol mandate \nwould increase costs by up to $3.2 billion a year. For the milk \nindustry, the Western United Dairyman reported in 2013 that a \ncombination of high feed costs and low milk prices put 105 dairies out \nof business in one year alone.\n  The corn ethanol mandate also has unintended environmental \nconsequences. In 2013, an investigative report from the Associated \nPress found using government satellite data that 1.2 million acres of \nvirgin land in Nebraska and the Dakotas alone were\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nconverted to fields of corn and soybeans since 2006. Putting virgin \nland under cultivation has environmental consequences, including \ngreater runoff, greater use of fertilizer, and less land available for \nconservation.\n  Another consequence of the corn ethanol mandate is that it places a \nregulatory requirement on oil refiners that cannot actually be \nsatisfied--it requires more ethanol than the auto fleet and existing \ngas stations can accommodate, a concept called the blend wall. Under \nthe RFS, oil refineries are required to blend 15 billion gallons of \ncorn ethanol into the fuel supply in 2015. This far exceeds the roughly \n13.5 billion gallons that our current infrastructure can accommodate. \nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency's final 2013 rule, the \n``EPA does not currently foresee a scenario in which the market could \nconsume enough ethanol to meet the volumes stated in the statute.'' The \nCongressional Budget Office confirmed this judgment in its June 2014 \nreport, saying that the statutory goal of escalating corn ethanol \nvolumes would be ``very hard to meet in future years.''\n  Chevron, which operates oil refineries in my home State, is also \nconcerned that the statutory mandate requires too much ethanol. It is \nChevron's judgment that ``the required volume of renewable fuel exceeds \nthe amount that can be safely blended into transportation fuels used by \nconsumers.'' Facing this difficulty, the EPA has been unable to \nfinalize the volume requirements for 2014 or 2015. This leaves the \nbusinesses seeking to develop advanced biofuel ventures without any \ncertain prospects to guide their investments and undermines the primary \npurpose of the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n  The Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act would address the blend wall \ndirectly, thereby allowing EPA to continue increasing volumes of low \ncarbon advanced biofuel.\n  The corn industry, by contrast, does not depend on the RFS for its \nlivelihood. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that \nrefiners will continue to blend corn ethanol into the fuel supply in \nthe absence of a mandate, because ethanol is the oil refiner's \npreferred octane booster and oxygenate.\n  Ultimately, I believe that this bill would better serve the advanced \nbiofuel industry by removing the blend wall as an obstacle to the \nindustry's expansion, and providing the regulatory certainty that they \nneed to guide their investments. These advanced biofuels have none of \nthe same problems as corn ethanol. They do not compete directly with \nfood, and they reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent \ncompared to petroleum.\n  I am also fundamentally committed to the vitally important public \nhealth and climate protections provided by the Clean Air Act. That is \nwhy I would like to make it crystal clear that this legislation is a \nnarrow bill repealing the corn ethanol mandate. The bill's language \nexplicitly clarifies that the legislation has no effect on the low-\ncarbon advanced biofuel provisions in the Renewable Fuel Standard, and \nI would oppose any bill that would amend, revise or weaken the advanced \nbiofuel provisions or other public health protections provided by the \nClean Air Act.\n  The elimination of the corn ethanol mandate is a smart, simple reform \nwith support from the prepared food industry, the dairy, beef, and \npoultry industries, the oil and gas industries, hunger relief \norganizations, and environmental groups.\n  The bill solves the problems of the Renewable Fuel Standard while \nmaintaining the provisions that encourage the development, growth, and \ndeployment of cellulosic ethanol, algae-based fuel, biodiesel, and \nother low-carbon advanced biofuels.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/16/senate-section/article/S236-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        JOHNSON CITY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, since 2010 I have sponsored a \nState of the Union essay contest for Vermont students. The contest, now \nin its fifth year, is an opportunity for Vermont students to articulate \nwhat issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United \nStates. A panel of Vermont teachers reviewed all of the essays \nsubmitted and selected the top twenty. I am proud to say that more than \n400 students wrote essays for this year's State of the Union contest.\n  I would like to congratulate each and every finalist, and to \nspecifically acknowledge Leo Lehrer-Small as this year's winner of the \ncontest. I would also like to recognize Ryan Taggard for placing second \nand Craig Pelsor and Hadley Menk for placing third. I ask to have \nprinted in the Record the winning essays.\n  The essays follow.\n\n\n      LEO LEHRER-SMALL, MOUNT MANSFIELD UNION HIGH SCHOOL (WINNER)\n\n       As we enter the year of 2015, there is one issue in \n     particular that our government, in conjunction with global \n     policy makers, need to address with attention and urgency. \n     This issue, quite simply, is the safety of our planet: global \n     climate change is already affecting the environment through \n     droughts, increasingly frequent heat waves, and rising sea \n     levels. It is a scientific fact that climate change is man-\n     made, even though some politicians still deny the part that \n     humans play in the issue.\n       As the most powerful country in the world, the US must be a \n     driving force in halting global climate change. The question \n     is: how do we go about doing this? In order to fix our \n     growing crisis, we must first understand the roots of the \n     problem. Last year's report released by the Intergovernmental \n     Panel on Climate Change showed that the recent rise of \n     temperature is due to an excess of greenhouse gases that \n     humans have released into our atmosphere. And to quote the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, ``The largest source of \n     greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United \n     States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, \n     and transportation.'' So it is clear; the root of our problem \n     is our overuse of fossil fuels.\n       We must take drastic measures to reduce our fossil fuel \n     consumption. Congress must make and pass bills that finance \n     green energy projects. Government subsidies which are \n     currently being given to the oil and gas industries should be \n     given to the renewable energy industry. This boost would \n     allow renewable and clean energy sources such as wind and \n     solar to provide more of the nation's energy, and in return \n     lower our usage of fossil fuels. The growth of clean energy \n     usage in the US would not only play a role in climate change \n     reversal, but also provide millions of safe jobs for American \n     workers.\n       Furthermore, our government should heavily tax the large \n     greenhouse gas producers; companies that burn cheap fossil \n     fuels to make massive amounts of money. These are the main \n     contributors to climate change. These are the corporations \n     that we must limit through a tax on carbon dioxide. Such a \n     tax would not only discourage the burning of fossil fuels, \n     but the money may also be invested in the redevelopment of \n     clean energy.\n       And as one of the leaders in our global economy, the rest \n     of the world will look to us to initiate the transition \n     towards clean energy usage. We have the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\n     globally legitimize renewable energy, which is a vital step \n     towards ending climate change. The action that our country \n     takes on this problem will be a model for the rest of the \n     world, which makes it the most important issue that should be \n     addressed by the United States. Not taking care of the planet \n     is not taking care of the people.\n\n\n       RYAN TAGGARD, BRATTLEBORO UNION HIGH SCHOOL (SECOND PLACE)\n\n       The state of our country has seen marked improvement over \n     the last year. Unemployment is at its lowest level since \n     before the recession, the stock market is setting record \n     highs, and a manufacturing sector that has added jobs for the \n     first time in nearly two decades. But we're working to regain \n     lost ground, while neglecting the importance of innovating, \n     creating, and aspiring--the very aspects that once made our \n     country great.\n       Throughout the 60's and 70's, America was the planet's \n     premier superpower. Despite the threat of an aggressive \n     U.S.S.R. looming on the horizon, campus unrest, the conflict \n     in Vietnam, and the civil rights movement playing out in \n     confrontations on the street, we found time to dream about \n     tomorrow. The engine of this growth was the relentless \n     advancement of science and technology. Our crowned jewel, \n     NASA, was among the most powerful agencies the world had ever \n     seen, and promised us a future full of plenty. We didn't \n     outsource jobs, because no other nation could do what America \n     could. We spawned entire industries built around new \n     inventions. And most importantly, we gained a technological \n     edge, strengthening our military, infrastructure, and \n     economy.\n       MRIs, GPS receivers, cochlear implants, Lasik surgery, \n     catalytic converters, the first fuel cells, cordless tools, \n     cell phones, and the microprocessors that enable our lives \n     are all direct results of our first forays into the abyss of \n     space. Due to our curiosity, hundreds of thousands of lives \n     were saved. Patients who were born deaf were given the \n     ability to hear. The blind could see. The environment was \n     restored in numerous and invaluable ways, and communication \n     became constant and universal. Curiosity enabled our nation \n     to perform miracles.\n       Unfortunately for our nation, NASA was formed in the midst \n     of a panic induced by the launch of the Soviet's Sputnik. \n     Once the American government saw that the U.S.S.R. wasn't \n     ready to go to the moon, they ceded their push to move \n     forwards. Today NASA's spending represents 0.49% of our \n     federal budget. This half a penny off the tax dollar pays for \n     all of NASA's operations: the International Space Station, \n     Hubble telescope, Curiosity rover, all the astronauts, and \n     more. With only a slight increase in funding, we could go \n     back to the moon, send men to Mars, and journey on to explore \n     asteroids and alien worlds.\n       The incentives for raising NASA's budget are diverse, \n     powerful, and irrespective of party. As well as providing an \n     opportunity for our government to assume a leadership \n     position, the economic stimulus that accompanies a revived \n     space industry would create new jobs, the technologies \n     developed would improve our lives, and the cultural shift \n     that occurred in the 60's and 70's would once again become \n     the norm. Students would aspire to become scientists, \n     engineers, mathematicians, and technologists. We as a nation \n     would reclaim our former spot at the very forefront of \n     innovation. And America would reap the benefits of an \n     educated, industrial, and forward thinking workforce.\n\n\n     HADLEY MENK, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (THIRD PLACE)\n\n       The future of our great nation is being threatened at this \n     very moment, and the foe may not be what you suspect. The \n     current states of our agricultural practices are harming our \n     country's future in catastrophic ways. Before a country can \n     focus on issues like health care, gun control, abortion, or \n     even the functioning of its own government, it must make sure \n     the people's basic needs are met. And nothing is more basic \n     or essential than food.\n       The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization \n     estimates that the world's population will reach 9 billion \n     people within the next 40 years. To meet this need, global \n     agricultural production must increase by 70%. Elected \n     officials of the United States must take this seriously. \n     Fortunately, agriculture is a subject in which Vermont is \n     well versed. It is time for Vermont to lead the way in \n     advocating for more efficient, effective, and sustainable \n     agriculture. Investing in agriculture is one of the simplest \n     but most effective ways for the United States to protect its \n     future as a nation and as a world leader.\n       There are several interconnected issues currently facing \n     our agriculture industry, the most important of which are \n     affordability, water, and land management. Food prices tend \n     to fluctuate depending on the price of oil, as petroleum \n     products are widely used in almost all aspects of food \n     production. From trucks and equipment to synthetic \n     fertilizers and pesticides, petroleum plays too large a role \n     in our food. Emphasis must be placed on finding more natural \n     alternatives to petroleum. Water and land management are also \n     major issues. As is evidenced by the crisis in California, \n     more needs to be done in terms of finding ways to better \n     conserve water for agriculture. According to the Index Mundi, \n     in North America in 1961, the amount of arable land per \n     person was 1.1 hectares. In 2009, that number had decreased \n     to .61 per person, due to land misuse. Legislators on a \n     local, state, and national level need to work with scientists \n     to solve these potentially catastrophic problems.\n       Without agriculture, it is impossible for any country to \n     survive. Widespread food shortages can cause not only \n     starvation but also corruption in the government. Investing \n     in food production benefits everyone, regardless of race, \n     gender, socioeconomic status, or political party, and yet \n     agriculture is not treated with as much attention as issues \n     like gun control and immigration in the media.\n       In order to preserve the future of the United States, we as \n     Vermonters must lead the way in urging legislators to endorse \n     measures that will improve agricultural methods and help \n     farmers be more sustainable. In a letter to George Washington \n     dated August 14, 1787, Thomas Jefferson stated that \n     ``Agriculture . . . is our wisest pursuit, because it will in \n     the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals and \n     happiness.''\n\n\n             CRAIG PELSOR, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL (THIRD PLACE)\n\n       The United States of America is without a doubt in a better \n     position now than it was ten years ago. The economy has \n     rebounded and the few lingering effects of the ``Great \n     Recession'' are being mended. The national unemployment rate \n     stands at 5.9% as of September, the lowest it's been since \n     2008. The United States is producing more oil, natural gas \n     and energy from renewable resources than ever before, which \n     seeks to further the eventual dream of an energy independent \n     America. In addition, rates for violent and property crimes \n     continue to decline and our national GDP continues to outpace \n     every other nations.\n       Even with the future seeming so bright, there remains still \n     pressing issues to which we must give our full attention.\n       As the economy has recovered and grown, so has the gap \n     between the rich and the poor, and even the rich and the \n     super-rich. We hear of the wealthiest one percent's still \n     growing fortunes while those in the 30th or 10th percentile \n     are still waiting for the wealth to trickle down. That has \n     not worked, and we must do something to stem the tide of this \n     growing inequality. To do this we must raise the minimum wage \n     until it is a livable wage in all fifty states, as well as \n     reorganizing our tax structure so that those with the most \n     wealth are contributing more than those without. There is \n     also the issue of massive student loan debts which dampen the \n     potential success of graduates. With the average student loan \n     debt growing, there are a number of steps we could take to \n     make paying for higher education less of a financial burden. \n     Expand the federal student loan program to grant more money \n     to those who need it, while at the same time ensuring public \n     colleges and universities do not raise their tuitions. The \n     system of federally subsidized Universities used in Canada \n     and some Europeans nations could easily be adopted in the \n     United States in order to keep the working costs of our \n     colleges and universities at a level where they will not need \n     to raise their tuition costs every year.\n       On a global front, there continues the troubles in the \n     Middle East and abroad, for which America has a duty to \n     respond with both humanitarian aid and military force to \n     ensure a lasting peace in the region. The arming of so called \n     ``moderate'' rebels in conflicts in Syria have proven of \n     little aid to America or its interests as well as the weapons \n     and intelligence we provide ending up in unintended hands. \n     Also, the billions of dollars of military aid to countries \n     such as Israel which has become a massively unnecessary \n     expenditure. In light of this, America should adopt a renewed \n     focus on bettering education opportunities and the general \n     standards of living in the Middle East and avoid joining any \n     new conflicts. The containment and destruction of ISIS should \n     remain a top priority, although the commitment of ground \n     troops to the area should be withheld unless the situation \n     gets far worse.\n       A chasm of trust has grown between American citizens and \n     those put in charge of their protection, law enforcement, due \n     to a lack of transparency and discretion. To that end, the \n     United States government must provide the states with \n     incentive to equip local law enforcement with things such as \n     body cameras instead of armored vehicles and assault rifles, \n     as well as further training in dealing with the mentally ill \n     and minorities where it is most needed. Until the people feel \n     like police officers are being held accountable for their \n     actions, we cannot expect to further improve the nation.\n       Another small change which may help stem the continuing \n     rise in prescription drug abuse would be the outlawing of \n     television, radio and internet advertising for all \n     prescription drugs. With this people will be less likely to \n     believe that they need all of the drugs that they see on \n     television and that they are all safe because they are being \n     publicly advertised.\n       There is no one solution to all the nation's problems, but \n     through many small steps and congressional efforts like the \n     ones that I have mentioned can make the United States of \n     America a much stronger and prosperous nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/16/senate-section/article/S237-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S237-S238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING S WHOLESALE FOODS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, one of the most important \nadvantages of small businesses is their unparalleled devotion to their \ncustomers and communities. Small business owners are\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\nthe most qualified to truly recognize and meet the needs of their local \nregions. Having a local presence can make all the difference when it \ncomes to building up a community, providing essential goods and \nservices, as well as giving back to those starting new ventures. For my \nsecond Small Business of the Week, I am honored to recognize S & W \nWholesale Foods for its success and commitment to serving southeast \nLouisiana and parts of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\n  Family owned and operated, Frank Spalitta and Richard Willams opened \nS & W Wholesale Foods in 1978. Over the years, it has grown from a \n5,000 square foot operation to two locations in Hammond, LA, and Baton \nRouge, LA. While S & W Wholesale Foods is well-known for distributing \nfresh food products such as meats, seafood, and produce, it also stocks \ncomplementary supplies, including plasticware, chemical and cleaning \nsupplies, and paper products to surrounding restaurants, bakeries, \nchildcare centers, convenience stores, and other local businesses. When \nFrank retired in 2006, his son and daughter-in-law, Paul and Tiffany \nSpalitta, purchased the business in order to keep the family tradition \nalive.\n  S & W Wholesale Foods has made a commitment to provide the best \navailable products to its customers, while also supporting an \nenvironment in which local restaurants and businesses work together to \nsucceed. As a shareholder in one of the largest foodservice \ndistribution cooperatives, Unipro Foodservice, S & W Wholesale Foods is \nable to supply high-quality products and services for its customers, \nwhich in turn supply Louisianians and residents of the Mississippi Gulf \nCoast. Even more inspiring is that S & W Wholesale Foods incorporates \nLouisiana brands, including New Orleans Roast and Zatarain's, to its \nlarger product base. One of the more unique aspects of the company is \nthe quarterly brochure that shares seasonal recipes and localized tips \nand ideas to help readers build up and maintain their own businesses.\n  S & W Wholesale Foods is a great example of how hard work and quality \nproducts can lead to a successful small business. The company's motto \ntruly sums up the undeniable foundation of its priorities, ``Large \nEnough to Serve . . . Small Enough to Care.'' It is my honor to \nrecognize this company that works so diligently to promote the \nbusinesses of the customers they serve. Once again, I congratulate S & \nW Wholesale Foods for being recognized as this week's ``Small Business \nof the Week'' and wish them all of the best in the future. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/16/senate-section/article/S238-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/16/senate-section/article/S238-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/16/senate-section/article/S238-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 37.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony in a criminal case under way in the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia. In this case, a former CIA \nofficer has been charged with unlawfully disclosing classified \ninformation. In 2010, the Senate agreed to S. Res. 600, in the 111th \nCongress, which authorized the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nto provide evidence in the investigation that preceded this indictment.\n  In addition to Senate Intelligence Committee staff, testimony as a \nfact witness has been requested from a former employee of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The chairman and ranking minority member of the \nJudiciary Committee would like to cooperate with the request for \ntestimony in this case.\n  Accordingly, this resolution would authorize the former Judiciary \nCommittee employee to testify at trial with representation by the \nSenate Legal Counsel.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 27) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/16/senate-section/article/S247-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S247-S248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 240\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
