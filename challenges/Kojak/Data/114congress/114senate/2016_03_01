Mr. President, the Republicans, in an effort to try to \ncloud the issue regarding selection of the Supreme Court replacement, \nusually don't provide a full quote. For example, they keep talking \nabout Senator Biden, but they should give the whole statement of \nSenator Biden, where he ended it by saying that ``compromise is the \nresponsible course, both for the White House and for the Senate. . . . \n[and] if the President consults and cooperates with the Senate . . . \n[on] his selections . . . then his nominees may enjoy my support, as \ndid Justices Kennedy and Souter.''\n  Yesterday the Washington Post published an editorial by Barbara \nPerry, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on the \nSupreme Court. It is among the finest law schools in all the world. \nThat is the University of Virginia.\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n  In her opinion piece, Dr. Perry pushed back against Republican claims \nthat Presidents have not historically nominated Supreme Court Justices \nduring an election year. According to her, ``14 Presidents have \nappointed 21 justices during presidential election years.'' That is 14 \nout of 44 Presidents have appointed Supreme Court Justices in \nPresidential election years. That is about one-third of all U.S. \nPresidents who have appointed nominees during an election year.\n  Amy Howe, an expert on the Supreme Court and editor at SCOTUSblog--\nSupreme Court of the United States blog--agrees that past Presidents \nand Senates have considered election-year nominees. She writes:\n\n       The historical record does not reveal any instances since \n     at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the \n     Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential \n     election year because of the impending election.\n\n  Republicans are using one inappropriate statement or excuse after \nanother to explain why they shouldn't have to do their jobs the \ntaxpayers sent them here to Washington to do. Instead of making \nexcuses, wouldn't it be easier just to do the right thing? The right \nthing would be to give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a \nhearing--a meeting before that--and a vote. We are simply saying: They \nshould be doing their jobs.\n  Some Republicans are already starting to see the light. Last week, \nthe Republican Senator from Maine ripped the Republican leader for \npoliticizing the current Supreme Court vacancy in the aftermath of \nJustice Scalia's death. Again, among other things, here is what the \nRepublican Senator from Maine said:\n\n       I thought it was a shame . . . that instead of honoring his \n     life and legacy and extending our condolences, already we are \n     embroiled in a political fight.\n\n  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie went a step further, urging the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings. Governor Christie said:\n\n       As I've always said, I believe that's absolutely the right \n     thing to do. People can vote up or down however they choose, \n     but hearings should be held. There is no reason for them to \n     not take on this nomination.\n\n  Governor Christie is absolutely right. There is no reason for a \nSupreme Court nominee not to have a full hearing and a vote. There is \nno reason for Senate Republicans not to give a nominee to the Supreme \nCourt a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. All we are saying is: Do your \njob.\n  Montana Republican Congressman Ryan Zinke published an editorial in \nthe Missoulian, one of the largest newspapers in the entire State, \nurging the Republican leader to give President Obama's nominee all due \nconsideration. Here is what he said:\n\n       It is unfortunate that partisanship took over the \n     conversation before the Justice even was laid to rest. The \n     partisan bickering and demands to ignore the Constitution \n     that unfolded after Scalia's death is an affront to his \n     legacy. Scalia dedicated his life to serving the \n     Constitution. It is time for the Senate to honor that service \n     and carry out their constitutionally mandated duty to advise.\n       The Constitution reigns supreme. . . . My colleagues in the \n     Senate have an obligation to provide advice to the President \n     on nominees.\n\n  So I urge others to look at what the Congressman from Montana said, \nwhat the senior Senator from Maine said, and what Governor Christie \nsaid. I agree with them that the Constitution reigns supreme. It simply \nis saying to do your job, among other things.\n  In this situation there is no question what the Constitution mandates \nin times of Supreme Court vacancies. Article II, section 2 of our \nConstitution clearly outlines the President's legal authority to \nnominate Justices to the Supreme Court. It also defines the Senate's \nrole in the nomination, which is to provide advice and consent. By \ndenying their constitutional mandate, Republicans are refusing to do \ntheir job.\n  Senate Republicans should give President Obama's Supreme Court \nnominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote, because, as Governor Christie \nsaid, there is really no reason not to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/senate-section/article/S1106-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday marked the end of Black History \nMonth, which we honored here in the Senate by adopting a resolution \nsponsored by the junior Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand.\n  The father of Black History Month was Dr. Carter G. Woodson. Now, I \nreally didn't know who Carter Woodson was, but there was a wonderful \npiece on public radio yesterday that outlined in detail this man, who \nhad been a garbage man, who did menial labor, and I just didn't realize \nhow smart he was. His personal story is remarkable.\n  Carter Woodson was born in Virginia to former slaves. He attended the \nUniversity of Chicago--not an easy school to get into, certainly in the \nearly part of the last century, when you are an African American. He \nthen went on to receive his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1912, making him the \nsecond African-American man to do so.\n  As a professor at Howard University here in Washington, DC, Dr. \nWoodson decided there was a need for Americans--Black and White--to \nbetter understand African-American history. In 1926, Dr. Woodson \norganized the first week devoted entirely to African-American history. \nHe coordinated lectures, panels, and hosted children's plays that \ncelebrated the lives of important figures in Black history.\n  He had a tough time. They couldn't find places to meet. They wouldn't \nallow Blacks in many meeting halls. But he found rooms at the YMCA, \nchurches, and Black fraternity houses to meet and to celebrate African-\nAmerican history. He was relentless. Over the years, the celebration of \nBlack history grew and grew until President Ford decided to make it not \na history week but a history month. He did that in 1976. So February is \nalways recognized--since President Ford did that in 1976--as Black \nHistory Month.\n  In addition to adopting this resolution to honor Black History Month, \nI hope my colleagues will take a moment to think about this great man, \nDr. Woodson, who did so much to help Americans embrace Black history \nand the many contributions of African-American leaders, such as \nFrederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, W.E.B. Du Bois, and many others.\n  But we must do more than just adopt a simple resolution honoring \nBlack History Month. We should work together to address the issues \nfaced by Black Americans and all Americans today and every month of the \nyear. It is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I see my friends on the floor. Would the Chair \nannounce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/senate-section/article/S1106-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 524, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to \n     authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the \n     national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin \n     use.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, known as CARA, of which I am \nproud to be a cosponsor. I want to begin by commending Senators \nWhitehouse and Portman for crafting this vitally important bill and \nalso to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for their \nleadership in the Judiciary Committee.\n  The heroin and opioid crisis in this country is devastating to far \ntoo many families, including those in my State of Maine. This epidemic \ncan be seen in emergency rooms, local jails, on Main Streets, and in \nhomes throughout our country.\n  In 2014, there were a record 208 overdose deaths in the State of \nMaine, including 57 caused by heroin, and the problem is only getting \nworse. Last year, in the city of Portland, ME, 14 people overdosed in \njust 1 day. Two of them died as a result of those overdoses.\n  This last weekend, the Bangor Daily News had a special segment of the\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\npaper that chronicled the vivid and tragic story of a young man, \nGarrett Brown, whose spiral into addiction ultimately resulted in his \ndeath from a heroin overdose.\n  This epidemic is also having tragic effects on the most vulnerable in \nour society--the children and babies born to addicts. Last year in \nMaine nearly 1,000 babies were born drug-affected. That is about 8 \npercent of all births in our State. I have seen the videos of these \nbabies in the neonatal intensive care unit. They are inconsolable. It \nis so tragic to watch them. Fortunately, the physicians and other \nhealth care providers in Maine have become very good at treating these \nbabies, but I wonder what happens to them when they go back to their \naddicted mothers or fathers.\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act takes the kind of \nmultifaceted approach needed to address this epidemic. I have said we \nneed a three-pronged approach.\n  First, we need to focus on education and prevention. That is \neducation of the public at large, particularly our school children, but \nit is also education of health care providers and of law enforcement as \nwell. I remember vividly when I was a young student sitting through a \npresentation by a recovered heroin addict. I don't know if that is done \nanymore in our schools, but I can tell you it had a marked impact on \nall of us who listened to him. None of us ever would have wanted to be \nin the position in which he found himself as he struggled to recover \nfrom his addiction. I don't understand how heroin has lost its stigma, \nbut it clearly has, and it is creating tragic results for our country. \nSo education and prevention are critical.\n  Second is law enforcement. We need to do a better job of helping law \nenforcement. I have had so many sheriffs tell me we cannot arrest our \nway out of this epidemic. We need to connect people who voluntarily \ncome into our jails, and we need to connect them to treatment. \nUnfortunately, there aren't enough treatment facilities or guidance \ncounselors or substance abuse experts or physicians and nurses and \nothers with this expertise in many rural areas of our country, \nparticularly in States like Maine, and I suspect in urban areas like \nChicago where the service providers are overwhelmed with the number of \npeople who need help. There has been a tripling of people in Maine who \nneed help.\n  Law enforcement has another critical role; that is, to work to \ninterdict the heroin that is coming into the State of Maine--whether it \noriginates in other States, or through ties to cities in Connecticut \nand Massachusetts, where inner-city gangs are bringing heroin into \nMaine and swapping it for guns. There is this trafficking that is going \non where addicts with no records are being used as straw buyers, buying \nguns for the gang members who then exchange the heroin for these \nweapons. We need to have a greater effort to keep heroin out of our \ncountry when it is coming from those international cartels in Mexico as \ndocumented by the Portland Press Herald's excellent investigation into \nthis matter.\n  Of course, the third prong is treatment. We need more treatment \nfacilities. We need the ability of not just paramedics but law \nenforcement to administer the drug Narcan, which can reverse the \neffects of overdoses if it is administered in time.\n  The bill before us takes that kind of multifaceted approach. It \nincludes strengthening treatment programs, supporting law enforcement, \nand increasing education and prevention efforts. It would encourage \nStates and communities to expand these efforts and to increase \nevidence-based treatments for substance abuse disorders. It would \nauthorize heroin and methamphetamine task forces to support safe law \nenforcement agencies, and it provides grants for communities facing \ndrug crises. This crisis is by no means confined to the cities in our \nStates. It is in the most rural areas imaginable in my State. It \naffects suburbia, and it affects neighborhoods throughout our country.\n  Part of the solution to this crisis includes examining pain \nmanagement and prescribing practices. I have heard from Maine families, \nfrom physicians, and from law enforcement about a disturbing pattern of \na significant percentage of individuals using heroin after abusing \nlegal opioid medications. According to a recent report from the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, prescription \nopioid abuse does indeed put individuals at a much higher risk of \nheroin use. In fact, nearly 80 percent of individuals using heroin \nreported that they began on their road to addiction by abusing \nprescription pain medications.\n  CARA would create a task force to review, modify, and update best \npractices for pain management and prescribing pain medication. It would \nalso expand the disposal sites for unwanted prescriptions through drug \ntake-back programs, which is an important way for individuals to safely \nand securely dispose of their unused prescription drugs. I have long \nbeen a supporter of drug take-back programs, which have prevented tons \nof unused, unneeded or expired drugs from falling into the hands of \nchildren or drug dealers. At Maine's most recent drug take-back day, \nauthorities safely disposed of nearly 10 tons of unused drugs. Think \nabout that. In a State of just 1.3 million people, in just one of these \ndrug take-back days, 10 tons of unused drugs were collected and safely \ndisposed of. The bill would also authorize grants for strengthening \nState prescription drug monitoring programs to help prevent doctor \nshopping.\n  I have great sympathy for our county sheriffs who have talked to me \nabout this problem. They tell me their jails are overwhelmed by those \nwho are struggling with addiction. Jails are not designed to take the \nplace of treatment centers. Yet sheriffs and police chiefs must train \ntheir officers to look for signs of withdrawal and to monitor mental \nhealth status. CARA would establish a demonstration program to help \nidentify addicted individuals who may benefit more from treatment than \nincarceration.\n  Funding would also be authorized to purchase and train first \nresponders in the use of Narcan, a drug that as I mentioned can reverse \nthe effects of an overdose if administered in time, and a portion of \nthis funding is designated to support rural areas in our country.\n  There have been many discussions in this Chamber, in our committees, \nand in our caucuses about the heroin crisis. Last December, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee on which I serve held a \nhearing to examine prescribing practices, expanding access to addiction \ntreatment, reducing overdoses, and partnering with law enforcement.\n  Just last week, the Special Committee on Aging--which I have the \nprivilege to chair--examined opiate use among seniors and other \nMedicare participants, the potential for diversion of powerful pain \nkillers and Medicare reimbursement policies that may penalize \nphysicians who, in their best medical judgment, decide not to prescribe \npowerful opiate pain killers and instead provide other kinds of pain \nrelief for their patients. Yet because of the way the surveys are \nworded, under the Medicare patient satisfaction program, their \nhospitals can actually lose reimbursement if it is found that a patient \nwas not satisfied enough with control of their pain. Clearly, pain does \nneed to be managed, but these questions are so biased in the way they \nare asked that they invite overprescription and the prescription of \npowerful pain killers when they may not be needed. I am not talking \nabout individuals with cancer or end-of-life conditions for whom opiate \npain killers may be exactly what is needed to relieve their pain, but \nwe know there are better alternatives for many people who do not need \nthat kind of pain relief. I am working with Senator Lankford, Senator \nDonnelly, Senator Casey, and others to see if we can come up with an \namendment to this bill on this issue.\n  It is clear we need to take a comprehensive approach to this \nepidemic, and the bill before us is a vital step forward. It recognizes \nopioid and heroin abuse for the public health crisis that it has \nbecome, and it offers meaningful and effective ways to support \ncommunities seeking to expand treatment prevention, law enforcement, \nand recovery efforts.\n  Again, I salute the sponsors of this legislation. I am pleased to be \na cosponsor, and I urge all of our colleagues to come together to \nsupport this much needed bill.\n  My thanks to my colleague from Illinois for deferring to me.\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I speak on a separate issue, I \nwould like to address the issue raised by the Senator from Maine.\n  Her experience in Maine is exactly the same as my experience in \nIllinois. There is no town too small, no suburb too wealthy not to have \nbeen touched by heroin overdoses and deaths. It is interesting--the \nSenator may be encouraged to know that in one small town in downstate \nIllinois, when they were desperate when two or three teenagers died in \n1 week in a small town, they heard about a program in Gloucester, MA, \nwhere the chief of police, reacting to what the Senator said earlier, \nrealized that we just can't keep arresting addicts. It is not working.\n  He announced that if someone who was addicted came into the sheriff's \noffice or the police department and reported their addiction, they \nwouldn't arrest them; they would take them to a treatment center \nimmediately. The next day, 27 teenagers showed up in this small town in \ndownstate Illinois. Then, of course, the challenge was where to take \nthem. In rural areas, it is a long drive. Some of them were not in good \nshape for a drive. But they went into treatment.\n  What they told me after I visited the town was that something \nhappened immediately: The jail was empty because the jail had been \nfilled with petty criminals who had been stealing, burglarizing, trying \nto feed their habits. Now they were in rehab. So it made it a safer \ncommunity and at least gave them a chance to straighten out their \nlives.\n  One of the amendments I am offering with your colleague from Maine is \nabout treatment. We decided a number of years ago, for fear that we \nwould be warehousing patients, to limit substance abuse treatment \nfacilities under Medicaid to no more than 16 beds. Sixteen beds may \nwork in a rural area; it certainly doesn't work in the city of Chicago. \nWe are not expanding it dramatically, but we allow treatment facilities \nto have up to 40 beds for residential treatment for substance abuse. We \ndon't want to go back into the bad old days of warehousing, but we \ncertainly want to expand treatment because the problem you have seen \nand I have seen is growing.\n  As you noted, if we don't move quickly on treatment, we can't expect \nto turn it around. I thank the Senator for bringing this to our \nattention. The bill before us truly is a bipartisan bill, and it should \nbe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 1 week ago the Republican majority leader \nmade an announcement that stunned a lot of observers on Capitol Hill. \nSenator McConnell said that the Senate Republicans would basically turn \ntheir backs on what I consider to be a constitutional responsibility \nand that they would refuse to consider the nomination to fill the \nvacancy of Justice Scalia, who recently passed away.\n  In article II, section 2 of the Constitution, the Founding Fathers \nestablished a very clear process for appointing Supreme Court Justices. \nUnder the Constitution, the President ``shall nominate, and by and with \nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the \nsupreme Court.'' That is the language of the Constitution. It is \nexplicit.\n  The President has a constitutional obligation to send a Supreme Court \nnominee to the Senate, and the Senate has a constitutional obligation \nto consider the nominee. But the majority leader for the Republicans \nsaid last week that he would not give any consideration to a nominee \nsent by President Obama--not a hearing, not a vote--and then he went so \nfar as to say he will not even meet with that nominee. This is a \nstunning abdication of the Senate's constitutional responsibility. All \nof us, as Senators, walk down this aisle, stand over to the side, raise \nour right hands, and swear to support and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States and to bear true faith and allegiance to it. It is an \noath each of us takes very seriously.\n  The majority leader has tried to justify his decision by noting that \nthis is an election year. Well, it turns out it doesn't take much \nconstitutional study to realize that the Constitution applies to \nelection years as well as every other year. There is nothing in the \nConstitution that directs the President or the Senate to ignore their \nresponsibility when there is a political Presidential campaign \nunderway. I have searched the Constitution. There is no reference \nwhatsoever to a Presidential campaign year absolving either the \nPresident or the Senate from their constitutional obligations.\n  One of the great ironies of the decision by the Senate Republican \nleadership was the way they reached it. Shortly after Justice Scalia \npassed away, Majority Leader McConnell issued a statement saying: ``The \nAmerican people should have a voice in the selection of their next \nSupreme Court Justice.'' Then last Tuesday he summoned the Republican \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee to his office, and there he \ndecided with them that they would deprive the American people of a \nchance to view a hearing on President Obama's nominee to fill the \nScalia vacancy. This is an unprecedented obstruction of a Supreme Court \nnominee, and this decision to obstruct certainly wasn't made by the \nAmerican people. It was a unilateral, partisan decision made by a \nhandful of Senators behind closed doors. The Republican Senators didn't \nbring their decision out into the open, not to a hearing of the \nJudiciary Committee, which they chair; they did it quietly behind \nclosed doors.\n  But the American people heard what happened. Last Friday a letter was \nsent to the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee by the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights and 81 other \nnational organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman,\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Michael Lee,\n     Hon. Ted Cruz,\n     Hon. Jeff Flake,\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     Hon. David Perdue,\n     Hon. Thom Tillis,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you \n     to reconsider your unprecedented and destructive refusal to \n     give fair consideration to any Supreme Court nomination until \n     after the next President is sworn into office on January 20, \n     2017, as announced in your February 23rd letter to Senate \n     Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n       Your letter claims that your refusal to hold a hearing on--\n     or to even meet with--any potential nominee is part and \n     parcel to executing your ``constitutional authority to \n     withhold consent on any nominee.'' This is a clear perversion \n     of your constitutional duties as understood by almost every \n     scholarly authority on the topic and by most Americans.\n       It is a dereliction of your constitutional duty to handcuff \n     the Supreme Court for two terms. Your proposed course of \n     action would cause a constitutional crisis that would shake \n     the very foundation of our democracy.\n       We condemn this unprecedented overreach, and call on you to \n     uphold the Constitution by giving fair consideration, \n     including timely hearings and votes, to the next nominee to \n     the Supreme Court.\n       Under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the \n     President shall nominate a Justice to the Supreme Court ``by \n     and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.'' This does \n     not give a select few senators veto power over the \n     President's role in selecting and nominating a candidate. The \n     Senate's duty is to evaluate a nominee's fitness and \n     qualifications, not to pick the President making the \n     nomination.\n       Our legal system is based on the rule of law and requires \n     stability and certainty. The course you have charted would \n     mean that a new justice would not be confirmed until well \n     into 2017 at the earliest. Shackling the court for two terms \n     would undermine the rule of law, leave legal questions \n     unresolved, and hamper the administration of justice across \n     our nation.\n       Refusing to consider any nominee, without due evaluation of \n     his or her merits, credentials, and experiences, is a direct \n     repudiation of your constitutional duties.\n       We believe in upholding the Constitution. So should you.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Philip \n     Randolph Institute; AFL-CIO; African American Ministers In \n     Action; Alliance for Justice; American Association for \n     Access, Equity and Diversity; American Association For \n     Justice; American\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\n     Family Voices; American Federation of State, County, and \n     Municipal Employees; American Federation of Teachers; \n     American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee; Americans for \n     Democratic Action (ADA); Americans United for Change; Andrew \n     Goodman Foundation; Asian & Pacific Islander American Health \n     Forum; Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund \n     (AALDEF); Asian Americans Advancing Justice/AAJC; Asian \n     Pacific American Labor Alliance, AFL-CIO (APALA); Association \n     of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO); \n     Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Bend the Arc Jewish Action; Center for American Progress; \n     Center for Community Change; Center for Pan Asian Community \n     Services, Inc.

The letter described the Republicans' obstruction as ``a \nclear perversion of your constitutional duties as understood by almost \nevery scholarly authority on the topic and by most Americans.'' The \nletter said that the Constitution ``does not give a select few Senators \nveto power over the President's role in selecting and nominating a \ncandidate. The Senate's duty is to evaluate a nominee's fitness and \nqualifications, not to pick the President making the nomination.''\n  I agree with that statement. By unilaterally refusing to give any \nconsideration to any nominee made by this President, Senate Republicans \nare trying to stop this President from fulfilling his constitutional \nresponsibility to nominate and appoint Supreme Court Justices under \narticle II, section 2. They did it in secret in a back room, behind \nclosed doors. Why are they so afraid to give President Obama's nominee \na fair hearing? Are they concerned that if the nominee is well \nqualified and they turn that person down, it will reflect poorly on the \nSenate Republicans?\n  The Senate Republican process of secrecy and obstruction is \ninconsistent with the Constitution. It does a disservice to the Supreme \nCourt, to the President, and to the American people.\n  I raised a point last week which is worth returning to. The argument \nis made that the next President should pick the nominee to fill this \nvacancy. The argument is made that the American people, when they \nselect the next President in November of this year--that we will be \nsaying to the American people: You make the choice. You select the \nPresident. And then you will know the Supreme Court nominee.\n  Well, there may be some logic to that but for one thing: We have a \nPresident. He was elected in 2012 with a 5 million-vote majority. This \nis the fourth year of his Presidency.\n  When you listen to the Republicans argue, you would think, wait a \nminute, Barack Obama was not elected for 4 years, only for 3 years and \n2 months. They argue at this point in time that this President does not \nhave the constitutional authority or responsibility to fill the vacancy \nof Justice Scalia. The American people spoke. It wasn't all that close. \nBy a margin of 5 million votes, they chose this President for 4 years, \nnot for 3 years or 3 years and 2 months. He is the President, he has \nthe authority of the Presidency, and he has that authority not given to \nhim by God but by the American people. It is authority which should not \nbe taken away by the Republican majority of the Senate.\n  Their argument, ``Wait for the next election''--do you know what that \nmeans? It means that if they have their way, if they fail to do their \njob, if they don't even have a hearing for President Obama's nominee, \ndon't even bring it to a vote, and the vacancy continues on the Supreme \nCourt, it will be historic. The last time we will have left a vacancy \nof this duration on the Supreme Court dates back to the Civil War. A \nnation at war with itself left a vacancy for more than a year on the \nSupreme Court. Now the Senate Republicans of 2016 want to leave a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court for over a year. There is no need for it, \nand the Constitution certainly makes it clear how this vacancy should \nbe filled.\n  There is no secret that there is a political motive. The Senate \nRepublicans hope Justice Scalia's seat will be filled by a person they \nchoose. This is a political calculation they are willing to make, to \ntake the heat for not following their constitutional responsibility in \nthe hopes that a President Trump will pick someone to fill this vacancy \nor some other Republican President in the future. That is what they are \ncounting on. That is political.\n  Politics shouldn't trump the Constitution. Nothing should trump the \nConstitution when it comes to governing the United States. Because it \nis an election year doesn't mean Senators can take a yearlong break and \nignore their own oath of office.\n  It is time for the Senate Republicans to do their job. The President \nand the Senate must fulfill their constitutional responsibility in \ntimes of war, in economic depression, and even in an election year.\n  Last week Majority Leader McConnell reportedly told a group of House \nRepublicans that there isn't ``a snowball's chance in hell'' that he \nwould back down from his plan of obstruction. Nevertheless, today \nPresident Obama has invited Majority Leader McConnell to meet with him \nin the White House to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy. They have also \ninvited the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nGrassley; the ranking Democrat, Senator Leahy; and the minority leader \nof the Senate, Senator Reid.\n  Why did the President offer this meeting? Because that is what always \nhappens. When a President is about to consider filling such a historic \nvacancy, he brings together the leaders of the Senate to discuss his \nthought process and perhaps to solicit names from them of potential \nnominees. Even when we have disagreed in the past and have Presidents \nand Senators from different political parties, they still extended that \ncourtesy to one another. President Obama is extending the majority \nleader that courtesy even if the majority leader has made it clear and \npublicly stated repeatedly that he will not even meet with, let alone \nconsider, the President's nominee.\n  The President is setting a good example of what should be done in \nthis circumstance where the President follows tradition and the \nConstitution. I am glad the President is taking this seriously. I know \nhe is in the midst of a careful, deliberative process to choose a \nnominee. The President should select an outstanding person who has the \nqualifications, a commitment to justice, a deep respect for the role of \nthe judiciary, and life experience that points toward integrity and \ngood judgment.\n  The President is doing his job as the Constitution requires. My \nRepublican colleagues in the Senate should do their job as well. They \nshould honor the process established in the Constitution and give the \nPresident's nominee fair consideration, a hearing, and a vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate unanimously voted to \nadvance consideration of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, \ncommonly known as CARA, and that is because this legislation gets at a \nbig problem. The abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers is \ndevastating families and communities across the country, including \nTexas. The truth is, the problem is getting worse, not better. Deaths \ndue to heroin and prescription drug overdoses have even surpassed car \naccidents as the No. 1 cause of injury-related deaths nationwide.\n  It is time for Congress to do something significant to address this \ndisturbing trend. This bill is a good example of how Republicans and \nDemocrats, working on a bipartisan basis, can zero in on a problem that \nis harming our Nation and work together to address it.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work on this bill and to voting on amendments that will \nactually improve it. Speaking of amendments, while this bill touches on \nhow to battle drug addiction in this country, we need to do more to cut \nthese drugs off at the source and keep them from getting into our \ncountry in the first place.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee recently heard about the supply \nside of this equation--this primarily goes to the heroin coming from \nMexico--when they heard testimony from the Director of National \nIntelligence, James Clapper. In his testimony, Director Clapper talked \nabout how Mexico has ramped up the production of heroin in response to \nthis growing demand in the United States.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is also from a border State and has had \nfrequent conversations with our Mexican counterparts. When we complain \nabout the supply, they usually turn it on me and say: Well, what about \nthe demand in the United States? The truth is, we have to get at both \ncomponents--both the supply and demand.\n  In 2014, drug cartels smuggled more than a quarter of a million \npounds of heroin across our borders. This was done by the same \ntransnational criminal organizations that traffic human beings for sex \nor forced labor and who man the illegal immigration pipelines into our \ncountry. This is no longer a mom-and-pop operation. These are major \ncriminal networks and organizations that will do anything for money \nand, of course, are happy to make money from the heroin that comes \nacross our border.\n  If we are going to make significant strides in the fight against \naddiction and drug abuse, we need to take a critical look at where the \ndrugs are coming from and consider the strategies we can employ to keep \nthem from even coming onto our soil. Unfortunately, even while the \nproduction and demand of these illegal drugs have been growing, we have \nnot done enough to combat it.\n  Earlier I mentioned that the U.S. Southern Command--that is the \ncombatant command for the U.S. military that is south of Mexico and \ngoes into Central and South America--has been given zero Navy ships to \nconduct counter-trafficking missions, and that is because our Navy \nfleet is simply too small and these resources have been diverted \nelsewhere to counter the growing threats around the world. It is \nirresponsible to ignore the transnational criminal threats in our own \nbackyard. We need a strategy to interdict drug shipments and cut them \noff before they reach our shores, so I have submitted several \namendments that would help focus our resources to interdict these \nshipments and to help stem the growing tide of illicit drugs entering \nthe U.S. market.\n\n  One amendment would simply require the Defense Department, when it \nallocates funding to the States for the National Guard Counterdrug \nProgram, to prioritize drug interdiction. More effectively using the \nNational Guard's military capabilities to help interdict drug flows \nwould provide a needed boost to law enforcement and counternarcotics \nefforts, especially on our southern border. Too often, law enforcement \nagencies have been left with scant resources to handle this growing \nproblem, so this amendment would allow the National Guard to play a \nbigger role in drug interdiction.\n  Another amendment I have submitted would require the President to \ncreate a plan--a strategy, really--to increase interdiction of illegal \ndrugs that enter across the southwest border. It would require the \ninterdiction goal of 90 percent of those drugs, which would be a great \nleap forward from the current levels.\n  Last year, General Kelly, then the commander of Southern Command, \nestimated that only 15 to 20 percent of drugs bound for the United \nStates were interdicted, just 15 percent to 20 percent. General Kelly \nsaid that, due to a lack of resources in the Southern Command, \nbasically many times they were relegated to being observers as illegal \ndrugs would transit across their area of operation.\n  Given our shortfall here, it is pretty amazing that a comprehensive \nplan across all relevant agencies doesn't already exist. It is shocking \nreally. This amendment would make sure that one is created to boost the \namount of drugs that we successfully interdict. It would also require \nthe President to submit this plan to Congress so we can have a \nconversation between the executive branch and the legislative branch \nand so the American people could review it, could hold us accountable, \nand to make sure we are making progress on this front.\n  Finally, I have submitted an amendment to strengthen the High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area Program. This would help Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officials use task force funding to \nimplement a multidisciplinary heroin response strategy. This has been \ntested in several high-intensity drug trafficking areas with great \nsuccess. This amendment would help implement this strategy nationwide, \ngiving law enforcement additional tools to combat the growing threat of \nheroin from both the supply and demand side.\n  Mr. President, I am glad we are making some progress on this \nlegislation. I am optimistic that we will be able to complete it this \nweek in a bipartisan fashion, which is the only way you get these done \naround here. We desperately need to target the opioid epidemic \nhappening across the Nation, and we also need to cut off as much of the \nsupply of the cheap heroin as we can. When people can't get access to \nprescription drugs, too often they turn to cheap heroin, and that is \nwhy the supply issue is so important. But we need both pieces in order \nto make real progress and restore our communities currently plagued by \naddiction and drug abuse.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This is \na bill that we have been working on for 2 years--Senator Portman, \nSenator Whitehouse, and Senator Klobuchar. I thank them for their \npartnership and leadership on this bill. This is something the four of \nus got together on because we saw in our own States the public health \nepidemic that was happening with our constituents: individuals \nstruggling with addiction, people who were addicted to prescription \ndrugs and overusing and misusing prescription drugs, and then with the \nprice of heroin on our streets so low that people are turning to heroin \nand also a combination of heroin and a deadly drug called fentanyl.\n  I thank Senators Portman, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar for the work we \nhave been doing together over the last several years on this bill to \nsee this bill come to this Senate floor. This is a very important piece \nof legislation and will help us address the public health epidemic \nfacing my home State of New Hampshire and this country. This is \nsomething I have come to the floor about on several occasions before.\n  Traveling around my State, I can't tell you the number of stories I \nhave heard from people in New Hampshire about what we are facing and \nthe number of lives that are lost, the number of lives that are \ndevastated by heroin and fentanyl and misuse of prescription drugs.\n  This is a life-or-death issue in my State. The number of drug \noverdose deaths has been staggering. Before I came to the Senate, I \nserved as attorney general of our State, and so I\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\nworked with law enforcement on these issues, whether it was \nmethamphetamine, cocaine, or other illegal drugs, but I have never seen \nanything like this. As of last week, the chief medical examiner's \noffice had recorded that there were 420 drug deaths in 2015, and that \nwas a dramatic increase in New Hampshire from the year before. The year \nbefore, we had about 320 drug deaths. So this is more than one person \ndying a day in my State. Many more than die in traffic accidents are \ndying from drug overdoses, and it is a combination, again, the driver \nof this--heroin and Fentanyl. Fentanyl is 40 to 50 percent times more \npowerful than heroin, and when the drug dealers mix it up with the \nheroin, it is a killer.\n  As Eric Spofford told me--he is an incredible guy who is in recovery \nand has opened treatment facilities in our State. He got it right when \nhe said fentanyl is a serial killer because that is what it is.\n  In the month of February alone, there were 14 suspected opioid \noverdose deaths just in the city of Manchester--14 in just one city in \nmy State. That is a record high in Manchester, NH. These are not just \nnumbers that we are talking about. Behind every statistic is a life, a \nlife that is taken from us far too soon and has been tragically lost--a \nmother, a daughter, a son, a brother, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker. \nThis hits all of us, and these are people who are being lost from this \nhorrible epidemic.\n  Behind the statistics and behind the headlines we see every day in \nthe news, there are family members, friends, and communities that have \nbeen deeply impacted by this public health crisis, such as the mother \nfrom Greenville, NH, who wrote to me. She spends her days actually \ndoing incredibly important work, helping people who are struggling with \naddiction. She helps them, and yet she has been coming home to see her \nown son struggling with heroin. She told me, ``As I tried to comfort \nthose who have been affected by this tragedy, I think that my son will \nbe next.''\n  In Laconia, a man helps those struggling to get treatment, but he \nfeels helpless when they are faced with a 5-month waiting period for a \nrehabilitation facility. He wrote, ``In 5 months, these individuals may \nbe dead.''\n  A parent from Salem, NH, contacted me and told me her son is \nstruggling with heroin addiction, and she needs help finding a \ntreatment program for him since she could not afford to pay for \ntreatment herself. Parents don't know where to go.\n  I have met many parents who want to get help for their kids, and they \nare having a hard time finding a place and knowing where to go. Another \nmother of three children had to revive her son from an overdose before \nthe paramedics could arrive.\n  The Griffin family from Newton, whom I have gotten to know well, lost \ntheir beautiful 20-year-old daughter Courtney to an overdose. Now, \nCourtney's father Doug and Courtney's mother Pam have made it their \nmission to bring awareness to this issue and to make sure that others \ndon't suffer from the same tragedy they have suffered in the lost life \nof a beautiful young woman named Courtney, who had so much of life \nbefore her and so much potential. Doug and Pam and so many other \ndedicated people in New Hampshire are working tirelessly to turn the \ntide against this epidemic.\n  Over the past 2 years, I made it a priority to travel the State and \nhear from our public safety community, treatment providers, addiction \nexperts, families, and individuals in recovery about finding effective \nstrategies to address this problem. On ride-alongs with the police and \nfire, I have been to overdoses. I have seen them bring people back to \nlife, administering Narcan only to say that they face this every single \nday. If we don't focus on prevention and we don't focus on treatment, \nand the important work that our first responders are doing, then we are \nnot going to get at this problem and make sure people who are \nstruggling get out of this cycle of addiction.\n  Treatment facilities in New Hampshire are certainly working \ntirelessly, and individuals are stepping up to expand our capacity in \nNew Hampshire to support individuals who need help, and they need more \nsupport. I want to take a moment to recognize some of their hard work. \nAmong so many others, I am grateful that there are so many working hard \ntogether in New Hampshire: Hope for New Hampshire Recovery, Families in \nTransition Willows Program, the Farnum Center, Westbridge Community \nServices in Manchester, GateHouse Sober Community in Nashua, Hope on \nHaven Hill, Bonfire Recovery Services in Dover, The Granite House in \nDerry, and the New Freedom Academy in Canterbury. I have met many \nincredible people who are dedicating their lives to this.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit these facilities and hear \ndirectly from the dedicated professionals who work there. They do \ncritically important work. You have average people coming together, \nwhether to organize a 5K race or to gain resources and support for \npeople who are on the frontlines. This is what those who are on the \nfrontlines are saying: Tackling this epidemic and reversing the tide of \naddiction will take a comprehensive, thoughtful approach, and include \nstrategies for treatment, prevention, education, support for \nindividuals in recovery, and interdiction. That is why we have to pass \nCARA.\n  CARA is important because it embodies the comprehensive approach that \nso many in my State have told me they need. Here is what it looks like. \nIt gives more support to first responders and law enforcement, \nexpanding the availability of lifesaving drugs like Narcan, which our \nfirst responders are using every day. And because CARA will help make \nthis happen, it has been endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of \nPolice, National District Attorneys Association, and National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, including New Hampshire's own \nattorney general, Joe Foster.\n  It strengthens prescription drug monitoring programs to help prevent \n``doctor shopping.'' This is something I have been advocating for since \nI was attorney general of our State so that our public health officials \ncan have the tools--because we know from SAMHSA research that four out \nof five people started by misusing or overusing prescription drugs and \ntransferred to heroin. So this is critical.\n  It increases access to treatment, including evidence-based medication \nassisted treatment, which can help people have more access. We need to \nturn the tide. Over 130 stakeholder groups have gotten behind this \nlegislation, groups that are on the frontline of this issue. Just to \nname some of them, it has been endorsed by the National Council for \nBehavioral Health, American Psychological Association, American Society \nof Addiction Medicine, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, Harm \nReduction Coalition, Faces and Voices of Recovery, Mental Health \nAmerica, Young People in Recovery, National Association of State \nAlcohol and Substance Abuse Directors, among many others. I thank these \ngroups for their feedback.\n  It would support additional resources to identify and treat \nincarcerated individuals suffering from substance abuse disorders and \nexpand prevention. It is so important we address prevention.\n  It would establish a campaign to bring greater awareness to the \nassociation between the overuse and misuse of prescription drugs and \nwhat happens as people misuse prescription drugs and then go to heroin \nand deadly drugs like fentanyl.\n  This bill has overwhelming bipartisan support. It has 42 bipartisan \nco-sponsors.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor. I want to thank \nher for her sponsorship of this legislation. This crisis does not \ndiscriminate. It doesn't care. Heroin, fentanyl--the devastating impact \nof this drug does not care whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, an \nIndependent, whatever your background.\n  This is something that affects all of us. A high school student from \nManchester who wrote to me, sharing how concerned he is about the \nnegative impact this epidemic is having on his city. When he walks home \nfrom school, he sometimes sees discarded needles on the sidewalk, and \ntragically he lost his best friend to a fentanyl overdose.\n  Abi, who lives in the Seacoast Region, struggled with an opioid use \ndisorder through her pregnancy until she was finally able to receive \nhelp and treatment and enter recovery. I met Abi, and I am so inspired \nby her because she shows us we can make a difference and we can turn \nthis around.\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\n  A woman in Londonderry, who spoke to me at a community forum, was \nterrified her brother would suffer a reoccurrence as soon as he was \nreleased from prison because he wasn't getting treatment. She was \nworried about his path to a successful life because he was still \nsuffering from a substance abuse disorder.\n  Then there is Angela from Nashua, who has turned her story into a \nrallying cry for others. Angela lost her mother to a heroin overdose 17 \nyears ago and has adopted the children of several of her aunts and \ncousins who have lost their battles with addiction. After all of this, \nAngela's son and his girlfriend have become addicted to opioids and his \ngirlfriend overdosed in Angela's home. Her son is still battling with \nheroin addiction.\n  There are so many groups that are working to support these \nindividuals and we need to give them our support. They cannot and \nshould not have to do this alone.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire on the floor. \nI really appreciate her leadership on this issue. I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Shaheen's standalone legislation which would provide emergency \nappropriations in order to combat the heroin and prescription opioid \ncrisis facing our State. In fact, she and I have both written to Health \nand Human Services and asked them to designate this as a public health \nemergency. We have seen the impact on our State and we have seen the \nlives that are being lost and impacted by this. So I am going to be \ncosponsoring Senator Shaheen's amendment to CARA and supporting it on \nthe floor. I very much support her getting a vote on this amendment, \nand I hope that happens.\n  In addition, I appreciate that the President has put in additional \nresources in his budget to address this issue. This is an issue that we \nall have to work together on.\n  At the end of the year, there was also important funding that was \npassed that CARA would provide a very important framework for. Last \nyear during the appropriations process, Congress worked to increase by \n284 percent funding for programs at CDC and SAMHSA related to combating \nopioid abuse. While this is a positive step forward, these dollars \nactually haven't been distributed yet. It is important we pass CARA to \nmake sure that as we go forward with the dollars that have already been \nappropriated and as we go forward in the appropriations process this \nyear, that we have the framework to properly redirect this funding for \nprevention, treatment, and first responders, to make sure we have the \nfeedback of 130 stakeholder groups and law enforcement throughout the \ncountry and to ensure that these dollars are appropriately spent to \naddress the epidemic we are facing.\n  I have been honored to work over the last several years, again, with \nSenators Portman, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar in introducing this bill. \nIn fact, I also thank the head of drug policy in the administration, \nDirector Botticelli. He summed it up well when we asked him what he \nthought about CARA. He said in a hearing before the Judiciary Committee \nin January:\n\n       There is clear evidence that a comprehensive response \n     looking at multidimensional aspects of this that are embedded \n     in the CARA Act are tremendously important. We know we need \n     to do more, and I think that all of those components put \n     forward in this bill are critically important to making \n     headway in terms of this epidemic.\n\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act would be a significant \nstep forward in a Federal response to this public health epidemic that \nis facing New Hampshire and so many other States in the country. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this critical legislation, to listen to the \npeople of New Hampshire and to the people of this country who are \nasking us to act.\n  This is what they are saying in New Hampshire.\n  In Center Barnstead: ``Please pass legislation to save my son's \nlife.''\n  In Manchester: ``I wake up every morning with a fear that I will find \nmy son dead. I am crying out for help.''\n  In Spofford: ``I want my voice to be heard so that no one else falls \nthrough the cracks.''\n  In Londonderry: ``Addiction can happen to anyone.''\n  In Tilton: ``We need action, and we need it right now.''\n  We have an opportunity on this floor right now, in this debate, with \nvery thoughtful legislation, very bipartisan legislation--the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--to take action now. We owe it \nto all those who have lost their lives, their families who have been \nimpacted, and those who are struggling with addiction. We owe it to the \nfirst responders in our community and to the people who are working \nhard to turn this around in New Hampshire and across this country. To \nall, I thank them for the incredible work they are doing.\n  We need to pass this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. \nThis bill will make a difference, and I believe it will help save lives \nin New Hampshire and across the country.\n  There is no doubt that passing this bill will make a difference. We \nwill all need to continue to do more. We will all need to continue to \nfight for more and more support through the appropriations process and \nany way we can. I intend to keep up this fight because I know lives are \non the line. I know this issue is impacting my State. I know that as I \ntalk to the mothers, the daughters, the fathers, the sons, the friends \nwho are telling me the stories of the people they have lost, that we \ncan turn this around. It is so important that we pass this legislation.\n  Again, I wish to thank my colleague from the State of New Hampshire \nfor her work on this.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 30 minutes, and I wonder if the Chair will advise me when I have \nabout 3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor and \nthe others who have spoken this morning so eloquently about the heroin \nand opioid epidemic that is ravaging families and communities in every \none of our States.\n  As Senator Ayotte said so well, we have seen in New Hampshire that we \nare at ground zero for this epidemic. In terms of the percentage of \npeople affected in New Hampshire, we are losing a higher percentage \nthan almost every State in the Nation. This is an issue we need to work \ntogether to address. I think we have to respond much more robustly than \nwe have done at the Federal level because this epidemic is becoming a \npandemic. It is affecting young and old, urban and rural, rich and \npoor, Whites and minorities.\n  As others have said, the Senate is now considering the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act or CARA. I want to congratulate the sponsors \nof the legislation because this is a good bipartisan bill. It is \nimportant as we look at what we need to do to address the epidemic we \nface.\n  In addition to the authorizations and the good work that is in the \nCARA legislation, we also need to provide the resources that law \nenforcement and health professionals who are on the frontlines of \ndealing with this crisis are going to need. Despite heroic efforts, law \nenforcement and treatment professionals are increasingly overwhelmed by \nthe sheer scope and scale of the opioid and heroin crisis. Everywhere I \ngo in New Hampshire, the lack of resources is abundantly clear. Our \ncommunities need additional funding--and they need it urgently.\n  So this is why I have submitted an amendment cosponsored by the \nauthor of CARA, Senator Whitehouse, and I am pleased my colleague from \nNew Hampshire has also joined in cosponsoring this amendment. This \namendment would provide $600 million in emergency funding for critical \nprograms that we know will help address this crisis.\n  I am on the floor to urge the majority leader and the leadership of \nthe Senate to allow a vote on this legislation because this is a \nnationwide emergency of the first order, and it is time for us in \nCongress to treat it like a nationwide emergency.\n  In 2014, more than 47,000 Americans died from lethal drug overdoses--\nmore fatalities than from car accidents. Each day 120 Americans die of \ndrug\n\n[[Page S1113]]\n\noverdoses--2 deaths every hour. In our State of New Hampshire, where we \nhave 1.3 million people, we are losing more than a person a day to drug \noverdose deaths.\n  Here we have a map of America that shows the increases in deaths from \ndrug overdoses. We can see in 2003 the majority of the map is lighter \ncolored, so it means it doesn't have the same number of deaths. In 2008 \nwe can see this dark red color which shows the deaths from drug \noverdoses increasing. Here, in 2014, we see the impact of those 47,000 \npeople lost.\n  The State of the Presiding Officer, like in New Hampshire, is at \nground zero in the State of Arizona. In West Virginia, in Tennessee, \nand in Kentucky, they are seeing the same dramatic increase in the \nnumber of deaths from drug overdoses. This chart represents overdose \ndeaths per 100,000 people. Again, it demonstrates how truly national in \nscope the crisis has become. No State is immune from the scourge.\n  Across the country, our communities are asking why this is happening. \nThey are asking why so many of our family members and neighbors are \noverdosing on these drugs. Sadly, as we have heard from people who have \nspoken on the floor, one of the primary reasons is because so many \npeople are becoming addicted to prescription opioid drugs, better known \nas painkillers. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for \nthese drugs--almost 1 for every American. That is more than enough to \ngive every American adult their own bottle of pills. During a 3-month \nstretch in 2015 in New Hampshire, 13 million doses of schedule II \npainkillers were dispensed at New Hampshire pharmacies in just one 3-\nmonth period--13 million pills in 3 months for a State with a \npopulation of 1.3 million, and nearly 80 percent of these prescriptions \nwere for heavy painkillers like oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl.\n  If we look, we can see how this graph dramatically tracks the \nincrease in drug prescribing and the number of deaths that resulted. \nThe number of drug overdose deaths has risen as opioid prescriptions \nhave increased. This orange line is the number of deaths. The green \nline is the number of prescriptions that are being written. We are \nmissing the data for the year 2012, but there is no doubt that those \ndeaths track the number of prescriptions for painkillers that are being \nwritten.\n  The National Institutes of Health have found that people who are \naddicted to opioid painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted \nto heroin. So when someone gets addicted to pain pills and can no \nlonger get prescriptions, they turn to drugs like heroin and fentanyl.\n  What I heard from law enforcement in New Hampshire and from the \nmedical community is that people turn to heroin because it is cheaper \nand easier to get than prescription drugs after they become addicted. \nOf course, we have seen that drug traffickers are taking advantage. \nThey are flooding our streets with these drugs. In many of our \ncommunities, that bag of heroin is cheaper than a six-pack of beer. Of \ncourse the end result is a staggering increase in overdose deaths, \nwhich we can see on this chart.\n  Again, in 2014, nearly 21,000 people died from opioid abuse. There \nwere more than 10,000 deaths from heroin. That is a 222-percent \nincrease from 2009 levels.\n  So we can see that these are opioid deaths, these are deaths from \ncocaine, and these are deaths from heroin. We can see the red line and \nthe green line have gone up dramatically.\n  A professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Brendan \nSaloner, describes opioid addiction as ``a chronic relapsing illness, \njust like diabetes.''\n  We know treatment is the only effective answer. Again, what I have \nheard from law enforcement in New Hampshire is that they know they \ncan't put drug users in jail. That is not the answer to deal with this \nchallenge. We need to put the bad guys in jail, but we need to provide \ntreatment to the people who need it because that is the only effective \nanswer. Unfortunately, it is a tragic reality that nationwide nearly 9 \nout of 10 people with substance use disorders don't receive treatment. \nThey are being turned away and denied treatment due to a chronic lack \nof resources.\n\n  My colleague from New Hampshire spoke very eloquently about some of \nthe people she heard from. We have heard from people in the same way in \nNew Hampshire. Of the 1.3 million people in our State, it is estimated \nthat 100,000 people--almost 10 percent--are currently seeking treatment \nfor substance use disorders. We are able to offer services to only a \nsmall fraction of that total.\n  Over the last decade the number of people admitted to State treatment \nprograms increased 90 percent for heroin use and 500 percent--500 \npercent--for prescription drug use, with the largest increases \noccurring in the past several years.\n  As we can see from this chart, lack of treatment is a national \nproblem: the darker the green, the more people in that State who are \nnot receiving treatment for addiction. Sadly, New Hampshire is a very \ndark green, as is Arizona, the Presiding Officer's State. You can see \nthis dark green line coming down the east coast and going up the west \ncoast.\n  In 2014, in Kentucky, 82,000 people needed addiction treatment but \nfailed to get it--in Tennessee, 116,000 people; in Arizona, 157,000; in \nNevada, 55,000; in North Carolina, 200,000 people. These are all people \nwho needed treatment who didn't get it. When people don't get \ntreatment, they are overdosing in overwhelming numbers.\n  Sadly, this map of the United States shows where the overdose death \nrates are the highest. Where the darkest colors are shown the death \nrates are greater than 19 per 100,000 of population. We can see many of \nthe same States, such as New Hampshire, that have the most difficulty \nin people finding treatment. Those are the States where we are finding \nthe highest death rates. In 2014 in Kentucky, 1,100 people died from a \ndrug overdose; in Tennessee, 1,200 people; in Arizona, 1,200 overdose \ndeaths; in Nevada, 500; and in North Carolina, 1,300.\n  In recent days I have had a chance to visit three treatment centers \nin my home State, Headrest in Lebanon, Serenity Place in Manchester, \nand Seacoast Youth Services in Seabrook. These treatment centers are \nstaffed by skilled, dedicated professionals. They are saving lives \nevery day, but they tell me that for every life they save, many more \nare being lost for lack of treatment capacity, lack of facilities, and \nlack of funding.\n  I had a chance on some of those visits to meet with some of the \npeople in recovery. I can remember one young man up in Lebanon at \nHeadrest who had been in and out of prison because of crimes committed \nwhen he was using. He said to me that it costs thousands of dollars to \nkeep someone in prison. The figure he used was $35,000. He said: Don't \nyou all know that it is cheaper to give somebody treatment? It is \nabsolutely more cost effective for us to provide treatment for people \nwho are in recovery, people who need help.\n  I heard from a young woman in Manchester who said that she had been \narrested for drug use. She said: I am not a criminal. My problem is I \nneed treatment to deal with these drugs.\n  Another young woman who was in her early twenties who had been in and \nout of the Manchester jail--the Valley Street jail--said: You know, \nthey don't provide treatment in the Valley Street jail. I learned when \nI got picked up that I don't tell them that I have a drug problem or \nthat I have mental health issues because if I do, they put me in the \nbubble where I get observed 24 hours a day, regardless of what I am \ndoing. What I need is treatment. I don't need to be in the bubble.\n  Well, that is why this supplemental amendment would increase \nresources for treatment and recovery--because the answer is treatment. \nOur amendment includes $300 million for the Substance Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Block Grant Program. This program is the premier Federal \ninitiative to boost State and local resources for prevention, \ntreatment, and recovery support. In 21 States this block grant program \nrepresents at least 75 percent of the State agency's substance abuse \nprevention budget. In some States, sadly, it is the only funding for \nsubstance abuse prevention. If we are going to get a handle on this \nproblem, we are going to have to provide some additional resources for \nthe treatment that these programs need. This funding will result in an \nimmediate increase in the number of addicted individuals who\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\nwill receive lifesaving treatment. It will also save taxpayer dollars \nin the future, just as I heard from that young man at Headrest, who \nsaid it is cheaper to provide treatment than to build prisons. He is \nabsolutely right.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that for every dollar \nspent on substance use disorder treatment programs there is a $4 to $7 \nreduction in the cost of drug-related crime. An outpatient treatment \nprogram can result in savings that exceed costs by a factor of 12 to 1.\n  I live in Stratford County in New Hampshire. It has used the modest \nfunding from this block grant program, the Substance Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Block Grant Program, to accomplish important things, \nincluding expanding the peer-based addiction recovery efforts and \nworking at schools to engage at-risk students in the middle school \nyears. If we can prevent addiction, that is obviously the best thing we \ncan do.\n  Unfortunately, many prevention and treatment efforts in Stratford \nCounty remain chronically underfunded. I recently learned about one \nlocal woman, a mother and waitress, who overdosed in front of her 2-\nyear-old child. Fortunately, she received inpatient treatment, and now \nshe is doing well. Others have not been so lucky. Like cities and \ncounties all across America, Stratford has a months-long waiting list \nfor those needing treatment. When people with substance use disorders \nare turned away, they remain on the streets--desperate, often \ncommitting crimes to support their addiction, always at constant risk \nof a lethal overdose.\n  Vice News in New Hampshire recently profiled the opioid epidemic. The \nreporter interviewed one desperate user who said this:\n\n       I tried to get help and stop, but at the treatment center \n     they said I would have to wait 3 months. I had to go to the \n     hospital and tell them I was going to kill myself just to get \n     admitted.\n\n  That should not happen in America.\n  Another critical tool in the effort to stem the tide of this crisis \nis prescription drug monitoring programs. These State-run programs \ncollect, monitor, and analyze electronically transmitted prescribing \nand dispensing data submitted by pharmacies and dispensing \npractitioners. We know that monitoring works. We have the data to show \nthat it works, but only half of the 50 States are receiving Federal \nsupport.\n  The emergency supplemental amendment would include $50 million for \nthe CDC to expand and bolster State drug monitoring programs. Our \namendment also allocates $10 million to improve access in high-risk \ncommunities to medication-assisted treatment services for heroin and \nprescription opioids because numerous studies have shown the \neffectiveness in including medication in the treatment of some \nindividuals with substance use disorders. Medications like methadone, \nbuprenorphine, and naltrexone have been shown to reduce opioid use.\n  Our supplemental spending amendment would also speed emergency \nresources to law enforcement agencies. This Senator has heard from \npolice in New Hampshire. They can't solve this problem by putting \npeople in jail. They can help to solve it by putting traffickers in \njail and by breaking up those networks that are supplying drugs.\n  In recent years, the opioid epidemic has spread to small towns and \nrural areas in every part of the country. If we went back to that first \nmap of the United States, we could see just how much the spread has \nbeen to rural parts of this country. Heroin traffickers in New York \nexpressly target New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine--all States with a \nlarge rural population. We don't have any real urban areas in our \nStates, but we can see the spread of those drugs in northern New \nEngland.\n  This amendment will provide $230 million in emergency funding for \nEdward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, and $10 million for \nCOPS Anti-Heroin Task Force Grants. The Byrne JAG Grant Program is the \nNation's cornerstone crimefighting program. It has proved its \neffectiveness in each of our States, which is why it enjoys such strong \nbipartisan support. But the program has suffered cuts. In New \nHampshire, we received $1.7 million in Byrne funding in 2007. Last year \nwe received less than $1 million--almost a 50-percent reduction.\n  I had the chance to travel with Senator Hoeven down to our southern \nborder of Texas last spring because we both are on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security. We talked with some of our Customs \nand Border Patrol employees who were down on the border in Laredo and \nwere interdicting drugs down on our southern border. One of the things \nthey talked about is that drugs are coming across our southern border \nand they are going up the Interstate Highway System. They are going up \nInterstate 95 to northern New Hampshire. They are going up Interstate \n35 through the middle of the country. We have to provide law \nenforcement with the funds they need to interdict those traffickers. We \nneed an infusion of new funding to mobilize so that the programs are \nmore aggressive for stopping opioid traffickers and dealers.\n  Our amendment requires that Byrne JAG funds be used directly to \ncombat the opioid crisis for this emergency funding. That will allow \nfor programs that emphasize treatment over incarceration, such as drug \ncourts.\n  In New Hampshire we have seen what a difference it can make to have \nwell-resourced, ambitious law enforcement initiatives. From May to \nDecember of last year, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Task \nForce, or the HIDTA Task Force, based in Bedford, NH, carried out \nOperation Trident. They draw on Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement resources in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. It makes \nsense because the more we cooperate, the more we can respond.\n  Operation Trident resulted in 240 arrests. They took down four major \nheroin fentanyl trafficking organizations. They dismantled three \nprocessing mills, and they seized more than $1.2 million in assets. \nWhat we have to do is continue to recreate these successes all across \nthe country by moving aggressively to take down the gangs and other \ntrafficking organizations that are feeding the opioid epidemic. To do \nthat we have to provide the resources.\n  This emergency funding amendment doesn't create any new programs. \nInstead, we fund proven and effective initiatives like Byrne JAG and \nthe substance abuse preventive and treatment block grants. These \ninitiatives have earned bipartisan support because Senators have seen \nthe good work it has done in each of our States. By allocating these \nemergency resources to these proven programs, this amendment will \nprovide law enforcement and treatment professionals with the resources \nthey need to go on the offensive to mobilize a real war on opioid \ntrafficking and addiction.\n  Perhaps most importantly, our emergency supplemental funding \namendment funds the programs that are included in the CARA bill. I want \nto thank Senator Whitehouse and other drafters of CARA, who have made \nimportant statutory steps and programmatic changes to improve programs \nthat help treat addiction.\n  But CARA, as important as it is, is an authorization bill that \ndoesn't provide any funding. If we support making the changes in the \nlaw that are included in the CARA bill, then we should also support the \nfunding needed to make these programs work.\n  This chart shows a quote from the National Governors Association. \nRecently, they came together and they endorsed emergency appropriations \nto address this crisis. They wrote:\n       Governors applaud the introduction of legislation that \n     would provide emergency assistance to states working on the \n     front lines of the opioid crisis. . . . [I]nvestment is \n     needed to help states mount an effective response to opioid \n     addiction, from increasing prevention and education regarding \n     the dangers of illicit drugs to strengthening state \n     prescription drug monitoring programs, expanding access to \n     addiction treatment and enhancing support for law \n     enforcement.\n\n  The Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed this amendment, saying:\n\n       This bill will help our State and local law enforcement \n     officers by giving them the necessary funding and tools to \n     battle their communities' heroin and opioid problems. \n     Something needs to be done.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe support letter from the Fraternal Order of Police.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1115]]\n\n\n                                          National Fraternal Order\n\n\n                                                    of Police,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2016.\n     Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shaheen: I am writing on behalf of the members \n     of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our support \n     for your bill S. 2423, the ``Opioid and Heroin Epidemic \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act.'' This legislation \n     will make available $210 million to help law enforcement \n     fight the heroin and opioid epidemic that is destroying our \n     communities.\n       This bill will help our State and local law enforcement \n     officers by giving them the necessary funding and tools to \n     battle their communities' heroin and opioid problems. This \n     funding will be used for expenses relating to drug treatment \n     and enforcement programs, law enforcement programing, and \n     drug addiction prevention and education programs. Something \n     needs to be done and Congress is correct to provide law \n     enforcement with the resources we need to combat this \n     epidemic.\n       On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I thank you for your continued leadership \n     and support of law enforcement. I look forward to working \n     with you and your staff to get this bill through Congress to \n     put an end to the heroin and opioid epidemic. If I can be of \n     any additional assistance, please do not hesitate to contact \n     me or my Executive Director Jim Pasco at my Washington \n     office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. We have also received support from groups such as the \nAmerican Academy of Pain Management; the American Public Health \nAssociation; the American Society of Addiction Medicine; the \nAssociation of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses; the \nPartnership for Drug-Free Kids; the American College of Physicians; and \nthe National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe list of groups.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Emergency Supplemental for Heroin and Opioid Abuse Supporting \n                             Organizations\n\n       Fraternal Order of Police, American Academy of Pain \n     Management, American College of Physicians, American College \n     of Sports Medicine, American Osteopathic Association, \n     American Public Health Association, American Society of \n     Addiction Medicine, Association of Women's Health, Obstetric \n     and Neonatal Nurses, College on Problems of Drug Dependence, \n     Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America.\n       Connecticut Certification Board, Friends of NIDA, IC & RC, \n     Illinois Alcoholism and Drug Dependence Association, \n     California Consortium of Addiction Programs and \n     Professionals, National Association of State Alcohol and Drug \n     Abuse Directors, Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, Physician \n     Assistant Education Association, SAI, Trust for America's \n     Health.\n\n\n               National Governor's Association Statement\n\n       Provide emergency supplemental funding to help states and \n     communities turn the tide on the opioid epidemic. Governors \n     applaud the introduction of legislation that would provide \n     emergency assistance to states working on the front lines of \n     the opioid crisis. Congress has provided billions in \n     emergency aid to address natural disasters, security threats \n     and other crises, including more than $5 billion last year to \n     combat Ebola at home and abroad. A similar investment is \n     needed to help states mount an effective response to opioid \n     addiction, from increasing prevention and education regarding \n     the dangers of illicit drugs to strengthening state \n     prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), expanding \n     access to addiction treatment and enhancing support for law \n     enforcement.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. The question is, Why do we need emergency funding? Some \nof my colleagues have argued that additional funds are not needed \nbecause there was enough money for the opioid crisis in last year's \nomnibus. Yes, it is true there is additional funding for these programs \nin the omnibus. I sit on the Appropriations Committee; I was one of \nmany on that committee who worked very hard to fight for those dollars. \nBut with spending caps in place, these increases are modest at best.\n  The majority of my supplemental amendment appropriates resources to \ntwo programs: the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant \nand the Byrne JAG Program. These programs have been critically \nunderfunded in recent years. For example, the substance abuse \nprevention and treatment block grant received a small increase in the \nomnibus. That was good, but the reality is that over the last 10 years, \nfunding for this program has not kept up with health care inflation. So \nwe have a 26-percent decrease in the real value of funding despite the \nsmall increase we got in the appropriations process. In order to \nrestore the block grant to its purchasing power from 10 years ago--10 \nyears ago, before we had the explosion of the opioid and heroin \ncrisis--just to get back to that level, Congress would need to allocate \nan additional $483 million for fiscal year 2017. My amendment provides \n$300 million for this program. It is a downpayment--only a \ndownpayment--on where we need to be. The Byrne JAG Program has been \nflat-funded for the last 3 years.\n  Fifteen years ago--again, before the explosion of the heroin and \nopioid crisis--Congress provided more than $1 billion in support to \nState and local law enforcement through Byrne JAG and block grant \nfunding. By 2015 that number had been reduced to $376 million. Right \nnow, despite the explosion in this heroin and opioid crisis, we are \nproviding only about one-third of the support we provided 15 years ago.\n  The reality is that criminal justice and prevention and treatment \nhave been chronically underfunded and, as a result, deaths have \ncontinued to rise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 27 minutes.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I should be finished shortly.\n  We have talked to the Department of Justice and to Health and Human \nServices, and they are ready to get this funding out the door \nimmediately because there is no time to wait. Law enforcement and \nhealth care providers on the frontlines need this money, and they need \nthis money now.\n  In the past, Congress has risen to the challenge of epidemics. In \n2009, Congress appropriated nearly $2 billion in emergency funding to \nfight swine flu, which claimed the lives of about 12,000 Americans. \nThat emergency appropriations bill passed the Senate 86 to 3. Mr. \nPresident, 51 Senators who voted for that bill are still serving in \nthis Chamber, including 23 Republican Senators and every Member of the \nRepublican leadership. Last year, Congress approved $5.4 billion in \nfunding to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, an outbreak that \nkilled only one American. Surely we can come together now, this year, \nin this session, to fight a raging epidemic here at home. We cannot \navert our eyes from 47,000 Americans who are being killed by lethal \noverdoses each year. We cannot accept that 9 out of 10 Americans with \nsubstance abuse disorders go without treatment. We cannot avoid the \nfact that law enforcement officers in communities across this country \nare overwhelmed by aggressive drug traffickers and a rising tide of \nopioid-related crimes.\n  CARA will help fight the heroin and opioid epidemic in the longer \nterm, but I urge my colleagues to also support this emergency \nsupplemental funding amendment because it will provide urgent emergency \nfunding to ramp up this fight in the months immediately ahead. This is \na nationwide crisis, and it is time we mobilize a nationwide response \nthat is equal to the challenge.\n  I urge my colleagues, I urge the majority leader to allow a vote on \nmy amendment and to pass this out so we can give our local communities \nand States the resources they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nrecess as under the previous order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/senate-section/article/S1115-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:23 p.m., recessed until \n2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer \n(Mr. Portman).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/senate-section/article/S1115-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1115-S1132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, you know more than just about anybody else \nhere\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\nthat across the Nation there has been a dramatic increase in the \nincidence of opioid addiction, which is now at the point of being a \nfull-blown crisis.\n  In my home State of North Carolina, we have seen this devastation \nfirsthand, with 1,358 overdose deaths in 2014 alone fueled by the \ncombination of abuse of opioid-based prescription painkillers and \nheroin. To put that figure into context, that is more than the number \nof North Carolinians who lost their lives in automobile accidents in \n2014.\n  For far too long the conventional thinking was that drug addiction \ndeserved the stigma it receives: a choice made by criminals who were \nintent on destroying the lives of themselves and others. It was a dark \nand painful embarrassment for their families. It is long overdue for us \nto come to grips with reality because we know the truth: Drug addiction \ndoesn't discriminate based on one's gender, race, or socioeconomic \nstatus. Successful CEOs of major companies have succumbed to addiction. \nStraight-A students and valedictorians with once bright futures ahead \nof them have succumbed to addiction. PTA moms and dads, who were \npillars of their communities, have succumbed to addiction. We know it \nbecause we have seen it in our inner cities, our suburbs, and our \ntight-knit rural areas.\n  Two weeks ago I picked up my hometown newspaper, the Charlotte \nObserver. On the front page was a report that highlighted the rising \nprescription overdose epidemic. It started off with a terrifying story \nof a North Carolina mother that encapsulates the kind of crisis we are \ndealing with.\n  The story began:\n\n       The Charlotte woman didn't know her daughter was a drug \n     addict until she heard a thud upstairs.\n       Her daughter, a bright Myers Park High graduate, had \n     returned from college for the weekend with a sack of dirty \n     laundry. Her mother was folding clothes in the den when she \n     heard the fall of her daughter's unconscious body.\n       She sprinted upstairs. ``She's unconscious on the floor, \n     blue, not breathing. No heartbeat,'' said the mother.\n\n  That is what the mother saw on the floor of her daughter's bedroom. \nFortunately, in this case, the young woman survived the painkiller \noverdose. With the support of a loving family, she has an opportunity \nto get her life back on track and seize the chance to reach her full \npotential. But let's not kid ourselves. This near tragedy could have \nhappened anywhere in America, and any parent could have experienced it.\n  It is important to reflect on how it got to this point, though. In \n2012 the CDC completed a report that said that in North Carolina, there \nwere 97 painkiller prescriptions written per 100 people. So what does \nthat mean? It doesn't mean 97 percent of the people in North Carolina \nare getting painkillers; it means there is a group of people who are \ngetting dozens and dozens, sometimes hundreds of prescriptions for \nopioids. In part, this is a result of a greater awareness of the \nimportance of pain management. And many people do need pain medication, \nbut the wider availability of these life-improving and lifesaving \nsurgeries and treatments has actually contributed to the epidemic.\n  The medical community rightly recognized that managing patient pain \nwas the compassionate thing to do and started holding providers \naccountable for doing so. However, the risk of the wider availability \nof these powerful medicines must be urgently and rigorously addressed. \nThat is because for Americans from all walks of life, the nightmare of \naddiction begins with something as unassuming as a routine prescription \nfor a painkiller such as OxyContin or Percocet. Due to the highly \naddictive nature of these drugs, a patient's body can become dependent \nand they experience debilitating withdrawal. Once the prescription runs \nout, the physical addiction unfortunately influences people to make \nreally bad decisions that can be life-changing--seeking more pills on \nthe black market when their doctor says ``no more'' or turning to \ncheaper or even more deadly opioid drugs, such as heroin.\n  Opioid addiction is a slippery slope, and it is a deadly slope. The \nCDC has concluded that people are 40 times more likely to be addicted \nto heroin if they are addicted to prescription painkillers.\n  Our country desperately needs coordination from Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement officials to develop comprehensive strategies to \ncombat heroin trafficking and to prevent prescription drug diversion. \nFederal dollars and resources come with so much redtape and so many \nmandates that State and local experts cannot use funding for different \ninitiatives, and that is what the CARA bill seeks to address. For \nexample, there simply are not enough treatment slots for mothers with \nchildren, and there isn't enough assistance provided to pharmacists and \ndoctors to teach them how to best manage their prescriptions and help \nthe people with the highest risk of addiction.\n  It has been heartening to see Members of Congress set aside their \npartisan differences in order to take immediate action to address the \ncurrent shortcomings. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, which is the bipartisan legislation that \nbrings together the experiences and recommendations of drug addiction \nexperts, law enforcement, health care providers, first responders, and \nthe patient community most affected by the opioid epidemic.\n  The legislation expands abuse prevention and education initiatives. \nIt provides grants to substance abuse agencies, local governments, and \nnonprofit organizations in North Carolina and the rest of the Nation \nthat are being hit hardest by the heroin and painkiller epidemic.\n  Local first responders will receive help through expanded \navailability of naloxone, a powerful antidote that is used to prevent \noverdose deaths. It has had amazing impacts on saving the lives of \npeople, such as the young lady I talked about earlier.\n  The legislation also addresses the strain the addiction crisis places \non our criminal justice system by providing more resources to identify \nand treat incarcerated Americans, helping put them on the path to \nrecovery, which in turn could lower the Nation's recidivism and crime \nrates.\n  We can never forget that the solution to so many of America's \nproblems can be found in our local communities--our schools, our \nchurches, townhalls, and VFW halls. The Federal Government can help \nsupport these efforts through smart, commonsense approaches, such as \nthe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. However, we must \nbe honest in recognizing that success will be neither quick nor easy. \nWe are confronted with the reality that addiction is a vicious and \ndevastating cycle of abuse and despair, with consequences that can \nresult in the destruction of loving families and the end to once-\npromising lives. It affects us all, Mr. President. The fight against \naddiction is one we must wage together, and we cannot afford to lose.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the Presiding Officer personally for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  I look forward to seeing the CARA bill come to the Senate and then on \nto the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I also want to take a few moments today to \ndiscuss the devastation drugs are bringing to too many families and \ncommunities across our Nation and also to congratulate the Presiding \nOfficer for his great work on this issue. The bill before us today is a \ncollaborative effort of his and Senators Ayotte, Toomey, and others who \nhave worked very hard to address what has become an epidemic across our \ncountry. It is particularly hitting States hard, it is hitting \ncommunities hard and families hard, and it needs to be dealt with. The \ndestructive effects of illegal drug use have been well documented, and \nanything we say about the problem is likely to have been said many \ntimes before, but it is still worth saying because we cannot afford to \nforget what is at stake in this effort.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, methamphetamine use has hit our \nIndian reservations very hard over the past few years. Numerous \nindividuals have become trapped in a cycle of meth abuse, their plans \nand dreams for their futures erased as their world shrinks to nothing \nmore than their next dose. Of course, drug abuse doesn't just affect \nthe individual using drugs; it ripples out into families and \ncommunities. Since meth abuse spiked on our reservations, there has \nbeen a significant\n\n[[Page S1117]]\n\nincrease in the number of babies born addicted to meth, and that is \nabout as heartbreaking as it gets, Mr. President--a newborn baby \nscreaming in agony as her body suffers withdrawal.\n  The meth epidemic on our reservations has also caused a significant \nincrease in the number of meth-related crimes, including sexual \nassaults, domestic violence, child neglect, car accidents, and gang \nviolence.\n  The meth epidemic has worsened the housing shortage facing South \nDakota tribes because meth has contaminated a number of homes across \nour reservations. Cleaning up a house that has tested positive for meth \ncosts thousands of dollars.\n  Several South Dakota tribes have seen so much devastation from meth \nabuse that they have declared a State of public emergency to gain \naccess to additional government resources to fight the problem.\n  Today we are considering legislation to address another drug epidemic \nthat has caused similar devastation--the abuse of prescription \npainkillers and heroin.\n  Since 1999, drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids, such as \noxycodone and hydrocodone, have quadrupled. Forty-four Americans die \nevery single day after overdosing on prescription opioid painkillers, \nand the numbers on heroin abuse are similarly disturbing. Heroin abuse \nin the United States nearly doubled between 2002 and 2013, while \noverdose deaths related to heroin nearly quadrupled. Between 2013 and \n2014 alone, heroin use in the United States increased nearly 35 \npercent. Behind those numbers are thousands of broken families, \nsuffering children, and devastated communities.\n  Any response to a problem as deep and complex as drug abuse has to \napproach the problem from a number of different angles. It has to \naddress education and prevention. It has to target the drug supply by \ngoing after those who trade in and produce drugs. And it has to ensure \nthat individuals trying to escape the cycle of addiction have access to \nthe resources they need to overcome their dependence. The bill before \nthe Senate today, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, targets \nall these priorities. A substantial part of the bill is focused on \nfunding programs that provide treatment and support for individuals \ntrying to escape painkiller or heroin dependence. The bill also \nprovides grants for education and prevention and for local communities' \nanti-drug efforts.\n  An important section of the bill focuses on developing best practices \nfor prescribing pain medication. Right now, prescription painkillers \nare heavily prescribed in the United States. In fact, the United States \nconsumes more opioids than any other country in the world. Our country \naccounts for almost 100 percent of hydrocodone used globally and 81 \npercent of oxycodone use. In 2012 doctors prescribed enough \nprescription opioids to give every adult in the United States a month's \nsupply. Let me repeat that. In 2012 doctors prescribed enough \nprescription opioids to give every adult in the United States a month's \nsupply.\n  It goes without saying that prescription painkillers can be a key \npart of medical treatment, but it is essential that we make sure these \npotentially addictive drugs are being carefully prescribed and that \nthey are only being prescribed when they are really needed. Reviewing \nand updating prescribing practices will help us prevent attempts to use \nthese drugs inappropriately.\n  One of the most important parts of preventing drug abuse is going \nafter the people who prey upon the vulnerabilities of their fellow man \nby engaging in the drug trade. One significant reason for the recent \nspike in heroin abuse is the sharp increase in supply of affordable \nheroin here in the United States over the past several years. This \nincrease has been driven by a major surge in heroin production in \nMexico. Between 2013 and 2014 heroin production in Mexico increased a \nstaggering 62 percent--62 percent, in 1 year. A large part of that \nproduction increase has ended up here in the United States. Any \nsuccessful strategy to combat the heroin epidemic in the United States \nhas to include efforts to check the flow of heroin coming across our \nborders. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act addresses this \npriority by authorizing grants to State law enforcement agencies to \ninvestigate the illegal trafficking and distribution of heroin and \nprescription painkillers, and Republicans will continue to look for \nways to support Federal, State, and local law enforcement as they seek \nto stem the flow of drugs into our communities.\n\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is an important bill. It \nis supported by Senators of both parties and by a number of law \nenforcement and drug treatment associations. It takes the kind of \ncomprehensive approach we need to address the abuse of heroin and \nprescription painkillers, but our efforts are not limited to this bill.\n  Last year we passed the Protecting Our Infants Act to help prevent \nand treat prescription painkiller abuse in pregnant women and provide \ncare for newborns who suffer as a result of their mothers' abuse of \nopioids. We also increased funding for efforts to combat painkiller \nabuse and provided grants to States to help them prevent and treat drug \nabuse. As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I worked with my \ncolleagues last year to provide new resources to the Coast Guard, the \nleading Federal agency for combating the drug trade on the high seas. \nThe Senate Finance Committee recently held a hearing on the Stopping \nMedication Abuse and Protecting Seniors Act, which establishes a \nMedicare Program to prevent painkiller abuse.\n  Too many lives across our country have been wrecked by drug abuse, \ntoo many children have lost a mother or a father to addiction, and too \nmany communities are bleeding from the violence and brokenness that \naccompany the drug epidemic in this country.\n  Republicans remain committed to doing everything we can to support \nthose fighting drug abuse, whether they serve in law enforcement \nagencies, emergency rooms or classrooms. We are committed to reaching a \nday when fewer lives are destroyed by the scourge of drugs.\n  The legislation before us today--which Senators Portman, Ayotte, \nToomey, and others have been involved with--is an important step \nforward in helping to address something that has become a crisis in \nthis country and which is impacting, in a harmful and negative way, way \ntoo many families and way too many individuals and ruining the hopes \nand aspirations of too many young people and children across the \ncountry.\n  Let's pass this legislation, let's get the House to pass a similar \npiece of legislation, and let's get something on the President's desk \nthat can be signed into law that will bring the relief that is needed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, no one appears to be seeking the floor \nright now, so I will take the opportunity to speak about our CARA \nlegislation. Since the Senator from Ohio, who has been my partner in \nthis, is now presiding, this is an opportune time to give some remarks.\n  I think like many States, just from the remarks we heard on the floor \nalready, it is not unusual to have a terrible toll at home from opioid \nabuse and from overdoses. In 2014, 239 Rhode Islanders lost their lives \nto overdoses. That is more than were killed in automobile accidents, \nmore than were killed in homicides, more than were killed by suicide. \nIndeed, that is more than all of those categories--automobile \naccidents, homicides, and suicides--combined.\n  In one small community, Burrillville, RI, the beginning of last year \nwas marked by six opioid overdose deaths. Burrillville is a very small \ntown in northern Rhode Island. There are probably 5,000 people who live \nthere. In one quarter, the opening quarter of last year, to lose six \npeople, to have six police calls to the scene, to have six wakes, six \nfunerals in a community that small--that is sadly emblematic of what is \ngoing on all around the country.\n  Rhode Island is not alone. The addiction overdoses are claiming \nlives, creating tragedy, and destroying families\n\n[[Page S1118]]\n\nacross the United States. Our emergency rooms in America treat almost \n7,000 people every single day for the misuse or abuse of drugs. There \nare 7,000 people who come through the ER doors needing treatment, \nwhich, by the way, runs up costs to our health care system. More than \n120 people die every day as a result of an overdose. The latest year \nfor which we have figures is the year that Senator Thune just \nmentioned, 2014--47,000 dead in 1 year.\n  If you leave this building and walk down to the Mall, you will find \nthe Vietnam war memorial. The Vietnam war memorial has about 58,000 \nnames on it. From the entire Vietnam conflict, there are 58,000 names \non the Vietnam war memorial. From 1 year of opioid overdose, there are \n47,000 deaths. I am afraid it probably went up in 2015. We don't have \nthe figures in yet.\n  Behind this tragedy of death and sorrow lies a terrible failing, \nwhich is that, according to the most recent estimates, nearly 9 out of \n10 people who need drug treatment don't get it. They just don't get it. \nWhen you think of that death toll, you think of the cost and you think \nof the sorrow. The idea that we are still letting 9 out of 10 people \nwho need treatment not even get it, not have access to it, is a \nterrible failing.\n  The economic cost of all of this is something we always think about \nhere in Congress. Whether it is from health care costs or criminal \njustice-related costs or loss of productivity at work, that has been \nestimated at as much as $70 billion per year.\n  One thing we have seen is that the ongoing substance abuse epidemic \ndoes not discriminate by race, by ethnicity, by gender, or by age. \nOverdose rates are up in both men and women, in non-Hispanic Whites and \nBlacks, and in adults of almost all ages. The dynamic nature of this \nepidemic demands that we respond in a comprehensive way--a way that \nbrings together the public health, the public safety, the behavioral \nhealth care, the addiction recovery, and other communities.\n  It was out of this recognition, this realization that this pandemic, \nas some have aptly called it, requires an all-hands-on-deck approach \nthat the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act was born. Starting in \nthe spring of 2014, Senator Portman of Ohio, Senator Klobuchar of \nMinnesota, Senator Ayotte of New Hampshire, and I hosted a series of \nbipartisan, bicameral congressional forums addressing various aspects \nof addiction--from the role of addiction in our criminal justice \nsystem, to the special challenges faced by women, by veterans, by young \naddicts, and the collateral consequences that we impose on people when \nthey are in recovery. We hosted five forums, as the Presiding Officer \nwill well recall, that brought together experts from these various \nfields to come here from all around the country. This was a national \npilgrimage to Washington to highlight best practices and to share \nsuccess stories from their States.\n  I have more remarks that I will be pleased to make as the day goes \non, but I am here managing the floor, and so I will yield the floor to \nmy colleague and fill in again when there is a gap in the proceedings.\n  I yield the floor, and I will pursue this later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                          Guantanamo Detainees\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, yesterday I joined Senators Gardner and \nMoran on a factfinding mission to Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay was a \nhumble reminder of the services our military provides overseas to get \nthese terrorists off the battlefield and ensure they don't end up in \nAmericans' backyards.\n  President Obama has signed multiple pieces of legislation into law \nthat explicitly prohibit the transfer of enemy combatants from \nGuantanamo Bay to our shores. Most recently, the 2016 National Defense \nAuthorization Act signed by the President specifically prohibited funds \nto be utilized to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United \nStates.\n  Among those being held are detainees such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, \nwho is the principal architect of the September 11, 2001, attacks in \nNew York City, according to the ``9/11 Commission Report.'' Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed is just part of the 9/11 five who are currently \ndetained in Guantanamo Bay who allegedly masterminded and facilitated \nthe 9/11 terror attacks on our country. In fact, other prisoners \ninclude Osama Bin Laden's bodyguard, who fought U.S. forces in \nAfghanistan.\n  We need to do the right thing for our country and keep them locked up \nin Guantanamo and not help President Obama fulfill a campaign promise \nand bring these terrorists to our communities.\n  I am exceedingly proud of our men and our women serving at Guantanamo \nBay. They are impressive, they are professional, and I am honored to \nrepresent their interests in the U.S. Senate. I will continue working \ntirelessly to prohibit the transfer of these detainees to America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I will continue my remarks.\n  We were discussing the forums that the Presiding Officer, Senator \nAyotte, Senator Klobuchar, and I organized. Out of that developed a \nnational working group of stakeholders from the public health \ncommunity, from behavioral health folks, prevention, treatment, \nrecovery, and law enforcement. The forums informed us and the working \ngroups supported us as we worked to draft legislation that would \npromote effective, evidence-based policies and increase collaboration \namong what are too often siloed areas of activity and expertise.\n  The bill we developed would do a great number of things. They fall \ninto four major categories:\n  First, it would expand prevention and educational efforts--\nparticularly aimed at teens, parents, and other caretakers, and elderly \nfolks, aging populations--to prevent the abuse of opioids and heroin \nand to promote treatment and recovery.\n  Second, it would expand the availability of naloxone to law \nenforcement agencies and other first responders to help in the reversal \nof overdoses and save lives.\n  Third, it would expand the resources to identify and treat \nincarcerated individuals suffering from addiction disorders promptly by \ncollaborating with criminal justice stakeholders and by providing \nevidence-based treatment.\n  Fourth, it would strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to \nhelp States monitor and track the diversion of prescribed drugs out of \nthe proper and legitimate market and to help at-risk individuals get \naccess to the services they need.\n  It does a number of other things, but I will not summarize them all \nnow.\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act recognizes what we have \nlearned from science and from experience, and it promotes those \npractices that we know work best to confront the multiple facets of \nthis new epidemic. It sends the message that we in Congress understand \nthat addiction is a disease, a public health crisis that requires more \nthan the enactment of stiffer criminal penalties. We tried that road. \nWe know it was not a success.\n  The bill we worked on and prepared has been endorsed by over 130 \ncommunity and national organizations on the frontlines of this \nepidemic, including the National Council on Behavioral Health, \nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Hazelden Betty Ford \nFoundation, the National District Attorneys Association, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, major county sheriffs, the American \nCorrectional Association, and many others.\n  Here in the Senate, at the last count, we had 38 cosponsors and \nmyself. I am sure that number is climbing.\n  As committed as I am to the principles in this legislation and to the \nneed to encourage and support these policies, I recognize that this \nbill alone is not enough. Without adequate resources to fund the \nprograms in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, they \nwill remain out of reach to too many of the individuals, communities, \nand first responders who most need them. Without adequate resources for \nprevention, treatment, and recovery, we will continue to spend billions \nof dollars elsewhere in economic and societal costs that would be \navoidable if we got this right. Without adequate resources, too many \npeople who desperately want to turn their lives around will be told to \nwait another day. Anybody who knows about addiction recovery knows what \nthe consequences can be of being told to wait another day.\n\n[[Page S1119]]\n\n  Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire has proposed an amendment which \nprovides emergency appropriations to address this crisis. I am a \ncosponsor of that amendment because I agree with her that the opioid \nepidemic is an emergency, a public health emergency, and should be \ntreated as one. Building on the strong commitment Congress made to \nfunding addiction and recovery programs in the fiscal year 2016 \nomnibus, Senator Shaheen's bill would appropriate an additional $600 \nmillion to the Department of Justice, to SAMHSA, and the CDC, much of \nit going to programs authorized in CARA, the Comprehensive Reduction \nRecovery Act, or complementary to CARA's goals.\n  This would not be the first time the Congress has authorized \nemergency spending in response to a public health emergency. When the \nswine flu epidemic hit, and I believe took 11,000 lives, Congress \nappropriated $2 billion on an emergency basis with broad support on \nboth sides of the aisle. Here, in the latest year for which we have the \ndata, the body count is 47,000 deaths. We lost 11,000 lives to swine \nflu and 47,000 lives in 1 year to the opioid epidemic.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me and \nSenator Shaheen and vote, not only to support the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act but to also provide added resources to make \nthose principles a reality in the lives of the people who are counting \non us to come to their aid. Addiction is a tough illness and recovery \nfrom it is a hard but noble path. Men and women who walk that path \ndeserve our support, encouragement, and admiration.\n  I thank my fellow sponsors, Senator Portman, Senator Klobuchar, and \nSenator Ayotte, for their partnership over the past 2 years as we \nprepared this legislation. I thank Chairman Grassley and my ranking \nmember Senator Leahy for their commitment to tackling this epidemic and \nfor bringing this bill out of the Judiciary Committee without \nopposition and now to the floor where we hope we can bring it across \nthe finish line.\n  Let me say that I anticipate we are going to have a disagreement \nabout the funding of this bill. I will fight as hard as I can to make \nsure this bill is adequately funded, but I do not intend, nor do I know \nanyone who intends, to block the passage of CARA or to interfere with \nit going into law over the question of funding.\n  People will have to check in with their own consciences, check in \nwith the desires of the addiction and recovery communities in their \nhome States, and check in with their constituents as to the right way \nto vote on giving this adequate funding.\n  Finally, let me close by thanking the advocates, providers, police \nofficers, rescue personnel, and of course the families who support and \nhelp the people in recovery through the tough nights and days. They do \nthe hard work of saving lives every single day, and we would do well to \nhonor them by passing this bill and seeing to it that it has adequate \nfunding support.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have an inquiry. I believe there will be \na series of speakers coming to the floor to address the issue of \ndigital security. I don't know if my colleague, the Senator from Ohio, \nhas a long statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask if my colleague would defer to me \nfor just 2 minutes so I may address the CARA bill that Senator \nWhitehouse has been talking about, and then I will yield to the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  First, I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse for his partnership. As he \nsaid, we have been working on this issue for the last few years to \nensure that we have a comprehensive approach to this horrible issue of \ndrug addiction and specifically the increasing threat of addiction to \nprescription drugs and heroin which we see in all of our communities. \nIt is the No. 1 cause of death in my home State of Ohio, and we have \nbeen told it is the No. 1 cause of accidental death in the country. It \nis far worse than that. It is tearing apart families and communities, \nand we need to address it.\n  I will say two things. One, this is not just a bill about principles, \nthis is a bill about policy, and Senator Whitehouse and I are \nsupporting new policies to approach this issue more effectively, as to \nprevention and education, as to treatment and recovery, as to dealing \nwith the unfortunate situation of too many overdoses of naloxone, as to \ntraining, as to getting prescription drug monitoring programs in place, \nas to helping these addicted babies and mothers who are pregnant and \nhave an addiction. There are very specific policy changes here that \ndirect the increase in appropriations which is provided for in the \ncurrent fiscal year, for the next 7, 8 months. That funding will be \nthere for this legislation.\n  If we were to pass this bill tomorrow and get it enacted into law, \nthat funding would be there not just in principle but in specific ways \nto spend that money more effectively. I wanted to make that point \nclear.\n  Second, I do support additional resources, as does Senator \nWhitehouse. I believe this is such a crisis that it requires resources \nover and above what we even provided in CARA. We have to get CARA done, \nand I agree with Senator Whitehouse on that. This is priority No. 1 not \njust for us but for the 130 groups around the country that are the \nexperts in prevention, education, treatment, and recovery. They have \ncome together and given us their best counsel; that is, that this \nlegislation will actually help to begin to reverse this terrible trend \nof addiction.\n  I am hopeful we can have a full debate on this legislation. I \nunderstand Senator Shaheen is going to offer an amendment. I have seen \nthe revised version of her amendment, and I believe I will be able to \nsupport her amendment. I have just started to look it over, but I like \nit because it does provide additional funding. The funding is in \naddition to the funding we know will already be in there for CARA. It \nwould be emergency funding. It is not usual for me to support funding \nthat is not paid for through other offsets, but I believe we are in \nsuch a crisis in this country, including my State, that I will be able \nto support that. However, as Senator Whitehouse said, we have to pass \nthe underlying bill. I appreciate my colleague's commitment on that, \nand I appreciate the commitment of so many other great groups around \nthe country that have supported us and said: Let's not get off track \nhere. Let's get this legislation passed.\n  We have companion legislation in the House. It is bipartisan and \nidentical to the legislation Senator Whitehouse and I introduced. We \nworked together with the House on this legislation. This is bipartisan. \nThey have over 88 cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats. We have very \ngood signals from the White House that shows they are interested in \nworking with us. Therefore, this can actually get done.\n  It is not just about funding for this year. Obviously, this would be \na change in the way we spend money. It is an authorization to change it \nnext year and the year after that and the year after that. In my \nexperience that is what needs to be done.\n  I was the author of the Drug-Free Communities Act in the House for \nalmost the past two decades. There has now been $1.3 billion under the \nauspices of the Drug-Free Communities Act that directs and targets that \nfunding to what we know is effective prevention. Our legislation takes \nthat to the next step with regard to heroin and prescription drugs and \nwill help those communities that are particularly impacted.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island. I also thank my colleague \nfrom Virginia for his indulgence. I am sorry to interrupt his colloquy \nwith our colleagues.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank both of my \ncolleagues for their very important work on the issue before the Senate \ntoday. I, like them, have a State where both opioid and heroin abuse is \ntaking too many lives and destroying too many families. I look forward \nto successfully moving forward on this legislation.\n\n\n                            Digital Security\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to join several of my colleagues in a \nconversation on digital security. Since last year, I have been working \nwith the chairman of the\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee, Texas Republican Michael McCaul, to \nset up a Commission of experts to study digital security and issues \naround encryption. These issues have been somewhat in the news, and we \nhave seen court cases in both California and New York.\n  I say to my colleagues that this is one component the Commission is \ntrying to address. We are at the beginning of a debate that is even \nbroader than the current cases being litigated in California and New \nYork, which will encompass the whole world with digital security. If \nyou think the issues we face now are challenging, as our country and \nthe world move more toward the Internet, such as having your \nrefrigerator respond to your voice, this issue around digital security \nis only going to grow.\n  I have a background with the technology community and Chairman McCaul \nhas a background with the law enforcement community. Unfortunately, \nover the last few months, we have seen folks from the tech community, \nthe law enforcement community, and the privacy community talk past each \nother too often. We have seen this issue addressed without a common set \nof facts. We have now seen situations arise that have basically pitted \nlaw enforcement against technology. We think the approach we are \ntaking--bipartisan legislation that was introduced on Monday--is the \nappropriate way to go.\n\n  I am joined by my partner in the Senate, Senator Gardner. We have \nSenator Collins, Senator Bennet, and my good friend Senator King.\n  Mr. President, regardless of where people fall in this debate, \ndigital security tools are terribly important. Encryption is essential \nto protecting our personal information, our financial information, our \nintellectual capital, and our national security, and this is one issue \nin which the heads of law enforcement and the heads of the intelligence \ncommunity as recently as 2 weeks ago--Senator King and Senator Collins, \nwho are on the Intelligence Committee--have said that encryption is \nhere to stay and is extraordinarily important.\n  We have seen challenges around this technological innovation come \nvery quickly. Think about this: Nearly 2,000 new applications are \nsubmitted to the App Store every day. That is how quickly this world is \nchanging. The majority of these new applications that are added to that \nApp Store are actually produced overseas. Two-thirds of these new apps \nuse some level of encryption.\n  I follow this from a policy standpoint but also my personal \nbackground in the telecommunication industry for over 20 years. I can \nsay that the networks we deal with today in terms of the Internet, the \ncloud, are infinitely more complicated than the distributed top-down \nnetwork that existed in the 1990s when the Congress most recently \naddressed some of these issues. The Internet today is no longer top \ndown. The fundamental architecture of the Internet is decentralized and \nresilient. We have seen on countless occasions in the past that telecom \ntraffic shifts quickly from one area to another, and attempts by any \ngovernment to channel that traffic in a certain way in fact often \nresults in shifts that make it harder for government, law enforcement, \nand intelligence to stay abreast of the activity.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, many of these issues have been public since \nEdward Snowden's disclosure 3 years ago. I think that disclosure did \ngreat harm to our country. We have seen more recently, in the press, \nthis debate crystallize after terrorist events and court activities in \nboth California and New York.\n  What we are doing--these Members in the Senate and Members in the \nHouse--in a bipartisan way is saying: Let's sit down together and work \nthrough a common set of facts, a common collaborative approach, so that \nbefore more time elapses and positions harden any further, we bring \nsomething together now to sort through these complicated issues.\n  We all need to be working, as I said before, from the same set of \nfacts. We need a framework for collaborative conversation. Too often I \nhave heard from law enforcement and tech in recent months that we need \nto get into a room and try to sort these things through. Unfortunately, \na static, American-only solution won't get us solving the problem. I \nbelieve it will simply drive the bad guys, the criminals and \nterrorists--at least the smart ones, anyway--off of American \ntechnology, away from American platforms, and move more and more \ncriminals and terrorists to foreign-based hardware and software and at \nthe end of the day actually make the safety and security of the United \nStates far more out of reach.\n  I know at the outset some of my colleagues here questioned whether a \ncommission is the right way, done too often. Congress has used \ncommissions in the past to punt the solution. The model we have taken, \nworking with great assistance from Senator Collins, is the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  In the event of a national tragedy, a congressionally mandated \nCommission came together on a series of policy recommendations, the \noverwhelming majority of which were implemented by the Congress. That \nis why the 16-member Commission, modelled after the 9/11 Commission, \nhas been endorsed by a wide range of stakeholders, from the tech \nsector, to respected academic and legal experts and distinguished \nnational security figures. As a matter of fact--and this doesn't happen \nthat often--our Commission proposal has even been endorsed by the \neditorial boards of both the Wall Street Journal and the Washington \nPost. These validators agree with us: A bipartisan, bicameral Digital \nSecurity Commission is a productive path forward.\n  All these issues are not easy. What is great about America is that we \nare a country of innovators and of problem-solvers. I know that if we \nstop talking past each other and put the right people in a room, we can \nfind the right solutions that protect us all, and then Congress can \nact.\n  Mr. President, I know we are going to hear from a number of my \ncolleagues. I would like to now yield the floor to my friend and \ncolleague on this issue, the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Gardner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia for his work on this and his \nhistory in the telecom business and his understanding of the \ncomplicated issues set before us. There are no simple answers. There is \nno black-and-white way to proceed here. There is no yes or no that we \ncan reach because of the complicated set of factors before us when it \ncomes to balancing our security needs and balancing our privacy needs \nat the same time.\n  In fact, I am reminded of when I was in the State legislature and \nlegislation we worked on several years ago. We were trying to figure \nout what to do when it came to criminal acts over the Internet. At the \ntime this bill passed, most people were using BlackBerrys. I don't know \nif the iPhone had been invented yet. They described in the statute that \nthe legislature was working on--it was dealing with the issue of \nInternet luring of a child, and when they wrote the language, they used \ntechnical language. And when presented with a case under the statute \ntrying to charge somebody with Internet luring of a child, a judge \nactually said: Well, since the defendant, the perpetrator, was using a \nBlackBerry--we don't define the BlackBerry as a computer; therefore, \nthis offense of Internet luring of a child won't apply in this \nparticular case. That was because at the time, the legislature tried to \ndescribe in very definite terms a black-and-white answer to technology \nthat had evolved or that everybody thought would be understood that \nthis is a computer or this is the Internet. A judge said: No, that is \nnot the case. So we had to address that issue in later years to try to \novercome and understand the technology in ways that allow technology to \nevolve, that allow new technologies to emerge, but also make sure we \nare passing laws to provide protection to victims of crimes--in this \ncase, an innocent child.\n  So when we are dealing with this issue of privacy and security and \nencryption, Congress ought to be the first body to admit there is no \nsingle person in here who can say: I have every answer. I have every \nsolution. Choose me. Choose my bill. This is the way forward.\n  I applaud my colleague, Senator Warner from Virginia, for the work he\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\nis doing, along with Senator Collins, myself, and Chairman McCaul in \nthe House of Representatives, to try to find that solution to a very \nnuanced issue. This challenge with encryption that we face today is \nsignificant.\n  Encryption, as we know, is a technology designed to prevent \nunauthorized access to data and information. It is a code or series of \ncodes put in place to put a lock on valuable things and trivial things \nalike, as the case may be when it comes to encryption. No matter how \nyou describe what it is or what it is protecting, there is no doubt \nthat it has been an enabler of global commerce in an increasingly \ninterconnected age. It is that blanket that keeps our credit card \nnumbers safe and our bank account numbers safe. It is the underpinning \nof financial success for businesses such as eBay, Amazon, iTunes, and \nmore. But it can also be used, as we have seen, perhaps to cover bad \nactors, to cover their actions, creating a safe harbor sometimes for \npeople who don't deserve to have a safe harbor. It can be an \nimpenetrable cage around crimes, a powerful tool that is used to thwart \nlaw enforcement and lawful investigations, a blockade that is too \ndifficult to penetrate for law enforcement.\n  So this bill that you have put forward, this Digital Commission that \nwill be comprised of experts around the country on issues of privacy, \non security, on encryption, to try to find the right balance between \nwhat is it that we need in this country to protect our national \nsecurity, to find bad actors who are trying to hide bad things with \ninnocent technologies--this is to craft policies in an open manner that \nwe can then turn to and look at to make sure we are protecting privacy, \nprotecting encryption, that we are not offshoring the problem, allowing \nothers to hide by technology made offshore, but that we have a solution \nhere in Congress that takes into account evolving encryption techniques \nand technologies, respecting people's privacy rights as well. While \nthere is a darker side to some users of innovations we have unleashed, \nwe have great benefits from the innovations we have created that have \nenhanced our way of life and our quality of life.\n  So to Senator Warner, my colleagues in the Senate, and the Chair, I \nwould congratulate the Senator on his good work and the work so many of \nus have done to try to find this balance of security, privacy, and to \nmake sure we are giving no quarter to people who wish to do this Nation \nharm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, he stated that correctly. This is not an \neither/or circumstance. We have to protect Americans' privacy. We have \nto make sure we protect Americans' lives and liberty from criminals and \nterrorists. We also need to ensure that we continue to promote American \ninnovation. And I believe there is a way through this, and I appreciate \nhis good work as we move forward on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let me ask someone who has seen this process work before, a longtime \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Homeland Security \nCommittee who helped shape this legislation, my friend and colleague \nfrom Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Digital Security \nCommission Act, a bill that will establish a national bipartisan \ncommission to examine digital security and privacy and the ``going \ndark'' problem that poses a real challenge for those responsible for \nour national security and for protecting the American public.\n  Let me commend the primary author of this bill, the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, for his expertise in putting together not only a \nwell-balanced commission but also a broad array of cosponsors in \nsupport of this important legislation.\n  Senior administration officials--the FBI Director first among them--\nhave been vocal in articulating the problem of terrorists and criminals \ngoing dark, with the result that our intelligence agencies and our law \nenforcement are going blind. Director Comey has testified repeatedly to \nthe fact that there are terrorists who are using encrypted \ncommunications to plot attacks against our people, and we know that \ninternational criminal cartels are doing so as well.\n  There are many competing and difficult concerns that need to be \nworked out as we address this complex issue. Under our bill, a national \nand diverse commission will perform its review and then make \nrecommendations that will protect the privacy rights of law-abiding \nindividuals in an era in which terrorists and criminals increasingly \nuse encrypted devices. The Digital Security Commission will have the \nopportunity to make a valuable contribution to this debate, and that is \nthe opportunity our legislation creates.\n  The laws of the United States, unfortunately, have not kept pace with \ntechnology, which has obviously rapidly evolved during the past three \ndecades. As a result, the issues of going dark and preserving personal \nprivacy are ones that we simply must grapple with today and for the \nfuture. To resolve what often are competing concerns will undoubtedly \nrequire a new law.\n  Let me be clear that I personally don't believe that the absence of a \nnew law in any way exempts a company or an individual from complying \nwith a court order issued by a Federal judge. In the San Bernardino \nterrorism case, Apple has been ordered by a Federal judge to provide \ntechnical assistance to help the FBI access data on a cell phone that \nwas used by one of the terrorists involved in killing 14 people and \ninjuring 22 others.\n  Here is an important fact that has been overlooked in many of the \nreports on this crime. Given that this phone was owned by the county, \nwhich has given its permission for the data to be retrieved--and I bet \nthat is a critical point here--and that the court order is narrowly \ntailored, I believe Apple should reconsider its position as it relates \nto this particular case.\n  In the long run, however, it is clear that we need a new law and a \ndialogue among the administration, Congress, Federal and State law \nenforcement, and the tech community in order to deal with this issue.\n  It is appalling to me that there have been no legislative proposals \nsubmitted by the White House or any other Federal agency to guide us on \nthis issue. At a time when the administration has been notably absent \nin the offering of a legislative proposal to address these important \nand complex issues, the practical solutions that I believe would come \nfrom the Digital Security Commission would be most welcome by the \nCongress and would help us and guide us as we draft a new law.\n  To be sure, these are difficult issues to resolve. And I believe that \nif you surveyed the cosponsors of this bill, you would find all sorts \nof different views on the cases that are before us. Indeed, the courts \nhave reached different opinions. While I do not expect that the \nCommissioners will see eye to eye on every recommendation, we can have \nconfidence that the final report will reflect the consensus judgment of \na supermajority of the Commissioners who are selected in equal numbers \nby Republicans and Democrats. The final report must be supported by at \nleast three-quarters of the Commission to ensure that no recommendation \nrepresents the view of just a few stakeholders. When we had the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations, one reason they were so powerful in \nenabling us to revamp the intelligence community was their unanimity.\n\n  Again, let me thank Senator Warner for his leadership. I look forward \nto working with him and with my other colleagues, including the Senator \nfrom Maine, Angus King, to make sure that we get this issue right for \nthe challenges we face now and in the decades to come.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins from Maine for her \ncomments today and for her good work on the Intelligence Committee and \nfor her good work on the Homeland Security Committee and the fact that \nshe has thought through these issues in a different framework--when our \ncountry was attacked--after 9/11. I would simply add that if some in \nCongress or elsewhere had come through with this kind of collaboration \na few years back, we might not now be having two cases--one in New York \nand one in California--where, at least it appears\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\nat first blush, the courts are coming at it from very different \ndirections.\n  Let me reemphasize that in America the only solution here could \nsimply drive criminals and terrorists to foreign-based technology, \nhardware, and software. In many ways, to get this right, if we are \ngoing to prevent a balkanization of the Internet, which is not in \nAmerica's interests and not in most countries' interests, we need to at \nleast think through this from an international perspective.\n  Let us hear now from a former Governor, like myself, and a great \nmember of the Intelligence Committee. I thank him for joining in this \neffort. As Senator Collins said, we have a broad breadth of ideological \nviewpoints from these eight bipartisan original sponsors here in the \nSenate, and I think more will be joining us.\n  I would simply add that on a day where a lot of the Nation's focus is \non Super Tuesday and on some of the activities that are taking place in \nthe Presidential debates, it is great to see such responsible Members \nfrom both parties step forward in a bipartisan way to address a very \nserious issue, both today and in the future, for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, when I first entered this body in the winter \nof 2013, I was appointed to the Intelligence Committee. Every Tuesday \nand Thursday, we would meet for several hours talking about very \ndifficult, very complex, and sometimes very scary issues.\n  After sitting through those meetings for several months, it suddenly \ncame to me what our mission in that committee is. It really comes down \nto balancing two provisions of the Constitution. The Preamble to the \nConstitution, which establishes the basic premise for why we have a \ngovernment and why the Constitution was established, uses two important \nphrases in conjunction with each other. The first is ``to ensure \ndomestic Tranquility'' and the second is ``to provide for the common \ndefence.'' There are other elements listed, but that is part of the \nessence of any government: to ensure domestic tranquility and provide \nfor the common defense; in other words, to keep us safe. That is what \ngovernment is all about.\n  But on the other hand, the Bill of Rights, and particularly the \nFourth Amendment, makes it clear that there are limitations on \ngovernment's power in whatever area. The Fourth Amendment says that \n``the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \npapers, and effects shall not be violated'' and also: no unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. Those two provisions are intentional, and they \nhave been since the founding of the Republic. The role of the \nIntelligence Committee and this body, it seems to me, is to constantly \nrecalibrate the balance between those two provisions based upon the \nthreats our country faces and the developments of technology. That is \nreally what this discussion is about. It has been brought into sharp \nfocus in the last two weeks by the case involving Apple and San \nBernardino, as well as other cases around the country.\n  The Apple case points out the complexity and the difficulty of these \nissues. It is not simple. It is easy to say it was a terrorist's phone; \nopen it up and get the information. But then we learn that, No. 1, \nApple is not being asked to simply throw a switch or plug in a wire. It \nis being asked to write new software that would compromise its own \nsoftware protections built into its iPhones all over the world. So it \nis being asked to create something, not simply open the doors. No. 2, \nalthough there has been some discussion about it as ``just this \nphone,'' it is not just this phone. Apple is being asked to create a \nnew piece of software that compromises its operating system in such a \nway that the phone can be hacked. Once that piece of software is \ncreated, there is no telling where it will go. It is referred to in the \ntech literature as the ``golden key'' or the ``God key.'' Sure, Apple \ncould keep it, but it might--who knows, a disgruntled employee could \nlet it out. Apple itself could be hacked. It could fall into the hands \nof our intelligence community. It could then be made public. Once it is \nout there, we can't undo it.\n  What I mean by raising these issues is not that I know what the \nanswers are, but that it is very complicated. And what if Apple creates \nthe key for the San Bernardino phone but it ends up in the hands of \nChina or Russia or Iran or a criminal enterprise, then we have \ncompromised the security of millions of our citizens, and perhaps of \nour country itself.\n  The real point here is this is an issue of immense significance and \npublic policy importance that should not be decided by a single court \nin California or Iowa or New Jersey or anywhere else based upon a 220-\nyear-old law. This is an issue of policy that should be decided here. \nIndeed, in the district court opinion that was written yesterday in New \nYork, that was released yesterday--I stayed up late last night reading \nit--the heart of that opinion was: This is a job for Congress. This is \na policy question. The judge said the people who wrote the All Writs \nAct in 1789, the Judiciary Act of 1789, many of them were the same \npeople who wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. He said he \ncould not believe they meant to import to the judiciary the power to \nmake this kind of policy. That was the fundamental promise of the \nopinion. I commend that opinion to my colleagues. I have been reading \njudicial opinions for about 50 years. It is one of the best I have ever \nread in terms of the research and the footnoting. It is a very, very \nstrong argument, and it makes the case I think very straightforwardly \nthat this decision should not stay in the hands of the court. The real \nissue here is who shall decide this complex and portentous issue.\n  Now, generally, I don't like commission bills. Typically, they are \noften the politicians' way of putting the problem off to someone else \nin the future and we will deal with it later and we will appoint a \nblue-ribbon commission. But I have seen them work. The Senator from \nMaine mentioned the September 11 Commission that I think did excellent \nwork and provided the basis for a great deal of good policy. In Maine \nwe had a commission years ago on workers' comp, which was a very \ndifficult issue in our State, but the commission helped us to get a \npolitical solution that ultimately helped to solve that problem. I have \nseen commissions work, and I think this is exactly the right answer in \nthis particular situation, because the issue is so complicated and \nbecause it involves technology, it involves law, it involves the First \nAmendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and it involves \nnational security. These are important considerations, and we have to \nunderstand the ramifications of these issues before taking action.\n  Now, we may want to and need to address the specific issues raised in \nthe current Apple case on an interim basis. We may decide not to do \nthat, but that is an option whereby we don't necessarily have to wait \nuntil the commission acts because the commission is talking about \nlarger issues. Yes, it is talking about the encryption issue, or would \ntalk about the encryption issue, but it is also dealing with broader \nissues of digital security. So we may want to make an interim decision \nwhile we wait for the work of the commission.\n  I think the important point is that the question before the Senate \nis, Where should this decision be made? I would join my colleague from \nMaine by saying that this problem--this so-called going dark--the \nencryption problem and its constraints upon law enforcement are not new \nthis week. We have been hearing about it in the Intelligence Committee \nand in the Armed Services Committee and generally in the press for 1 \nyear or 2 years, and I believe the law enforcement community or the \nadministration should have come forward with a legislative proposal for \nus to act upon. Of course, I am not absolving myself. We could have \nbrought forth our own proposal. But it was their continuing to raise \nthis issue, and I think it was incumbent upon them to say: Here is how \nI think it should be solved.\n  Now, I know if Mr. Comey were here he would say: Well, we hoped we \nwouldn't have to bother you about this because we were trying to work \nthis out with the technology companies. I understand that. But I wish, \nfrankly, that we had put forth this bill 1 year ago or 2 years ago, and \nthen we would be in the position of answering this question today \ninstead of starting\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\ndown the path of handing this question to a commission that we hope \nwill provide some answers and guidance to us that will help us to make \npolicy.\n  I am delighted to be a cosponsor of this bill. I commend the Senator \nfrom Virginia for spearheading this effort. I think it is one that \ndeserves quick attention here, and it is something that we can move so \nwe can get to work on trying to understand all the ramifications of \nthis decision. We don't want to compromise national security, but we \nalso don't want to compromise personal security. And we don't want to \ncreate something that could redound against national security if it \nfell into the hands of some of our adversaries.\n  So I am delighted to be able to help with this effort. I look forward \nto working with the sponsor and the other cosponsors. Hopefully, this \nis something we can move on with alacrity so that we can bring this \nissue back to this Congress sooner rather than later. We will never \nanswer the questions finally because by the time we get some answers, \nthere will be new developments in technology and new questions. But we \nat least need to bring this debate into the 21st century and try to \nfind a solution that will make sense, both in terms of national \nsecurity and personal security for the citizens of this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a great country. Regardless of \nwhat some people say, this is a great country, and the reason it is \ngreat is that people work. They get up and they produce for this \ncountry. They give their talents. They get paid. They help their \nfamilies. Their kids get educated. We have that ethic of doing our job.\n  That is why it is so shocking to me that the Republicans who are in \ncharge of this Senate refuse to do their job. They said that no matter \nwho the President nominates, they are not even going to hold a hearing \non that person. They say they want a Presidential election. Well, they \nhad two, and their guys lost. I know it is not a happy experience. \nBelieve me, I have lived through it. I have served with Republican \nPresidents and Democratic Presidents. But the world doesn't stop \nbecause you are not happy with who is President. The Constitution tells \nus what we have to do. Here is what article II, section 2, clause 2 \nsays. And I know everyone here swears to uphold this Constitution. I \nwould argue that when my Republican friends state that they are not \ngoing to do their job, they are not going to hold even a hearing on \nwhomever the President nominates for the Supreme Court, which is now \nshort one member, they are defying the Constitution. Maybe they will be \nsued by someone--an aggrieved party. The people of this country are \naggrieved by this attitude.\n\n  Let's read article II, section 2, clause 2, for anyone who cares \nabout the Constitution, and everybody says they do. It says the \nPresident ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and \nConsuls, [and] Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  It doesn't say the President does it alone; it doesn't say the Senate \ndoes it alone; it says they do it together. That is article II, section \n2, clause 2. This Senator advises her colleagues to read it, and if you \ndon't follow it, you are not doing your job. We want them to do their \njob.\n  Now, who else says that it is important? I will tell you--some very \nincredibly respected people. This quote is from Ronald Reagan, one of \nthe heroes of the Republican Party. I served when he was President, and \nhe said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full \nstrength impairs the people's business in that crucially important \nbody.''\n  That is Ronald Reagan.\n  Let's look at Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the \nSupreme Court, a Republican who is very beloved. What a wonderful \nwoman. She made history because Ronald Reagan appointed her and we \nconfirmed her. She said, ``I think we need somebody there''--meaning in \nthe Court--``to do the job now, and let's get on with it.'' This is \nSandra Day O'Connor.\n  So, my Republican friends, you have two extraordinary Republicans \nwhom you love telling you to do your job.\n  It doesn't say in article II, section 2, clause 2: But you don't have \nto do your job if you don't like the President. It doesn't say that. It \njust lays it out pretty straightforwardly. This is article II, section \n2, clause 2. It doesn't say: Don't do this if you don't like the \nPresident. It doesn't say: Don't do this in an election year.\n  As a matter of fact, we voted in an election year. Anthony Kennedy \nwas nominated by Ronald Reagan with a Democratic Congress. And we voted \nin an election year. Do you think we wouldn't have been happier to wait \nand see if we were able to get that Presidency back as Democrats? No, \nwe did what Ronald Reagan asked us to do. We acted responsibly, and we \nfound Anthony Kennedy to be very qualified. He sits on the Court to \nthis day, having been voted on in an election year.\n  It has happened 14 times in our history. The only time we had a \nproblem was back in the Civil War, when our country was obviously under \ntremendous stress. Today, we are one Nation under God, and we should \npull together on this.\n  There are some other things I wanted to read to you. This is what \nMichael Gerhardt, professor of law at the University of North Carolina, \nsaid about the Republican plan not to move on this vacancy:\n\n       Refusing to hold a hearing on a Supreme Court nomination or \n     refusing to take any action on a nomination before it has \n     been made is simply unprecedented in our history. The refusal \n     is not grounded in the Constitution. It is a willful \n     abdication of authority. The Constitution does not seek to \n     have effect at certain times of the year or the session.\n\n  One never knows when something horrible is going to happen. When this \nhappened to Justice Scalia, this was a shock to his family, to the \ncountry. Regardless of whether you agreed with him or not, it was a \nshock. Nothing in the Constitution says if you are shocked about \nsomething that happens, you don't have to work with the President. It \ndoesn't say that. Don't make it up, especially because this is the \nparty that keeps saying they want a strict construction of it. If you \nwant to construe the Constitution in a strict way, you need to act.\n  There is Jamal Greene, professor of law at Columbia. He says: ``The \nSenate has a constitutional duty to give due consideration to anyone \nnominated by the President to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.''\n  He goes on: ``In the modern history of the Nation, there is no \nprecedent for the Senate deliberately refusing to vote on a nominee to \na vacant Supreme Court seat, whether during an election year or at any \nother time.''\n  We have our differences here; we really do. People say: Senator, is \nthat why you are not running again, because it is so hard to do things? \nNo. I love it here. This is just my time to move on and do other things \nand have somebody else come in. I love it here. I love my colleagues. I \nhave friends on both sides of the aisle and I get things done and so do \nthey. You would think that we would agree on the meaning of the \nConstitution--it is simple--and that we wouldn't be arguing about it.\n  I am a little stunned at this failure to step up and do their job. I \nwill tell you this. If you are an average American and you have a job \nand you call your boss and say: ``Hi, Boss. It is Monday morning, and I \njust don't feel like coming to work.''\n  \"Are you sick?''\n  \"No.''\n  \"Do you have a problem with your family?''\n  \"No.''\n  \"Well, what should we do?''\n  \"Well, I am not in the mood. I want to wait.''\n  You would be fired. You would be fired.\n  I am going to be here for the remainder of this year. I want to do my \njob. I want to do my due diligence. I want to have a chance to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here on this issue.\n  Today at the White House, Senator McConnell and Senator Grassley \nreportedly told President Obama that they don't want to do their job. \nThey don't want to do it. They don't care who he sends up. It is \nunreal. It is unbelievable. They want an election.\n\n  We had an election. President Obama didn't get elected for 3 years; \nhe got\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\nelected for 4 years. The next President, whatever party, is going to be \nthere for 4 years until the next election. This person has to do their \njob for 4 years, and we have to do our job. They don't want to hold a \nvote, they don't want to hold a hearing, and many of them say they will \nnot even meet with the nominee.\n  It is our job to be involved in this election. This election of the \nnext Justice is such an important job. The Supreme Court has a job to \ndo. This incredible attitude by my Republican colleagues means that the \nSupreme Court cannot really function the way it is meant to function. \nIt is going to be divided 4 to 4. That is unfair to the people of this \ncountry. Whatever side they are on, this decision needs to be made. As \nRonald Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with the Supreme Court \nbelow full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially \nimportant body.''\n  Here is one of the heroes of the Republicans saying that every day \nthat passes with the Supreme Court below full strength, the people's \nbusiness is, in fact, impaired.\n  Here is what that states. This isn't an argument that is happening in \na vacuum in some fancy boardroom of some law firm, conservative or \nliberal. It is a serious argument that impacts the people. Every year \nthe Court considers cases with profound consequences for our \nconstituents. Again, it doesn't matter what your position is. We need a \nfully functioning Court.\n  I want to give an example, and I see my friend from the State of \nWashington. The Supreme Court is going to hear oral arguments in Whole \nWoman's Health v. Hellerstedt, the most important women's health case \nin a generation. The case is about the unprecedented attacks we are \nseeing on women's health in Texas--which is what this case is about--\nbut also across the Nation. This case is about extreme politicians and \nextreme groups trying to overturn 43 years of settled law.\n  The settled law is very simple. Women have a right to have \nreproductive health care. It is as simple as that. When a series of \nclinics throughout the State are shut down and women have to travel \nhours and hours and hours and maybe even days to get health care, they \neffectively don't have it. That is what has been happening in Texas. \nThat is why this case is so important. There is a Texas law, HB2, that \nwas designed to close health clinics that provide a full range of \nreproductive health care services, including annual exams, pap smears, \nSTD tests, birth control, and, yes, safe and legal abortions--the full \npanoply of services for a woman. This law in Texas singles out women's \nhealth providers with burdensome requirements that have already forced \nmore than half of the clinics in Texas to close.\n  I don't know who gets happy about that, but I don't get happy about \nthat, and nobody who cares about a woman should get happy about that. \nIt is a total outrage. Women are taking matters into their own hands \nbecause they have no access to doctors. The goal of this law--and it is \nworking--is to shut down these clinics and deny to women these rights \nthat they have earned. It would reduce the number of providers in \npractice from 40 to 10. If you are just unfortunate enough to live in \nan area where your clinic is shut down, Lord knows what you do. You may \nbe a single mother, you may be part of a couple where you both work, \nyou may have children, and you may not be able to take days to find \nhealth care.\n  The law is forcing women to travel for hours and some even to other \nStates. Women who live in remote or rural areas may have to stay \novernight or for multiple days to avoid making more than one trip. \nThink about the cost to families who may not be able to do it, who are \njust getting by. Many women simply can't afford to take off work, drive \nfor hundreds of miles, or get on a plane every time they need health \ncare.\n  They want to do their jobs. They want to be responsible. They step up \nto the plate every single day, but we can't do it here because politics \nis playing a part. People have decided they didn't like the fact that \nBarack Obama got elected twice. Well, too bad--he did, and it is your \njob to act.\n  I am sorry you don't like the President. Maybe you don't like the \nfact that he got us out of the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. Maybe you don't like the fact that he cut the deficit by \ntwo-thirds. Maybe you don't like the fact that he got us out of two \nwars. That is your choice, fine, but he has a right to nominate, and we \nhave a responsibility to meet that nominee and to vote up or down on \nhim or her.\n\n  These cases that are pending before the Court--and I am just \nhighlighting this one, and I know Senator Murray will go into depth on \nit--these cases are critical. We need the full bench. I don't care how \nyou feel about the issue. Maybe you support closing down clinics and \ngoing from 40 to 10, letting women suffer, taking matters into their \nown hands. If that is your position, I am sorry, it is not fair, but \nyou have a right to your position--but the Court has a right to be at \nfull strength.\n  I close with just a quote from a woman who has been hurt already by \nthis Texas law which is going to be heard tomorrow in the Court.\n  Marni. Marni had to fly from Austin, TX, to Seattle when her \nappointment was cancelled the night before it was scheduled because the \nclinic was forced to immediately discontinue providing these services \nafter the Texas law took effect. Marni said her first reaction was ``to \nfeel like my rights were being taken away from me, to feel very \ndisappointed that elected officials had the ability to make decisions \nabout my and my fiance's life.''\n  That is Marni. The stakes could not be higher. This is just one of \nthe cases.\n  Finally, the highest Court in our land should be fully functioning. \nThe American people deserve nothing less. I am going to put up the \nSandra Day O'Connor quote for the last time in this talk. She is a \nRepublican woman, first woman to serve, and appointed by Ronald Reagan. \nShe is looking at this Court. She knows what it is like to serve on the \nCourt. She knows how hard the issues are. She understands how important \nit is. She is more important to this debate than anyone in the Senate, \nincluding yours truly. She knows. She didn't say: Wait until the next \nelection to see if my party wins, no. She didn't say that. She said: \n``I think we need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on \nwith it.''\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                  Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, thank you to the Senator from California \nfor her long advocacy on behalf of women across this country to be able \nto access the health care they choose.\n  Tomorrow the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case of \nWhole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. At its core, this is a case about \nwhether extreme rightwing politicians will be allowed to block women \nfrom exercising their constitutionally protected health care rights, \nrights that have been affirmed by the Supreme Court for more than four \ndecades.\n  For women across the country, for our daughters, and for our \ngranddaughters, there is truly a lot at stake. I have been so inspired \nto see women of all ages from across the country standing up now to \nshare their stories and to make sure the Supreme Court knows why \npoliticians should not be able to make women's health care decisions.\n  In fact, 113 lawyers submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court \nexplaining the difference that constitutionally protected reproductive \nrights have made in their own lives. The stories they tell are \nincredibly powerful. One partner at a major law firm wrote that after \nthree miscarriages, ``my husband and I were delighted when I again \nbecame pregnant in December 1999 and safely made it past the `danger \nzone' of the first trimester, passing an amnio with flying colors. \n[But] five weeks later, when I was heading into the sixth month of my \npregnancy, I returned to the doctor for a routine ultrasound and the \ndoctor immediately detected a problem.''\n  Her baby had a rare heart defect, so severe that he was already in \ncongestive heart failure and would be born only to suffer if he \nsurvived at all.\n  After talking with her doctors and her husband, they made the \ndecision to terminate her pregnancy. She wrote:\n\n       As a woman, a mother and a lawyer, I know I did the right \n     thing. I have shared my story with my children, and hope that \n     should my daughter ever find herself in a position similar to \n     mine, she will enjoy the same rights that were available to \n     me.\n\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\n\n  It should go without saying, but politicians have absolutely no place \nin such a deeply personal, extraordinarily difficult decision. \nUnfortunately, the Texas clinic shutdown law being challenged in Whole \nWoman's Health v. Hellerstedt--a law that has been driven by extreme \nrightwing politicians who want to undermine women's access to health \ncare--would mean the exact opposite. This law and laws like the one \nthat was allowed to stand in Louisiana just last week places burdens \nthat health experts, such as the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, say are medically unnecessary on clinics in order to \nshut them down and make it harder for women to exercise their \nconstitutionally protected reproductive rights.\n  If the Supreme Court fails to block this law, three-quarters of the \nclinics that provide abortion services, as well as other health care in \nTexas, would be forced to close, leaving 5.4 million women in Texas \nwith just 10 clinics statewide. Hundreds of thousands of Texas women \nwould have to drive 300 miles round trip just to get care they need.\n  If that is not an undue burden, I don't know what is. A ruling \nupholding the Texas shutdown law wouldn't just impact women in Texas, \nit would make it easier nationwide for politicians to interfere with \nwomen's health care and block them from exercising their constitutional \nright. That would be the wrong direction for women. It would be the \nwrong direction for families and for our country as a whole.\n  That is why tomorrow women and men from all over the country will be \noutside the Supreme Court standing up for women's health, rights, and \nopportunity. I will be very proud to be right there with them because \nwe are going to be sending a very clear message. A right means nothing \nwithout the ability to exercise that right.\n  I hope the Justices listen, realizing how much this ruling means to \nwomen's lives. Ultimately, I hope they will rule in favor of ensuring \nwomen's health and rights continue to progress, rather than going \nbackward. I know our country will be stronger for it.\n  Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator Whitehouse and \nall of our colleagues who have worked very hard to bring this bill \nbefore us on the floor, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. \nIt lays out key steps toward addressing the crisis of prescription drug \nabuse and heroin addiction, which is ruining and costing lives \nnationwide, including in my home State of Washington.\n  I hear about this epidemic from Washington State families and \ncommunities far too often. Parents ask me what we are doing in Congress \nto help families like theirs who are trying desperately to help their \nchildren who are struggling to escape addiction. I am told about \nmothers and fathers who developed opioid addictions after being \nprescribed pain medication, with devastating consequences for their \nfamilies.\n  When I go to speak with local sheriffs and police chiefs, they say \nthey are most often the ones responding to these crises and that our \ncountry needs to do better than allowing those struggling with \naddiction to cycle in and out of the criminal justice system. They tell \nme that heroin use is only becoming more widespread in our communities, \nespecially amongst our young people.\n  Penny LeGate is a former news anchor from Seattle and she knows this \nall too well. Her daughter, Marah Williams, had a happy childhood, \nballet lessons, softball, a close-knit family, but in middle school, as \nshe began to struggle with ADHD, depression, and anxiety, she also \nstarted experimenting with drinking and drugs. For years her parents \ntried everything they could do. As Penny will tell you, Marah did too. \nShe fought hard to break her addiction and to keep her life moving \nforward, but tragically, when Marah began using OxyContin and then \nheroin, the grip of addiction was just too much. Marah died of a heroin \noverdose in the basement of her family home when she was just 19 years \nold. This is a parent's worst nightmare. It is happening to parents \nacross my State, across the country, and it has to stop.\n  I am pleased there is bipartisan momentum toward giving our \ncommunities the tools and resources they need to tackle this disease. \nThe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, includes efforts to \nstrengthening education, prevention, and treatment efforts around \nprescription drug abuse and heroin use. It will cut down on \ninappropriate use of pain medication that gets so many people addicted \nto opioids in the first place and would make it easier for people to \nsafely dispose of pain medication so it doesn't get in the wrong hands. \nThis legislation will also help police departments get access to \nnaloxone, a drug that counteracts the effect of an overdose, which is \nsomething police chiefs I have spoken to make clear they need--and \nmore.\n  The bill we are debating right now would be a good step in the right \ndirection, but it can be even better. As many of my Democratic \ncolleagues have made clear, a problem as serious and urgent as this \nepidemic deserves a serious, urgent response. So we should enact the \npolicies in this bill and at the same time we should also make sure \nfamilies and communities will see additional tools and resources as \nquickly as possible. That is why I strongly support the emergency \ninvestments proposed by the senior Senators from New Hampshire, West \nVirginia, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, and others. Their \nproposal will actually help our States and local governments, as well \nas families who are on the frontlines of this battle, by providing the \nresources to prevent opioid abuse and expand access to the treatment \nthat so many families are seeking.\n  I am hopeful Republicans will work with us to move this alongside \nthis important bill so families don't have to wait for Federal \nresources that this crisis desperately needs.\n  As I have laid out, the legislation we are debating today would go a \nlong way toward tackling the epidemic of prescription drug abuse and \nheroin addiction, especially if it includes an emergency funding that \ncan offer relief and support quickly, but given the strong belief on \nboth sides of the aisle that far too many people are falling through \nthe cracks in our mental health and substance abuse systems, I believe \nwe can and should do more to build on this CARA legislation in the \ncoming months.\n  We should pass this bill, but then I hope all of our colleagues will \nnot just get up and walk away. We should build on this rare moment of \nbipartisan agreement, stay at the table, and keep working beyond this \nbill to strengthen mental health care and substance abuse treatment in \nour country.\n  So even while we are debating this very first step, I wish to lay out \njust a few of the goals that should guide us as we look past this, \ngoals I believe that can be met if we work together and take this \ncrisis seriously.\n  First, mental health is every bit as important as physical health, \nand we should make sure we work together to make sure they are both \ntreated equally in our health care system; secondly, we should do more \nto break down the barriers that make it difficult to address patients' \nmental and physical health care needs at the same time; third, at a \ntime when half of all U.S. counties lack access to a social worker, a \npsychologist or a psychiatrist, we need to strengthen our mental health \ncare workforce so patients and families can get care when and where \nthey need it, whether that is at a hospital or in their own community; \nfourth, we need to recognize that mental health care is important at \nevery stage of life and ensure our system can address every patient's \nneeds, whether that patient is a child or an adult; and, finally, \ncontinue taking steps to address the opioid abuse epidemic, I believe \nwe can do more to expand access to medication-assisted treatment and \noffer our States more resources to respond to crisis situations, \nincluding by strengthening prescription drug monitoring programs.\n  My colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have worked very hard to \nimprove prevention and treatment of opioid addiction, especially among \nindividuals who pass through the criminal justice system. I believe we \nneed to ensure these tools and resources are available to all Americans \nstruggling with addiction and ensure that our health care system is \nequipped to address addiction as a disease.\n  I have been proud to work with the junior Senator from Connecticut \nand other members of the HELP Committee on both sides of the aisle, led \nby\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\nChairman Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, on a path toward \nmeeting those goals. I am very hopeful we will be able to reach \nagreement on some additional steps that would make a difference for the \nmany families and communities who are struggling to support loved ones \nin need.\n  Mr. President, it goes without saying that in this divided government \nwe don't agree on much, but there is some important bipartisan \nagreement on the need to close the gaps in our mental health care \nsystem and tackle the crisis of opioid addiction. So I hope we can pass \nthe legislation we are debating today, along with improvements that \nensure it helps patients and families as quickly as possible, but we \nshouldn't stop there. We should seize this opportunity, work together, \nand continue making progress for the families and communities we serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in favor \nof the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Senator Whitehouse and \nI have been working on this together for years, along with Senator \nPortman and Senator Ayotte, so this bill has been bipartisan from the \nbeginning. I thank my colleagues, and I also thank Senator Grassley and \nSenator Leahy for their leadership in bringing this to the floor and \nall members of our committee, including the Presiding Officer, who have \ncontributed to this bill.\n  Our Nation is facing a serious problem with drug addiction, and I am \nglad to join my colleagues today to talk about how we can tackle this \nproblem and work toward a solution by passing this bipartisan bill. \nJust last week I was out in Montevideo, MN, and we gathered together \nsome people from the town. It is a town of a couple thousand people. \nOur goal was to just talk about this problem. I was shocked that early \nin the morning on a Saturday we had 50 people there. We had every \ndoctor in the town there, to my knowledge. We had the sheriff there, \nthe police chief there.\n  At one point a regular citizen who was there, who had suffered from \nsome diseases and had been in the hospital, actually emptied out her \npurse and tons of medications and opioids came rolling out onto the \ntable that she hadn't used. It was an image I will not forget and an \nimage I bring to the Senate floor to remind us there are too many of \nthese drugs out in our communities.\n  I heard stories of young children who had dealers--people who were \ntrying to get the opioids--actually saying to them: Hey, I will give \nyou a beer if you will go to your parents' medical cabinets and look \nfor these drugs, and they would write them down for them. The kids \nwould then go, get the drugs, and bring them back.\n  There was a story of one doctor who was treating someone, thought he \nwas pretty normal. He had back pain, and the doctor had given him some \npainkillers for years. Then, all of a sudden, one day the Secret \nService shows up because this man had actually made a threat on the \nlife of the President. He had an entire nightlife that was different \nthan his day life, and it was completely dictated by the fact he was \naddicted to prescription drugs.\n  Four out of five heroin users get their start these days from \nprescription drugs. I don't think anyone would have ever imagined that. \nWhen I was growing up, when we saw heroin addicts on the corner or when \nI was a prosecutor for years, we never had those kinds of statistics. \nPeople got hooked on heroin because they got hooked on heroin. They \nstarted with heroin and they, sadly, would end with heroin. In this \ncase, we have 80 percent of people becoming addicted because they have \na surgery because they have back pain. They then get too much of the \ndrug or no one figures out that getting hooked on the drug is worse \nthan the pain they had in the first place, and they get hooked on the \ndrug.\n  We also have stories of overdoses of people who are not even taking \nthe drugs for periods of time. So we have a crisis in this country, and \nwhen I met with those people in Montevideo, it hit home to me that it \ncan happen at any time.\n  We didn't pick this town because they were having a big crisis or \nbecause they had a number of deaths. We just happened to be in that \narea of the State and decided we wanted to focus on the issue.\n  Before I was elected to the Senate, I spent 8 years serving as chief \nprosecutor in Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. Drug cases \nmade up about one-third of our caseload, which meant we handled \neverything from trafficking and selling to production and \nmanufacturing. From this position, I had an opportunity to see \nfirsthand the devastating impact of drug addiction.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Indiana has arrived. I am \nmanaging the bill for this hour, and if he wants to speak, I can go \nback and finish my remarks later. I will just finish up while he is \ngetting back to his desk.\n  I was talking about my time as county attorney. Many of those people \nwho were affected by addiction that we saw were hooked on opioids, \nincluding both heroin and we saw the start of this prescription \npainkiller epidemic.\n  We would be sadly mistaken if we think drug abuse only happens in our \ncities or the metropolitan areas of our States. As I saw this weekend--\nwhen I met with some of our people--Beltrami County, MN, received three \nemergency calls for heroin overdoses in 1 day. One of those individuals \npassed away. So this is happening every day.\n  Mr. President, I am going to turn it over now to Senator Coats of \nIndiana. I see he is here to support this bipartisan bill, but I thank \nthe Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nMinnesota. I am here to talk about opioid abuse as well, although I am \ntrying to combine two speeches. Since we are now talking about the \nopioids abuse and drug addiction, I am more than happy to listen to the \nSenator from Minnesota finish her speech. I thank her for the time, but \nI want to make sure I am not also unduly holding my colleague back as I \nflip through my weekly ``Waste of the Week'' because I can delay that, \nif necessary.\n  Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues here. I believe all of us \nare deeply concerned about the drug addiction epidemic that is sweeping \nthrough our Nation. It is an epidemic for people of all ages, but it is \nmost tragically an epidemic for our young people who feel a sense of \nimmortality when they are young and often fall prey to the ``just try \nit, it is harmless, don't worry about the addiction.'' Obviously, that \nis not the case. We are talking about highly addictive drugs and heroin \nthat is coming into our country, and we are talking about serious \nconsequences of this.\n  In our States, as in every other State, it is a major crisis, and we \nare trying to do everything we can to address that. In one county \nalone, we have had an unprecedented rural HIV outbreak as a result of \nthe sharing of needles to inject opioids. These needles that are \nproviding the kind of drug addiction we read about every day.\n  It is clear the legislation before us is a comprehensive approach, \nand that is needed. As I have said, I think we have to have an all-\nhands-on-deck effort here, whether it is prevention, whether it is law \nenforcement to keep the drugs from coming in or whether it is \ntreatment. It is all three, and it requires not only those three \ncomponents but communities and community organizations, whether \nFederal, State, local, or volunteer organizations, such as the various \ncharities that are operating and their volunteers who are stepping up. \nAll of us need to get involved in all aspects of dealing with this.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor the bill Senators Portman and Whitehouse \nhave worked on, CARA, which has been talked about on the Senate floor. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. The \nlegislation includes a provision Senator Blumenthal and I, on a \nbipartisan basis, have offered, which authorizes individuals who are \nauthorized by the State to write prescriptions for controlled \nsubstances, such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, to \naccess State prescription drug monitoring programs--so-called PDMPs--to \nreduce drug abuse. I will not go into the details of that program, but \nit has been very successful in terms of providing the transparency and \nthe information necessary so we can control prescriptions and the \noutput of drugs\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\nthat are perhaps prescribed for legitimate purposes but are used for \nillegitimate reasons.\n  For all of that, I look forward to our being able to work through \nthis legislation and to successfully pass this legislation and move it \non through the Congress and to the President.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. President, if I could also, ask for the indulgence of my \ncolleague from Minnesota, to talk briefly about my waste of the week. I \nthink this is the 35th or 36th week. I have almost lost track of the \nnumber of weeks I have been down here. Every week the Senate has been \nin session I have been down, with maybe one or two exceptions, talking \nabout the waste of the week.\n  Waste of the weeks are simply issues documented, through a \nnonpartisan process, of waste, fraud, and abuse that occur through the \nirresponsible spending and oversight of our bureaucracies here in \nWashington. Today I am highlighting two policies that have occurred \nwithin the State Department and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Frankly, I could be talking about every agency in the Federal \nGovernment that has fallen prey to a lack of oversight. We have come to \nthe point where we have identified over these ``Waste of the Week'' \nspeeches well over $150 billion of documented waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  These are issues that have been raised through inspections and \nanalysis by the Government Accountability Office by the inspectors \ngeneral of various agencies whose job it is to delve in and find out \nhow the taxpayer money is being spent--is it being spent for the \nlegitimate purpose of providing the service that is needed or is there \na problem either in mismanagement or through waste or are criminals and \nothers taking advantage of the program? I have now documented, as I \nsaid, 35 of those cases totaling well over $150 billion.\n  Today we want to look at two agencies as examples of this. I can go \nthrough every agency, but we will take two today. One is the State \nDepartment. Let me note it is estimated that changing the policies here \ncould save the taxpayers an estimated $295.6 million. That is not small \nchange. Just addressing these two agencies $295-plus million it will \nsave.\n  Let me go into a little bit of detail. State Department employees \nlocated overseas--those serving in embassies or consulates--have access \nto what is called a purchase card. The concept is OK. The idea is that \nrather than go through all the paperwork and processing and sending \nback to the United States, employees can say: Look, we need some office \nsupplies. We didn't order enough initially. We need to pick up 100 \nScotch tape containers or pens or who knows what. A purchase card is \ngiven to those employees who are responsible for providing those \nsupplies to make what is called simple transactions.\n  To prevent the wasteful use or fraudulent use of these purchase \ncards, Federal law and State Department guidelines require all \ntransactions meet certain eligibility criteria and be continually \nmonitored. We know from experience that mistakes are made. We know from \nexperience that fraud is committed. One of those key eligibility \ncriteria is that all of the purchase receipts have to be retained for a \nminimum of 3 years. That is so inspectors general can go back and look \nat what the purchase is, look at the receipt, make sure everything is \nup to speed and done within the law.\n  However, a recent report by the State Department inspector general \nhas revealed that overseas employees have been told they do not have to \nsend any purchase documentation to their supervisors in Washington for \nfurther review. All they need to do is keep the receipts of the \npurchases for a 3-year period of time so that if those assessments are \nevaluated, when someone comes back and says ``We heard there is a \nproblem here,'' they will have the receipts to verify whether the \npurchases were legitimate or not. That is the ``trust but verify'' that \nI think is important for dealing with these kind of situations.\n\n  When the State Department inspector general tried to access the \ndocumentation for purchase card transactions as required by the law and \nby State Department regulation, he found that many of the overseas \noffices didn't keep their transaction records. As an example, in fiscal \nyear 2014, the inspector general found that more than half of overseas \noffices either didn't perform reviews of purchase card transactions as \nthey are required to do or didn't even respond to the inspector \ngeneral's request to produce the documentation. The report determined \nthat during 2013 and 2014, there were $53.6 million in unaccounted \npurchases. That is unacceptable.\n  If you take a job, you are told: Here is your card. If you need to \nbuy something locally and don't want to go through all the rigmarole of \npurchasing and sending documentation overseas and so forth, you can use \nthis purchase card. But you have to keep the documents if you do this \nbecause you are going to be reviewed. Someone is going to come over \nhere and say: Prove it.\n  Yet the State Department has basically said: Don't worry about it. \nYou don't have to keep those--probably thinking that they will never \ncome over and follow up on this. So that $53.6 million in unaccounted-\nfor purchases at this rate, over a 10-year period of time, amounts to \nabout $263 million in unknown and unverified purchases just within the \nState Department's overseas offices. Who knows what is going on here?\n  Secondly, I want to talk about the Federal Aviation Administration \nbecause they have a similar situation that was inspected by their \ninspector general. He found that many employees do not comply with the \nguidelines, and the employees are not consistently held responsible for \nsafeguarding their assigned equipment and supplies, such as digital \ncameras, laptops, and any other number items. As a result, the Federal \nAviation Administration IG, the Inspector General, found that there are \nnearly 15,000 pieces of equipment and material that employees may not \nbe able to locate. The combined value of that missing property is over \n$32.5 million.\n  To make matters worse, the IG report states that the FAA division \nthat essentially lost $32.5 million worth of equipment doesn't even \nhave the authority to hold employees accountable. Not a bad job, right? \nIt is as if they are saying don't worry: If you mess up, if you do \nsomething illegal, fraudulent, or you are just sloppy you're not \nresponsible, if you don't know where the equipment is, if you don't \nkeep track of it, you will not have to be accountable for that lost \nequipment.\n  No American business could function this way and stay solvent. But \nwalk back an employee there and say: ``What happened to the new laptop \nthat we gave you 6 months ago?''\n  They would say: ``I don't know. I don't know where it is. I need \nanother one.''\n  ``That's fine. Don't worry. This happens all the time. We will give \nyou a new one.''\n  On and on it goes. That division of the FAA essentially has lost \n$32.5 million worth of equipment, and, again, it doesn't even hold its \nemployees accountable.\n  We have racked up nearly $19 trillion of debt in this country. No one \ncan explain how large an amount of money that is. What we do know is \nthat we are continuing to plunge into debt, and we are going to keep \ndoing that. One of the ways we can be more accountable here is what I \nhave just described.\n  I know my time is running out. With that, I am going to add this week \nto our accumulating waste $295.6 million for these unknown, unverified \npurchases, bringing our total now to $157.5 billion. It is time to put \na stop to this. It is time to enforce these rules and regulations. It \nis time to be sensitive to the fact that we are wasting hard-earned \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  With that, keeping on schedule, I thank my colleague from Minnesota \nfor the time which she has yielded, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak in\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\nfavor of our bill, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I \nthank Senator Whitehouse, Senator Portman, and the Presiding Officer \nfor their leadership. We have worked together on a bipartisanship basis \non this bill from the beginning. Our Nation, as we know, is facing a \nserious problem with drug addiction, and I am glad to join my \ncolleagues to talk about how we can handle this problem and how we can \ndo something about it.\n  Earlier in my speech today I referred to a group that I met with in \nMontevideo, MN, with only a few days' notice. All the doctors in the \ntown showed up. The sheriff, the police chief, and regular constituents \npoured a bunch of medications on the table to show how much we are \nseeing in terms of overprescription and how this can so easily get in \nthe wrong hands or turn people into addicts.\n  I came to this issue first as a prosecutor. I spent 8 years serving \nas the chief prosecutor in Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. \nDrug cases made up about one-third of our caseload, which meant we \nhandled everything from trafficking and selling to production and \nmanufacturing. From this position, I had an opportunity to see \nfirsthand the devastating impacts of drug addiction. Many of those \naffected were hooked on opiates, including both heroin and prescription \npain medication. But even when I left that office in 1998, I didn't see \nanything near what we are seeing today. We were starting to see the \nbeginnings of the addiction on prescription drugs, but nothing like we \nare seeing today. In fact, four out of five heroin users are getting \ntheir start by misusing prescription drugs.\n  We would be sadly mistaken if we thought this was only an urban \nproblem. We know it is a huge problem in our rural areas. In Beltrami \nCounty, MN, just this past weekend there were three emergency calls for \noverdoses. One of those people passed away. That is a rural county in \nour State on one weekend.\n  Many of those who have been affected by this epidemic are young \npeople. Over just 6 months in 2013, three people died of opiate \noverdoses and another three were hospitalized for overdosing on heroin \nin one 7,000-person town in Minnesota. These statistics and stories are \ntroubling, and they show why we must focus on both treatment and \nprevention.\n  Minnesota is home to Hazelden Betty Ford Addiction Treatment Center. \nWe are proud of the work and the leadership our State shows when it \ncomes to treatment--one of the reasons I got involved in this issue. \nHazelden Betty Ford has had impressive success with its comprehensive \nopiate response program. Their program offers the best of both worlds: \nlifesaving medicine to help treat the medical causes of addiction, as \nwell as counseling to help people get on the right path.\n  However, too many people have been unable to get the treatment they \nneed. Almost 10 percent of Americans are estimated to need treatment \nfor issues related to drug and alcohol, but only about 1 percent \nreceives treatment at a specialty facility. That is why my colleagues \nand I have come together to introduce this bill.\n  Our bill covers strategies for prevention, evidence-based programs \nsuch as strengthening prescription drug monitoring programs--something \nI worked on with the Presiding Officer. These types of programs help \nStates track data on controlled substances like opioids so that when \nthey are dispensed, they can be a strong, effective tool in making sure \nthat they are used for the right reasons.\n  This last week I was near the South Dakota border. There were doctors \nwho knew patients were also going into South Dakota to get \nprescriptions. It was very difficult for them to trace what was going \non--which pharmacy they would go to in rural areas. They could drive an \nhour and go to a different pharmacy, drive another hour and go to a \ndifferent pharmacy--maybe see a different doctor in South Dakota and \nmaybe check into an emergency room somewhere else. That is going on \ntoday in our country.\n  Another important provision in our bill will help make drugs less \naccessible by providing consumers with safe and responsible ways to \ndispose of unused prescription drugs. According to the DEA, more than \n2,700 tons of expired, unwanted prescription medications have been \ncollected through these programs since the drug take-back law that we \npassed in 2010 was put into place. That is a bill I worked on with \nSenator Cornyn, who is also on the Judiciary Committee with me. It is \ncalled the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act. It took a long \ntime for the DEA to get their act together to get the rules up. The \nrules came up, and guess what. Literally, a few months later, Walgreens \nhas now said they will offer kiosks and places for people to return \ndrugs on a nationwide basis. Right now, we have law enforcement doing \nit. Minnesota is at the front of the curve. We have some of our \nlibraries taking these drugs into secure facilities. But the best would \nbe that the places where people got the drugs would also be taking back \nthe drugs. So we are glad that bill has finally helped in that way.\n  We believe this bill before us today will help even more. We also \nhave in this bill increasing the availability of naloxone, which is \nused to save lives in emergency overdose situations and a number of \nthings that are going to be helpful going forward. This bill is a \nframework, but it is an important step forward that the Federal \nGovernment is finally saying to the Congress and the Senate that we \nneed to take steps here.\n  Our bill has the support of a broad range of stakeholders, including \nthe National District Attorneys Association, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse \nDirectors, Faces and Voices of Recovery, and the Major County Sheriffs' \nAssociation.\n  Finally, we must also recognize that combating this kind of drug \nabuse will require a serious investment of resources. It is for that \nreason that I have cosponsored Senator Shaheen's amendment to \nappropriate emergency funding to address the heroin and opioid drug \nabuse epidemic. I am hopeful that the Senate will come together to curb \nthe problem of prescription drug abuse and save lives across our \nNation. I am hopeful we will pass the amendment as well as our bill. I \nthink there will be a number of other good amendments that are \nconsidered, including medical education and other things that need to \nbe done here.\n  I see this bill as the beginning and not an end. I think more work is \ngoing to have to be done with funding. I think more work is going to \nhave to be done with the prescription drug monitoring. We have a start \nhere. But when people and addicts are crossing State lines, when we \nhave a very difficult situation with trying to regulate where the drugs \nare and how many are going out--I figure that if a Target in my State \ncan find a pair of shoes in Hawaii with a SKU number, we should be able \nto figure out if people are getting too many prescription drugs. We \nshould be able to educate our doctors so they are not giving them out \nin quantities that are too big. These are some of the things I am going \nto continue working on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, each of us has taken an oath to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States. President George \nWashington called the Constitution the guide that he would never \nabandon. The Constitution declares itself to be the supreme law of the \nland, and more than 90 percent of Americans say it is very important to \nthem. Unfortunately, basic knowledge about the Constitution is \ndangerously inadequate. I say this is dangerous because, as James \nMadison put it, only a well-instructed people can be permanently a free \npeople.\n  The current debate over when to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left \nby Justice Antonin Scalia's death only magnifies my concern. Ignorance \nof not only how the Constitution applies to this question but even what \nthe Constitution says apparently extends far and wide.\n  Here is the text of the Constitution regarding the appointment of \njudges\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\nand other public officials: The President ``shall have Power . . . [to] \nnominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of \nthe United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \nfor, and which shall be established by Law.''\n  I could hardly read that on the chart from this side here. I should \nhave done it by memory.\n  The President ``shall have Power . . . [to] nominate, and by and with \nthe Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the \nsupreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose \nAppointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be \nestablished by Law.''\n  This is what the Constitution actually says, right here for everyone \nto read. The Constitution gives power to nominate to the President and \ngives the power of advice and consent to the Senate. It says nothing \nabout how the President and the Senate should exercise their separate \npowers. In fact, the judicial confirmation process has been conducted \nin different ways, at different times, and under different \ncircumstances.\n  Our job is to determine how, under current circumstances, best to \nexercise our power of advice and consent. Several factors convince me \nthat the best way to do so is to defer the confirmation process for \nfilling this vacancy until the next President takes office.\n  First, this is only the third Supreme Court vacancy in nearly a \ncentury to occur after the American people had already started voting \nfor the next President. In the previous two instances, 1956 and 1968, \nthe Senate did not confirm a nominee until the year after the \nPresidential election.\n  Second, the only time the Senate has ever confirmed a nominee to fill \na Supreme Court vacancy created after Presidential election voting had \nbegun was 1916. That vacancy arose only because Justice Charles Evans \nHughes resigned to run against President Woodrow Wilson, a completely \ndifferent situation than we have before us today.\n  Third, the judicial confirmation process has become increasingly \ncombative, especially for the Supreme Court. Attempting to conduct this \nprocess in the middle of an already divisive Presidential election \ncampaign would be especially difficult.\n  Fourth, President Obama's judicial appointees and Justice Scalia \nrepresent two radically different kinds of judge. This offers the \nAmerican people a unique opportunity to express, through the election, \ntheir view of the direction the judiciary should take by electing the \nPresident who will make judicial appointments in the next 4 years.\n  In June 1992, then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, a \nfriend of mine, made the very recommendation that we are following \ntoday based on some of the very same factors that I just mentioned. In \nparticular, he noted that the appointment process would take place in \ndivided Government during a Presidential election process that was \nalready under way. He could have been describing 2016 instead of 1992.\n  The Constitution does not mandate a particular process to address \nthis Supreme Court vacancy. We have to look all the way back to the \n19th century to find a year in which the Senate confirmed a Supreme \nCourt nominee of the other party in a Presidential election year. That, \nof course, was long before the courts became as powerful and the \nconfirmation process as confrontational as they are today. Democrats \ncan read the Constitution and understand the historical and political \nfacts as well as anyone else. Why then are they making such bizarre \nclaims?\n\n  Last week, for example, the minority whip said that the Constitution \nrequires ``a fair hearing and a timely vote.'' He claimed that this \nconclusion comes from the plain text of the Constitution. Well, I have \nthe plain text up here, and it clearly says nothing whatsoever about \nhearings or votes. As I said, the Constitution gives the power to \nnominate to the President and the power of advise and consent to the \nSenate and leaves to each the judgment about how to exercise their \nrespective powers.\n  Last week the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, said that \ndeferring the confirmation process would be an abomination. She said \nthat the Constitution's standard for the Senate's advice and consent \nrole does not change with the party of the President making \nnominations. Yet she voted 25 times to filibuster Republican judicial \nnominees, including to the Supreme Court. She voted not simply to defer \nthe confirmation process, as we are doing today, but to prevent a \nconfirmation vote from ever taking place. If the confirmation process \nshould not change with the President's party, then she should have no \nproblem with the decision we have made since it is less drastic than \nthe blockade she promoted just a few years ago.\n  Also last week, an email solicitation signed by one of my Democratic \ncolleagues asking for petition signatures claimed that the Senate has a \n``fundamental duty to confirm nominees to the Supreme Court.'' I would \nlike to think this is simply an egregious typographical error because \nit goes beyond even the false claim that the Constitution requires \nhearings and a vote. If the Senate has no choice but to confirm a \nPresident's nominees, what is the point of giving the Senate a role in \nthe process at all?\n  I will say it again in the hope of clearing up what should not have \nbeen confused in the first place: The Constitution gives to the \nPresident the power to nominate and to the Senate the power of advice \nand consent. These are separate and independent powers, and the \nConstitution does not mandate any particular way for the President and \nthe Senate to fulfill their responsibilities.\n  Because this fact is evident on the face of the Constitution, I \ncannot understand my colleagues who say that the President has a 4-year \nterm. That observation has nothing at all to do with anything before \nthe Senate. The Senate is not doing a single thing and cannot do a \nsingle thing to interfere with the President's power to nominate. He \ncan exercise that power in any way he chooses, including sending \nnominees to the Senate up to his very last day in office. He can do \nthat. Nobody that I know of disputes that. My dispute would be as to \nwhether it is wise to do it right up to the very last day in office, \nbut nobody really disputes that he can exercise that power in any way \nhe chooses, including sending nominees to the Senate up to his very \nlast day in office. What the President cannot do is dictate to the \nSenate how we exercise our separate power of advice and consent \nregarding those nominees.\n  Liberal allies of Senate Democrats are similarly confused. I received \na letter signed by liberal groups, for example, claiming that the \nConstitution requires ``timely hearings and votes.'' It almost sounds \nlike Democratic Senators and leftwing groups are sharing talking \npoints--almost.\n  Let's look once more at the language of article II. I will refer to \nthe chart. Tell me, where is the language about hearings and votes? I \nunderstand that Senate Democrats and their leftist allies want a timely \nhearing and confirmation vote this year to replace Justice Scalia, but \nwanting a particular confirmation process and saying the Constitution \nrequires that process are two very different things.\n  Some of the groups signing that letter--in particular, I noticed the \nLeadership Conference, the Alliance for Justice, and People for the \nAmerican Way--actively urged Senators to filibuster the Supreme Court \nnomination of Samuel Alito. In 2006 they opposed the very confirmation \nvote that today, just 10 years later, they say the Constitution \nrequires. Democrats and their liberal allies must be reading the same \nmade-up, shape-shifting Constitution that their favorite activist \njudges use because the real Constitution says no such thing.\n  Democrats' arguments contradict not only the plain words of the \nConstitution but also their own words and actions in considering \nnominees of a Republican President.\n  As to hearings, then-Chairman Pat Leahy denied a hearing to nearly 60 \njudicial nominees in less than 4 years while George W. Bush was \nPresident.\n  As to confirmation votes, the minority leader said in May 2005 that \nclaiming the Constitution requires a confirmation vote would be, in his \nwords, rewriting the Constitution and reinventing reality. That was by \nthe current minority leader. Here is what he said then:\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\n  \n\n       The duties of the United States Senate are set forth in the \n     Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in that document \n     does it say that the Senate has a duty to give Presidential \n     nominees a vote. It says that appointments shall be made with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate. That's very different \n     than saying that every nominee receives a vote.\n\n  That was the minority leader, who was then the majority leader. Well, \nthink about that.\n\n       The duties of the United States Senate are set forth in the \n     Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in that document \n     does it say that the Senate has a duty to give Presidential \n     nominees a vote. It says that appointments shall be made with \n     the advice and consent of the Senate. That's very different \n     than saying that every nominee receives a vote. -\n\n  I mentioned one Democratic Senator who voted 25 times to prevent \nconfirmation votes on judicial nominees, as did the minority leader, \nminority whip, Senator Leahy, and Senator Schumer as well. In fact, \nVice President Biden himself, when he served in this body, voted 29 \ntimes to filibuster Republican judicial nominees. While President Obama \ntoday says that the Constitution requires us to vote on a Supreme Court \nnominee, as a Senator, he, too, voted to prevent any confirmation vote \nfor Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito. In other words, these Senate \nDemocrats voted over and over to deny the very confirmation vote that \ntoday they say the Constitution itself requires. They cannot have it \nboth ways. Do we have multiple Constitutions, one to use for a \nPresident of your own party and another for the President of another \nparty? Democrats today have no credibility whatsoever to dictate how \nthe confirmation process should work for filling this Supreme Court \nvacancy.\n  The Constitution leaves to the President how to exercise his power to \nnominate and to the Senate how to exercise its power of advice and \nconsent. Recent claims to the contrary are inconsistent with the plain \ntext of the Constitution and with past words and actions of the very \nSenators and grassroots activists making those claims today.\n  The question is when, not whether, to fill the vacancy left by the \nuntimely death of Justice Scalia. The best answer is to defer the \nconfirmation process until after the next President takes office. Far \nfrom ignoring or shirking our responsibility, that conclusion tackles \nour responsibility head-on for the good of the judiciary, the Senate, \nand the country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Deputy Derek Geer\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to honor the life and work of Mesa County Sheriff's Deputy Derek \nGeer. On Monday, February 8, Deputy Geer was dispatched to a call about \nan armed individual in a local neighborhood. As members of our law \nenforcement do every day, Deputy Geer, with courage and care, responded \nto that call and through the senseless act of another, this son, \nhusband, father, and friend, lost his life.\n  Deputy Geer served with the Mesa County Sheriff's Office for nearly \n15 years. As a veteran of the Navy, his service to others began long \nbefore his role as a law enforcement officer. Service and duty to his \ncountry and his community exemplified Deputy Geer's selfless concern \nfor others.\n  As a member of the Sheriff's Department, Deputy Geer served as a \nvictim's advocate, providing support to those enduring some of life's \nworst difficulties. In every role he held, he always found ways to give \neven more.\n  This loss has been felt deeply across Colorado's Western Slope, the \ncommunities of the Western Slope, and our State, as we remember a man \nwho exemplified the best of the western spirit--courage and selfless \nleadership.\n  The Grand Junction community has come together to support the Geer \nfamily and our men and women who nobly protect us each and every day. \nMembers of law enforcement from around the State and around our Nation \ncame to honor the life of Deputy Geer, filling the streets to pay their \nlast respects.\n  Integrity, service, and community, the values of the Mesa County \nSheriff's Department--values carried out since the inception of the \norganization in 1883--were embodied in the work of Deputy Geer.\n  The thin blue line represents the men and women in law enforcement \nprotecting the public from those who seek to harm and cause \ndestruction. Our officers do not waiver at the dangerous calls and \nunknown situations. They face them in this line of duty, and they do so \nout of a love and loyalty for their neighbors and community.\n  I am grateful for the work of those at St. Mary's Medical Center who \ncared for Deputy Geer, as his last act was perhaps the most selfless of \nall--to give his organs to others in need.\n  As Mesa County deputies shrouded their badges, we too shared in \nmourning the loss of Deputy Geer, and we will continue to honor his \nlife and legacy.\n  My deepest sympathies and prayers go to Derek Geer's family, his two \nchildren and his wife Kate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I, too, would like to extend my \ncondolences to the family in Colorado and to the Senators from Colorado \nfor their loss.\n\n\n               Return from Space of Commander Scott Kelly\n\n  Madam President, I wish to call to the attention of the Senate that \ntonight, around midnight, we are expecting the return from space of \nCommander Scott Kelly, who has been in space for almost a year. He has \nbeen on the International Space Station for 340 days. It is an \nexperiment regarding not only all of the things he has done in doing \nexperiments--all kinds of physical things--but we are specifically \ndoing a test to compare the effects of zero gravity on the human body \nfor an extended period of time and, of all things, comparing him to his \ntwin brother, an astronaut commander who was in command of the next-to-\nthe-last space shuttle mission in 2011. In that case, it was Commander, \nnow Navy, Retired, Captain Mark Kelly. So we will have an identical \ntwin so NASA can then see the effects of the physical, emotional, and \npsychological effects, because as we prepare to go all the way to Mars \nin the decade of the 2030s, there is going to be a lot we are going to \nhave to learn in long-duration space flight, and long duration in zero \ngravity is going to be one of the things we have to be able to adapt \nto.\n  This Senator was only in space for 6 days. The human body readapts \nwhen you get back to Earth fairly quickly. For the long duration, and \nin this case a year, there is going to be a significant readaptation, \nas we have seen by some of our Americans who have been up for months \nand months but nobody as long as a year.\n  In the old Soviet program, they put up cosmonauts for a year, and \nthere are changes that occur, but in those intervening years we have \nbecome so much more aggressive in how we keep in a physical exercise \nactivity on board the space station, which is what it would be on a \nMars mission as well, trying to replicate through stress machines the \nfact that we don't have gravity, but replicating that, and trying to \nkeep up the bone density and the muscle tone. We have to work at it, \nand the astronauts on board the space station do that.\n  Scott Kelly has been up there for a year, and we will compare that \nwith his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who has flown several times \nin the space shuttle.\n  I will report to the Senate tomorrow, since he is supposed to return \nin early morning to Kazakhstan. That is somewhere just before midnight \nhere on eastern time, and I wanted to alert the Senate to this because \nwe are right on the cusp of doing a whole number of things as we \nprepare to go to Mars. This is certainly one of the significant events, \nand we will see how Scott Kelly is doing.\n  In the meantime, we say Godspeed on his fiery reentry into the \nEarth's atmosphere. Our hopes and our prayers go with him as he and his \ncrewmates return. I will be able to report to the Senate tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to deliver my climate \nremarks, but I wish to thank the Senator from Florida for his \ndescription of what is happening up in space and what our fellow \nAmericans have achieved. One of the unforgettable moments of my time in \nthe Senate has been to hear Senator Nelson's description of the events \nthat led up to his space flight, the experience of his space flight, \nand, frankly, the spiritual nature of the events and the effects on his \nlife. It has been impressive, and I am honored to serve with Senator \nNelson.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, this is my 129th \n``Time to Wake Up'' speech to my colleagues about the serious threat of \ncarbon pollution and our responsibility as Senators to heed that threat \nand to take steps to soften the blow of climate change. With each \npassing week, the evidence of climate change continues to mount and \npublic understanding of the stakes of the climate crisis continues to \ngrow.\n  Worldwide, 2015 was the hottest year since we began keeping records \nback in 1880, according to both NOAA and NASA. The last 5 years have \nbeen the warmest 5-year period on record since the World Meteorological \nAssociation. We know the amount of carbon in the Earth's atmosphere has \nrisen to its highest level in at least 800,000 years--probably several \nmillions of years but at least 800,000 years. Global sea levels are \nrising along our shores at their fastest rate in nearly 3,000 years. \nThe current rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at \nany time in the past 50 million years. Our oceans are acidifying more \nrapidly than they have at any time in 50 million years. We measure that \nfrom the geologic record.\n  The American people get it. They understand that climate change is \nreal. More than three out of every four Americans believe that climate \nchange is occurring and that doing nothing to reduce future warming \nwill cause a very or somewhat serious problem for the United States--\nthree out of four. Even the majority of Republicans now acknowledge \nglobal warming, with 59 percent saying the climate is changing. When \nasked, do you think that the world's climate is undergoing a change \nthat is causing more extreme weather patterns and the rise of sea \nlevels, 70 percent said yes.\n  The American people have an extraordinarily diverse and qualified \narray of expertise supporting those convictions: virtually every major \nscientific society and agency, our American military and national \nsecurity and intelligence officials, leading American companies, \ndoctors, and faith leaders.\n  So the truth is winning out, right? The polluters' campaign of \ndeception and misinformation has been thwarted, right? Well, wrong. \nThey are still at it.\n  A network of fossil fuel-backed front organizations with innocent \nsounding names still propagates counterfeit science in an attempt to \ncast doubt on the actual American scientific consensus. This network of \npolluter-paid deceit and denial has been well documented by Dr. Robert \nBrulle at Drexel University, Dr. Justin Farrell at Yale University, Dr. \nRiley Dunlap at Oklahoma State University, and others. Dr. Brulle's \nfollow-the-money analysis, for instance, diagrams the complex flow of \ncash to these front groups--a flow that the polluters persistently try \nto obscure. Dr. Farrell's quantitative analysis of words written by \nclimate denial organizations revealed a complex climate denial \napparatus that is ``overtly producing and promoting skepticism and \ndoubt about scientific consensus on climate change.'' ``Doubt is their \nproduct'' is the famous phrase.\n  Dr. Constantine Boussalis at Trinity College and Dr. Travis Coan at \nthe University of Exeter released a new study in December examining \nmore than 16,000 documents from 19 conservative think tanks over the \nperiod 1998 to 2013 and found ``little support for the claim that the \nera of science denial is over--instead, discussion of climate science \nhas generally increased over the sample period.''\n  Their study demonstrates that in spite of the broken global heat \nrecords over the last decade, rising sea levels, and accelerated \nmelting of polar ice sheets, these conservative think tanks have, in \nrecent years, actually increased their polluter-paid attacks on \nscience.\n  The study explains these think tanks ``provide a multitude of \nservices to the cause of climate change skepticism.'' These include: \noffering material support and lending credibility to contrarian \nscientists sponsoring pseudoscientific climate change conferences, \ndirectly communicating contrarian viewpoints to politicians--which is \nhow we get infected here--and disseminating skeptic viewpoints out \nthrough the media.\n  It follows a playbook of fraudulent deception that we have seen \nbefore from industrial powers fighting to obscure the harms their \nproducts cause, tobacco being a fine example.\n  In 2002, the conservative strategist Frank Luntz summed up the scheme \nin a memo to the Republican Party, since leaked, titled ``Straight \nTalk.'' Here is what Mr. Luntz said:\n\n       Should the public come to believe that the scientific \n     issues are settled, their views about global warming will \n     change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make \n     the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the \n     debate . . . The scientific debate is closing [against us]--\n\n  He said back in 2002--\n\n     but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to \n     challenge the science.\n\n  This is the climate science version of the infamous 1969 tobacco \nindustry memo that declared that ``Doubt is our product.''\n  In her recent book ``Dark Money,'' Jane Mayer describes in-depth the \nmeans by which fossil fuel interests put their wealth to use exerting \noutsized influence on our American political process. First, she \ndescribes, they invest in intellectuals who come up with ideas friendly \nto the industry. Then they invest in think tanks to transform these \nideas into ``marketable policies''--stuff they think they can sell. As \none environmental lawyer explains, ``You take corporate money and give \nit to a neutral-sounding think tank'' which ``hires people with \npedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. \nBut they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their \nfunders.'' Ms. Mayor describes this as the ``think tank as disguised \npolitical weapon.''\n  Not surprisingly, think tanks in the climate denial scheme tend to be \nfunded by fossil fuel interests like ExxonMobil and the Koch brothers \nor their fronts. The Kochs and their ilk use dark money channels to \nfunnel money through a labyrinth of nonprofit groups that make the full \nextent of their meddling difficult, if not impossible, to fully \ndetermine. The Boussalis and Coan study identifies the Heartland \nInstitute as a particularly important cog in the polluter-funded \nclimate denial apparatus. According to their study:\n\n       Heartland's shift towards science-related themes . . . \n     dovetails with Luntz's famous ``Straight Talk'' memo. It is \n     therefore not a surprise that for a decade it has organized \n     the annual International Conference on Climate Change (also \n     known as Denial-a-Palooza), which serves as a forum for \n     climate science deniers, or that it [Heartland] made \n     headlines in 2012 after launching a controversial ad campaign \n     which equated climate scientists with Ted Kaczynski, the \n     Unabomber.\n\n  Climate scientists, such as the ones who work at NASA and NOAA, are \nbeing equated with Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber--very responsible \nbehavior by Heartland, but Heartland gets big bucks from the fossil \nfuel industry and its front groups for this service.\n  Unfortunately, that is not all. Behind this well-paid conspiracy to \nfool the American public, which is failing, is a related political \neffort, which is not. The polluters are losing with the American \npublic, but they still control Congress. Huge sums of dark money are \nspent on politics, particularly right here in the U.S. Senate and House \nof Representatives.\n  As NYU law professor Burt Neuborne has written, ``rivers of money \nflowing from secret sources have turned our elections into silent \nauctions.''\n  How huge are these rivers of money? Each election sets new records. \nIn the 2012 Presidential cycle, the nonpartisan Center for Responsible \nPolitics reported that dark money groups spent over $300 million, with \nover 80 percent of it coming from Republican-leaning outfits.\n  The torrent of dark money flooded the 2014 midterm elections, making \nthem the most expensive midterm elections in American history. \nAccording to the Washington Post, at least 31 percent of all \nindependent spending in\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\nthat election came from groups not required to disclose their donors--\ndark money. That doesn't even count spending on so-called issue ads, \nwhich is also not reported.\n  In this 2016 election cycle, dark money spending has broken new \nrecords again. These dark money groups, according to the Center for \nResponsive Politics, ``are more integrated into campaigns than we've \nseen in the past.'' The Koch brothers' political network alone has \nvowed to spend $750 million this election cycle. They are through $400 \nmillion already and climbing. And the $750 million they have vowed to \nspend is more than the Bush and Kerry campaigns combined spent in 2004.\n  In our political debate, dark money dollars drown out the voices of \naverage citizens with what has been aptly called ``a tsunami of \nslime.'' All that money is not spent for nothing. As one secret \ncorporate donor exulted, ``We can fly under the radar screen. . . . \nThere are no limits, no restrictions, and no disclosure.'' The result \nstinks, and it is polluting our public discourse.\n  The sad part is that it is working. Not one Republican Senator will \nstand up and address climate change in a meaningful way. I have a bill \nmodeled on what conservative economists and the out-of-office \nRepublican officials who are willing to address climate change all \nrecommend as their solution. I did it their way--not a single \ncosponsor.\n  In the Presidential primary, it is even worse. One leading candidate \nhas actually declared that ``the concept of global warming was created \nby and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing \nnoncompetitive.'' Tell that to NOAA, NASA, the U.S. Navy, and every \nsingle American National Laboratory. It is a preposterous statement \noffered by a person who presents himself as qualified to be President \nof the United States.\n  Another candidate--this one, I am sad to say, a Senate colleague--\nsimply shrugs and says, ``Climate is always changing.'' No, not like \nthis. And if you don't believe me, ask NOAA, NASA, the U.S. Navy, and \nevery single American National Laboratory.\n  Yet another candidate who is also a Senator dismissed the solid \nAmerican scientific consensus on climate change as ``partisan dogma and \nideology.'' Tell that to the scientists at NOAA, NASA, the Navy, and \nevery single one of our National Laboratories, that what they are doing \nis not legitimate science, but it is partisan dogma and ideology. \nAgain, that is a preposterous remark, but they have to say those things \nbecause the big fossil fuel money is so powerful in that primary race \nthat they don't dare cross them.\n  The powerful fossil fuel interests have created a beautiful \nsituation. They no longer care which candidate wins the primary because \nthey have schooled them all to climate denial. That is the achievement \nof dark money, and it is an achievement that is disgracing our \ndemocracy and will darken our reputation for decades. Its effect is \nthat we do nothing--exactly what the big polluters want, exactly what \nthe big polluters paid for. It is just sickening what these secretive \nspecial interests and their dirty dark money are doing to our American \ndemocracy.\n  It is time to wake up, Mr. President. I thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow the Supreme Court will hear oral \narguments in the case Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. The central \nissue of this case is an attack by the State of Texas on women's health \nand the clinics that provide abortion services.\n  I wish to begin by stating clearly that in our country women have a \nconstitutionally protected right to make their own choices about their \nbodies. That is the law of the land, as guaranteed to women in Oregon \nand nationwide by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade.\n  The 2013 Texas law at the heart of this case, HB2, is a thinly veiled \nattempt to block women's choice by setting unjustifiable and burdensome \nrequirements on the doctors and clinics that offer abortion care. \nDespite what HB2 supporters say, it doesn't have anything to do with \nprotecting women's health. And the reality is, complications from \nabortion procedures are exceedingly rare. In fact, the numbers show \nthat abortion care is far safer than colonoscopies. Yet Texas law \ndoesn't go out of its way to impose comparable requirements on \nfacilities providing colonoscopies. HB2 unfairly targets women's health \nclinics.\n  To make this point directly, I wish to briefly quote from an amicus \nbrief filed by the trusted experts on these matters at the American \nMedical Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, among others. Their briefs said that the requirements \nimposed by the State of Texas ``are contrary to accepted medical \npractice and are not based on scientific evidence.'' The brief \ncontinued: ``They fail to enhance the quality or safety of abortion-\nrelated medical care and, in fact, impede women's access to such care \nby imposing unjustified and medically unnecessary burdens on abortion \nproviders.''\n  HB2 tells clinics, ``comply with these new requirements, or close.'' \nSo in the months since the law passed, the number of clinics that \nprovides such services has, in fact, plummeted across the State. \nAccording to reports, if HB2 is upheld, the total will drop by more \nthan three-quarters. Texas, obviously, is a big State, and under HB2 \nmany women are going to have to travel for hours on end to exercise a \nright guaranteed to them by the U.S. Constitution. The fact is, a lot \nof working women don't have the luxury of taking a day off or cannot \nafford a long and expensive trip to a faraway clinic. In effect, women \nare going to be denied care.\n  You are going to hear people on both sides of the aisle say again and \nagain how vital it is that Americans have access to medical treatment \nand advice from doctors they know and trust. But HB2 flatly denies many \nwomen that protection.\n  I personally find it very troubling that HB2 has become a blueprint \nfor similar restrictive laws around the Nation, bills that masquerade \nas women's health safety measures. For example, the State of Louisiana \nnow has a nearly identical law on its books.\n  In January, 162 of my congressional colleagues and I wrote the \nfollowing in an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court: ``A woman's \nright to decide whether to carry a pregnancy to term or to seek \ncritical medical services, including abortion, should be insulated from \nthe shifting political rhetoric and interest groups whose sole purpose \nis to erode the right to choose to bring a pregnancy to term afforded \nto women under Roe.''\n  So here is my bottom line: A limit on the exercise of a woman's right \nis a limit on the right itself. It is wrong and it is un-American to \nrestrict a person's right because it conflicts with your own views. \nTexas HB2 should be struck down. The rights guaranteed to women \nfollowing Roe v. Wade ought to be protected, just as all the others \nthat are guaranteed by the Constitution. My hope is that this ongoing \ncrusade against women's health care, which I have spoken about \nrepeatedly on the floor of this Senate, ought to end here, and it ought \nto end now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on January 16, 2016, the people of \nTaiwan went to the polls and elected Dr. Tsai Ing-wen as the next \nPresident of Taiwan, with 56.2 percent of the vote. The 2016 \nPresidential election marked the sixth direct election of the President \nand Vice President of Taiwan, and the first time a woman has been \nelected as head of Taiwan's Government. Dr. Tsai's party, the \nDemocratic Progressive Party, also won 68 seats of the 113-member \nLegislative Yuan for an outright majority in that body. I congratulate \nDr. Tsai and her party for their victories and new responsibilities.\n  This election represents a significant change in Taiwan's political \nlandscape, with important implications for the U.S.-Taiwan \nrelationship. I urge the administration to express its clear support \nfor Taiwan and its vibrant democracy.\n  As part of the 2016 Taiwan Presidential and legislative elections, an \ninternational election observation mission made up of 18 observers from \n10 countries visited Taiwan at the invitation of the Taiwan Nation \nAlliance and the International Committee for a Democratic Taiwan. After \nthe elections, the mission submitted its final report on the elections, \nconcluding that they were free and fair. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe summary of that report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Observations by the International Election Observation Mission, 2016\n\n\n                            1. Introduction\n\n       From January 12-17, 2016, a group of eighteen observers \n     from 10 countries (see the attached list of members) visited \n     Taiwan at the invitation of the Taiwan Nation Alliance (TNA) \n     and the International Committee for a Democratic Taiwan \n     (ICDT). They formed an International Election Observation \n     Mission (IEOM) to observe the election campaign for the \n     January 16th 2016 Presidential and Legislative elections in \n     Taiwan.\n       At the completion of their mission on the day after the \n     elections, the members of the IEOM expressed appreciation to \n     the organizers of the visit, and encouraged them to continue \n     in their efforts to strengthen Taiwan's democracy, so that it \n     can be shared with other countries in the region and around \n     the world. In addition, as the IEOM conducted their mission, \n     it greatly appreciated the willingness of candidates, party \n     representatives, and government representatives to meet with \n     them.\n       During the IEOM, the group visited locations in Taipei, \n     Kaohsiung, and Taichung, meeting with various representatives \n     of the two main political parties: Democratic Progressive \n     Party (DPP) and Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), as well as \n     of two smaller parties--the People's First Party (PFP) and \n     New Power Party (NPP). They also observed political rallies, \n     street campaigns, and activities at several polling stations \n     and the Central Election Commission counting center on \n     Election Day.\n\n\n            2. The conclusions of the IEOM were as follows:\n\n       It congratulated the people of Taiwan and its newly-elected \n     president Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on the achievement of this major \n     milestone in Taiwan's history, the consolidation of many \n     decades of hard work and dedication by the Taiwanese people.\n       And it stated that:\n       a. The vibrancy of the sixth direct presidential election \n     further confirms that Taiwan has left its authoritarian past \n     behind it, and has grown into a fully democratic society \n     featuring the institutionalization of fundamental freedoms, \n     comprehensive electoral procedures, and sound democratic \n     practices.\n       b. In our view, these elections were free and fair, though \n     there were media reports of irregularities such as vote \n     buying in locations such as Hsinchu, Chiayi and Taitung. \n     However, these have not affected the overall outcome of the \n     elections.\n       c. After such elections it is key that all sides of the \n     political spectrum in the country respect the democratic \n     choice of the people, and work together to make Taiwan a \n     better place for all.\n       d. It is also essential that other nations respect the \n     results of the elections as the free choice of the people of \n     Taiwan, and work with the newly-elected leadership to \n     establish a sustainable, long-term peace and stability in the \n     region.\n       e. The impending third transfer of executive power, as well \n     as the first parliamentary majority for the opposition, are \n     opportunities for further deepening and consolidation of \n     Taiwan's democracy.\n\n\n       Members of the International Election Observation Mission\n\n       Head of Mission: Frank Murkowski, former Senator and \n     Governor of Alaska\n\n\n                        United States and Canada\n\n       Julian Baum, former correspondent for the Far Eastern \n     Economic Review and the Christian Science Monitor\n       Stephen Bryen, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense\n       June Teufel Dreyer, Professor of Political Science, \n     University of Miami\n       William A.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor March 2016 as National \nEye Donor Month, an event first celebrated by President Reagan in 1983 \nand one I am proud to commemorate now.\n  For over 50 years, corneal transplants have restored the vision of \nthose with corneal diseases. Today these procedures are overwhelmingly \nsafe and successful and help reduce the impact of eye disorders on our \neconomy. As a result of higher medical expenses and reduced workforce \nproductivity, eye disorders are the fifth costliest disease type in the \nUnited States.\n  In total, over 70,000 people receive corneal transplants each year. \nThe largest eye bank in the United States, Eversight, operates two \nlocations in Illinois. These institutions, one in Chicago and one in \nBloomington, facilitated over 3,000 transplants in 2015 and provided \nnearly 1,500 corneas for research and training purposes. Thanks to the \n2,700 eye donors in Illinois in 2014 and the thousands of other donors \nacross the country each year, scientists are closer to finding \ntreatments and cures for corneal blindness and many patients no longer \nsuffer from impairment or loss of vision.\n  On this special occasion, I commend the Eye Bank Association of \nAmerica and the eye banks across this country for their great work, \nencourage my colleagues to promote eye donation, and urge all Americans \nto register to become eye donors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/senate-section/article/S1133-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1133-S1134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1471.

A bill to approve an agreement between the United States and \nthe Republic of Palau; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Maria \nCantwell and Senator Mazie Hirono to introduce legislation to approve \nthe 2010 Agreement between the Governments of the United States and the \nRepublic of Palau following the Compact of Free Association Section 432 \nReview.\n  Palau's history with the United States dates back to the Battle of \nPeleliu, fought between United States and Japanese forces for over two \nmonths with the highest casualty rate of any battle in the Pacific \nTheater. Following World War II, Palau became a district of the Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific Islands under the auspices of the United \nNations, but administered by the United States. Palau was the last \ndistrict of the Trust Territory to choose its political future, when in \n1994, it became a self-governing, sovereign state and entered into a \nfifty-year Compact of Free Association with the United States similar \nto that of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.\n  Under the Compact, the United States, through the Department of the\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\nInterior, provides economic and financial assistance, defends Palau's \nterritorial integrity, and allows Palauan citizens the opportunity to \nenter the United States as non-immigrants. In return, the United States \nreceives exclusive and unlimited access to Palau's land and waterways \nfor strategic purposes. U.S. assistance is intended to help Palau \ndevelop its infrastructure and economy so that it has a sustainable \ngovernment and economy capable of functioning without the United \nStates' support. Section 432 of the Compact provides that after the \nfifteenth, thirtieth, and fortieth anniversaries of the Compact, the \nUnited States and Palau shall formally review the terms of the Compact \nand shall consider the overall nature and development of their \nrelationship, including Palau's operating requirements and its progress \nin meeting development objectives.\n  The United States can count on Palau to vote with us on a broad range \nof issues, including some that are controversial and where we need \nreliable allies. On a number of important resolutions that have come \nbefore the United Nations' General Assembly, Palau stood by us and \nprovided critical votes. For example, in 2014, Palau voted with the \nUnited States on 97 percent of votes before the U.N. General Assembly, \nand Palau voted with the U.S. 90 percent of the time in important \nvotes. From 2011-2013, Palau voted with the United States 100 percent \nof the time in important votes. Palau has been a steadfast ally of the \nUnited States in international forums and we should be mindful of and \ngrateful for their support.\n  It is also important to recognize that Palau has consistently \ndemonstrated a commitment to the U.S.-Palau partnership under the \nCompact. Palauan nationals serve in U.S. coalition missions, \nparticipate in U.S.-led combat operations, and have given their lives \nfor the safety of our nation. Approximately 500 Palauan men and women \nserve as volunteers in our military today, out of a population of about \n21,000. Palau is indeed a strong partner who punches well above its \nweight. We are grateful for their sacrifices and dedication to \npromoting peace and fighting terrorism. After reviewing the progress \nachieved by Palau in the first 15 years of the Compact, and with the \n13th anniversary coming upon us, the administration is recommending \ncontinued assistance, but at lower levels.\n  This agreement, reached in 2010, has been before Congress in prior \nyears and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has held \nhearings on the matter. To the best of my knowledge, there is no \nobjection within Congress on the policy of continuing to provide \nfinancial assistance to Palau under the Compact of Free Association. \nThe hang-up has been finding a viable offset to pay for that \nassistance. I would note that since 2010 Congress has provided just \nover $13 million in annual discretionary funding to the Government of \nPalau in lieu of the Agreement's enactment--a total of over $90 million \nin that timeframe. At the same time, the administration has failed to \nidentify an acceptable offset for a cost that is now just under $150 \nmillion over 10 years.\n  For such a steadfast ally, partner, and friend, whose citizens serve \nin our Armed Forces for the protection of our nation, and whose \ngovernment supports the United States' position on critical issues in \ninternational forums, we should be able to come up with a viable \nfunding solution. I call upon the administration to work with Congress \non this matter, find an offset, and enact the 2010 Agreement between \nthe United States and Palau.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 22, 2016.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is draft legislation to amend \n     Title I of Public Law 99-658 (100 Stat 3672), regarding the \n     Compact of Free Association between the Government of the \n     United States of America and the Government of Palau \n     (Compact). This legislation would approve and implement the \n     results of the mandated 15-year review of the Compact, as \n     well as the Agreement Between the Government of the United \n     States of America and the Government of the Republic of Palau \n     (Compact Review Agreement), signed on September 3, 2010. We \n     strongly urge this draft bill be introduced, referred \n     appropriately, and passed in Congress at the earliest \n     opportunity.\n       The relationship between the United States and Palau, as \n     embodied in the Compact, is grounded in shared history, \n     friendship, and a strong partnership in national security, \n     especially with respect to the Asia-Pacific region. In the \n     Battle of Peleliu, in Palau, more than 1,500 American \n     servicemen lost their lives, and more than 8,000 were \n     wounded, resulting in one of the costliest battles in the \n     Pacific in World War II. After the war, the United States \n     assumed administrative authority over Palau as part of the \n     Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and in 1994 Palau \n     became a sovereign nation in free association with the United \n     States under the Compact of Free Association. The Compact \n     provides U.S. military forces full authority and \n     responsibility for security and defense matters in or \n     relating to Palau. Conversely, the United States has the \n     extraordinary advantage of being able to deny other nations' \n     military forces access to Palau, an important element of our \n     Pacific strategy for defense of the U.S. homeland.\n       In addition to the important historical and security \n     relationship, Palau has consistently demonstrated a \n     commitment to the U.S.-Palau partnership under the Compact. \n     Palauan nationals have served in U.S. coalition missions and \n     participated in U.S. led combat operations. Palauan citizens \n     volunteer in large numbers in the U.S. military. Since \n     September 11, 2001, seven Palauans have lost their lives in \n     combat. At the United Nations, Palau has voted with the \n     United States more than 95 percent of the time, including on \n     key foreign policy issues.\n       The Compact has seen the goal of self-governance and \n     democracy in Palau realized. However, to bolster this \n     progress and maintain stability in the region, we must now \n     help to ensure Palau's financial independence. By approving \n     the Compact Review Agreement, the pending legislation would \n     extend U.S. assistance through 2024, helping to meet and \n     achieve this critical goal. Under the agreement, Palau has \n     committed to undertake economic, legislative, financial, and \n     management reforms. Additionally, this agreement assures the \n     United States can withhold economic assistance in the absence \n     of significant further progress in implementing meaningful \n     reforms.\n       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 requires that the \n     cumulative effects of revenue and direct spending legislation \n     in a congressional session meet a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) \n     requirement. In total, such legislation should not increase \n     the on-budget deficit; if it does, it would produce a \n     sequestration if it is not fully offset by the end of the \n     congressional session. This draft bill would increase \n     mandatory outlays and the on-budget deficit as shown below:\n\n                                                                                          FISCAL YEARS\n                                                                                      [Dollars in millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        2017          2018          2019          2020          2021          2022          2023          2024          Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit Impact....................................................           46            26            20            17            15            14             6             5           149\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       This proposal would increase direct spending, and it is \n     therefore subject to the Statutory PAYGO Act and should be \n     considered in conjunction with all other proposals that are \n     subject to the Act. Approving the results of the Agreement is \n     important to the national security of the United States, \n     stability in the Western Pacific region, our bilateral \n     relationship with Palau, and to the United States' broader \n     strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region. We stand \n     ready, as always, to provide you with any information and \n     assistance necessary to help secure the passage of this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sally Jewell,\n       Secretary, Department of the Interior.\n     Heather Higginbottom,\n       Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources, Department \n     of State.\n     Robert O. Work,\n       Deputy Secretary, Department of Defense.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Johnson, Ms. Heitkamp, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, \n        and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 2612. A bill to ensure United States jurisdiction over offenses \ncommitted by United States personnel stationed\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\nin Canada in furtherance of border security initiatives; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year, I hailed the signing of a new \nagreement between the United States and Canada designed to improve \ncross-border travel, commerce and security between our two countries. \nSecretary Johnson of the Department of Homeland Security was joined in \nWashington by Canada's Minister of Public Safety, Steven Blaney, for \nthe signing of that new preclearance agreement, which was negotiated \nunder the Beyond the Border Action Plan.\n  Preclearance facilities allow travelers to pass through U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection, CBP, inspections in Canada, prior to traveling \nto the United States. Preclearance operations relieve congestion at \nU.S. destination airports, facilitate commerce, save money, and \nstrengthen national security. The United States currently stations CBP \nofficers in select locations in Canada to inspect passengers and cargo \nbound for the United States before departing Canada. The new agreement \nsigned in March 2015 will lead to expanded U.S. preclearance facilities \nin Canada in the marine, land, air and rail sectors.\n  However, the Department of Homeland Security requires specific, \nnarrowly tailored legislation to fully implement the new agreement. CBP \nOfficers assigned to preclearance locations operate with law \nenforcement authorities and immunities as agreed upon by the United \nStates and the host country's government. Under the new preclearance \nagreement with Canada, the United States secured the right to prosecute \nU.S. officials if they commit crimes on the job while stationed in \nCanada--and thereby preclude a prosecution by Canadian prosecutors. But \nin some cases, the United States may lack the legal authority to \nprosecute U.S. officials because many federal crimes do not have \nextraterritorial reach. The Promoting Travel, Commerce and National \nSecurity Act of 2016, which I am proud to introduce today with Senator \nMurkowski, would ensure that the United States has the legal authority \nto hold our own officials accountable if they engage in wrongdoing \nabroad in Canada. This legislation will allow for full implementation \nof the expanded Canada preclearance agreement.\n  Enacting this legislation will promote two key national goals: \nenhancing our national security, and creating a more efficient flow of \ntravelers and goods. By placing CBP personnel at the point of \ndeparture, screening occurs before a person boards a flight, increasing \nour ability to prevent those who should not be flying to the United \nStates from doing so. In 2014, preclearance stopped more than 10,000 \ninadmissible travelers worldwide before they left foreign soil. As \nSecretary Johnson has said, ``We have to push our homeland security out \nbeyond our borders so that we are not defending the homeland from the \none-yard line.'' At the same time, preclearance facilitates travel and \ntrade.\n  I am pleased that a bipartisan coalition in the House of \nRepresentatives, led by Representatives Elise Stefanik and Ann Kuster, \nwill also introduce companion legislation today as well. And I am \ngrateful for the support of Senators Schumer, Johnson, Heitkamp, \nShaheen, Cantwell, Murray and Gillibrand for this important \nlegislation. I hope with this bipartisan, bicameral support, this \nsimple, straightforward enabling legislation will be enacted this year.\n  In Vermont, we look to our Canadian neighbors as partners in trade \nand commerce, and as joint stewards of our shared communities. While \nboth nations strive to ensure that the border is secure, the ties \nbetween Canada and Vermont run deep. We rely on each other for trade, \ncommerce, and tourism. And many Vermont families have members on both \nsides of the border. This agreement has long been a dream for \nVermonters who have fond memories of taking the train north to Montreal \nto enjoy all that this vibrant cultural hub offers. It is also a win \nfor visitors from Canada's largest cities who love to come to Vermont \nto ski, shop and dine. I commend Secretary Johnson for his commitment \nto forging this agreement that will greatly benefit Vermont and the \nUnited States. I look forward to enacting this legislation into law so \nthat these projects can move forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Hatch, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 2613. A bill to reauthorize certain programs established by the \nAdam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have all heard accounts of innocent \nchildren being victimized and abused by predators. Today I will \nintroduce legislation to extend two of the key programs that Congress \nestablished under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of \n2006. With today's legislation, I hope to send a strong message to all \nAmericans about Congress' continued commitment to keeping our Nation's \nchildren safe.\n  Many of us here in the Senate worked very hard on the original \nversion of the Adam Walsh Act, which is named for a six year-old who \nwas tragically murdered in 1981. President George W. Bush signed that \nlegislation on the 25th anniversary of Adam Walsh's abduction from a \nFlorida shopping mall. I am pleased that Senators Hatch, Schumer, and \nFeinstein--who cosponsored the Senate version of that legislation when \nit was first introduced in the 109th Congress--have joined me as \noriginal cosponsors of today's legislation.\n  John Walsh, the father of Adam Walsh, worked closely with us on the \ndevelopment of the 2006 Adam Walsh Act, and we worked with him on the \ndevelopment of today's legislation as well. Reauthorization of the Adam \nWalsh Act is a priority for him and has the support of the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  The Adam Walsh Act was enacted in response to multiple, notorious \ncases involving children who had been targeted by adult criminals, many \nof them repeat sex offenders. Its passage became a national priority \nafter Congress discovered that criminals were taking advantage of gaps \nand loopholes in some States' laws to circumvent sex offender \nregistration requirements--with tragic results for some of the nation's \nchildren.\n  Who can forget Jetseta Gage--a beautiful 10-year-old girl from Cedar \nRapids, Iowa who was sexually assaulted and murdered by a registered \nsex offender in 2005? As a cosponsor of the Senate version of the Adam \nWalsh Act, I championed the inclusion in the 2006 law of language \nimposing mandatory minimum penalties for those who murder, kidnap, or \ninflict serious bodily harm to children like Jetseta.\n  Of course, the centerpiece of the Adam Walsh Act is the Sex Offender \nRegistration and Notification Act, or SORNA. SORNA divides sex \noffenders into three categories, or tiers, depending on the seriousness \nof their crimes. It encourages States to set minimum criteria for the \nregistration of sex offenders in each tier, with the aim of \ndiscouraging ``forum shopping'' by offenders who prey on children.\n  The Adam Walsh Act also established several programs that are key to \nits successful implementation. One such program, known as SOMA, or the \nSex Offender Management Assistance Program, makes federal grant \nresources available to states to offset the costs of Walsh Act \nimplementation. Today's legislation would extend the authorization for \nthat program, which expired 8 years ago.\n  The federal government, through the U.S. Marshals Service, also \nsupports States and localities in tracking down sex offenders who fail \nto register or re-register. Those fugitive apprehension activities were \nauthorized under the 2006 Adam Walsh Act, and today's legislation would \nextend the authorization for those U.S. Marshals Service activities at \n$60 million annually for each of the next 2 years.\n  Nothing can bring back Adam Walsh, Jetseta Gage, Dru Sjodin, Megan \nKanka, or the other innocents for whom the Adam Walsh Act was passed. \nBut it is important that we continue to not only honor their memories \nbut also protect America's future children from harm by extending the \nkey programs that were authorized under the original Adam Walsh Act. \nThe authorization for these programs expired at least 7 years ago.\n  According to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nthere are about a hundred thousand\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\npeople convicted of sexual violence offenses in state prisons, and \nhundreds of thousands more who currently reside in neighborhoods across \nthe United States. As a father of five and the grandfather of 9, I \nbelieve we should continue to make sex offender registration and \nnotification a priority.\n  Mr. President, July 27 of this year will mark the 35th anniversary of \nAdam Walsh's abduction. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthe passage of this important legislation before that date elapses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Tillis):\n  S. 2614. A bill to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, to reauthorize the Missing Alzheimer's Disease \nPatient Alert Program, and to promote initiatives that will reduce the \nrisk of injury and death relating to the wandering characteristics of \nsome children with autism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Senators Schumer, Tillis and I \nwill introduce legislation to help America's families locate missing \nloved ones who have Alzheimer's disease, autism or related conditions \nthat may cause them to wander. Our bill would extend existing programs \ndesigned to assist in locating Alzheimer's disease and dementia \npatients. It also adds new support for people with autism.\n  We have named the legislation in honor of two boys with autism who \nperished because their condition caused them to wander. One of these \nchildren, nine-year-old Kevin Curtis Wills, slipped into Iowa's Raccoon \nRiver near a park and tragically drowned in 2008. The other, 14-year-\nold Avonte Oquendo, wandered away from his school and drowned in New \nYork City's East River several years ago.\n  Theirs are not isolated cases. We have all read or heard the \nheartbreaking stories of families frantically trying to locate a \nmissing loved one whose condition caused him or her to wander off.\n  We have also seen benefits of notification systems to locate missing \nchildren and bring relief to families through community assistance. Our \nbill will use similar concepts and other technology to help locate \npeople with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia as well as \nchildren with autism spectrum disorders who may be prone to wander away \nfrom their families or caregivers.\n  My home State of Iowa has the fifth highest Alzheimer's death rate in \nAmerica, according to the Alzheimer's Association. As further noted by \nthe Alzheimer's Association, which we consulted on this bill's \ndevelopment, as many as one in three seniors will die with a form of \ndementia. About 63,000 Iowans are living with Alzheimer's disease.\n  In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released \ninformation on the incidence of autism in this country. The CDC \nidentified 1 in 68 children as having autism spectrum disorders. \nExperts tell us that, in Iowa alone, about 8,000 individuals have been \ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, and we worked closely with \nthe Autism Society of Iowa on the development of this bill.\n  Because police often are the first people to respond when a child \ngoes missing, the bill also will make resources available to equip \nfirst responders and other community officials with the training \nnecessary to better prevent and respond to these cases. With better \ninformation sharing, communities can play a central role in reuniting \nthese children with their families.\n  Finally, the bill will ensure that grants from the U.S. Department of \nJustice also can be used by state and local law enforcement agencies \nand nonprofits for education and training programs to proactively \nprevent and locate missing individuals with these conditions. The \ngrants will facilitate the development of training and emergency \nprotocols for school personnel, supply first responders with additional \ninformation and resources, and make local tracking technology programs \navailable for individuals who may wander from safety because of their \ncondition. Grant funding may also be used to establish or enhance \nnotification and communications systems for the recovery of missing \nchildren with autism.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/01/senate-section/article/S1139-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 381--HONORING THE MEMORY AND LEGACY OF MICHAEL JAMES \nRIDDERING AND CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA \n                        FASO ON JANUARY 15, 2016\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 383\n\n       Whereas the deep bond between the United States and Israel \n     is exemplified by its many facets, including the robust \n     economic and commercial relationship;\n       Whereas, on April 22, 2015, the United States celebrated \n     the 30th anniversary of its free trade agreement with Israel, \n     which was the first free trade agreement entered into by the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement \n     established the Joint Committee to facilitate the agreement \n     and collaborate on efforts to increase bilateral cooperation \n     and investment;\n       Whereas, since the signing of this agreement, two-way trade \n     has multiplied tenfold to over $40,000,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas Israel is the third largest importer of United \n     States goods in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) \n     region after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, \n     despite representing only 2 percent of the region's \n     population;\n       Whereas nearly half of all investment in the United States \n     from the MENA region comes from Israel;\n       Whereas Israel has more companies listed on the NASDAQ \n     Stock Exchange than any other country except for the United \n     States and China;\n       Whereas, in 1956, the United States-Israel Education \n     Foundation was

over 1,000 projects since its inception;\n       Whereas an independent review of the United States-Israel \n     Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) \n     estimated that the dollar benefits of just 10 of its projects \n     through 2010 came to $440,000,000 in the United States and \n     $300,000,000 in Israel, far exceeding total investment in the \n     program;\n       Whereas, in 1984, the United States and Israel began \n     convening the Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG) to \n     regularly discuss economic conditions and identify new \n     opportunities for collaboration;\n       Whereas, in 1994, the United States-Israel Science and \n     Technology Foundation (USISTF) was established to promote the \n     advancement of science and technology for

Security Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150), which \n     set United States policy to expand bilateral cooperation \n     across the spectrum of civilian sectors, including high \n     technology, agriculture, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals, \n     and energy;\n       Whereas, in 2013, President Obama said in reference to \n     Israel's contribution to the global economy, ``That \n     innovation is just as important to the relationship between \n     the United States and Israel as our security cooperation.'';\n       Whereas, in 2014, Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew said, \n     ``As one of the most technologically-advanced and innovative \n     economies in the world, Israel is an important economic \n     partner to the United States.'';\n       Whereas the 2014 Global Venture Capital Confidence Survey \n     ranked the United States and Israel as the two countries with \n     the highest levels of investor confidence in the world;\n       Whereas, in 2014, Congress passed and President Obama \n     signed into law the United States-Israel Strategic \n     Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-296), which deepened \n     cooperation on energy, water, agriculture, trade, and \n     defense, and expressed the sense of Congress that Israel is a \n     major strategic partner of the United States; and\n       Whereas economic cooperation between the United States and \n     Israel has also thrived at the State and local levels through \n     both formal agreements and bilateral organizations in over 30 \n     States that have encouraged new forms of cooperation in \n     fields such as water conservation, cybersecurity, and \n     alternative energy and farming technologies: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that the United States-Israel economic \n     partnership has achieved great tangible and intangible \n     benefits to both countries and is a foundational

particularly in light of widespread \n     drought, cybersecurity attacks, and other major challenges \n     impacting the United States;\n       (3) encourages the President to regularize and expand \n     existing forums of economic dialogue with Israel and foster \n     both public and private sector participation; and\n       (4) expresses support for the President to explore new \n     agreements with Israel, including in the fields of energy, \n     water, agriculture, medicine, neurotechnology, and \n     cybersecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Democracy Restoration Act \n     of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. __2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n     citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n     individuals with criminal convictions into free society, \n     helping to enhance public safety.\n       (2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution grants \n     Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, \n     an authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the United \n     States Supreme Court.\n       (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal \n     protection require an equal opportunity for citizens of the \n     United States to vote in Federal elections. The right to vote \n     may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any \n     State on account of race, color, gender, or previous \n     condition of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and \n     26th Amendments to the Constitution empower Congress to enact \n     measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections. \n     The 8th Amendment to the Constitution provides for no \n     excessive bail to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, \n     nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n       (4) There are 3 areas where discrepancies in State laws \n     regarding criminal convictions lead to unfairness in Federal \n     elections--\n       (A) the lack of a uniform standard for voting in Federal \n     elections leads to an unfair disparity and unequal \n     participation in Federal elections based solely on where a \n     person lives;\n       (B) laws governing the restoration of voting rights after a \n     criminal conviction vary throughout the country and persons \n     in some States can easily regain their voting rights while in \n     other States persons effectively lose their right to vote \n     permanently; and\n       (C) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     racial and ethnic minorities.\n       (5) Two States do not disenfranchise individuals with \n     criminal convictions at all (Maine and Vermont), but 48 \n     States and the District of Columbia have laws that deny \n     convicted individuals the right to vote while they are in \n     prison.\n       (6) In some States disenfranchisement results from varying \n     State laws that restrict voting while individuals are under \n     the supervision of the criminal justice system or after they \n     have completed a criminal sentence. In 35 States, convicted \n     individuals may not vote while they are on parole and 31 of \n     those States disenfranchise individuals on felony probation \n     as well. In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime \n     disenfranchisement.\n       (7) Several States deny the right to vote to individuals \n     convicted of certain misdemeanors.\n       (8) An estimated 5,850,000 citizens of the United States, \n     or about 1 in 40 adults in the United States, currently \n     cannot vote as a result of a felony conviction. Of the \n     5,850,000 citizens barred from voting, only 25 percent are in \n     prison. By contrast, 75 percent of the disenfranchised reside \n     in their communities while on probation or parole or after \n     having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,600,000 \n     citizens who have completed their sentences remain \n     disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws. In 6 States--\n     Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and \n     Virginia--more than 7 percent of the total population is \n     disenfranchised.\n       (9) In those States that disenfranchise individuals post-\n     sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in \n     practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform \n     and potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised \n     individuals must either obtain a pardon or an order from the \n     Governor or an action by the parole or pardon board, \n     depending on the offense and State. Individuals convicted of \n     a Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining \n     voting rights.\n       (10) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately \n     impact racial and ethnic minorities. Eight percent of the \n     African-American population, or 2,000,000 African-Americans, \n     are disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, \n     approximately 1 in 3 of the next generation of African-\n     American men will be disenfranchised at some point\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\n     during their lifetime. Currently, 1 of every 13 African-\n     Americans are rendered unable to vote because of felony \n     disenfranchisement, which is a rate 4 times greater than non \n     African-Americans. 7.7 percent of African-Americans are \n     disenfranchised whereas only 1.8 percent of non African-\n     Americans are. In 3 States--Florida (23 percent), Kentucky \n     (22 percent), and Virginia (20 percent)--more than 1 in 5 \n     African-Americans are unable to vote because of prior \n     convictions.\n       (11) Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised \n     based upon their disproportionate representation in the \n     criminal justice system. If current incarceration trends \n     hold, 17 percent of Latino men will be incarcerated during \n     their lifetimes, in contrast to less than 6 percent of non-\n     Latino White men. When analyzing the data across 10 States, \n     Latinos generally have disproportionately higher rates of \n     disenfranchisement compared to their presence in the voting \n     age population. In 6 out of 10 States studied in 2003, \n     Latinos constitute more than 10 percent of the total number \n     of persons disenfranchised by State felony laws. In 4 States \n     (California, 37 percent; New York, 34 percent; Texas, 30 \n     percent; and Arizona, 27 percent), Latinos were \n     disenfranchised by a rate of more than 25 percent.\n       (12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a \n     criminal offense and who are living and working in the \n     community serves no compelling State interest and hinders \n     their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\n       (13) State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral \n     participation among eligible voters by discouraging voting \n     among family and community members of disenfranchised \n     persons. Future electoral participation by the children of \n     disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well.\n       (14) The United States is the only Western democracy that \n     permits the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals \n     with felony convictions.\n\n     SEC. __3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n       The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United \n     States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not \n     be denied or abridged because that individual has been \n     convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is \n     serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or \n     facility at the time of the election.\n\n     SEC. __4. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Attorney General.--The Attorney General may, in a civil \n     action, obtain such declaratory or injunctive relief as is \n     necessary to remedy a violation of this title.\n       (b) Private Right of Action.--\n       (1) In general.--A person who is aggrieved by a violation \n     of this title may provide written notice of the violation to \n     the chief election official of the State involved.\n       (2) Relief.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the \n     violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a \n     notice under paragraph (1), or within 20 days after receipt \n     of the notice if the violation occurred within 120 days \n     before the date of an election for Federal office, the \n     aggrieved person may, in a civil action, obtain declaratory \n     or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.\n       (3) Exception.--If the violation occurred within 30 days \n     before the date of an election for Federal office, the \n     aggrieved person need not provide notice to the chief \n     election official of the State under paragraph (1) before \n     bringing a civil action to obtain declaratory or injunctive \n     relief with respect to the violation.\n\n     SEC. __5.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The abuse of heroin and prescription opioid painkillers \n     is having a devastating effect on public health and safety in \n     communities across the United States. According to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose \n     deaths now surpass traffic accidents in the number of deaths \n     caused by injury in the United States. In 2014, an average of \n     more than 120 people in the United States died from drug \n     overdoses every day.\n       (2) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n     (commonly known as ``NIDA''), the number of prescriptions for \n     opioids increased from approximately 76,000,000 in 1991 to \n     nearly 207,000,000 in 2013, and the United States is the \n     biggest consumer of opioids globally, accounting for almost \n     100 percent of the world total for hydrocodone and 81 percent \n     for oxycodone.\n       (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or \n     abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as \n     ``CPDs'') and are involved in most CPD-related overdose \n     incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network \n     (commonly known as ``DAWN''), the estimated number of \n     emergency department visits involving nonmedical use of \n     prescription opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent \n     between 2006 and 2010, from 84,671 to 179,787.\n       (4) The use of heroin in the United States has also spiked \n     sharply in recent years. According to the most recent \n     National Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 900,000 \n     people in the United States reported using heroin in 2014, \n     nearly a 35 percent increase from the previous year. Heroin \n     overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014.\n       (5) The supply of cheap heroin available in the United \n     States has increased dramatically as well, largely due to the \n     activity of Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The Drug \n     Enforcement Administration (commonly known as the ``DEA'') \n     estimates that heroin seizures at the Mexican border have \n     more than doubled since 2010, and heroin production in Mexico \n     increased 62 percent from 2013 to 2014. While only 8 percent \n     of State and local law enforcement officials across the \n     United States identified heroin as the greatest drug threat \n     in their area in 2008, that number rose to 38 percent in \n     2015.\n       (6) Law enforcement officials and treatment experts \n     throughout the country report that many people who have \n     misused prescription opioids have turned to heroin as a \n     cheaper or more easily obtained alternative to prescription \n     opioids.\n       (7) According to a report by the National Association of \n     State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to \n     as ``NASADAD''), 37 States reported an increase in admissions \n     to treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while \n     admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased \n     500 percent from 2000 to 2012.\n       (8) Research indicates that combating the opioid crisis, \n     including abuse of prescription painkillers and, \n     increasingly, heroin, requires a multipronged approach that \n     involves prevention, education, monitoring, law enforcement \n     initiatives, reducing drug diversion and the supply of \n     illicit drugs, expanding delivery of existing treatments \n     (including medication assisted treatments), expanding access \n     to overdose medications and interventions, and the \n     development of new medications for pain that can augment the \n     existing treatment arsenal.\n       (9) Substance use disorders are a treatable disease. \n     Discoveries in the science of addiction have led to advances \n     in the treatment of substance use disorders that help people \n     stop abusing drugs and prescription medications and resume \n     their productive lives.\n       (10) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and \n     Health, approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States \n     needed substance use disorder treatment in 2013, but only \n     2,500,000 people received it. Furthermore, current treatment \n     services are not adequate to meet demand. According to a \n     report commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration (commonly known as ``SAMHSA''), there \n     are approximately 32 providers for every 1,000 individuals \n     needing substance use disorder treatment. In some States, the \n     ratio is much lower.\n       (11) The overall cost of drug abuse, from health care- and \n     criminal justice-related costs to lost productivity, is \n     steep, totaling more than $700,000,000,000 a year, according \n     to NIDA. Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major \n     economic dividends.\n       (12) According to NIDA, when schools and communities \n     properly implement science-validated substance abuse \n     prevention programs, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit \n     drugs is reduced. Such programs help teachers, parents, and \n     healthcare professionals shape the perceptions of youths \n     about the risks of drug abuse.\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\n       (13) Diverting certain individuals with substance use \n     disorders from criminal justice systems into community-based \n     treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent sizeable \n     numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the \n     course of those individuals' lives.\n       (14) According to the DEA, more than 2,700 tons of expired, \n     unwanted prescription medications have been collected since \n     the enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act \n     of 2010 (Public Law 111-273; 124 Stat. 2858).\n       (15) Faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models can provide \n     a critical path to successful recovery for a number of people \n     in the United States. The 2015 membership survey conducted by \n     Alcoholics Anonymous (commonly known as ``AA'') found that 73 \n     percent of AA members were sober longer than 1 year and \n     attended 2.5 meetings per week.\n       (16) Research shows that combining treatment medications \n     with behavioral therapy is an effective way to facilitate \n     success for some patients. Treatment approaches must be \n     tailored to address the drug abuse patterns and drug-related \n     medical, psychiatric, and social problems of each individual. \n     Different types of medications may be useful at different \n     stages of treatment or recovery to help a patient stop using \n     drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse. Patients have a \n     range of options regarding their path to recovery and many \n     have also successfully addressed drug abuse through the use \n     of faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models.\n       (17) Individuals with mental illness, especially severe \n     mental illness, are at considerably higher risk for substance \n     abuse than the general population, and the presence of a \n     mental illness complicates recovery from substance abuse.\n       (18) Rural communities are especially susceptible to heroin \n     and opioid abuse. Individuals in rural counties have higher \n     rates of drug poisoning deaths, including deaths from \n     opioids. According to the American Journal of Public Health, \n     ``[O]pioid poisonings in nonmetropolitan counties have \n     increased at a rate greater than threefold the increase in \n     metropolitan counties.'' According to a February 19, 2016, \n     report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, \n     ``[M]ultiple studies document a higher prevalence [of abuse] \n     among specific vulnerable rural populations, particularly \n     among youth, women who are pregnant or experiencing partner \n     violence, and persons with co-occurring disorders.''\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Recovery Enhancement for \n     Addiction Treatment Act'' or the ``TREAT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Overdoses from opioids have increased dramatically in \n     the United States.\n       (2) Deaths from drug overdose, largely from prescription \n     pain relievers, have tripled among men and increased five-\n     fold among women over the past decade.\n       (3) Nationwide, drug overdoses now claim more lives than \n     car accidents.\n       (4) Opioid addiction is a chronic disease that, untreated, \n     places a large burden on the healthcare system. Roughly \n     475,000 emergency room visits each year are attributable to \n     the misuse and abuse of opioid pain medication.\n       (5) Effective medication-assisted treatment for opioid \n     addiction, in combination with counseling and behavioral \n     therapies, can decrease overdose deaths, be cost-effective, \n     reduce transmissions of HIV and viral hepatitis, and reduce \n     other social harms such as criminal activity.\n       (6) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for \n     opioid addiction should include multiple components, \n     including medications, cognitive and behavioral supports and \n     interventions, and drug testing.\n       (7) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for \n     opioid addiction may use a team of staff members, in addition \n     to a prescribing provider, to deliver comprehensive care.\n       (8) Access to medication-assisted treatments, including \n     office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment, remains limited \n     in part due to current practice regulations and an \n     insufficient number of providers.\n       (9) More than 10 years of experience in the United States \n     with office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment has informed \n     best practices for delivering successful, high quality care.\n\n     SEC. 803.
