Mr. President, the Keystone jobs bill is a bipartisan \ninfrastructure project the American people deserve, so the vote last \nnight to filibuster was certainly disappointing. The Keystone jobs bill \nhas been considered and reported out of the energy committee. It has \nbeen subject to weeks of open debate. Senators on both sides have been \nable to offer and vote on amendments--two dozen so far and counting. \nOur Democratic friends have had more amendments considered on this bill \nthan Republicans, more amendments than all of last year combined.\n  Just a few days ago we offered our friends the opportunity to have \neven more of their amendments voted on. Unfortunately, they rejected \nthat offer. So today I am asking them to reconsider, join us, and work \nwith the bill managers, Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell. Let's \nget your amendments processed, and let's make progress for the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S495-7", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake).

Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senators who are \nworking on the amendments on the Keystone Canadian pipeline. This is \nthe highest priority of the new Republican majority, a pipeline that is \nbeing built on behalf of a Canadian company.\n  You would think there would be a lot of other possibilities here to \ncreate jobs for America, but the Senate Republicans are focused on this \none. Ultimately it will produce 35 permanent jobs in America, and this \nis their highest priority. Had they taken up instead the Federal \nhighway bill--a bill which is looming in terms of a deadline this \nyear--we literally could have created thousands of American jobs across \nAmerica, not just in one pipeline location. But they chose instead to \nhelp this Canadian company build this pipeline.\n  Sadly, it won't produce products that can help America. We had an \namendment offered here on the floor that said any refined products that \ncame from this pipeline would be sold in America. It was defeated. \nEvery Republican voted against that amendment.\n  Then we offered an amendment that said this pipeline, if it is going \nto be built in America, should use American steel. Every Republican \nvoted against that, save one.\n  The notion that we are going to use foreign steel to build a pipeline \nfor a Canadian company so that the refined products from that pipeline \ncan be exported overseas is somehow, in the eyes of the majority in the \nSenate, an American jobs bill. I don't think the American people would \nagree with that. They would understand, if we were taking up the \nFederal highway bill, that is an American jobs bill. We put \nconstruction workers across the United States to work and create an \ninfrastructure that would build on the economy, creating more jobs in \ncommunities from Arizona to Illinois, from Florida to the State of \nWashington. But instead we are focused on the Keystone Canadian \npipeline, the highest priority of the Senate Republican majority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S495-9", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S495-S497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a little more than a month the \nDepartment\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\nof Homeland Security in Washington, DC, will run out of money. It is \nhard to imagine that the agency responsible for combating terrorism in \nthe United States has its budget in question, but that was the design \nwhen the people sat down to write the Omnibus appropriations bill last \nyear. The Republicans in the House insisted that if we were going to \nfund the rest of government, we had to withhold regular funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That is why the deadline of February \n27 is looming.\n  The Department of Homeland Security more than any other single agency \nis responsible for keeping America safe from terrorism. They supervise \nand manage the TSA officers and airports. They collect weapons that \npeople try to bring on airplanes. It is hard to imagine that people \nstill do. They try to keep us safe at a time when we know terrorism is \na threat not just in the United States but in countries all over the \nworld.\n  Yet the Republicans in the House and Senate do not want to give \nregular funding to the Department of Homeland Security. They put it on \ntemporary funding. As Mr. Johnson, the Secretary of this Department, \nsaid, it puts them at a real disadvantage at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in keeping America safe. Yet the Republicans have insisted on \nthis. Why? Why would they withhold regular funding for this critical \nagency? Because they are exercised by the President's decision to issue \nExecutive orders on immigration. Their anger over the President's \naction has led them to jeopardize the immediate funding of an agency of \ncritical importance to the United States. So they set out in the House \nof Representatives to add five riders to this appropriations bill which \nthey insist must be passed if we are going to fund this agency. When \nyou look at these five riders, I think you can understand why many of \nus think this is nothing short of an outrage.\n  One of the things which they have set their sights on is a program I \nhave worked on for 14 years here in the Senate. I introduced a bill 14 \nyears ago called the DREAM Act--14 years ago. The concept behind it was \nvery basic: Children brought to the United States by their parents who \nare undocumented deserve a chance--a chance to make a life in America \nif they have no serious criminal issues, if they have graduated from \nhigh school, if they are prepared to step forward, go to college, or \nserve in the military. The DREAM Act was introduced 14 years ago with a \nbasic concept: Don't hold children responsible for bad decisions or \nwrongdoing by their parents. Give these young people a chance.\n  Sadly, in the House of Representatives there is an anger against \nthese young people that is almost difficult to describe. We think there \nare almost 2 million of them in America, and 600,000 have stepped \nforward to qualify for the DACA Program, an Executive order by the \nPresident that spares them from deportation while they are living in \nthe United States. But the House of Representatives has insisted that \nwe repeal the DACA Program, not issue any renewals for DACA protection, \nand not issue any new DACA protection for the 1.5 million who may still \nbe eligible. That is one of their conditions before they will fund the \nagency that deals with terrorism to protect the United States from \nterrorism.\n  This last weekend there were several very unusual and important \nmeetings involving the American political scene. One was in California \nhosted by the Koch brothers which attracted three of our Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle who were at least considering, if not \naspiring to be President of the United States. The Koch brothers called \nthem in for a presentation and questions as part of the process of \ndeciding whether the Koch brothers would support them to be the next \nPresident of the United States. That is not the first time that has \nhappened. Others representing special interest groups I am sure have \ncalled candidates before. This is a very overt effort by two very \npowerful men to spend almost $1 billion in the next political cycle to \ncontrol the political future of this country.\n  As troubling as that is for most Americans to hear, there was another \nforum that I think was equally disturbing in my neighboring State of \nIowa. This was a forum called by Congressman Steve King. He called it a \nfreedom forum. He attracted a large array of Republican aspirants to \nthe office of President. Included in those were Governor Christie of \nNew Jersey; Senator Cruz of Texas; former Senator Santorum of \nPennsylvania; Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin; former Governor \nPalin of Alaska; Donald Trump; former Governor Perry of Texas; and \nformer Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. They all came to Iowa to be \npart of this freedom forum. This freedom forum was sponsored by \nCongressman Steve King.\n  Without question, Congressman King has made some of the most \noutrageous statements about the DREAMers, whom I described earlier, of \nany Member of Congress. He has compared them to dogs. He has referred \nto DREAMers as the deportables--whatever that means.\n  He has one oft-quoted statement: For every valedictorian among the \nDREAMers, there were 100 who had developed cantaloupe-sized calves \ncarrying illegal narcotics across the border into the United States.\n  That is the kind of rhetoric which might cause David Duke to blush, \nbut it didn't stop these Republican Presidential aspirants from \ntrekking out to Iowa to pay homage to Congressman Steven King.\n  I would suggest that the Grand Old Party, which I do respect--the \nparty of Abraham Lincoln--would be a party that would be embarrassed by \nthe comments of Congressman King rather than pay homage to him in the \nState of Iowa.\n  I wish to tell the story of one of the DREAMers whom Congressman King \nparticularly would come to dislike because this is an undocumented \nperson and one of the DREAMers who would be disadvantaged by the \nRepublican action in the House of Representatives which would literally \nremove the protection this young lady has from deportation.\n  This is Ola Kaso. Her story is amazing. She was brought to the United \nStates from Albania in 1998 at the age of 5. She grew up in Warren, MI, \nand her dream was to become a medical doctor and to treat cancer \npatients. Ola was the valedictorian of her high school class. She took \nevery advanced placement class offered by her school and had 4.4 grade \npoint average.\n  She was treasurer of the student council and treasurer of the \nNational Honor Society at her school. In 2011, I held a hearing on the \nDREAM Act. Ola Kaso had just graduated from high school and she came to \ntestify at that hearing. She was the first ever undocumented immigrant \nto testify before the Senate.\n  In the fall of 2011, Ola entered the honors program at the University \nof Michigan where she is a premed student. What has happened to Ola \nKaso since DACA was established in 2012? Ola has become involved in \npublic service. In 2013 she worked as an intern in the office of our \nformer colleague Senator Carl Levin. She continued her studies. This \nspring Ola will graduate from the University of Michigan with a double \nmajor in biochemistry and women's studies.\n  Keep in mind she completed this degree without any financial \nassistance from our government. Ola is not eligible for Pell grants or \nstudent loans because she is undocumented. She has become involved in \nnanotechnology, a cutting-edge field that holds great promise for \nfuture technological breakthroughs. Ola is now conducting at the \nMichigan Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and Biological Sciences. \nLast year Ola's work was published in the Journal of Physical \nChemistry. I want to read the name of the article which Ola Kaso \npublished. I hope I will be spared, a liberal arts lawyer, if I stumble \nover some of these words. But just to give you an idea of her research, \nthe article was entitled ``Atomic Force Microscopy Probing of Receptor-\nNanoparticle Interactions for Riboflavin Receptor Targeted Gold-\nDendrimer Nanocomposites.''\n  Now, that is a mouthful, but it gives you a sense of how much Ola \nKaso has to contribute. Next, Ola plans to attend medical school, but \nif the House Republicans have their way and we pass in the Senate the \nlanguage which was included as part of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill, Ola Kaso will never have a chance. She \nwill be deported back to Albania, a\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\ncountry she does not know at all. She will be forced to leave the \nUnited States.\n  We will basically give up on the investment we have made as Americans \nin her education and her potential and tell her: Leave. In the words of \nCongressman Steve King, she is one of the ``deportables''--one of the \n``deportables.'' Ola sent me a letter recently. Here is what she said \nabout her dreams for the future:\n\n       I aspire to ultimately become a surgical oncologist, but \n     more importantly, I intend to work for patients that cannot \n     afford the astronomical fees accompanying life-saving \n     surgeries, patients are denied the medical treatment they \n     deserve. My goal is not to increase my bank account; my goal \n     is to decrease preventable deaths. I wish to remain in this \n     country to make a difference.\n\n  Ola is not alone. There are so many DREAMers across this country just \nlike her who want to be part of our future. It is clear this DACA \nProgram works for America. That is why I am asking DREAMers around the \ncountry to join me, post their stories about what they have done with \nDACA on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag ``DACA Works.''\n  I want the American people to understand the human cost of the bill \nthat was passed by the Republicans in the House of Representatives and \nis now pending before the Senate. If this bill becomes law, DACA will \nend. Hundreds of thousands of DREAMers will risk deportation to \ncountries they can barely remember. Will America be stronger if we \ndeport Ola Kaso and others like her, young people who want to use their \ntalents to give back to America, deporting them to countries they have \nsome loose connection to by family ties?\n  Of course not. It is shameless--shameless to play politics with the \nlives of these young people. They grew up in this country, attended \nschool in this country, put their hand over their hearts in their \nclassrooms every day to pledge allegiance to the only flag they have \never known. It is shameless for the House Republicans to put homeland \nsecurity funding at risk in pursuit of punishing these young people. \nThe House Republicans feel so strongly about deporting DREAMers, they \nare willing to hold our homeland security funding hostage.\n  The House Republicans are telling the Senate and the President: \nDeport the DREAMers or we will shut down the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I hope the Senate majority leader will reject this blackmail \nand bring a clean homeland security appropriations bill to the floor of \nthe Senate as soon as possible.\n  For our part, the Senate Democrats will insist that the Department of \nHomeland Security be funded and that the President have the authority, \nwhich every President has, to establish America's immigration policies. \nThe Presiding Officer was part of an effort, as I was several years, to \ntry to resolve this issue in a thoughtful, balanced, comprehensive way.\n  The ultimate bill that was considered before the Senate was not \nperfect. Parts of it I did not like at all, but we reached a \ncompromise. Over a year and a half ago, we sent that bipartisan bill to \nthe House of Representatives asking them to call it for consideration \nand amendment. They refused, refused for more than a year and a half to \ncall that bill. Instead, what they have done is launch these attacks on \nyoung people such as Ola Kaso.\n  Is that what America is all about? Is that the best we can do? For \nthe dozen or more Republican Presidential aspirants who made that \njourney out to Iowa to pay homage to Congressman Steve King and his \nviews about immigration, I would ask them to, when they return home: \nLook around you. There are young people just like this young woman who \nare only asking for a chance to be part of America's future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                International Holocaust Remembrance Day\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is International Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, commemorating the genocide that resulted in the murder \nof nearly 6 million Jews by the Nazi regime. On this day in 1945, the \nallied forces entered Auschwitz, a complex of concentration and death \ncamps in Nazi-occupied Poland. They liberated more than 7,000 \nprisoners. Auschwitz was made up of 3 main camps and more than 40 \nsubcamps covering over 15 square miles. Between 1940 and 1945 nearly \n1.3 million people were deported to Auschwitz and at least 1.1 million \nwere murdered.\n  By January 1945 the allied forces were closing in. To eliminate \nwitnesses to their crimes, thousands of prisoners were killed at \nAuschwitz, and 60,000 were forced to march west days before the \nliberation.\n  During these marches SS guards shot anyone who fell behind or could \nnot continue. More than 15,000 died in that march. In the months prior \nto the liberation, an elderly French inmate urged a young Jewish \nprisoner named Olga to watch everything she saw, and when the war was \nover, to tell the world what she had seen. Olga wrote her memoirs in \nthe years that followed and gave voice to those who could no longer \nspeak.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post featured the horrific stories of four \nAuschwitz survivors, including those who suffered under the sadistic \nNazi doctor Josef Mengele, known as the Angel of Death. GEN Dwight D. \nEisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the allied forces in Europe also \nunderstood the importance of documenting what he saw. After visiting a \nrecently liberated Nazi camp, General Eisenhower urged Washington to \nsend a congressional delegation to witness Nazi crimes firsthand so in \nthe future there could be no attempt to dismiss these allegations as \nmere propaganda. With the remaining eyewitnesses in their twilight \nyears, the responsibility to ensure that future generations never \nforget these atrocities falls to us. Recently I joined my colleagues \nSenators Mikulski, Cardin, Kirk and others and introduced a resolution \ncommemorating this important anniversary. This resolution calls on us \nto be witnesses to the 1.1 million innocent victims murdered at \nAuschwitz and honors the legacy of the survivors of the Holocaust.\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\n  Last Congress I chaired the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights and Human Rights. Although I am disappointed that the \nRepublicans chose to change the name of that subcommittee under their \nleadership, I am going to continue to focus on protecting human rights \nand civil rights.\n  When I chaired the subcommittee, I tried to give a platform to voices \nthat are not often heard and to examine what needs to be done to \nprotect human rights. Our responsibility in Congress is to focus on \nlegislation, not lamentation. So we wrote legislation and passed bills \nto hold the perpetrators of serious human rights violations accountable \nfor their crimes.\n  In 2007 my Genocide Accountability Act was enacted, allowing \nprosecution of genocide committed outside the United States or by \nsomeone other than a U.S. national outside the United States. The \nfollowing year President Bush signed the Child Soldiers Accountability \nAct, which I also introduced. In 2010 the Child Soldiers Accountability \nAct was used to deport Liberian warlord Dr. George Boley.\n  I have also authored the Trafficking in Persons Accountability Act, \nthe Human Rights Enforcement Act, the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, \nthe Child Marriage Prevention Act, Congo Conflict Minerals Act, all \nlegislation aimed at protecting human rights in terrible situations, \nall of which became law.\n  Our hearts go out to the survivors who mourn their families and the \nmillions of others murdered in the Holocaust. Today many of the \nsurvivors will return to Auschwitz. They will recall that moment when \nthey first arrived more than 70 years ago and passed under a sign that \nmockingly read, in German, ``Work makes you free.'' Standing before \nthem was Josef Mengele to await their fate. Turning right meant death \nin the gas chamber, turning left may have meant survival, for a few \nweeks at least. So many voices were silenced that now we have to tell \ntheir stories.\n\n  As the memory of the Holocaust passes from those who were there to \nthe generations that were not, we cannot forget the importance of \nremembrance and speaking out against intolerance whenever and wherever \nit occurs. Unfortunately these horrible crimes still take place. \nConsider Boko Haram in Nigeria, ISIL in Syria and Iraq, and the \nbarbaric systems of gulag in North Korea. We cannot be silent.\n  As Holocaust survivor Ruth Eglash said in yesterday's Washington \nPost:\n\n       I used to be an optimist until a few years ago, but the \n     situation in the Middle East has changed and the world does \n     not notice anything. . . . The bottom line is, it can happen \n     again and it is happening again in many places, not \n     necessarily to the Jews, but to anyone.\n\n  Our promise to hold accountable those who commit the most unspeakable \ncrimes will ring hollow unless we lead the world in punishing those \nresponsible for the gravest human rights violations. I look forward to \ncontinuing working with my colleagues in the Senate to make progress \ntoward ending genocide and human rights abuses everywhere they exist. \nWe should all proclaim in one voice: Never again.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Funding the Department of Homeland Security\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today on the important issue of \nfunding the Department of Homeland Security and to urge my colleagues \nto come together and pass a clean appropriations bill with regard to \nthis agency.\n  The Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, is charged with border \nsecurity and immigration enforcement. DHS's role extends far beyond \nimmigration. The agency is also responsible for aviation security, \nemergency management and response, counterterrorism, and cyber \nsecurity.\n  Democrats and Republicans have long worked together to make sure our \nhard-working Federal officers on the border, in our airports, and at \nour ports can continue their critical work that keeps us safe.\n  Now the Republican-controlled House would irresponsibly risk shutting \ndown the Department of Homeland Security to score political points over \nthe President's immigration actions. Today I object to the effort to \nshut down DHS over the President's immigration Executive action because \nit is not only an irresponsible strategy from a security point of view, \nbut it comes with a real cost in the everyday lives of students and \nparents.\n  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire \nFebruary 27. The President has been clear that he will veto any policy \nriders that undo his Executive action and harm millions of students and \ntheir families. The House Republican bill forces us to choose between \nshutting down the Department of Homeland Security or deporting children \nand families. This is an untenable choice.\n  Looking at the votes in the House, it is clear some Members of \nCongress would on the one hand say our immigration focus should be on \nsecuring our border, while on the other hand they risk turning off the \nlights at Border Patrol stations because they disagree with the \nPresident's immigration policies.\n  Last year I led a congressional delegation to McAllen, TX, and to \nLackland Air Force Base to see the humanitarian crisis on the border \nfirsthand. My colleagues and I were heartbroken after seeing children \nas young as 7 years old in Customs and Border Protection facilities.\n  But what we also saw were hard-working border agents doing the best \nthey could under difficult circumstances in an already stressed \nimmigration system. These agents should know that we in Washington are \ngoing to give them the resources they need to do their jobs, not \nirresponsibly shut down the Department of Homeland Security, for whom \nthey work.\n  Instead of threatening to shut down the government's primary homeland \nsecurity agency, we should be working together to once again pass \nbipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. Republicans and Democrats \nagree our immigration system is broken.\n  With his Executive action President Obama took a step to bring \nmillions across the country out of the shadows and keep U.S. citizens \nand their families together. Congressional action that puts families \nfirst is needed if we are to permanently fix our immigration system.\n  The President's Executive action helps millions of people across \nAmerica by allowing certain students and families to register, work \nlegally, and pay their taxes. His action is rooted in the reality that \nour immigration enforcement officers need to exercise discretion on \nwhom to go after with limited resources and in a broken immigration \nsystem.\n  Those who oppose the President's action, which is reflected in the \nHouse Republican bill, say that the President and enforcement officers \nmust act with absolutely no discretion. This position contemplates and, \nin fact, supports the removal of nearly 12 million undocumented people \nfrom our country. This is paramount to a policy of mass deportation.\n  If mass deportation were enacted, DHS would need an exponential \nincrease in funding and resources. Billions in increased spending \nwithout any permanent fixes or reforms is not a viable option. Even if \nwe somehow have the resources to enact the policy of mass deportation, \ndoing so would devastate our economy, removing millions of hard-working \npeople who would no longer be working, running businesses, buying our \ngoods and products. That would lead to over $2.5 trillion of economic \nloss to our country in just a decade.\n  Mass deportation is not a serious solution for immigration reform. It \nsimply is not possible for DHS to remove every undocumented person from \nthis country.\n  Passing the House bill would just make life even harder for these \npeople, many of whom are already some of the hardest working people in \nour Nation.\n  As I mentioned, there are nearly 12 million undocumented people \nliving in communities across America. Many have been living here for \nyears or decades. They are parents, they are small\n\n[[Page S499]]\n\nbusiness owners, and they are our neighbors and our children's \nclassmates at school.\n  They are people such as Bianca, a woman who lives in Hawaii with her \nfamily. After moving to the United States on a visa over a decade ago, \nBianca met her husband. They moved to the place where they had always \ndreamed of living--Hawaii, naturally--and began a family there.\n  Bianca's work visa and her husband's work visa were temporary, and \nlike many immigrant families they faced a tough decision to remain \nafter their visas expired and to continue building a life here in \nAmerica. Bianca and her husband started with nothing. Today they have \ntwo small businesses on Oahu and four American children--children born \nin the United States. Their businesses employ American citizens. They \npay their taxes, and they work hard to provide for their families and \nbe engaged in the community.\n  Because of the President's order, Bianca and her family no longer \nlive in fear every single day of being torn from the life they have \nbuilt in Hawaii.\n  The House Republicans' mass deportation policy is a serious proposal \nin only one respect. It would result in serious, negative consequences \nfor our economy, our government, and millions of families in our \ncountry.\n  In contrast, prioritizing deporting felons, not families and \nstudents, is simply common sense, and that is what the President's \nExecutive order does.\n  Now is the time when we should be working together on commonsense and \ncomprehensive immigration reform that the vast majority of Americans \nsupport. Comprehensive immigration reform is supported by 70 percent of \nthe American people. In the past Congress, nearly 70 percent of the \nSenate supported our bipartisan immigration bill.\n  Our bipartisan bill was a compromise. It strengthened border \nsecurity, modernized our system, addressed visa backlogs, and allowed \nmillions of undocumented people to step out of the shadows, get in \nline, and work toward becoming American citizens. Comprehensive \nimmigration reform would have spurred economic growth in our country by \nover $100 billion per year while helping to bring down the deficit.\n  The only thing that kept this bipartisan reform bill from becoming \nlaw was the fact that Speaker Boehner refused to give the bill an up-\nor-down vote in the House. Recklessly shutting down the Department of \nHomeland Security will not fix our broken immigration system. Undoing \nthe President's Executive action will not fix our broken immigration \nsystem. We must work together, and we must fund the Department of \nHomeland Security so that they can continue to protect our country, and \nwe must come together to pass commonsense reform that Americans \nsupport.\n  Both sides of the aisle agree that we are a nation of immigrants and \nour immigration system is broken. We don't need to shut down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security or round up and deport millions of \nfamilies and individuals.\n  We can start that process with a clean DHS funding bill, and I urge \nmy Republican colleagues to bring one to the floor quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I rise this morning to join our colleagues in \ndiscussing the need for a clean, full-year bill to fund the Department \nof Homeland Security. Just 30 days from today, funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security expires unless Congress acts.\n  I know that sometimes in congressional time 30 days may seem like a \nlong time, but with a scheduled recess in a few weeks and the certain \nfact that the House-passed bill cannot pass the Senate, we must act \nsoon to prevent a shutdown and provide the resources to keep our \ncountry safe.\n  Luckily, there is a path forward to prevent a shutdown. We should \npass the bipartisan, bicameral, Homeland Security funding bill that was \nagreed to last December.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Senator Mikulski, then Chair of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and Congressman Rogers, Chair of the House \nAppropriations Committee, negotiated spending bills for the entire \ngovernment, including the Department of Homeland Security bill. This \nwas a compromise measure. Not everyone got what they wanted, but the \nbill funded the Department at levels that would ensure the Department \ncan fulfill its mission to secure the homeland.\n  Then, unfortunately, politics came into play. Some House Republicans \ndemanded the homeland bill be removed from the larger budget because of \nimmigration issues, and now the entire Department is funded on a short-\nterm basis through February 27. Now we face a fundamental question: Are \nwe going to put the country at risk because of an ideological \ndisagreement?\n  Since Senator Mikulski and Congressman Rogers reached that agreement \nin December, we have seen many threats to our Nation and to our allies. \nThe U.S. law enforcement community is on high alert for terror threats \nafter attacks in Australia and Ottawa, Canada, and in Paris. Recently, \nan Ohio man was arrested when it was discovered he was plotting to blow \nup the U.S. Capitol in an ISIS-inspired plan. Now is not the time to be \nholding up funding for the Department of Homeland Security because of \nideological reasons.\n  Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's cyber security center in Arlington. The center is where \nofficials are working every day to prevent attacks not just against the \nFederal Government or against State governments but against the private \nsector, against U.S. companies such as Sony, and against critical \ninfrastructure such as nuclear powerplants and the electric grid.\n  Last week, in the Armed Services Committee, former National Security \nAdviser Brent Scowcroft said that he views cyber security threats to be \n``as dangerous as nuclear weapons.''\n  We must continue to make important investments in our cyber defenses. \nBut if we fail to fully fund their budget--the clean budget that was \nagreed to by the House and Senate--their efforts to identify the newest \ntechnologies and strategies to protect our cyber infrastructure will be \nput on hold.\n  One of the things they talked to me about when I visited the center \nincludes two areas I think are particularly important to our national \nsecurity. One is the effort to identify a secure emergency response \nline, which is very critical when we have national emergencies--even \nthe snowstorm we are seeing in the northeast in New Hampshire, where we \nhave several feet of snow that is being predicted. We also need a \nsecure emergency response line so our first responders--the people \nthere on the ground when an emergency happens--can communicate with \neach other. That is at risk if we pass a CR rather than a clean funding \nbill.\n  The other thing at risk is the effort to identify the next generation \nof cyber threats. There are things being worked on that we don't even \nknow yet, and unless we are ahead of that curve we are not going to be \nthere to protect our cyber system throughout the country. So we need to \ngive the Department of Homeland Security budgetary certainty so it can \nplan and prepare for these kinds of threats. That is why a short-term \ncontinuing resolution should be off the table. We need to pass a bill \nthat funds homeland security for the rest of this fiscal year.\n  A short-term budget means the Department is on autopilot. That would \nbe extraordinarily bad for business and for our national security. If \nHomeland Security operates under a short-term budget, new projects and \ngrants are halted, contracts and acquisitions are postponed, hiring is \ndelayed, employee training is scaled back, and grants to our first \nresponders--those people on the ground when something happens--are not \ngoing to be awarded, and congressionally targeted reductions--those \nreductions we want to make in wasteful programs--are also put on hold.\n  Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit New Hampshire's fusion \ncenter. Every State has a fusion center. This is a network of centers \ndesigned to serve as a focal point in each State to coordinate \nterrorism-related information and threats to our national security, to \nour State security, and to our municipalities. It is a place where \nfirst responders, local law enforcement, and in New\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\nHampshire's fusion center, in addition to our State and local folks \nbeing represented, someone from the FBI is there on hand, someone from \nthe Department of Homeland Security identifies potential threats and \nrelays that information up and down the chain of command.\n  In New Hampshire, the fusion center has also been very critical in \nworking to address drug interdiction and to help identify the heroin \nabuse epidemic that, sadly, we have seen not only in New Hampshire but \nin northern New England. If we have a short-term budget, new grants to \nour fusion centers, which are on the front lines of protecting our \nStates and municipalities against security threats, and the security \ngrants to State and local law enforcement will not be awarded.\n  Why would we threaten this important public safety and security \nfunding for unrelated ideological reasons?\n  Secretary Jeh Johnson recently said:\n\n       As long as this Department continues to operate on a \n     continuing resolution, we are prevented from funding key \n     homeland security initiatives. These include, for example, \n     funding for new grants to State and local law enforcement, \n     additional border security resources, and additional Secret \n     Service resources to implement the changes recommended by the \n     independent panel. Other core missions, such as aviation \n     security and protection of Federal installations and \n     personnel, are also hampered.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, Jeh Johnson.\n  In addition to what he lays out there, I want to highlight a few \nspecific examples of why a short-term budget--a continuing resolution--\nis problematic for the Department and for our national security.\n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement--ICE--could not fund all of its \ncurrent detention, antitrafficking, and smuggling requirements under a \nshort-term budget. Under a short-term budget, ICE will not have the \nfunding they need to meet their legal mandate to have 34,000 detention \nbeds in place for immigration detainees nor funding for a new family \ndetention center.\n  So for those people concerned about our border security, concerned \nabout people coming into this country, why would we want to deny \nfunding to address efforts to interdict people coming across the \nborder, to interdict surveillance efforts, to build a new family \ndetention center so we can find out who these people are and whether \nthey should go back to the country they came from? It makes no sense.\n  Under a short-term budget, there is no funding to hire additional \ninvestigators for antitrafficking and smuggling cases to combat the \ninflux of unaccompanied children at the southern border.\n  Under a short-term budget, no funding is provided to address Secret \nService weaknesses identified after the recent White House fence-\njumping incident.\n  Yesterday we saw concerns about how the Secret Service operates. This \ntime I think everybody acknowledged they could not have been expected \nto intervene in the drone that got dropped on the White House lawn, but \nit highlights again the threats that are there and why we need to \nensure the Secret Service has the resources to reform itself and to \nmake sure the President and officials are protected.\n  A short-term budget would delay the contract for the Coast Guard's \neighth national security cutter we need for maritime security.\n  In New Hampshire, we have a border with the ocean, so we very much \nappreciate the work of the Coast Guard, but I think it is critical \nthroughout the country. And one of the things that would be put on hold \nis upgrading the Coast Guard's ice-breaking fleet.\n  Last winter alone, when the Great Lakes froze, $705 million in \nshipping was lost and 3,800 jobs because we didn't have a Coast Guard \nice-breaker that can open a channel on the Great Lakes.\n  Under a short-term budget, aging nuclear weapons equipment will not \nbe replaced. That causes gaps in an area where mistakes are simply \nunacceptable and too dangerous even to comprehend.\n  A short-term budget would delay upgrades to emergency communications \nfor first responders--something I have already talked about--as we \nthink about how they respond to local emergencies.\n  The best way forward is to provide certainty and stability for the \nmen and women who fulfill homeland security's mission to protect the \nUnited States from harm. To ensure our local communities and our States \nthat we are providing the resources they need, we need to pass a clean \nbill--a clean bill that was agreed to last December.\n  Lurching from funding crisis to funding crisis is a terrible way to \ngovern. It is an especially terrible way to govern when our Nation is \ndealing with major threats. The clean bill that was agreed to by the \nHouse and Senate last December provides a good budget that strengthens \nour Nation, protects against known threats, properly supports homeland \nsecurity and those who serve on the front lines of protecting this \ncountry.\n  The negotiated agreement includes critical increases in funding and \nsupport for border security, for cyber security, and for other national \nsecurity initiatives. It maintains strong maritime security operations \nprovided by the Coast Guard. The agreement fully funds continued cyber \nsecurity advancements. It invests in innovative solutions for border \nsecurity, for biological defense, and for explosives detection.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle have talked about the importance \nof border security and a clean bill that robustly funds border security \nrequirements. The clean bill funds customs and border protections \nrequirements to apprehend, care for, and transmit unaccompanied alien \nchildren, while maintaining 21,370 Border Patrol agents on our borders \nand safely facilitating legitimate travel and trade.\n  The agreement also funds enhanced border security technologies as \nwell as air and marine surveillance along our land and maritime borders \nto help the Department better interdict illegal crossing of people and \nnarcotics.\n  It allocates grant funding to train and equip first responders, \ncontinuing real progress and efficient preparedness, as was so evident \nin New England in the response to the Boston marathon bombing.\n  And the agreement fully funds known disaster needs and prepares us \nfor the next disaster.\n  In closing, let us support our national security funding by passing a \nclean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the rest of \nthis fiscal year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today I stand in support of the Keystone \nPipeline project. As an Alaskan, I feel it is important to talk about \nthis bill and the importance of American energy infrastructure.\n  I live in a State with one of the world's largest pipelines. In 1973, \nafter bitter debate--similar to the debate about Keystone--Congress \npassed a bill that led to the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nSystem--what we in Alaska call TAPS. It almost didn't happen. The Vice \nPresident at the time, serving as the President of the Senate, cast the \ntie-breaking vote. Then, like now, opponents howled. They said TAPS \nwould be an environmental disaster. They said bird and caribou \npopulations would be decimated.\n  But none of that happened. In fact, birds and caribou flourished, \nshowing we can develop energy infrastructure responsibly with the \nhighest standards in the world. Alaska proves this every day. TAPS was \ncompleted in 1978. It has carried almost 17 billion barrels of oil to \nenergy-thirsty American markets. It is a technological and \nenvironmental marvel and a critical component of America's energy \ninfrastructure. It has been a resounding success for this country and \nfor my State. It is the engine of growth for Alaska's economy. The \nproven safest, most environmentally responsible way to transport oil is \nthrough a pipeline. I am certain Keystone will also prove a success.\n\n  In supporting Keystone, I am also standing for a larger, more \nimportant principle--the ideal that the Federal Government should be a \npartner in opportunity, a partner in progress, not an obstacle. I am \nstanding in support of what has defined this country for centuries--the \nidea of the American dream.\n  The American dream is still alive in my home State. Yes, we have \nmajor challenges, like all States. But in Alaska, we still have hope. \nWe still dream\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\nbig dreams, and TAPS helps fuel these dreams.\n  In Alaska, the very air we breathe is bathed in promise. The people \nstill speak the language of bold ideas and rugged adventure. It is \nthese people of all colors and creeds who make up the tapestry of \nAlaska that give us our strength. It is the enormous opportunities of \nour natural resources--whether world-class fisheries or oil and gas \nreserves--that drive the economic engine of my State.\n  But despite this promise and opportunity, I also see anxiety and \nfrustration, and even fear, in the eyes of my fellow Alaskans, just as \nI know others are seeing this across the country. Despite what we are \nhearing from this administration, Americans have real reasons to feel \nthis way.\n  Business startups are at a 35-year low, as is the percentage of \nAmericans actually looking for work. More small businesses failed than \nwere started this past year. Over three-quarters of Americans now \nbelieve their kids' future will be less promising than their own.\n  Believing that we will leave our children a better tomorrow is the \nessence of the American dream. But for many, that dream is starting to \nfade. This does not have to be. We live in a State and a country with \nso much untapped potential, so many opportunities, and so much promise \nthat can bring limitless possibilities for our kids and our grandkids. \nYet, in Alaska and throughout America, people are feeling that the \nheavy hand of the Federal Government is not working in their interests.\n  The boldness of America is being bludgeoned by bureaucrats, with new \nExecutive orders and regulations arising everywhere. And every time \nanother one of those unneeded, often absurd, regulations is \npromulgated, a little bit of hope dies.\n  A little bit of hope dies every time a doctor's office is shuttered \nor someone loses health care because of the complexities and costs of \nObamaCare.\n  A little hope dies when a rural community wants to build a road that \nwill protect its citizens and is told by the Secretary of the Interior \nthat birds are more important than their lives.\n  And a lot of hope dies when the people in my State are told that the \nresources that are rightfully theirs can't be developed, and their \nlands and waters can't be fished and hunted to put food on their table.\n  I support the Keystone Pipeline. It will create thousands of jobs. \nThat is why it has the overwhelming support of American labor unions. \nIt will enhance America's energy infrastructure and contribute billions \nto our economy. That is why it has the support of the American people.\n  But just one bill, one pipeline, one project is not enough. It is not \nnearly enough.\n  Since the founding of this country we have had important debates \nright here, on this floor, about the role of the Federal Government in \nour lives. Judging from what Americans are telling us, the reach of the \nFederal Government has hit its limits, it has exceeded its limits. Our \ncitizens are telling us that their government--and it is their \ngovernment--has gone well beyond deriving its powers from the consent \nof the government. What the American people are telling us, what \nAlaskans are telling me is they want a Federal Government that helps \nignite their hope, not smother it.\n  We have a job to do. We must work to address the anxiety and \nfrustration of the people we serve. We must work to once again unleash \nthe great potential that is Alaska and America. And we must work to \nreinvigorate faith in the American dream.\n  How do we do this? Let me suggest two ideas.\n  First, we must stop delaying economic projects that benefit our \ncitizens. Purposeful delays and roadblocks have been the hallmark of \nthis administration's approach to infrastructure projects that benefit \nAmericans, and Alaska has been ground zero for such delays. Bridges, \nroads, mines that take years simply to permit, not to build; oil wells \nthat cannot be drilled on Federal lands despite billions of dollars of \nleases from the private sector to the Federal Government; a state-of-\nthe-art clean coal plant that sits idle for over a decade despite the \ndire need for lower cost energy throughout Alaska.\n  The Keystone Pipeline, a project that has been studied for 6 years, \nis just the latest example of the willful delay that has been the \nweapon of choice for this administration for killing projects they \ndon't like.\n  Enough is enough. We are Americans. We know what we are capable of. \nWe built the 1,700-mile Alaskan-Canadian Highway, the Alcan Highway, \nthrough some of the world's most rugged terrain, in less than a year. \nWe built the Empire State Building in 410 days. The Pentagon was built \nin 16 months. There is no reason that Keystone should have been studied \nfor 6 years.\n  If the executive branch continues to dither on America's economic \nfuture, Congress can and should act to expedite such projects. That is \nwhat we are doing with Keystone, and that is what I will be pressing \nthe Congress to do for Alaska's and America's next great energy \ninfrastructure project--the Alaska LNG project--which will create \nthousands of jobs and provide clean and affordable energy to Americans \nand our allies for decades.\n  Second, we need more, not less, access to our Federal lands. As \nAmericans, these are our lands. We own them. They are not the \nDepartment of the Interior's or BLM's lands. Yet this administration is \nadamant on keeping us from responsibly developing them. Once again, \nAlaska is ground zero for their efforts.\n  Through Executive orders of various dubious legal merit, this \nadministration locked up half the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska. \nThis isn't a national park. NPRA is an area specifically set aside by \nCongress for oil and gas development. And just this weekend, in another \nbrazen action, the Obama administration announced they are working to \nlock up millions of acres of land on Alaska's coastal plain, some of \nthe Nation's richest oil and gas prospects.\n  This is an affront to Alaskans and Americans who cherish security--\nenergy security--the rule of law, and the strength of our Nation, and \nit is an affront to Members of Congress regardless of party. How we \ndevelop Alaska's lands is an area where Congress, not the Executive, \nhas preeminent authority.\n  I think the Obama administration needs a reminder of what article 4, \nsection 3 of the Constitution states:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all \n     needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or \n     other Property belonging to the United States . . .\n\n  This brings me to my third point: We must get back to the rule of \nlaw. The rule of law, carefully built up and nurtured for centuries in \nAmerica, is a fundamental pillar of our great Nation. Most countries \ndon't have it. We do. It is a gift. But if we continue to erode this \nrule of law, we ultimately undermine what it means to be an American, \nand it will be hard to get it back.\n  But I hope, because there are still enough of us here who respect the \nrule of law and see the Constitution not as a mere suggestion but as \nthe foundation for the structure of our government and our individual \nliberties. There have been cracks in the foundation recently, but the \npeople sent us here to repair those cracks.\n  Fourth, while I believe in a limited Federal Government, it is \nimportant to recognize where the Federal Government does not have \nresponsibilities, it needs to carry out its duties with more efficiency \nand compassion, particularly toward the most vulnerable in society. \nThis is especially true when it comes to honoring the sacred trusts of \nresponsibility we have toward our veterans.\n  That is why I cosponsored the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill. I am \nconfident my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will quickly vote on \nthis important measure and move it on to the President's desk.\n  It is also why I will support effective programs where the Federal \nGovernment and States can work together to address our problems \nthroughout this country with regard to sexual assault and domestic \nviolence.\n  Fifth, and finally, we must challenge the conventional wisdom that \nhas existed in this town for decades that the Federal Government's \npower and intrusiveness should always be expanding like some inevitable \nforce of nature. Nowhere is this more important than reforming the \novergrown regulatory thicket that strangles our future.\n\n[[Page S502]]\n\n  According to the President's own Small Business Administration, \nFederal regulations impose an annual burden on our economy of close to \n$2 trillion. That is roughly $15,000 per year per American family. \nFederal regulations are sapping our strength as a Nation. So many of \nthem don't make sense, and others are not authorized by law or the \nConstitution as they must be. And, increasingly, those who promulgate \nand enforce them are showing less and less restraint for the well-being \nof our citizens.\n  The recent Obama administration ANWR assault is the latest example, \nand I will use all of my power to protect the economic growth and \nprosperity of Alaska. That is why I have already filed amendments with \nSenator Murkowski to rescind the Obama administration's ANWR order.\n  I have also filed an amendment that seeks to check another abuse of \nFederal power. When the EPA was initially authorized in 1970, no one \nthought it necessary to arm its employees with weapons. But today, in a \nclassic case of Federal Government power creep, close to 200 armed EPA \nagents are roaming our country. It is a disturbing fact.\n  But it was particularly disturbing for a small group of miners who, \nduring the summer of 2013, prospecting for gold in Chicken, AK, were \nswarmed by armed EPA agents.\n  This wasn't some huge mining conglomerate. This was a small mining \noperation in interior Alaska--sluice boxes with specks of Alaska gold, \nand EPA agents armed with rifles, body armor, a helicopter overhead, \nlooking for Clean Water Act violations. They found none. And apart from \nterrifying the miners, they accomplished nothing.\n  As Alaska's former attorney general and commissioner of Natural \nResources, I have worked with many fine Federal agents, and I \nunderstand the importance of sensible regulations that are based on the \ndirectives of Congress. But problems arise when regulations become \nexcessive--and big problems arise when regulators are given guns to \nenforce these regulations. It is our responsibility to say: Enough; to \nstand up for those we serve, and to roll back Federal power when \nnecessary.\n  I am all for a country with an armed citizenry. As a marine, I have \ntaken an oath to defend and fight for this critical constitutional \nfreedom. However, I am not for a country with an armed bureaucracy.\n  Let's give my State and the rest of the country a little hope that we \nare doing the jobs they sent us here to do. One concrete step in that \ndirection would be to pass this simple amendment I am offering to \ndisarm the EPA. They can certainly do their job without having guns. \nThey have done so in the past, and they should be able to do so in the \nfuture.\n  Finally, I will close with a few words on how I view my mission here. \nI suspect it doesn't differ greatly from what most of us hope to \naccomplish. We all want the best for the people we serve and the States \nwe represent. We want to be strong here at home, which will help us be \nrespected once again by our allies and feared by our adversaries. We \nwant our children to be safe and secure, and we want the same for our \nneighbor.\n  We want to live in a country of unlimited opportunity--a country of \nAlaska-sized dreams. We want a government that holds dear what our \nFounding Fathers knew--that all powers are derived from the consent of \nthe governed. I think most of us can agree that we must unleash our \ncountry's enormous economic potential once again.\n  I believe our government should be helping us, not hindering us from \nachieving these efforts. I believe unlocking our country's vast energy \npotential is one of the best ways to reignite the American dream.\n  Despite challenges, despite big government's creep into our lives, \nand despite armed EPA agents, we continue to live in the greatest \ncountry in the world--in the history of the world. There is no doubt \nabout that. The people who sent us here still have big dreams and big \nhopes. Let's help those dreams grow and their hopes flourish.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate our new \ncolleague from Alaska on his initial address to the Senate and just \ncomment that it could not be more timely, as his State is obviously \nunder assault by this administration. His prescription for the way \nforward, both for Alaska and America, strikes me as entirely \nappropriate for our country, and I congratulate our colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. I wish to thank the majority leader for his kind words \nand all my other colleagues who came to witness a new Senator's maiden \nspeech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also wish to congratulate our new \ncolleague from Alaska. Well said, and welcome. The two Senators from \nAlaska have dominated the start of this new session, and we are glad \nthey have because they are bringing very important legislation and \ndecisions to this body. So I congratulate both the senior and junior \nSenators from Alaska for their efforts, and I look forward to working \ntogether to accomplish what we all want to accomplish--a growing \neconomy and better opportunities for Americans. The Senator from Alaska \nis certainly an important component of that in leading the way to that \ngoal.\n\n\n                          Indiana Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, this morning we received the announcement that after \nnearly 2 years of negotiations, the State of Indiana and the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services have reached a major \nbreakthrough, an agreement that approves Indiana's Healthy Indiana Plan \n2.0 waiver application by allowing it to move forward and be \nimplemented.\n  This agreement is great news for hundreds of thousands of low-income \nHoosiers and a testament to the effectiveness of the current Healthy \nIndiana Plan. Now an expansion of that will be made possible through \nthis waiver. It solidifies Indiana's position at the forefront of \nMedicaid reform and the advancement of consumer-driven health care. \nThose are key words--reforming a current dysfunctional and broken \nMedicaid system, advancing consumer-driven health care, getting \nconsumers into the role of making decisions about their health and not \njust having a government agency say: This is what you can get, and this \nis what you cannot get or this is what makes you healthy. The Healthy \nIndiana Plan incentivizes consumers to determine what is best for their \nown health.\n  The Healthy Indiana Plan was originally crafted under Indiana's \nformer Governor Mitch Daniels. He extended health care coverage to \nlower-income residents who earned too much to qualify for Medicaid but \ntoo little to afford quality health coverage.\n  The guiding principle of the original plan was simple. Individually \nowned and directed health care coverage has a positive effect for \nindividual citizens and the health care system as a whole. We have \nproven that giving people a stake in their own health care decisions \nworks.\n  Governor Daniels put it well in a 2010 Wall Street Journal article, \nstating:\n\n       Americans can make sound, thrifty decisions about their own \n     health. If national policy trusted and encouraged them to do \n     so, our sky-rocketing health care costs would decelerate.\n\n  The original plan had three main objectives: individual control of \nhealth care spending, taxpayer protection based on the stipulation that \nenrollment could not grow faster than available funding, and disease \nprevention by incentivizing preventive care.\n  Then in 2013 our current Governor, Mike Pence, announced plans to \nreform and expand the original Healthy Indiana Plan to cover more low-\nincome Hoosiers. Today, after more than a year and a half of \nnegotiations, the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 has received a green light \nfrom the Obama administration. Coverage will begin on February 1 of \nthis year.\n  I applaud Governor Pence, and I applaud Health and Human Services \nSecretary Sylvia Burwell for working together to move forward to \ncontinue Indiana's successful consumer-driven approach that empowers \nmembers and provides access to quality care.\n  This agreement will expand an existing proven program to more than \n350,000 low-income Hoosiers and allow the State of Indiana to end \ntraditional Medicaid for all nondisabled adults between the ages of 19 \nand 64. They will\n\n[[Page S503]]\n\nbe transitioned into the new plan just approved through this waiver.\n  The answer to our Nation's health care problems is not the broken \nstatus quo of ObamaCare. Indiana has shown, and will continue to show, \nthat reforming traditional Medicaid and offering innovative health care \nsolutions is the right way to empower individual citizens as they seek \naccess to quality health care. Once again, Indiana is leading the way \nnationally by creating State-based innovative ideas for governing.\n  As I serve individuals and Hoosiers here in Washington, I have often \nturned to what I call the Indiana model as a blueprint for a more \nefficient and fiscally responsible Federal Government. I developed a \nlegislative roadmap that I call the Indiana Way--a 10-point plan that \ntakes the model of Indiana, which it has put in place and proven over \nthe last 10 years, and the ideas that I have gathered from Hoosiers as \nI travel about the State--ideas and plans that will make our State and \nNation stronger. Innovative and effective solutions put forward in \nIndiana are what is desperately needed in Washington today to put our \ncountry back on a path to economic growth and opportunity.\n  I congratulate Governor Pence and our State on this terrific news, \nand I look forward to continuing to highlight Hoosier's success stories \nand the Indiana way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge my colleague from \nAlaska, and I appreciate the comments he made this morning in his first \nspeech on the Senate floor and in choosing to clearly focus on the \nopportunities that we have as a State and the challenges we face.\n  I do feel it is unfortunate that, as a State, it seems that our \nlargest battle is against our own federal government. How unfortunate \nis that? I feel very fortunate to have him as a partner here in the \nSenate as we take on these initiatives that have such impact and are of \nsuch import to our State and to how we fit with the other 49 States. We \nhave no shortage of issues to take up when it comes to Federal \noverreach and the impact it has on our Nation and our State and how we \nwill be able to develop our resources. I look forward to working with \nthe Senator in these different areas.\n  I do have to comment, given where we are in the discussions here on \nthe Senate floor about the Keystone XL Pipeline and what benefit that \ninfrastructure will provide to this country by way of a resource that \nwill help us with our energy security and truly helps us with our \nnational security, is it not better to receive oil from our friend and \nour ally Canada than it is from Venezuela? To me these are subjects \nthat should not even merit that level of discussion because it is just \ncommon sense.\n  Yet this President and his administration have taken 6 years to get \nto a point where they may decide on this issue. It has taken 6 years to \ndecide whether it is in our country's best interest to receive oil from \na friend and neighbor rather than from those who would do us ill. And \nthen in a stunning act on Sunday--in one breath--this administration \nhas taken an area that has been identified as the greatest source of \noil potential that we have in this country, outside of Prudhoe Bay, \nwith an estimated mean average of 10.3 billion barrels, which could \nprovide 1 million additional barrels a day that would come down the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline, which my colleague has talked about, and would \nhelp us to provide our Nation with the resource we need and would not \nonly help us from a jobs and energy perspective but also from a \nsecurity perspective.\n  On one hand, the President is saying, nope, I think I would rather \ncontinue to receive oil from Venezuela and Nigeria and all these other \ncountries, and then on Sunday he just decides to put it off limits--the \ngreatest source of oil we have identified in this country to date.\n  Just this morning, the President released his 5-year lease-sale plan, \nwhich is putting off--not deferring but withdrawing--areas in the \nBeaufort and the Chukchi, which will limit our opportunity for the 23 \nbillion barrels of potential in the offshore there.\n  As my colleague has noted, the President has taken off half of the \nnational petroleum reserve--the area we have designated for accessing \nour oil and gas resources. There is a move underfoot right now where \nthis administration, I believe, is going to make the first production \nin NPRA and push it to a place where it will be uneconomic.\n  We have a stunning situation. This administration says they want an \nall of the above energy policy, except maybe in Alaska. We can't do it \nin ANWR. We are going to push you off of NPRA, and offshore we are \ngoing to make it that much more difficult for you. We are going to put \nthe throttle on Alaska's energy opportunities for this country. We are \ngoing to put the throttle on Canada and say: Don't run it through the \nUnited States--not down into the gulf coast where we have these \nrefineries.\n  What is he doing? He is putting our national security at risk with \nactions such as these.\n  So when we talk about Keystone XL, this is more than just a pipe or \npiece of infrastructure crossing the border. We are talking about \nenergy security and national security. Then we have actions from this \nadministration this week that choke off Alaska's energy opportunities. \nThis is why I need my colleague in this fight. Believe me, the Alaska \ndelegation is prepared for it.\n  It just causes us to wonder why. What are they thinking? What about \nenergy security and national security for this country? We have the \npotential to be secure. North American energy independence is not a \nmyth. It is real. But we have to have the will to make it happen--we \ncertainly have the resources. We just need the ability, the opportunity \nto be able to develop them. So get out of the way and let us do that.\n  My colleague from Washington and I have been working all morning \ntrying to see if we can't identify a series of amendments that we might \nbe able to move to this afternoon. We would like to give colleagues a \nsense of how we are going to be advancing through these additional \namendments, get some additional amendments up pending, and really lay \nout that process. I think we have had really constructive conversation \nthis morning, and I am encouraged. Obviously, we have a few more issues \nto work out, but I am hopeful we will be able to announce--hopefully in \nthe short term--a glidepath that will give Members a little more \ncertainty.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. Murkowski. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S503-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          Guantanamo Detainees\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 165, which \nrestores many of the terrorist detainee transfer safeguards that were \nweakened in the fiscal year 2014 National Defense Authorization Act, as \nwell as imposes a 2-year bar on the transfer of detainees to Yemen.\n  This legislation has been authored by Senator Kelly Ayotte, one of \nthe Senate's foremost leaders on national security, and its cosponsors \ninclude the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator John \nMcCain, and the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nSenator Richard Burr, as well as the Senate's preeminent expert on \nmilitary law, Senator Lindsey Graham.\n  I am honored to add my name to the list of Senators who have \ncosponsored this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the effect of this legislation is to preserve the \nability of the\n\n[[Page S504]]\n\nUnited States to detain at our facilities at Guantanamo Bay members of \nAl Qaeda and the Taliban--the organizations responsible for the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  Why is keeping Guantanamo open so important?\n  Simply put, Guantanamo affords our military a safe and secure \nlocation to detain those individuals held under the law of war or for \nviolations of the law of war.\n  If an enemy combatant is captured during an armed conflict, that \nindividual can be held under the law of war. It is a generally accepted \nlegal principle, affirmed repeatedly by the Supreme Court, that enemy \ncombatants can be held at least until a conflict is concluded.\n  If an individual is held for a violation of the laws of war, that \nmeans they are being detained until they can be prosecuted for a war \ncrime they are alleged to have committed.\n  The detainee population of Guantanamo contains battle-hardened \nterrorists. Indeed, the threat they pose is amply demonstrated since 29 \npercent of Guantanamo detainees released so far are confirmed or \nsuspected of rejoining the fight against the United States.\n  Now, Mr. President, Cliff Sloan, who was the State Department's envoy \nfor closing Guantanamo Bay, recently wrote in a New York Times \neditorial that this nearly 30 percent recidivism rate was ``deeply \nflawed.'' It appears Mr. Sloan only wants the Congress and the American \npeople to consider the confirmed rate rather than the combined \nconfirmed and suspected recidivism rate.\n  Mr. President, if Congress and the American people are truly to \nunderstand the risks inherent in this administration's insistence on \nreleasing Guantanamo Bay detainees, we must consider this combined \nnumber. How can that be deeply flawed?\n  Mr. Sloan goes on to state that the level of recidivism is much lower \nsince 2009. However, this lower rate, if accurate, undoubtedly does not \ninclude the five senior Taliban leaders who were illegally released to \nQatar and whose 1-year travel ban is about to expire. Unless the Qatari \nGovernment prevents it, soon these terrorists will be free to go \nwherever they wish.\n  I am also concerned that this new number might not fully incorporate \nthe activities and future actions of those detainees who have been \ntransferred in recent months. One of the major advantages of locating \nour detention operations at Guantanamo Bay is that it is well-settled \nlaw that the United States can hold individuals held under the law of \nwar or for violations of the law of war at our facilities there.\n  Now, I personally believe current Supreme Court precedent would \nenable us to hold both law of war and violations of law of war \ndetainees in the United States. However, if these detainees are moved \ninto the United States, every attorney representing detainees would \nrush to federal court and file new lawsuits seeking their clients' \nrelease. Indeed, there exists a very real possibility that a court \nmight release a detainee into the United States, especially in light of \nthe Obama administration's unwillingness, in some cases, to defend \nagainst detainees' habeas petitions to the fullest extent. As such, the \nrisks of transferring these detainees into the United States are great.\n  Guantanamo Bay also affords us a much better environment to bring and \nhold newly apprehended terrorists. Inside the United States, the \nSupreme Court has mandated that criminal suspects be read their \nrights--including their right to remain silent and right to a lawyer--\nsubject to only a narrow public safety exception. Such limits on \ninterrogations severely hinder our ability to gather information from \ncaptured terrorists, who have time and again proven to be the source of \nvital intelligence.\n  Consider, for example, how officials were only able to interrogate \nthe Boston Marathon bomber for just 16 hours before he was read his \nrights and immediately stopped cooperating. As one of the longest \nserving members ever of the Intelligence Committee, I can assure you \nthat it takes far longer to gather all of the important information we \ncan from most terrorists.\n  Moving detainees into the United States also presents serious \ndomestic security concerns. A number of terrorist groups such as Al \nQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have become quite adept at jailbreaks. \nBringing a concentration of terrorist detainees into the United States \ntherefore could create a particularly appealing target in the homeland \nfor jihadist radicals, whereas at Guantanamo Bay they are essentially \nisolated in a facility well secured by the U.S. military.\n  Clearly there are ample and compelling legal and national security \nreasons to maintain our detention operations at Guantanamo Bay. That is \nwhy Senator Ayotte's legislation is so important. It ensures we will \ncontinue to use this vital facility by restoring the transfer \nrestrictions that have enabled us to keep these individuals in such a \nsecure location.\n  A little over a year ago, there was a profound change in the laws \ngoverning the transfer of Guantanamo detainees overseas. Before fiscal \nyear 2014 legislation, the Congress had repeatedly enacted provisions \nin the annual Defense Authorization Act which all but prevented the \ntransfer of Guantanamo detainees.\n  Specifically, these previous laws required the Secretary of Defense \nto certify in writing, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State \nand in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, that \ncertain criteria had been met before the transfer of a detainee abroad \ncould occur--in particular, that the foreign entity receiving a \ndetainee has ``taken or agreed to take effective actions to ensure that \nthe individual cannot take action to threaten the United States'' as \nwell as ``taken or agreed to take such actions as the Secretary of \nDefense determines are necessary to ensure the individual cannot engage \nor reengage in any terrorist activity.''\n  Despite this, with few exceptions, the law prohibited the transfer of \ndetainees to countries to which detainees had previously been \ntransferred and subsequently reengaged in terrorism. Yet the law did \nafford the Secretary of Defense a national security waiver that negated \nthe requirements if other standards were met.\n  So the bottom line here is that under the old law it was very \ndifficult--as it should be--to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees \noverseas.\n  But the Obama administration, bent on an ideological crusade to empty \nGuantanamo no matter the cost, successfully lobbied to relax these \nrestrictions in the Fiscal Year 2014 Defense Authorization Act. The \nnewly weakened provisions permitted the transfer of detainees overseas \nas long as the Secretary of Defense determined that ``the individual is \nno longer a threat to the national security of the United States.'' \nThis is, of course, a lesser standard than requiring a certification \nthat the individual cannot threaten the United States or reengage in \nterrorist activity.\n  In addition, under the Fiscal Year 2014 law, the Secretary could even \nauthorize the transfer of a detainee as long as the Secretary \ndetermined the transfer was in the interest of the United States and \naction had been or was to be taken which will substantially mitigate \nthe chance of recidivism.\n  While the statute does require the Secretary of Defense to take into \nconsideration a number of factors before making this decision, the \nreality of the new regime is that the Secretary has far more ability to \ntransfer detainees overseas.\n  The Obama administration quickly seized on this new power. In the \npast year the number of Guantanamo Bay detainees has been decreased \nfrom 155 to 122. And despite this new transfer authority, the Obama \nadministration had the audacity to violate even the relaxed transfer \nrestrictions less than 6 months after the law's enactment--specifically \nby transferring five senior Taliban commanders to Qatar without \nproviding Congress 30 days of notification. Since then, the \nadministration, after a brief lull, has continued and even increased \nthe pace of detainees being transferred overseas.\n  These deeply troubling moves by the Obama administration demonstrate \nthe vital importance of Senator Ayotte's bill. It restores the previous \ntransfer restrictions. Specifically, it requires the Secretary of \nDefense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in \nconsultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to certify \nthat certain safeguards are in place and that threat of recidivism is \nvery small before a transfer can be undertaken.\n  Furthermore, this legislation also places a 2-year ban on the \ntransfer of detainees to Yemen. This restriction is especially \nimportant because approximately half of the remaining detainees at \nGuantanamo are from Yemen.\n\n[[Page S505]]\n\n  Yemen is one of our most critical partners in the fight against \nterror, and we cooperate closely with the Yemeni Government in the \nfight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. But because of the \npresence of this menacing group within Yemen's borders, the security \nsituation there is dire, and it seems to be deteriorating as we speak.\n  Just last week the Houthi, a Shia rebel group, seized control of \nYemen's Presidential palace, forcing the resignation of the President, \nPrime Minister, and Cabinet. In December of 2013 AQAP launched a well-\ncoordinated assault on the Yemeni Ministry of Defense that left 52 \ndead, not to mention a number of jailbreaks from the Yemeni \ncorrectional facilities in which, according to press reports, numerous \nmembers of AQAP were freed.\n  The unvarnished truth is that it will take many years and much effort \nto bring about the security improvements in Yemen needed before we can \nbe confident that detainees returned there will not return to the \nbattlefield. That is why this section of Senator Ayotte's legislation \nis so important.\n  Our policies must be based on defeating the real threats facing our \nNation, not pacifying the ideological passions of an extreme few, which \nis why I was so disappointed by another recent New York Times editorial \nabout this legislation. The Times called Senator Ayotte \n``opportunistic,'' if you can believe that, for citing the very real \nthreat of a Paris-style attack on the homeland and termed her \ndescription of Yemen as ``the wild, wild West,'' as ``odd.'' I cannot \nimagine a better way to describe the disturbing security situation in \nYemen. And based on years of evidence, one can only conclude Senator \nAyotte is right. Frankly, I believe the New York Times owes Senator \nAyotte an apology, and I hope they will be big enough to do that.\n  We need this legislation because it restores proper protections from \nthe threats posed by released detainees. I hope the rest of my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would like to make a statement about the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. This first came before this body some 4 years \nago. I said at the time that the pipeline was a good idea. Why? Because \nit would create construction jobs. It would reduce America's reliance \non Middle Eastern oil for our energy. I said also that the pipeline \nmust be built right. What does that mean? It means two things. First, \nKeystone must be built to the highest of safety standards. That only \nmakes sense. And we must have respect for private property rights when \nthat pipeline is built.\n  Just like everything else in Washington, the Keystone was eventually \nmade into a political football, and it has dragged on for 4 years. It \nhas taken on a life of its own. And to be straight and level with you, \nfolks on both sides of the aisle have turned it into something much \nbigger than it really is.\n  At the start of the 114th Congress, I was hopeful that there would be \nenough momentum behind the pipeline to finally get it done and begin \nconstruction. But since the swearing-in ceremony 3 weeks ago, my faith \nin our ability to have a deliberative debate has been shaken. Last \nweek's political stunts were simply unacceptable. We can't tell the \nAmerican people we are going to responsibly govern when in fact we \nstopped Senators from even speaking on the floor about amendments they \nhave offered.\n\n  The majority decried these kinds of practices last Congress. Many of \nus agreed. But to start with these kinds of actions in the new Congress \nis discouraging, to say the least. I hope this week we can have an open \ndebate, make this bill better, pick up a few more votes, and finally \napprove the Keystone Pipeline for building.\n  Ten days ago an oil pipeline burst in eastern Indiana. It spilled \nabout 40,000 gallons of oil into and around the Yellowstone River. Six \nthousand residents in Dawson County, MT, had their water cut off for 5 \ndays after oil got into the local water treatment plant. Cleanup crews \nare slowly making progress removing oil from an ice-covered river.\n  This oilspill was unacceptable. What is worse, it was completely \npreventible. The pipeline that burst last week was nearly 60 years old. \nIt had not been inspected in at least 2 years. Pipelines, just like \nroads and bridges and railroads, get old and they wear out. If we want \npipelines to operate properly, they need to be regularly inspected and \nupgraded.\n  In December, during the lameduck, Congress plussed up the budget for \nPHMSA--the agency that does pipeline inspections--giving PHMSA the \nresources to hire more than 100 pipeline safety inspectors. It is clear \nwe need to get these folks hired, trained, and working on the ground. \nWe also need to look at how PHMSA spends those dollars and whether \nresources are adequate to inspect the Nation's 2.6 million miles of \npipeline.\n  Despite the criticisms, pipelines are still the safest way to \ntransport oil. We have seen the headlines--we have all seen them--in \nrecent years of oil trains exploding, trucks running off the road that \ncarry oil.\n  In 2013, one explosion in Canada leveled an entire town. It killed 47 \npeople. Months later, another oil train traveling in North Dakota burst \ninto flames and caused an entire town to evacuate.\n  In northwestern Montana, the resort town of Whitefish is situated a \nfew miles west of Glacier National Park. The town is home to a world-\nclass ski hill and one of the world's most pristine lakes. Every day \noil tank cars run past Whitefish Lake carrying thousands of gallons of \noil. The environmental impact of an explosion or spill on that railroad \nwould devastate that lake, and it would devastate that region, its \nwater supply, and have serious impacts on the State's economy.\n  In fact, in 1989, a freight train derailed as it was circling \nWhitefish Lake and four cars slid into the water and leaked out some \nfuel. Twenty-three years later--just 2 years ago--they finally finished \nthe cleanup. Imagine if those cars were carrying crude as they do \ntoday.\n  Pipelines are the fastest way to transport oil. Until this body can \nagree that climate change is real and start making smart investments in \nalternative energy sources, our economy still needs traditional ways.\n  I have said many times I still power my farm equipment with diesel \nfuel. I don't have any options. So it is clear to me we need a way to \ntransport oil, and Keystone is that way. And, yes, in Montana, it will \ncreate jobs. According to the State Department's analysis, construction \nof the pipeline would create 3,700 jobs. Over $700 million worth of \nconstruction materials and support costs would come to eastern Montana. \nThat is not to mention the tax base that would be increased. But safety \nmust come first. We need the best materials; we need more inspections. \nWe simply cannot afford another spill.\n  Finally, I want to talk about eminent domain. Everyone in this body \nshould agree that a foreign corporation should not be allowed to seize \nprivate property here in America. That is a fact. Unfortunately, we \ncouldn't agree on that last Thursday. There was an amendment offered by \nSenator Menendez stating that TransCanada can only acquire land from \nwilling sellers. But there are Members of the U.S. Senate who put \nprofits of a foreign corporation above the constitutional rights of \nAmerican citizens. If someone had told me in January of 2007, when I \nwas first sworn in, that my colleagues would one day vote against such \nan amendment, I simply would not have believed it, but that is exactly \nwhat happened. I am disappointed that amendment failed, but I do \nbelieve we can improve upon this bill by including commonsense \nreporting requirements that would ensure this pipeline is built in a \ntransparent way.\n  Senator Cardin has an amendment to do just that, and I for one \nsupport it. Private property rights should not be a partisan issue, and \nI would hope my colleagues would join me in supporting this measure. \nLet's not race to cloture. Let's not race to trample private property \nrights of Americans. Let's get this bill passed, and let's do it in the \nright way.\n  This pipeline is not a long-term solution for our energy problems, \nbut it is one piece of the puzzle. We must make meaningful investments \nin research and development so we can make carbon-neutral energy \nsources more accessible and affordable. Until we do that,\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\nthe reality is that this economy still runs on oil.\n  This pipeline helps get us to the next step. I still believe in this \npipeline. I believe Keystone can boost our energy independence and will \ncreate jobs in the short term and over the long haul, but we need to \ndebate this bill. We need a chance to make it better, to make the \npipelines safer, and send a message to the American people we are \nserious about investing in our long-term energy future. If we don't do \nthat, we won't build the Keystone.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the Keystone \nXL Pipeline. At the outset this Senator wants to say the conclusion of \nthis Senator is that this is much more about politics than it is about \nenergy policy, than it is about the economy of this country, \nparticularly so since the price of oil has gone from something in \nexcess of $100 a barrel down to the range of $46 a barrel.\n  Likewise, the fact that the United States is now the No. 1 producer \nof oil in the world--in large part because of our brethren and sistren \nin the Senate who represent those Northern Plains States as well as the \nSouthwestern States where they are producing all of this newly found \noil from the shale rock which has strengthened the economic position of \nour country. Think about it, No. 1 producer in the world. That is us. \nAs a result, we do not have to be nearly as dependent on the Middle \nEast, from where we used to get at least 50, 60 percent of our oil or \nfrom other areas such as Nigeria or Venezuela.\n  I have just mentioned three very unstable parts of the world. Yet \nthat is the position we have been in, but that has changed. It is now \nthe 21st century. As a result of new technologies, we are the No. 1 \nproducer of oil in the world. So back when we were not, when we were \nstill dependent on foreign oil, there was a discovery in Canada--\nWestern Canada--the ability to extract oil from the heavy tar in these \ntar sands.\n  The Canadians wanted an outlet for that. It made it much more \nappealing to us, to the United States back then, when oil was over $100 \na barrel and we were still importing a lot of it from abroad. But \ninterestingly, the Canadians wanted and suggested a pipeline that would \ncome right through the middle of the United States, from the north in \nCanada, through the middle of the United States, down to the gulf \ncoast, to the refineries.\n  Why didn't they go west from the western States of Canada to the \nPacific to have an outlet? They had to cross the Rocky Mountains. Of \ncourse that was going to be expensive. It was also going to roil up a \nbunch of the Canadian environmentalists. So the idea of the Keystone XL \nwas born.\n  What does XL stand for? Extra large. Well, if it was extra large, it \nimplies there is an existing pipeline. Indeed there is. I want to show \nit to you. This orange line is an existing pipeline coming from \nAlberta, northeast of Calgary, across Saskatchewan into Manitoba, and \nthen it comes down through North Dakota, South Dakota, eastern \nNebraska, and there it forks right at the Kansas line. One line goes \neast all the way into Illinois, and the other line goes south through \nKansas into Oklahoma.\n  I said at the outset this is much more about politics as opposed to \nenergy policy, as well as economics because this all heated up--XL, \nextra large--during the last Presidential election. Of course those who \nraise this issue were trying to say: Unless you embrace this XL you are \nagainst the United States being energy independent.\n  Well, an interesting thing happened along the way. From Cushing, OK, \nthere was no line directly going to the gulf coast, where the \nrefineries are in Houston and Port Arthur. The President approved that. \nThat has been constructed. I am advised that has just opened in the \nlast few days--so the existing line, all the way from Alberta, Canada, \nthrough the heartland of America, all the way to the gulf coast. That \nis that.\n  But XL, extra large, to carry more oil, was proposed. The route that \nis now proposed is here. That looks like it makes sense because it cuts \noff the dogleg and does a straight line. But originally it had come \nmuch further to the west, right over the environmentally sensitive \nlands of the aquifer in central Nebraska where so much of the water \nresources for the entire Midwestern United States come from.\n  This Senator said, back in the Presidential election of 2012: If you \nreally want a bigger pipeline and you want to avoid all of the \ncontroversy over the environment, which this proposed route certainly \nhas since it is extra large, why do you not just run it along the \nexisting pipeline? The right of way is already there. Indeed, it is now \ncomplete all the way to the gulf coast. Why do you not run it just \nright along and you would have a lot less opposition?\n  But no. This Senator comes back to his main point: This is all about \npolitics. It is all about trying to make some look as though they are \nanti-energy and others look as though they are pro-energy. But it is \nwhat it is. It is 2 years later, and here we are.\n  The proposal is to still come across parts of Montana, South Dakota, \nfurther east in Nebraska, and join with the existing pipeline. So what \nis confronting a Senator such as this who certainly wants us to be \nenergy independent? Well, then, if we are going to have additional oil \nsupplies as a backup, maybe that would be a good consideration. So \nlet's make sure this new source of foreign oil--that we have a chance \nto use it in this country, since it is going to come right down the \nmiddle of America.\n  No. No. No can do. This foreign oil, for those who are proposing what \nwe are about to vote on, is going right down the gullet of America, \nright down the middle of America to the gulf coast, and it is going to \nbe exported to foreign countries. So a little old country boy such as I \nwonders: Now, wait. Let me get this straight. You want foreign oil to \nbuild a big oil pipeline to run right through the middle of America as \na conduit to send right out to other foreign countries and not be \nutilized in this country?\n  Sadly, the answer to that is yes. That is what we are confronting. We \nhad an amendment that Canada could not export it. We could use it here \nfor American purposes. But sadly that amendment was defeated by the \npurists who want it to be exactly as they want it to be, a tool of \nforeign oil to send through the middle of America in a conduit to other \nforeign nations.\n  This Senator does not think that is in the interests of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I come first of all in celebration, in \ncelebration that the Senate is finally working again. In just 27 days \nwe have seen more amendments voted on on the floor of the Senate than \nunder the Democratic majority in the entire year of 2014. We once again \nhave a Senate where Republicans and Democrats can offer their \namendments, can debate their amendments, and can vote them up or down.\n  One of the resounding consequences of the election in November is the \nAmerican people were tired of the Democratic do-nothing Senate. We have \na Senate that has shown up to work.\n  The bill we are voting on, the underlying bill, is an example of what \nthe priorities should be in the Senate. The Keystone Pipeline bill \nought to be a no-brainer. It ought to be an example of bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  Indeed, one of the very first things I did 2 years ago when I was \nnewly elected to this body was join with 10 Senators, 5 Democrats and 5 \nRepublicans, in sending a bipartisan letter to the President saying \napprove the Keystone Pipeline now.\n  Why? No. 1, it will produce jobs, tens of thousands of high-paying \njobs. No. 2, it will increase tax revenue. It will increase revenue for \nthe Federal Government, for State and local governments. That revenue \ncan be used to pay down our national debt to provide for our vital \nneeds.\n  No. 3, it will enhance our national security by allowing us to move \ntoward North American energy independence\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\nrather than being dependent on foreign nations for oil, nations whose \ninterests are very different and sometimes hostile to our own.\n  No. 4, building the Keystone Pipeline is unequivocally better for the \nenvironment.\n  Indeed, I have joked: If you are a bearded, tattooed, Birkenstock-\nwearing, tree-hugging, Green Peace activist, you should love the \nKeystone Pipeline, because if the pipeline is not built, it means we \nwill continue to bring our oil in on overseas tankers and on rail, both \nof which are far more dangerous for the environment than a pipeline, \nboth of which we know to a certainty that as long as there are tankers \non the oceans there will be spills, as long as there is rail there will \nbe spills.\n  Moreover, if the pipeline is not built north-south, it is not as \nthough our friends the Canadians are simply going to leave the oil \nwhere it is, they are going to build the pipeline east-west, and \ninstead of allowing it to be refined in America where it produces high-\npaying jobs here up and down the gulf coast, the alternative is it \nwould be refined in Asia and China in far dirtier refineries that \npollute the environment even more.\n  So this ought to be a no-brainer. This ought to be an example of \nwhere Republicans and Democrats come together in agreement. But, sadly, \nit is not, and it is not because the modern Democratic Party has made a \ndecision between two traditionally favored children of the Democratic \nParty. The modern Democratic Party has made a decision that they care \nmore about the campaign donations from California environmentalist \nbillionaires than they do about the jobs for union members.\n  I suggest that the 100 Senators who are elected to the Senate ought \nto be fighting for the hard-working men and women. We ought to be \nfighting for the union members, for all of the men and women who want \ngood, decent-paying jobs, who want to provide for their kids, and who \nare tired of the stagnation of the Obama economy.\n  Only last week we heard the President give his State of the Union \nAddress, where he talked about how swimmingly the economy is going.\n  Well, you know, he was right. If you happen to be one of those \nCalifornia environmentalist billionaires, if you happen to be in the \ntop 1 percent--the millionaires and billionaires whom the President \ndemagogues--then you have indeed become richer under President Obama.\n  Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our economy than in \nany year since 1928. Those who walk the corridors of power in the Obama \nadministration have gotten fat and happy.\n  Yet for working men and women, union members, their lives have gotten \nharder and harder and harder. We have, today, the lowest labor-force \nparticipation since 1978. Median income in this country has stagnated \nfor two decades.\n  Yet what is the Democratic Party doing? Marshalling every vote it can \nto vote against union members, to vote against hard-working men and \nwomen, to stand with the big dollars coming out of California. What a \nsad, sad statement of priorities that is.\n  So let me commend majority leader Mitch McConnell for bringing up an \nopen process, allowing Democrats amendments. I would be happy to vote \non Democratic amendments all day long and Republican amendments on the \nmerit. Let me commend the majority as well for focusing on the issues \nthat matter to the American people--namely, bringing back jobs and \neconomic growth and opportunity.\n  Now, in the course of this open amendment proceeding, I have \nsubmitted three different amendments. One would get rid of the \nlongstanding anachronistic ban on exporting crude oil that was put in \nplace in the 1970s. It makes no sense in the current environment and is \nhurting jobs and economic growth.\n  A second would obviate the need for having this fight every time a \ncross-border pipeline was built. It would streamline the process for \nbuilding pipelines so we could move ahead with economic growth.\n  Both of those amendments, I believe, are sound policy. I think they \nare supported by the interests of Americans across this country.\n  After long conversations with my friends and colleagues, Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Hoeven, we have agreed that we are going to have \ncommittee hearings in the coming months focusing on both of those \nissues, laying out the facts and the data to make clear that these are \nunambiguously good--whether you are a Republican or a Democrat or an \nIndependent or a Libertarian--if you want jobs and economic growth. \nThese reforms are sound reforms to bring back jobs, economic growth, \nand opportunity.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 15\n\n  The third amendment I have submitted, which I am hopeful we will vote \non either today or tomorrow, is an amendment to expedite exports of \nliquid natural gas. That is what I wish to speak about for just a few \nminutes.\n  The amendment that I am presenting will expedite LNG exports to World \nTrade Organization members, removing unnecessary delays that have been \ncaused by the arbitrary Department of Energy approval process.\n  Currently, countries under free-trade agreements with the United \nStates enjoy a streamlined, expedited approval process to import our \nLNG. For projects to FTA countries, current law deems those ``in the \npublic interest'' and they get a permit ``without modification or \ndelay.''\n  Yet those without such an agreement must, instead, submit to an \narduous case-by-case nonstandardized process that ends up discouraging \nLNG trade and related investments. It ends up killing jobs.\n  For projects to non-FTA countries, right now there are no time limits \nand no standardized process by which the Department of Energy \ndetermines whether or not the project is ``in the public interest'' for \nreceiving a permit. The amendment I have offered would open the doors \nof trade to more than 160 countries in the World Trade Organization to \nreceive this same expedited treatment that we currently have in place \nfor free-trade countries.\n  This is particularly important not only for economic development, not \nonly for jobs, not only for growth but also for the enormous \ngeopolitical advantages that it will present to the United States.\n  In the past several years we have seen the consequences of the Obama-\nClinton foreign policy. We have seen the United States receding from \nleadership in the world, and we have seen other nations--foreign \nnations--step into that void and use energy as a weapon, as a cudgel--\nwhether it is Venezuela or Iran or Russia.\n  Allowing expedited LNG exports strengthens our hands against those \nwho would be enemies of America, and it strengthens the hands of our \nfriends and allies. Here at home, according to a 2013 study, in the \nUnited States LNG exports could create up to 450,000 new jobs by 2035.\n  So we will see, when Republicans and Democrats vote on this \namendment, where each Senator stands on whether we should allow the \nprivate sector to create up to 450,000 new jobs. Every Democrat who \nvotes no can expect to go back to his or her State and face \nconstituents--face the union members who would like to get some of \nthose 450,000 new jobs--and explain why he or she voted against that \nhard-working man or woman having a job.\n  Over the same time, GDP growth could generate anywhere from an \nadditional $15.6 billion up to $73.6 billion. By 2035 the net gain in \nmanufacturing jobs could mean up to 76,000 new jobs. A lot of the \nMembers of this body like to talk about manufacturing, like to talk \nabout the steel industry, the car industry. It used to be that the \nbackbone of the American middle class was the blue-collar jobs where \nyou could work with dignity, where you could provide for your family, \nand where you could provide for your kids.\n  Every Senator who votes no to LNG exports because they want to \ncontinue receiving money from the California billionaires had better be \nprepared to return home to their States, look into the eyes of the \nmanufacturing workers, and explain why he or she voted against 76,000 \nnew manufacturing jobs.\n  Geopolitically, let's take Ukraine. All of us sat not long ago in the \nHouse of Representatives for a joint session when the President of \nUkraine addressed us both. We stood over and over--standing, quite \nliterally, alongside Ukraine. If we want action to match those words, \nthen every Senator should vote yes on this amendment.\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\n  Ukraine currently relies on natural gas for 40 percent of its energy \nneeds. More than 60 percent of the natural gas that Ukraine gets and \ndepends on comes from Russia, and Russia uses that natural gas as a \nclub to extract economic blackmail on Ukraine.\n  Last spring I traveled to Ukraine, Poland, and Estonia. As I visited \nwith leaders throughout Europe, these friends of ours said over and \nover: Help us free ourselves from energy blackmail from Russia.\n  As of today, the Department of Energy has approved nine export \npermits to non-free-trade agreement countries within the past 2 years. \nTwenty-eight applications are currently pending stacked up on the desk, \ngoing nowhere.\n  The increased energy production from allowing us to export the \nresources we have to friends and allies who want and need it would spur \ninvestment and create thousands of jobs for America. It would be a boon \nto countries such as Ukraine. It would be a boon to Europe, and it \nwould be a boon to the Baltics, which are watching what is happening in \nUkraine and wondering: Are we next? It would be a boon to friends of \nours, such as Germany, who likewise depend on Russia for significant \nenergy needs.\n  Today this body faces a pivotal question. Will we lead the world into \na new generation of American prosperity and energy prosperity led by \nthe American energy renaissance we are experiencing or will we instead \nshut off our borders, erect walls, and allow our friends and allies to \nbe dependent on tyrants such as Putin or Maduro.\n  We need to come together in a bipartisan manner to say we support \njobs, we support economic growth, and we support standing united \nalongside our friends and allies in defense of freedom.\n  I urge my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                 Justice For Victims of Trafficking Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we all know, there is a big game this \nweekend, and I wouldn't be surprised if our friends from Washington and \nfrom the New England area find themselves a little bit distracted \nbeyond the ``snowpocalypse,'' I guess they call it, all the big \nsnowstorms.\n  In anticipation of the big game, I am told that 100 million Americans \nwill actually tune in to the Super Bowl this weekend. And here is a \nshocking statistic. Some 1.25 billion chicken wings will be consumed--\n1.25 billion chicken wings--and, of course, millions of pizzas, \ncelebrating what has, of course, become in many ways an unofficial \nAmerican holiday. I am still stuck on the 1.25 billion chicken wings.\n  Well, while many of us will tune in to cheer our favorite team in the \nSuper Bowl, unfortunately--and what I am on the floor to talk about--\nthere is the dark underbelly of events such as the Super Bowl that \ndon't get the attention they really deserve. Most of us would, perhaps, \nprefer to avert our gaze or think about other, more pleasant, positive \nthings, but what I want to talk about briefly is the practice of human \ntrafficking.\n  When many people hear about human trafficking, they think about \nsomething that doesn't happen in America; it happens somewhere else. \nThey might envision brothels in foreign cities or girls being smuggled \nacross other borders. But the sad reality is human trafficking is a \nproblem all across the United States and at all times of the year. But \nit is especially a problem surrounding big, public events such as the \nSuper Bowl.\n  Yes, human trafficking is happening in our own backyard, and more \nthan 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. \ncitizens. They are not some person who has been brought to the United \nStates from some foreign country. Eighty percent are U.S. citizens.\n  As the father of two daughters, one of the most disturbing facts is \nthat the average age of a child who first becomes a victim of sex \ntrafficking is 13 years old.\n  As I said, recent years have shown an uptick in human trafficking \nsurrounding large events such as the Super Bowl. For example, in Dallas \na few years ago, there was a 300-percent increase in sex-for-sale \nInternet ads. That was in 2011, of course. In 2012, in Indianapolis, \npolice made 68 commercial sex arrests and recovered two human \ntrafficking victims.\n  One of the worst problems associated with human trafficking is that \nmany of the victims don't actually consider themselves victims yet \nbecause they are so young and so vulnerable that they don't actually \nrealize they are being used and their future is literally being \ndestroyed.\n  In 2013, in New Orleans, police made 85 arrests for suspected human \ntrafficking. Of course, this year the Super Bowl is in Phoenix, and no \ndoubt law enforcement in Phoenix will have a vigilant eye in an effort \nto identify and crack down on the perpetrators. But the truth is most \nof this is happening right under our nose and we don't even see it.\n\n  We know the police are doing the best they can, but it won't be \nenough--it won't be enough--to stop each one of these crimes. Indeed, \nstaggering numbers of these crimes will continue to be committed. The \nSuper Bowl will be done and gone next Sunday, but after the confetti is \ncleared from the field and the fans catch their flights home, the work \nto end this heinous crime known as human trafficking will continue.\n  As a matter of fact, January is National Slavery and Human \nTrafficking Prevention Month. Human trafficking is a form of human \nslavery. We thought that was eliminated from our history following the \nterrible Civil War that took the lives of 600,000 Americans. If you \nextrapolate the Civil War to today, in terms of population, that would \nbe 3 million Americans who gave their lives. We had the Civil War in \nlarge part because of the bane and the scourge of slavery, but the \ntruth is human slavery still exists in the form of sex trafficking.\n  Awareness is important. As we are driving around our city streets--\nparticularly people driving around in Phoenix this weekend--we may \nactually see some underage girls or others who are actually victims of \nthis crime, and so we need to be vigilant. We need to do what we can to \nbe the eyes and ears of law enforcement and to call in suspicious \ncircumstances. We simply need to do everything we can to stop human \ntrafficking by all means necessary.\n  This is something that strikes close to home, in Texas, where I come \nfrom. Sadly, Texas, in part because of our proximity to the U.S.-\nMexican border, sees more human trafficking than many other States. One \nout of 10 tips received by the National Human Trafficking Resource \nCenter in 2013 involved incidents occurring in Texas--1 out of every 10 \ntips. And Texas reported more than 1,000 suspected human trafficking \nincidents in 2007.\n  So this is a big challenge and a big problem, and it is not going \naway. According to law enforcement authorities, sex trafficking is the \nfastest growing business of organized crime and the third largest \ncriminal enterprise in the world.\n  And here is something I really don't understand. When we talk about \nthe criminal organizations--the transnational criminal organizations \nthat smuggle people across the border--most recently in the context of \nthese unaccompanied minor children who came from Central America whose \nparents paid human smugglers--the cartels, really--let's say $5,000 \napiece, these parents have no knowledge of what will happen to their \nchildren once they turn them over to these cartel members. Indeed, \nthese criminal organizations are engaged in the money business, \nanything that will make a buck. They will traffic in children, they \nwill smuggle immigrants, they will smuggle drugs.\n  With regard to these same criminal organizations, somehow, some way, \nwe tend to compartmentalize our brains and say: Well, sex trafficking \nis different from illegal immigration and smuggling. But it is not. It \nhas the same corridors funded by the same people and operated by the \nsame transnational criminal organizations.\n  Now, back to sex trafficking after that parenthetical comment. This \nis one of those bipartisan subjects where there has been a lot of good \nwork by Members on both sides of the aisle, and one of the things we \nhave needed the most is to have the help of many nongovernmental \norganizations--these are faith-based organizations, these are\n\n[[Page S509]]\n\nlocal community organizations--that are designed to help victims of \nhuman trafficking escape, with the aid of law enforcement, and then \nsomehow helping victims to rebuild their lives.\n  Earlier this month, I partnered with the Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden, Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, and Senator Kirk of Illinois \nto introduce a bill we call the Justice For Victims of Trafficking Act \nof 2015. I have talked to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, and have urged him to give this bill an early markup \nin the Judiciary Committee so it will be eligible to come to the floor \nas soon as we can get it here, because I am going to be asking the \nmajority leader to schedule floor action so we can have a debate and a \nvote on this important legislation.\n  What does the legislation do? It provides additional funds for human \ntrafficking support victims, with tens of millions of dollars of \nadditional funds each year, and it would be financed entirely by \ncriminal fines and fees. This wouldn't be tax dollars, this would be \ntaking basically the fines and the fees paid by people who plead or are \nconvicted of other crimes and putting those funds into a crime victims \nfund that could be used to help these organizations--these human-\ntrafficking victims support programs.\n  Again, this legislation would be financed entirely by fines on \npredators convicted of child pornography, human trafficking, child \nexploitation, and commercial human smuggling.\n  This legislation would also assure that victims would have greater \naccess to restitution by requiring the Department of Justice to use \ncriminally forfeited assets to compensate them through a process known \nas victim restoration.\n  It is no secret the victims of this terrible crime end up with a lot \nof psychological baggage and other challenges. We need to help them get \non with their lives and to address the terrible things they have \nexperienced.\n  This legislation would also enhance law enforcement tools to target \nboth sophisticated criminal networks that engage in human trafficking \nand the predators who increase demand for sex slavery by purchasing \ninnocent children.\n  This bill now has 20 bipartisan cosponsors. So don't believe the \ncynics who say that nothing happens up here on a bipartisan basis. It \nis just not true. There are some things--and this is one of them, and \nperhaps one of the most important things--that happen on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  The good news is the House of Representatives is voting on companion \nlegislation today, so this legislation should be ready for Senate \naction, I hope, soon. I hope we can work with our House colleagues and \nget it to the President as soon as we possibly can.\n  The bottom line is we need to take a stand against this modern-day \nslavery and lift up the victims of these crimes whoever and wherever \nthey may be. Again, this is obviously not a political issue. This is \nsomething we have the power to address and we must take action to \ncombat this human trafficking all around the world, and the place to \nstart is in our own back yard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first commend my colleague from \nTexas. We sit on opposite sides of the aisle, but there are many things \nthat bring us together, and I certainly support what he has said about \nthe impact of human trafficking.\n  In a hearing before the subcommittee on the Constitution, which he \nnow chairs, during this session of Congress, we brought in law \nenforcement victims and talked about some of the outrageous things \nwhich are occurring in exploiting young people, particularly young \nwomen. One of the points which my colleague has made, and I have \nlistened carefully, is that we should consider these human trafficking \nvictims as victims.\n  Many times, sadly in the past, they have been prosecuted as if they \nwere complicit, and many times they are children. They have no \nknowledge of their rights or obligations and are being exploited and, \nas a consequence, they are very reluctant to cooperate with law \nenforcement if they feel they too might end up in jail, having been \nvictimized twice in the process.\n  I thank him for his leadership and I look forward to looking closely \nat his legislation and I hope we can work closely together on that.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a pending amendment \nwhich troubles me. I don't know if there will be much time for debate \nshould we actually consider this amendment, and I want to make my \nfeelings a matter of public record.\n  This is amendment No. 67 offered by Senator Sullivan. This amendment \nwould require--would require--the disarming of Federal law enforcement \nofficers who work for the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  There are currently about 180 law enforcement agents working for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. They are trained professional officers \nand are tasked with investigating and enforcing our Nation's \nenvironmental laws. They conduct investigations, execute warrants, and \nmake arrests for misdemeanors and felonies under the laws of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  This is law enforcement work and it is dangerous work. Many times \nthese officers face the same threats as all law enforcement officers \nface. According to the Bureau of Justice statistics, there are 73 \nFederal agencies with law enforcement officers, ranging from the FBI to \nthe Food and Drug Administration and NASA.\n  EPA's criminal investigators were given law enforcement powers in a \nlaw signed by President Reagan in 1988. President Reagan stated his \nadministration actively sought this authority and he was pleased to \nsign it into law.\n  The amendment No. 67 of Senator Sullivan would prevent these EPA law \nenforcement officers from being armed while they are carrying out their \nlaw enforcement responsibilities. A lot of what these EPA agents do is \nto investigate suspected cases of illegal dumping of hazardous \nmaterials. This can lead to dangerous confrontations. The EPA reports \nits agents have frequently encountered weapons and armed individuals \nwhen they have conducted their work.\n  I took a look at some of these cases. Many people mistakenly believe \nthe Environmental Protection Agency is a group of government employees \nsitting behind desks and computers in Washington and regional offices \nwho don't get out and about to see the actual violations that are \ntaking place. They are mistaken.\n  Let me give a few examples for the record. In Marathon, FL, EPA \nspecial agents, along with local sheriff's deputies, shot and arrested \nLarkin Baggett, a Federal fugitive from Utah, after he pointed an \nassault rifle at them. Baggett was initially arrested by the EPA on \npollution-related crimes in the State of Utah. During the initial \narrest of Mr. Baggett, a knife and handgun were recovered off his \nperson. Mr. Baggett was considered armed and dangerous due to the \namount of firepower he had in his possession.\n  Firearms recovered from Mr. Baggett included an AR-10 assault rival, \na 12-gauge shotgun, several rifles and handguns, and hundreds of rounds \nof ammunition. Mr. Baggett was ultimately sentenced to 13 years in \nprison for his assault conviction and his environmental crimes \nconviction.\n  The Sullivan amendment would say the environmental officer who was \ntrying to arrest this man had to be disarmed. In other words, the \nenvironmental law enforcement officer would have no firearm while Mr. \nBaggett would be holding an arsenal. That is what the Sullivan \namendment would do.\n  During a Mississippi search warrant, seven handguns and a sawed-off \npistol-grip shotgun were secured during the warrant. During that same \nwarrant, two handguns were removed from the sweatshirt pocket and hip \nholster from one subject. Another handgun was removed from the purse of \nanother subject. The sawed-off pistol-grip shotgun was found stored in \nthe cavity of a desk where a drawer was removed and the weapon was \npointed directly at the agents of the Environmental Protection Agency \nwhen they entered.\n  If you read the amendment offered by Senator Sullivan, he has removed \nthe ability and right of these agents to be armed to protect themselves \nand to enforce the law, but he continues to require them to do the most \nbasic things under the law. He requires them--continues to require \nthem--to execute and\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\nserve any warrant or other process unarmed. He continues to require \nthem under the statute to make arrests without warrant for any offense \nagainst the United States, including felonies. Under the Sullivan \namendment they are to do so unarmed.\n  I can go through a lengthy list here of real-life circumstances where \npeople working for the Environmental Protection Agency literally risked \ntheir lives, and they did it at least with the comfort of being trained \nprofessional law enforcement officers equipped with firearms to protect \nthemselves and enforce the laws of the United States.\n  Senator Sullivan wants them to enforce the laws, but he doesn't want \nthem to carry a firearm. That to me is ridiculous. In fact, it is \ndangerous. It is dangerous to send these men and women with the \nresponsibility of doing their job into circumstances where they could \nliterally lose their lives because of the Sullivan amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated January 24, 2015, signed \nby Jon Adler, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Federal Law Enforcement\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the 27,000 members of the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), I am \n     writing to express our strong opposition to the misguided \n     ``Keystone'' amendment put forth by Senator Sullivan that \n     calls for the disarming of EPA Criminal Investigators.\n       EPA-CID currently employs approximately 180 sworn Criminal \n     Investigators, all of whom have completed the mandatory \n     Criminal Investigator Training Program at the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center. These highly trained law \n     enforcement officers complete the same basic academy training \n     as their counterparts at the U.S. Marshals Service, the \n     Secret Service, NCIS, ICE and other credible federal law \n     enforcement agencies. They receive quarterly tactical \n     training to ensure firearms proficiency, defensive tactics \n     capability, and enforcement operation readiness. They should \n     not be denigrated and belittled like some Barney Fife \n     aberration gone wild.\n       Unfortunately, Senator Sullivan has opted to employ \n     inflammatory language to mischaracterize EPA-CID 's execution \n     of court-issued search warrants as stampede-styled ``raids.'' \n     EPA Criminal Investigators employ proper law enforcement \n     tactics and techniques, while wearing the appropriate \n     protective equipment during field work. They issue proper \n     verbal commands, and do not scream ``Charge!'' like some \n     reckless group of bandits. Contrary to Senator Sullivan's \n     alarmist assertions, EPA Criminal Investigators invoke a \n     proper command presence in order to protect their safety as \n     well as those around them.\n       While Senator Sullivan seeks to minimize the law \n     enforcement relevance of the EPA-CID mission, it is important \n     to note that the Criminal Investigators enforce the criminal \n     statutes of the United States Code, and investigate alleged \n     violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the \n     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. If Senator Sullivan \n     takes exception to a particular statute, he should focus on \n     amending the law and not disarming and jeopardizing the \n     safety of those who risk their lives to enforce it. \n     Furthermore, he should respect the fact that there are \n     criminals who knowingly and willfully harm our environment, \n     and EPA Criminal Investigator's expertise is needed to \n     investigate and apprehend these criminals.\n       Recent current events, both domestic and abroad, have made \n     clear that terrorist groups are targeting law enforcement \n     officers. In New York City, a lone-wolf terrorist \n     assassinated two heroic NYPD Police Officers. In France, a \n     terrorist cell brutally murdered three law enforcement \n     officers, as well as civilians. So how does Senator Sullivan \n     come to any rational conclusion that it's appropriate to \n     disarm law enforcement officers who are protecting our \n     homeland? Perhaps Senator Sullivan is unaware of terrorists' \n     intent to deploy biological, chemical and radiological \n     weapons to harm our citizenry and institutions? EPA Criminal \n     Investigators are an integral, indispensable component of our \n     homeland defense against such attacks. Does Senator Sullivan \n     maintain in good faith that EPA Criminal Investigators should \n     conduct their criminal investigations unarmed in support of \n     the FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force?\n       Each cabinet entity has an Inspector General's office that \n     employs highly trained Criminal Investigators to investigate \n     allegations of excessive force or misconduct. This includes \n     the EPA. In reaching his ill-advised conclusion to disarm EPA \n     Criminal Investigators, did Senator Sullivan draw upon any \n     Inspector General report to substantiate his position? While \n     there is no evidence to suggest any widespread incidents of \n     excessive force or misconduct by EPA Criminal Investigators, \n     a reasonable person is left to question the rational \n     motivation of Senator Sullivan's amendment.\n       In closing, I reference a statement a FLEOA member who \n     serves honorably as a Criminal Investigator with EPA: ``We \n     conduct search warrants, arrest warrants, and interviews \n     which brings us into contact with individuals who may be \n     armed or have access to weapons. There is no way we can \n     accomplish our mission safely without a means to protect \n     ourselves.''\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                        Jon Adler.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This letter says it all. It spells out how dangerous this \nis if the Sullivan amendment passes. To think that, for whatever \nreason, a U.S. Senator is going to take a firearm away from a law \nenforcement officer of a Federal agency who is putting his or her life \non the line every single day is just plain wrong.\n  If Senator Sullivan wants to take away the enforcement authorities of \nthis Agency, so be it. We can argue and debate that. But to require \nthis Agency to execute warrants and make arrests but require that their \nlaw enforcement officials be unarmed is sending them into dangerous--\neven deadly--situations. This Sullivan amendment is not well-thought-\nout. To offer this I think is a serious mistake.\n  The Senator is offering it, he says, because of a 2013 incident in \nwhich EPA agents were part of a law enforcement task force that \ninvestigated a mining operation in Alaska based on allegations of \nenvironmental allegations. I don't know the particulars of that \nincident, but there was a review of the incident commissioned by the \nGovernor of Alaska--a Republican Governor of Alaska--that found no \nevidence that these EPA agents broke any laws during the investigation.\n  Isn't it odd that we have reached the point where, when we try to \nintroduce an amendment which says that you will not sell a gun, a \nfirearm, to someone at a gun show who is on the terrorist suspect \nlist--many argue against that, saying even terrorist suspects have \nSecond Amendment rights--and then turn around with the Sullivan \namendment, this ill-advised amendment, and say law enforcement does not \nhave a right to carry a firearm. That is the Sullivan amendment. I hope \nwe vote against it on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the legislation before \nthis body, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. I wish to address three issues \nthat have been brought up as we have continued this discussion.\n  I start out by thanking the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nWashington who are leading this effort to bring forward amendments from \nboth sides of the aisle. I think they are doing great work. They are \nheavily engaged in trying to make sure the people's amendments are \nbrought forward and that we have a vote. So I thank them for that and \nagain encourage everyone to work with both these bill managers who I \nbelieve all of us feel are doing an excellent job. So let's get going. \nLet's get voting on these amendments. Let's make them pending and have \nthat vote.\n  This is again, after all, an effort not only to advance this \nlegislation but also to reestablish regular order in this body and move \nto an open amendment process--which is so important again not just in \nterms of people being heard on this legislation, having votes on \namendments, but for other legislation that Senators want to bring \nforward for the good of this country, to have the debate, to offer \ntheir ideas, to get a vote, and to get things done for the American \npeople. That is what it is all about. We have to keep that in mind and \nnot lose track of that. This is truly about not just this legislation \nbut getting to regular order, which I think is so important for the \nwork we do, to accomplish the work we need to do on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  Let me touch on three aspects of the current legislation that have \nbeen brought up. One is that it is a bill for Canada rather than for \nthe United States. It is something that is very much in the interest of \nthe United States, so I want to address that. I also want to talk about \nsome of the environmental aspects from the standpoint that there are \nhundreds of millions of dollars being invested in new technologies by \nmajor companies in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada, that are going to \nhelp deploy and develop things\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\nsuch as carbon capture and storage, which can be used not only to \nreduce the environmental footprint and the greenhouse emissions of oil \nproduced in the Canadian oil sands, but that is technology then that \nwill get adopted in this country and around the world because it \nenables us to produce more energy more cost-effectively, more \ndependably, and with environmental stewardship. So that is a win on \nboth counts, and here is a place where it is being developed. So let's \nempower that investment that produces more energy with better \nenvironmental stewardship as we go forward into the future.\n  Then the third area I want to touch on for just a minute is pipeline \nsafety because some of the recent spills have been brought up. It is so \nimportant that we have the new infrastructure to replace older \ninfrastructure.\n  For example, the pipeline spill in Poplar, MO, near Glendive, MO, has \nbeen brought up. It is a pipeline that I think was originally built and \nput in place in the 1950s. So we are talking about a 50-year-old \npipeline with 50-year-old technology. Whether it is roads or bridges or \npipelines or transmission lines or any kind of infrastructure--we need \ninfrastructure for this country, but we have to update it. Think about \nbuilding a road 50 years ago and then not putting in a new one to \nreplace and update it with the new technologies that have been \ndeveloped to make it better.\n  When we talk about trying to get these new infrastructure projects \ngoing--again, paid for 100 percent with private dollars--this generates \nrevenue for the taxpayer. This doesn't take one penny of taxpayer \nmoney. This is an $8 billion state-of-the-art pipeline. It is important \nfor all the reasons we have talked about, but it also is the kind of \nthing that will replace some of the older technologies and give us that \nupdated new infrastructure we need.\n  So I think when we hear about a spill, wherever it may occur, we want \nto make sure it is taken care of and fully remediated and take \nprecautions so it doesn't happen again. But we have to understand we \nhave to put the new infrastructure in place if we want to reduce the \nnumber of spills we have as we continue to rely on infrastructure that \nis 50 years old--when we don't make or allow these new investments to \nbe made.\n  So I will touch on all those for just a few minutes.\n  Again, I know the bill managers are hard at work. They are having \ngreat dialogue. If they come out and are ready to go, I will yield the \nfloor right away to do that. Again, the priority is to keep the process \nmoving and get amendments up and have them voted on.\n  The first issue: It is a Canadian project somehow, not a U.S. \nproject. The first point I would make, on its face, is it is going to \nmove domestically produced crude as well as Canadian crude. Everybody \ntalks about the fact that it starts up in Hardisty and says it is going \nto move Canadian oil, and then they stop there. But it is not only \ngoing to move Canadian oil, it is going to move oil from North Dakota, \nMontana--light, sweet Bakken shale oil--out of this region of our \ncountry. So it is going to move both domestic crude as well as Canadian \ncrude. So when somebody says it is just a Canadian project, that is not \ntrue. That would be akin to somebody saying it is only a U.S. project \nbecause it is moving U.S. oil.\n  For beginners, it is important that people understand it is not just \nCanadian oil, it is oil we produce in our country that needs to get to \nrefineries as cost-effectively and safely as possible.\n  What is happening is because we are being blocked from getting these \nkind of pipelines developed because they can't get through the \nregulatory process, the oil production we are producing in our part of \nthe country, in North Dakota, Montana, and the Bakken area, as well as \nother areas of the country is all having to move by rail.\n  For example, right now my State of North Dakota produces 1.2 million \nbarrels of oil a day, second only to Texas, and that number has been \ngrowing. That growth I think will slow down right now because the price \nof oil has come down so much. But the point is we are having to move \n700,000 barrels a day by rail because we don't have the pipelines, such \nas the Keystone XL Pipeline, approved.\n  That creates other problems as well. We produce a tremendous number \nof ag commodities and ag products. We actually are the leader of 14 \ndifferent major ag commodities in the country--things such as wheat, \nfor example, and many other farm commodities as well. All of those \nthings get backed up on the rail system because we are trying to move \nso much oil on the rail that we can't handle all the congestion.\n  So it is not just an issue in terms of energy for our country, but it \nis affecting our other commerce, our farmers, and other goods that are \ntrying to be shipped. It is not just goods that originate from our part \nof the country but all the goods that go back and forth and are trying \nto go through that bottleneck.\n  But the biggest reason it is very much a U.S. project is because it \nis about getting to energy security and energy independence.\n  Right now the United States consumes about 18 million barrels of oil \na day. We produce about 11 million barrels a day--which is up \ntremendously in recent years because of production on private and State \nlands in places such as North Dakota. That means we still import about \n7 million barrels a day. We use 18 million barrels of oil a day. We \nproduce 11 million barrels a day. We import 7 million. The amount of \noil we get from Canada is increasing. We are up to more than 3 million \nbarrels a day that we import from Canada. So if we take the 11 million \nwe produce plus the 3 million we get from Canada, that is 14. That \nleaves us 4 million short of what we use on a daily basis. We get that \nfrom places such as OPEC, Venezuela, and other parts of the world that \nhave very different interests in many cases than our own.\n  I think the American people very much want to get to a position where \nwe don't have to rely on OPEC anymore for the oil we use. In fact, we \nare getting there. We are getting there. As I say, we are at the point \nnow between ourselves and Canada where we have 14 million of the 18 \nmillion a day we use covered.\n  If we can continue to develop our energy resources and work with \nCanada, we can truly have North American energy security--meaning we \ndon't have to rely on OPEC anymore for our oil. That is a national \nsecurity issue. It is an energy issue. It is a jobs issue. It is an \neconomic growth issue. It is a national security issue. Look at what is \ngoing on in the Middle East. Americans do not want to rely on OPEC for \ntheir oil anymore.\n  Look at the benefit. As we produce more energy in this country and \nwork with Canada, look at what is happening at the pump. Oil prices are \ndown more than $1 from 1 year ago because we are producing so much \nmore. Basic economics: More supply helps bring prices down. So it is \nnot just about energy independence and energy security for our country, \nit is about lower energy costs for consumers, for small business. It is \nnot only good for our hard-working Americans as they pull up to the \npump and benefit every day from those lower gas prices, but it helps \nmake our economy grow because energy is a foundational industry.\n  When we have low-cost energy produced in this country that we know we \ncan rely on, that makes us competitive in every other industry sector \nin a global economy.\n  So when somebody says: This is just about a pipeline or it is just \nabout a Canadian issue, it is not the case. This is very much about our \nenergy future in this country and how we are going to build it, both to \nbe energy secure and to make our economy go when we have to compete \nglobally.\n  The second issue--and I often show this chart because it makes the \nsecond part of that energy security point. If we don't work with Canada \nso that this oil comes to us and we control that oil and control our \nenergy future, Canada is going to make other arrangements. They are \ngoing to build pipelines to their west coast, and that oil is going to \nChina and we will continue to import oil from OPEC. That is how life \nworks. We either take advantage of this opportunity with our closest \nfriend and ally in the world or somebody else will.\n  The next one I want to touch on for just a minute is the \nenvironmental. We hear about this so much, the environmental aspects of \nthis project. I have\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\nbeen on the floor and I have talked about various aspects of the \nproject based on the science and based on the fact that there have \nactually been five environmental impact statements produced. The \nenvironmental impact statements produced by the Obama administration \nsay there will be less greenhouse gas emissions with the pipeline than \nwithout it because we will be able to move that 830,000 barrels a day \nof oil by pipeline, rather than moving it by either 1,400 rail cars or \nsending it to China where the refineries have higher emissions than \nours do.\n  But I would like to go beyond that and talk for a minute in a broader \nsense about our energy future and how we not only produce more energy \nmore cost-effectively from all sources, from all kinds of energy, but \nhow we can do it with better environmental stewardship. And the way \nforward there is really technology. It is the American ingenuity, the \ninvestment in technology, and the creativity of our companies and our \nentrepreneurs. That is the real key to success in the future in terms \nof producing more energy more cost-effectively, more independently, and \nwith better environmental stewardship--by leading the way forward with \ntechnology development. We cannot export our regulations, but as we \ndevelop technologies, those, in effect, get exported around the world \nbecause other countries adopt those technologies.\n  So I will talk just a minute about the technology development that is \ngoing on in the oil sands. Since 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions on a \nper-barrel basis in the oil sands have gone down by 28 percent, almost \none-third. On a per-barrel basis they have reduced their greenhouse gas \nemissions by 28 percent since 1990. They are engaged in major projects \nnow to develop and deploy new technologies that will help them produce \noil in the oil sands region with a smaller footprint--which is what I \nam showing here--through in situ development and also through carbon \ncapture and storage.\n  We talk so often about developing carbon capture and storage in this \ncountry. That is being developed and deployed in the oil sands right \nnow. The Quest project, which is a project Shell Oil Company is \nundertaking--let me read from a bit of a summary on their Quest \nproject, which is a project for carbon capture and storage they are \ndeveloping right now.\n  This is a picture of it. It is in situ--which means drilling and \nusing steam to bring the oil out rather than excavation, which is the \nold style--so it has a much smaller environmental footprint, but it \nalso reduces greenhouse gas emissions because they capture the \nCO2 and they store it.\n  A point of inquiry, Mr. President. I would like to ask the bill \nmanagers if they are ready to move forward or make any announcement. If \nwe have any amendments, I would gladly yield the floor for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  As we mentioned earlier, we had a very productive morning trying to \ndiscern the universe of amendments we may have before us. I think it is \nvery clear that there is genuine interest on both sides of the aisle to \nfind that path forward so we can come to a conclusion on S. 1 and do so \nin an orderly way--a way that respects the legislative process and a \nway that allows Members to have opportunities to advance issues they \nfeel strongly about and issues that merit debate on this floor.\n  We have encouraged Members over the past couple weeks to present \ntheir amendments to us. At this point in time we have processed 24 \nseparate amendments. We do have some amendments that are pending on the \nRepublican side--seven to be exact. I do know that there are others \nthat Members would like to be made pending. I have one myself, and I \nknow the Senator from Washington will be speaking to several additional \nDemocratic amendments which they would like to offer on their side. So \nI think we have discussed a process here to get us moving in that \ndirection so that we can get the amendments pending, and then \nhopefully, perhaps as early as this evening--I don't want to make any \npromises--we can begin voting on these amendments.\n  What I would like to do at this time is turn to my colleague to not \nonly speak to the gentlewomen's agreement we have in so far as a way \nforward but also to allow for a couple of amendments to be made pending \non her side, and then we will come back and provide that opportunity on \nthe Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her \nwork on this process and for her legislation. As she said, she and I \nhave a gentlewomen's agreement to move forward, and we would like to do \nthat so we can finish business on this legislation, and we are working \nin good faith on that process. Just as she said, we are going to work \non getting the next amendment before us. I thank the Senator for her \nhard work.\n  I would like to turn to my colleague from California to call up her \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank both of my colleagues for working so hard. I am trying to be \na facilitator in this process as well, as the ranking member now on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I want to remind everyone that \nthis bill deals with environmental law.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 130 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so that I \ncan call up amendment No. 130.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 130 to amendment \n     No. 2.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To preserve existing permits and the authority of the \n    agencies issuing the permits to modify the permits if necessary)\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 20 through 23 and insert the \n     following:\n       (c) Permit Savings Clause.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     affect the status of any Federal permit or authorization \n     issued before the date of enactment of this Act for the \n     pipeline and cross-border facilities referred to in \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a very simple amendment. I hope it \nwill be unanimously accepted. I think anyone within the sound of my \nvoice who cares about the health and safety of people would support \nthis amendment because we know this underlying bill facilitates the \nbuilding of a Canadian project, with all the benefits going to Canada, \nnone to America. We have established that there will be 35 permanent \njobs. We have established that we could have oilspills because we have \nalready had several serious oilspills and this oil is very hard to \nclean up. We have established by the Republicans' votes that they will \nnot vote to keep the oil in America, so it doesn't even help us with \nenergy independence. They even voted against the amendment to make sure \nthe steel was from America. They voted against that.\n  So this is a Canadian bill. This is a wonderful bill for Canadian oil \ninterests. Frankly, that is not why I was elected. I was elected to \nfight for California, fight for American jobs, fight for middle-class \njobs, and not sit by while we see what is happening here, which is that \nthe very first bill brought to us by this new Republican Congress turns \nout to be a bill for Canadian oil.\n  One of my colleagues--I don't know if it was Senator Cantwell who \ncoined this or Senator Markey--said it is basically a big straw that \nruns from Canada and has the potential to spill all the way down, and \nthen it is refined here, and all the filth and dirt gets stored here \nand goes into the air, and then it goes out of the country. It doesn't \ndo a thing to help us. So all I am asking for is a little bit of relief \nfor the people of this Nation.\n  Right now, S. 1 says that all permits ``shall remain in effect'' for \nthis TransCanada pipeline regardless of any actions taken in building \nthe pipeline, even if the company violates the permits.\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\n  So we know this company had to go and get a number of permits. What \nthis bill does is it says: Once you get a permit, TransCanada, no one \ncan take it away from you.\n  Imagine. We don't do that for our companies. They have to walk the \nwalk and talk the talk.\n  All we say here is, if you violate your permit, it can be revoked. \nYou cannot willy-nilly get permits from the Commerce Department, EPA, \nthe Corps of Engineers, or other entities and then violate them and \nknow that the permit can never be taken away. I was stunned when I \nlearned this.\n  So this would very simply say that if, in fact, there is new \ninformation that requires a permit to be changed or modified, it can be \ndone. We do not waive protecting the health and safety of the American \npeople.\n  Let me give an example. Back home I have a bridge that was built, \nunfortunately, with foreign parts, and those parts failed. It is a \nnightmare to try to fix it.\n  If TransCanada violates their permit and uses the wrong materials--\nlet's say the bolts rupture--they still get to keep their permit. We \nare saying: No. Your permit can be revoked.\n  Another example: This is the handling of hazardous waste. We know \nthis is filthy, dirty oil, and we know what is in this oil. It is \ntoxic. Peer-reviewed research established significantly higher levels \nof carcinogens. We know this. We have met with the people who live in \nCanada who have had to breathe in that air. Data collected by the Texas \nCancer Registry indicates that cancer rates among African Americans in \nJefferson County, Port Arthur, TX, are 15 percent higher than for the \naverage Texans. They live right near the refineries.\n  We know these permits are only as good as they are enforced. If they \nare enforced and we find they haven't lived up to their commitments on \nthe handling of hazardous waste--by the way, to get their permit from \nCommerce, they also have to put out a plan that deals with a spill. \nLet's say there is a spill and they don't live up to the permit. They \nstill get to keep the permit.\n  This is an extraordinary piece of legislation. I have never ever in \nmy time here or ever in history known of any American corporation \ngetting a free pass in terms of the health and safety and the \nprotection of the air and water that this company is getting. They \ncould literally avoid following any of the steps they committed to in \ntheir permit, and this legislation gives them a free pass.\n  My amendment simply says that we are able to revoke a permit if it is \nnot followed.\n  I would ask the Senator from Washington if I could at this point \nyield the floor. My amendment is pending. I appreciate the work of the \nSenator from Alaska in allowing this amendment to be offered, and I \nappreciate the work of my colleague from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, before recognizing the Senator from \nCalifornia, I failed to say that there is no way this legislation would \nbe where it is today, moving forward in the process, without the \nSenator from California. She has been a great adviser all through this \nprocess and a great protector and advocate of the issues we are \ninterested in on the environment, on security, and on safety. I thank \nher for her leadership, and I look forward to supporting her on this \namendment.\n  I would like to turn to my colleague from Michigan, if I could. We \nare going to offer a couple of amendments on our side and go back to \nthe Senator from Alaska, but at this point in time I would like the \nSenator from Michigan, who has had a very devastating personal \nexperience related to tar sands, to talk about his amendment and call \nup that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 70 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 70, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Peters], for himself and Ms. \n     Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered 70 to amendment No. \n     2.\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require that the Administrator of the Pipeline and \n  Hazardous Materials Safety Administration make a certification and \n submit to Congress the results of a study before the pipeline may be \n            constructed, connected, operated, or maintained)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PHMSA GREAT LAKES RESOURCES AND STUDY.\n\n       The pipeline described in section 2(a) shall not be \n     constructed, connected, operated, or maintained until the \n     Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \n     Administration--\n       (1) certifies to Congress that the Pipeline and Hazardous \n     Materials Safety Administration has sufficient resources to \n     carry out the duties of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials \n     Safety Administration for pipelines in the Great Lakes; and\n       (2) submits to Congress the results of a study on \n     recommendations for special conditions on pipelines in the \n     Great Lakes, similar to the recommendations in Appendix B of \n     the environmental impact statement described in section 2(b).\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, this is a very commonsense amendment based \non a simple premise. Before Congress intervenes to approve this new \npipeline that is before us, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \nAdministration, PHMSA, the Federal agency which oversees pipeline \nsafety, should certify that it has the resources required to carry out \nits duty.\n  Specifically, the amendment before the Senate requires PHMSA to \nconfirm that it has the resources to oversee pipelines in the Great \nLakes and provide recommendations for special conditions for pipelines \nin the Great Lakes just as it provided recommendations for special \nconditions for the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The people of Michigan know why it is so important that we ensure \nthese pipelines are safe. We had a pipeline spill in Kalamazoo, MI, in \n2010 that spilled over 800,000 gallons of tar sands into the Kalamazoo \nRiver. The cleanup has now taken over 4 years at a cost of over $1.2 \nbillion. A pipeline accident in the Great Lakes, where we have some of \nthese pipelines located now, would be absolutely catastrophic. We have \nto remind folks that the Great Lakes now provide drinking water to over \n40 million people and support 1.5 million jobs. It would be a disaster \nnot just for folks in the State of Michigan, but throughout the Great \nLakes region and throughout the country, if there were a pipeline \nbreak. We know it firsthand from what happened in Kalamazoo, the most \nexpensive pipeline break in the history of this country.\n  We have to ensure that the pipelines that operate in the Great Lakes, \nparticularly in the Straits of Mackinac, which connect the Upper \nPeninsula with the Lower Peninsula, have the protections they need.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to make \nsure we protect the Great Lakes, not just for today but for future \ngenerations.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Collins from Maine \nto bring up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 35 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 35.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 35 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska for yielding to me for this purpose and I commend her, as \nwell as the Senator from Washington State, for their extraordinary \nmanagement of this bill.\n  I am pleased to report that the amendment I have called up and made \npending is actually a bipartisan initiative. It is cosponsored by my \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, and its purpose is to help \nschool officials to learn more easily about Federal programs and \nincentives that are available to improve energy efficiency and thus \nlower costs for our Nation's schools.\n  There are a number of Federal initiatives already available to \nschools to help them become more energy efficient, but in many cases \nschools are not taking full advantage of these programs. The reason for \nthat is because they are scattered across several agencies and are \ndifficult to access.\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues that Senator Warner and I \nare not proposing the creation of any new programs to help schools \nbecome more energy efficient but rather to have more coordination and \nto streamline those programs which already exist.\n  Our amendment would require the Department of Energy to be the leader \nof these programs and help schools identify and navigate them, and that \nin turn would be a great service to our Nation's schools.\n  As I said, by providing a streamlined coordinating structure, this \namendment would help schools navigate available Federal programs and \nfinancing without authorizing new programs or funding. Decisions about \nhow best to meet the energy needs of their schools would appropriately \nremain in the hands of States, school boards, and local officials.\n  Specifically, the amendment would establish the Department of Energy \nas the lead agency for coordinating and disseminating information on \nexisting Federal energy efficiency programs and financing options \navailable to schools for initiating, developing, and financing energy \nefficiency, renewable energy, and energy retrofitting projects.\n  The amendment would also require DOE to review existing Federal \nprograms--scattered at the Departments of Agriculture, Education, \nTreasury, the IRS, and EPA--so schools know what is available.\n  It would also streamline communication and outreach to the States, \nlocal education agencies, and schools and the development of a \nmechanism for forming a peer-to-peer network to support the initiation \nof the projects.\n  Finally, the amendment would require the Department of Energy to \nprovide technical assistance to help schools navigate the financing and \ndevelopment of such projects to better ensure their success.\n  Assisting our nation's schools in navigating and tapping into \nexisting federal programs to lower energy usage and save money makes \ngood common sense.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the \nCollins-Warner amendment No. 35.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 166 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

RELEASE OF CERTAIN WILDERNESS STUDY AREAS.\n\n       (a) Bureau of Land Management Land.--With respect to Bureau \n     of Land Management land identified as a wilderness study area \n     and recommended for a wilderness designation under section \n     603(a) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 \n     (43 U.S.C. 1782(a)), if, within 1 year of receiving the \n     recommendation, Congress has not designated the wilderness \n     study area as wilderness, the area shall no longer be subject \n     to--\n       (1) section 603(c) of that Act; or\n       (2) Secretarial Order No. 3310 issued by the Secretary of \n     the Interior on December 22, 2010.\n       (b) Fish and Wildlife Service Land.--With respect to land \n     administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \n     that has been recommended by the President or the Secretary \n     of the Interior for designation as wilderness under the \n     Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), if, within 1 year of \n     receiving the recommendation, Congress has\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\n     not designated the land as wilderness, the land shall no \n     longer be managed in a manner that protects the wilderness \n     character of the land.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering this \nafternoon is pretty straightforward. It would effectively release \nwilderness study areas if, within 1 year of receiving the \nrecommendation, Congress has not designated this study area as \nwilderness.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in the news of late with the \nPresident's announcement on Sunday that he is seeking to put an \nadditional 12 million acres in the ANWR area--Alaska's North Slope--\ninto wilderness status, including the 1002 area which has specifically \nbeen designated for oil and gas exploration. I want to make sure people \nunderstand this is not just an ANWR amendment. This is about the \nwilderness study areas that we see that are currently on the books.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, as of the beginning \nof this year, Congress has designated 109.8 million acres of Federal \nland as wilderness. Just over half of this wilderness is in my State of \nAlaska. We have over 57 million acres of wilderness in Alaska. Ninety \npercent of the wilderness under the management of the Fish and Wildlife \nService is in Alaska.\n  As a practical matter, there is more out there. There are more acres \nthat are proposed for wilderness designation. For example, the Bureau \nof Land Management manages 528 wilderness study areas containing almost \n12.8 million acres located primarily in the 12 States in the West as \nwell as Alaska.\n  We also have the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has a \nwilderness study process through its land use planning to identify \nareas to be proposed as wilderness.\n  There is some history as to how we got to dealing with these \nwilderness study areas. Areas that are identified by agency officials \nas having certain wilderness characteristics--as identified under the \n1964 Wilderness Act--were classified as wilderness study areas. BLM \nreceived specific direction in the Federal Land Policy Management Act \nof 1976 to inventory and study its roadless areas for wilderness \ncharacteristics. By 1980 the BLM completed field inventories which \ndesignated about 25 million acres of wilderness study areas. Since 1980 \nCongress has taken a look at some of these. Some have been designated \nas wilderness and others have been released for nonwilderness uses. The \nBLM has also taken it upon itself to designate wilderness study areas \nthrough its land use process.\n  The point here is that once an area has been designated under the BLM \nor the Fish and Wildlife Service study regime, it effectively becomes \nde facto wilderness. The designation then limits and restricts the \nability to do just about anything for fear that it might impair the \nsuitability of the area for preservation as wilderness.\n  Until Congress makes a final determination on a wilderness study \narea, the BLM or the Fish and Wildlife Service manages these areas to \npreserve their suitability for designation as wilderness. Even if \nCongress has not acted--because it is Congress's purview to do so--the \nagencies have designated it as de facto wilderness.\n  My amendment says we are going to change this, and we have to change \nthis. Congress needs to reassert itself into this equation. As the \nfinal arbiter of what is or is not designated as wilderness, Congress \ncan and should make the decisions in a timely manner about the \nwilderness status.\n  What my amendment does is pretty simple. If Congress doesn't act \nwithin 1 year to designate as wilderness an area recommended for \nwilderness, the designation is released. It just goes back to multiple \nuse. That way the agencies are not managing areas to preserve a \npossible wilderness designation as an option for Congress. Instead, \nthey can get on with looking at a broader range of options for how to \nmanage that land with the local people and other interested \nstakeholders through the land-use planning process that applies to each \nof the agencies.\n  Some may argue that Congress needs more time on this. I would say we \nhave had plenty of time to review these areas. Some of the wilderness \nstudy areas have been pending since the 1980s. That is plenty of time \nto figure out whether they should be put in wilderness status. Congress \nneeds to make decisions.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment and take a look at what \nis contained and not just think about the ANWR situation but think \nabout the applicability within their respective States.\n  I know that Senator Sessions was seeking recognition. As Members are \nseeking to come to the floor to get their amendments pending, we would \nlike to allow them to have recognition.\n  At this point, I believe we need some clarification from the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will wrap up in 2 minutes and will then yield the floor \nto the Senator from Alabama.\n  I have been talking about a number of different points, but right now \nI would like to defer. I will be back on the issues as we continue this \ndebate. Again, I thank the bill managers, and I am very pleased to see \nthat Senators are coming down and making these amendments pending. That \nis what we need do now. I thank Senators on both sides of the aisle for \ndoing that.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hoeven for his hard work \non this Keystone XL Pipeline bill, as well as Senator Murkowski and \nothers who have worked together on it on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have been talking about global warming and climate \nchange. I have been on the Environment and Public Works Committee for \nsome time, and we have had a number of good hearings on the subject. I \nwish to share some thoughts on climate change because so much of what \nis driving our energy policies in America today is entirely dependent \non a fear of the impact of global warming in the years to come.\n  There have been a number of votes on global warming. I was asked by a \nreporter today: You voted with the Whitehouse amendment; why did you do \nthat? Well, I just have this to say. It is true, to my understanding, \nand according to the best science we have, that the Earth has warmed by \na degree in the last 100 years, and exactly what is causing that, we \nare not so sure.\n  If that were to accelerate, then, to a significant degree, it would \nbe a cause for concern. It would be a cause for America and the entire \nworld to really begin to evaluate what our future is and what action \nmight be taken. That is what has happened.\n  The world has been engaged mightily in the effort to drive up the \ncost of electricity, drive up the cost of gasoline, drive up the cost \nof the production of products that use energy, and drive up the cost of \ntransported items that you go to the grocery store and buy.\n  I will just say this. The scare tactics we have been hearing are not \ncoming to fruition. Over a time period, they were predicted to come to \na fruition, but they just are not. As public servants--as elected \nofficials who represent 320 million Americans--we need to ask \nourselves: Should we press down an excessive, increased burden of \nenergy costs on the backs of working Americans to meet the fears that \nwe have been hearing about? And if we do that, how much can we afford \nto do? How much can we afford to ask of them?\n  We are reducing CO2 emissions in the United States and \ndoing a pretty good job of it. But the fear is--at least the concern \nfrom so many of us--is that we are now projecting--the President is \nprojecting massive increases in regulations that will significantly and \nfurther hammer coal and hammer the price of energy in America.\n  Many Members of Congress want to take drastic action that would \nincrease the cost of electricity and gasoline from fossil fuels. It \nwould do that. There is no doubt about that. And it would virtually end \ncoal production in the United States, a product we have a lot of.\n  They claim the science of global warming is settled, but I suggest \nquestions remain. Global climate change advocates have, over many \nyears, relied upon a number of climate models. These models are \ndesigned to predict the temperature over time, and they\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\nhave done that, and I will show my colleagues the result of these \nmodels in a minute. They predict not only increasing temperatures but \nincreasing droughts, increasing flux--droughts and flux--increasing \nsevere weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes. These models \nhave long predicted this. So we have a history of how well the models \nhave performed over time. An easy measure, a critical measure, of the \nvalidity of any model is how well it compares to actual data. So the \nactual weather data, I tell my colleagues, is proving that the models \nhave not been accurate.\n  There are other facts we are dealing with that give concern to those \nof us who are less than certain about what the climate will do in the \nfuture.\n  Last week, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies claimed that \n2014 was the hottest year on record. Perhaps my colleagues heard that. \nIt was based on their analysis of 3,000 ground-based thermometers \naround the world. They backtracked on that claim the very next day, \nhowever, because the increase was so small that the ground-based system \nfell within the margin of error.\n  There are other problems with those assertions. Data gathered at the \nEarth's surface has limitations in measuring the temperature. It is a \nrelatively small sample influenced by human construction. Instead, the \nbest data, I think most scientists agree, for determining warming of \nthe atmosphere is a method that can objectively gather far more data, \nand that is satellites.\n  There are two research groups that track atmospheric data, one \nsatellite and one balloon. They both show temperature data that has \nbarely risen for 35 years. The balloons validate the accuracy of the \nsatellites and the satellites tend to validate the accuracy of the \nballoons. So there is a wider and wider divergence over the years from \nwhat the models claim and what the actual temperature is doing. There \njust is.\n  Other evidence can be seen in the Earth's ice coverage. A few years \nago former Vice President Al Gore claimed the Arctic might be ice-free \nin the summertime by 2014. That was last year. That was a prediction. \nAnother study said it would be ice-free by 2029. But this past summer, \nthe ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean was 43 percent greater than it was \nin 2012.\n  Senator Murkowski, that is an increase the size of the State of \nAlaska, which is a pretty sizable State, for heaven's sake. It has \nbecome well-known that ice coverage in Antarctica is also at its record \nrecorded levels.\n  There have been dire predictions made about extreme weather events. \nOn the Weather Channel on our TV, they love to talk about storms, and \nit is exciting, and people watch it. I have had people call from \nAlabama and tell me, Have you gotten your food in? You are going to \nhave a big storm. You are going to be shut in.\n  When temperature data stopped supporting the applicants' claims of \nwarming, they started claiming that storms and droughts would worsen; \nwe would have more of them. We all heard that many times. It is hard to \nknow what to think about it when we heard that over the years.\n  It has now been nearly 3,400 days since the last major hurricane hit \nthe United States. This is no little matter to me. I remember moving to \nMobile in 1979, and that year we had Hurricane Frederic that slammed \nthe city. Trees were down everywhere. Power was off for weeks. I \nbelieve it was a category 3 hurricane. Earlier we had Hurricane Camille \nhit, and that was in the 1960s. Then we had Hurricane Katrina that hit \nNew Orleans and hit my hometown of Mobile a very significant blow. But \nit has been nearly 3,400 days since the last major hurricane hit the \nUnited States. That is a category 3, 4, or 5. That is almost 10 years. \nI think that is the longest period maybe this century.\n  According to Dr. Roger Pielke, a professor at the University of \nColorado-Boulder, who testified before our EPW Committee last year, he \nsaid hurricane seasons in the United States are 20 percent less intense \nand have seen 20 percent fewer landfalls than in 1900.\n  We have received testimony in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee from Dr. Roy Spencer, who said this:\n\n       There is little or no observational effort that severe \n     weather of any type has worsened over the last 30, 50, or 100 \n     years.\n\n  He said that in his testimony before the committee.\n  The IPCC, the International Panel on Climate Change, fifth climate \nassessment released in 2013, what did they say about these predictions? \nQuote:\n\n       Current data sets indicate no significant observed trends \n     in global tropical cyclone frequency over the last century.\n\n  So I suppose they have acknowledged that prediction to be incorrect.\n  That same report talked about floods. We have been told we will have \nmore floods.\n  The IPCC says:\n\n       In summary, there continues to be a lack of evidence and \n     thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the \n     magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale.\n\n  According to the Palmer Drought Index, there is a statistically \ninsignificant decrease in global droughts from 1982 to 2012.\n  So, remember, CO2 is increasing in the atmosphere. It is a \nsmall part of the atmosphere. It is a clean gas. There is no damage to \nus. It is a gas that is plant food. If we understand photosynthesis, \nplants breathe in CO2, grow, and create carbon stalks and \nemit oxygen, which is good for us. So in itself, CO2 is not \nan inherently bad product.\n  From 1982 to 2012, when we had some of the greatest increase in \nCO2--I guess the greatest increase in CO2 in the \nhistory of the planet, unless there was some volcano or some event--we \nhave seen actually a decrease in droughts. Small, but a decrease \nnonetheless.\n  Last July, the Budget Committee, which I was the ranking member of, \nhad a hearing on the cost of climate change to the economy and the \nDemocrats called that hearing. The Republican witnesses were Dr. Bjorn \nLomborg and David Montgomery. Professor Lomborg, from the Copenhagen \nInstitute in Denmark, said this:\n\n       While some warming may have occurred, it will not mean the \n     end of the world. The total, discounted cost of inaction--\n\nnot doing anything on global climate change--\n\n     over the next five centuries is about 1.2 percent of \n     discounted GDP. The cumulative cost of inaction towards the \n     end of the century is about 1.8 percent of GDP. While this is \n     not trivial, it by no means supports the often apocalyptic \n     conversation on global climate change.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       The cost of inaction by the end of the century is \n     equivalent to losing one year's GDP growth.\n\n  Last year we had, what, 2 percent GDP, using an average of 2.5 \npercent, 2 percent, 1 year's worth; not 100 years' worth, 1 year's \nworth, the equivalent, he said, of a moderate 1-year recession. The \ncost of inaction by the end of the century is equivalent to an annual \nloss of GDP growth on the order of .02 percent, or two-hundredths of 1 \npercent--not 2 percent; two-hundredths of 1 percent.\n  Professor Lomborg, who believes that human activity has contributed \nto some global warming--he said that--also pointed out that climate \ncontrol policy, based on current data, will cost far more than the \n``benefits'' it delivers.\n  Isn't that the question we have to ask ourselves? When we impose a \ncost on the American people, shouldn't that cost produce more benefit \nthan the cost in currency?\n  He continues:\n\n       A slightly warmer Earth means net benefits through the \n     first half of this century, until 2065.\n\n  So until 2065 it will benefit America, warmer temperatures. After \nthat, these models and other projections--he is taking them from the \nIPCC's own data--find that costs do begin to occur.\n  He continues:\n\n       However, an aggressive government response to warming now \n     can wipe out the benefits we can expect to receive.\n\n  Plus we will have higher taxes; more spending, more regulations will \ncut jobs, reduce incomes, hurt savings, and, thus, set us back more as \na nation.\n  Dr. David Montgomery, who testified at the hearing, said: It is far \nfrom clear that recent weather events are anything more than normal \nvariability in storm frequency and intensity and the nature, timing and \nextent of damage from climate change remains highly uncertain. This \ndoes not imply that no action is justified, but it does imply that \ncosts and avoided risks must be balanced carefully.\n  I think that is what we need to do, balance the cost and the risk.\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\n  In sum, these experts before the Budget Committee highlighted that \nthe climate change could be happening and it could be a part of human \naction, but its costs in the near term certainly are not great. This \ncompares to the cost of trying to stop climate change by reducing human \nactivity as very large indeed.\n  Congress considered legislation in 2009 and 2010 to put a price on \ncarbon through a cap-and-trade system that President Obama supported. \nThe cost was deemed too high. Congress said no. The bill that passed \nthe House would cost $161 billion--it was in Democratic hands at the \ntime--would cost $161 billion in the first year, and it increased in \nadditional years. How much is $161 billion? Well, we are desperately \ntrying to find $10 billion, $12 billion a year for the next 6 years to \nfund the highway bill. That is $10 billion a year. This is $160 billion \na year. The amount we spend on education in America is about $100 \nbillion a year. This would be $161 billion a year. Over a decade, we \nare talking $2 trillion hammered onto the American economy.\n  This is a serious matter and, fortunately, Congress did not yield. \nCongress rejected the legislation. So the President decided to pursue \nthe same results, not through the elected representatives but through \nthe regulatory process. In 2007, the Supreme Court sided with the State \nof Massachusetts in a critical case. It empowered EPA--if it chose--to \nregulate greenhouse gases, based on the Clean Air Act of the 1970s, \nwhen global warming was never dreamed of and nobody ever considered \nCO2 to be a pollutant. This was an activist Supreme Court \ndecision, in my opinion. Congress would never pass this law. There has \nnever been one time in the last 30 years, or certainly before that, \nthat Congress would pass a law recommending huge regulatory powers to \nthe EPA over CO2.\n  So the Court did not require EPA to regulate gases, but the Court \nallowed that under the Clean Air Act. So now the EPA is developing a \nrulemaking called a Clean Power Plan. This regulation will cost between \n$41 billion and $73 billion annually, more than the road bill and \nalmost as much as the educational bill according to analysts.\n\n  On top of this, consumers will have to spend hundreds of billions \nconserving electricity. Electricity rates are going to increase by \ndouble-digit percentages throughout most of the country. These are the \ncosts of only one of the regulations EPA is pursuing. In total, the \nHeritage Action expects the President's Climate Action Plan will cost \n$1.47 trillion in lost GDP by 2030. The costs of action far outweigh \nthe cost of inaction, it seems to me. That is the basis of my concern \nabout many of the extreme actions we are taking. The Nation is \ncrisscrossed with pipelines. They are all over it.\n  In my home State of Alabama, we are not having complaints about that. \nThis idea that we shouldn't have a pipeline to bring oil from our ally \nand friend Canada to drive down further, hopefully, the cost of energy \nin the United States is an erroneous idea. It is all driven at the \nbottom by this global climate change idea. I am not a climate denier. I \ndon't know what the truth is and what history will teach. I have \nassumed over the years scientists are on to something when they claim \nthat CO2 will be a blanket effect in our atmosphere and \ntemperature might increase. I do know that if we burn fossil fuels, \nburn plants, it creates CO2. I know that. It increases it in \nthe atmosphere. The models which are predicted increasing temperatures \nfrom this steady rise in CO2 that has been occurring for \nover 100 years as the planet's population increases have been wrong.\n  Let me show this chart. It is prepared by Dr. John Christy, who \nworked at NASA and the University of Alabama at Huntsville. The red \nline represents from 1975 to 2025, a projection average of all the \nmodels--and there are many of them; I think about 30 people doing \nmodeling of the temperatures and the average shows this rise. This is \nan alarming rise. It was based on those predictions, those modeled \neffects, that people have demanded we change what we do with energy in \nAmerica and we reduce fossil fuels and we pay more for energy to avoid \nthis trend.\n  We are getting not too far from 2025. That is a 50-year trend. Look \nat the reality though. These are the numbers, satellite data, and \nballoon data around the world. We basically had very little increase \nfrom 1980 to 2015. For 18 years or so it is basically totally flat. So \nwhat does that mean?\n  I am not sure. Maybe it will start surging next year. Maybe we will \nsee more. But at this point, as reasonable Congressmen and Senators, I \ndon't believe we can conclude that we should burden this American \neconomy weak as it is--high unemployment, December wages dropped 5 \ncents an hour. The President kept talking about how great things are. \nWages dropped 5 cents an hour in 1 month alone--December. We have the \nlowest percentage of Americans in the working ages actually working in \nAmerica today since the 1970s. Things aren't going so well. We don't \nneed to be driving up costs for our businesses, making them less \ncompetitive in the world marketplace, making gasoline more expensive \nfor working moms, making electricity more expensive for our elderly who \nare at home and cold. We just don't.\n  So who cares the most? I say we need to care about the people we \nrepresent. We need to care about their welfare.\n  Mr. Steyer, with his tens of millions of dollars in contributions, \ndemands we don't pass Keystone Pipeline, to carry out his theory--this \nbillionaire that he is--and he doesn't care apparently about what is \nhappening to jobs in America, competitiveness in America, and the \nwelfare of the citizens of this country.\n  Congress represents the interests of 320 million people. We need to \ndefend their interests, not ideological activists. It is almost a \nreligion to them. We have to be objective and realistic as we evaluate. \nSo there can be no doubt that this agenda will increase energy prices, \nit will shrink the middle class, it will eliminate jobs, it will \nincrease costs across the board, it will reduce wages, and it will \nthrow millions of Americans out of work. It just will if we carry out \nthis agenda.\n  It is not being done in China. It is not being done in Russia. It is \nnot being done in Brazil. So it is of utmost importance that the \nAmerican people know about these claims and the effects of regulations \nbefore we go headlong into enacting them.\n  The blocking of Keystone Pipeline is a clear example of what has \nhappened. We will be denying struggling Americans and businesses \nanother source of energy that will put further downward pressure on \nenergy prices. We can have only one effect to produce the greatest \nsupply and to help contain the price of oil. Whatever the price of oil \nis, it will be less with Keystone Pipeline than if we didn't have that \nsource from the Keystone Pipeline in Canada.\n  This will make us more dependent on foreign suppliers, many of which \nare not our friends. Canada is our friend, our best trading partner in \nthe world, perhaps our best ally in the world. It is already causing \ngreat frustration with our friends in Canada.\n  I met with the Canadian parliamentarians. Last year we had a meeting. \nI was surprised how deeply they felt about this. They were hurt. They \ncannot understand why we can't get this done. It is such a commonsense \nthing to them.\n  Some of our Democratic colleagues argue our economy will not be \naffected by the agenda, the President's Climate Action Plan. Others \nacknowledge the cost but justify this as a speed bump and not \nsignificant. Congress represents most closely the people of the United \nStates, and Congress has never voted to give unelected bureaucrats and \nofficials the power to regulate CO2. We are not close to \ndoing that today. It would never pass this Congress, either House or \nSenate. There is zero chance it would pass if it was actually voted on.\n  As long as Congress has decided not to act, how can EPA act? It is \nacting against the wishes of the American people and the interests of \nthe country. It takes the consensus of the American people to move \nlarge and costly legislation such as this, hundreds of billions, \ntrillions of dollars. That consensus is not formed. It is not there.\n  On Keystone and other key issues, the consensus is against government \nexcess, not for the government to do more. Talk to the American people. \nLook at the polling data. Someday maybe things will change, it is true, \nI will acknowledge. Temperatures could start to rise significantly and \nstorms\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\ncould begin to worsen. But as long as the measured data fails to match \nthe alarmists' climate models, I believe Congress should approve this \npipeline and reject the agenda of the climate alarmists and conduct a \npolicy that is beneficial to the people of our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I know the ranking member had \nintended to offer an amendment on behalf of one of her colleagues, and \nshe is off the floor right now. I want to respect the understanding we \nhad, but I also want to respect that the Senator from Vermont is here \nand I believe prepared to speak to his amendment. I just want to \nacknowledge that Senator Cantwell intended to offer a couple of \namendments.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 23 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment to call up my amendment, amendment No. 23, the Ten Million \nSolar Roofs Act, and it be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Menendez, and Mr. Whitehouse, proposes an amendment numbered \n     23 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the quantity of solar photovoltaic electricity by \n providing rebates for the purchase and installation of an additional \n                10,000,000 photovoltaic systems by 2025)\n\n       After section 2, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. REBATES FOR PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF \n                   PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Photovoltaic system.--The term ``photovoltaic system'' \n     includes--\n       (A) solar panels;\n       (B) roof support structures;\n       (C) inverters;\n       (D) an energy storage system, if the energy storage system \n     is integrated with the photovoltaic system; and\n       (E) any other hardware necessary for the installation of a \n     photovoltaic system.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n       (b) Rebates for Purchase and Installation of Photovoltaic \n     Systems.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a program \n     under which the Secretary shall provide rebates to eligible \n     individuals or entities for the purchase and installation of \n     photovoltaic systems for residential and commercial \n     properties in order to install, over the 10-year period \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, not less than \n     an additional 10,000,000 photovoltaic systems in the United \n     States (as compared to the number of photovoltaic systems \n     installed in the United States as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act) with a cumulative capacity of not less than 60,000 \n     megawatts.\n       (2) Eligibility.--\n       (A) In general.--To be eligible for a rebate under this \n     subsection--\n       (i) the recipient of the rebate shall be a homeowner, \n     business, nonprofit entity, or State or local government that \n     purchased and installed a photovoltaic system for a property \n     located in the United States; and\n       (ii) the recipient of the rebate shall meet such other \n     eligibility criteria as are determined to be appropriate by \n     the Secretary.\n       (B) Other entities.--After public review and comment, the \n     Secretary may identify other individuals or entities located \n     in the United States that qualify for a rebate under this \n     subsection.\n       (3) Amount.--Subject to paragraph (4)(B) and the \n     availability of appropriations under subsection (c), the \n     amount of a rebate provided to an eligible individual or \n     entity for the purchase and installation of a photovoltaic \n     system for a property under this subsection shall be equal to \n     the lesser of--\n       (A) 15 percent of the initial capital costs for purchasing \n     and installing the photovoltaic system, including costs for \n     hardware, permitting and other ``soft costs'', and \n     installation; or\n       (B) $10,000.\n       (4) Intermediate report.--As soon as practicable after the \n     end of the 5-year period beginning on the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress, and publish on the website of the \n     Department of Energy, a report that describes--\n       (A) the number of photovoltaic systems for residential and \n     commercial properties purchased and installed with rebates \n     provided under this subsection; and\n       (B) any steps the Secretary will take to ensure that the \n     goal of the installation of an additional 10,000,000 \n     photovoltaic systems in the United States is achieved by \n     2025.\n       (5) Relationship to other law.--The authority provided \n     under this subsection shall be in addition to any other \n     authority under which credits or other types of financial \n     assistance are provided for installation of a photovoltaic \n     system for a property.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, it goes without saying I disagree with \nmy good friend from Alabama in terms of his assessment of the climate \nsituation. To my mind, the scientific community, the overwhelming \nmajority of scientists have made it clear that climate change is real, \ncaused by human activity, is already causing devastating problems in \nour country and around the world, that we have a limited opportunity to \ntry to transform our energy system so a bad situation does not become \nmuch worse. One of the ways we transform our energy system is by moving \nto such sustainable energies as wind, solar, geothermal, and others.\n  What this amendment does is propose to create over the next 10 years \n10 million solar rooftops in this country--a massive effort to expand \nsolar energy in this country by giving a rebate on new solar systems. \nAs we all know, the solar industry is booming. We are seeing \nsignificant increases in the number of people who are using solar. \nToday there are more than 13,000 megawatts of operating solar capacity, \nnearly half a million photovoltaic systems.\n  We have made real progress in recent years. But we have a long way to \ngo, and that is what this legislation would do. I wanted to say a word \nabout an article that appeared in many of the papers today which I \nthink is pretty scary stuff.\n  It talks about the Koch brothers being prepared to spend almost $1 \nbillion in 2016 in order to bring forward their very rightwing agenda. \nWhen we hear these numbers about one family--the second wealthiest \nfamily in America, extreme rightwing family--prepared to spend almost \n$1 billion in the coming elections, I think the American people have to \nask whether the foundations of American democracy have been uprooted \nand whether in fact we are moving to an oligarchic form of society. As \nmany people know, what oligarchy is about is when you have very wealthy \nand powerful people controlling what goes on.\n  What the history of America presumably has been about is ordinary \npeople determining what happens in our country. Ordinary people elect \nMembers of the House and elect Members of the Senate. Now what we have \nis one family worth some $85 billion prepared to spend in the next \nelection almost as much as Obama spent and almost as much as Romney \nspent in the last Presidential election.\n  My guess is in the coming years what we are going to see is the major \nand most effective and most powerful political party in America is not \nthe Republican Party. It is not the Democratic Party. It is the Koch \nbrothers party. They already have assembled, as I understand it, a \npolitical database which has more information than the Republican Party \ndatabase.\n  We have to take a very hard look at what is going on and determine \nwhether this is what we believe our democracy should be--a billionaire \nfamily with more power than either the Democratic or Republican \nParties.\n  In the last election the Republican candidate for President, Mitt \nRomney, spent about $446 million from his campaign committee--about \nhalf of what the Koch network plans to spend next year. President Obama \nspent $715 million in 2012 from his campaign committee. The difference \nis that Obama and Romney raised significant sums of money from people \nall over the country, people who may have contributed 50 bucks or 100 \nbucks, and now we have one family preparing to spend almost as much \nmoney as either Obama or Romney spent, and that is a frightening \nsituation. It tells me loudly and clearly that we must overturn this \ndisastrous Supreme Court decision called Citizens United.\n\n\n                          Rebuild America Act\n\n  Madam President, today I have introduced legislation that calls for a \n$1 trillion investment to rebuild our collapsing infrastructure; that \nis, our\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\nroads, bridges, wastewater plants, water systems, dams, levees, rail, \nairports.\n  Everybody in the Senate and I hope everybody in America understands \nthat our infrastructure is collapsing. We can't avoid dealing with this \nissue. We can't turn our backs on this issue. I am a former mayor, and \nwhat I can say is that infrastructure does not get better when we \nignore it. It gets worse, and it becomes more expensive to fix.\n  For most of our history the United States proudly led the world in \nbuilding innovative infrastructure, from inland canals to the \ntranscontinental railroad. We implemented huge flood-control projects \nand embarked on an ambitious rural electrification program. We built \nmodern airports and the Interstate Highway System. In terms of \ninfrastructure, we were the envy of the world. Sadly, that is no longer \nthe case.\n  Today the United States spends just 2.4 percent of GDP on \ninfrastructure--less than at any point in the past 20 years. Europe \nspends twice that amount, and China spends close to four times our \nrate. We are falling further and further behind, and that is not where \nthe United States of America should be.\n  Today we are 12th in the world in terms of the quality of our \ninfrastructure when we used to be No. 1. One out of every nine bridges \nin our country is structurally deficient and nearly one-quarter are \nfunctionally obsolete. Almost one-third of our roads are in poor or \nmediocre condition, and more than 42 percent of urban highways are \ncongested. Urban and suburban transit systems are struggling to address \ndeferred maintenance even as ridership steadily increases.\n  No one argues about the need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. \nWhen we do that, we get an additional bonus because if we invest $1 \ntrillion over a 5-year period, we can create 13 million decent-paying \njobs, and that is exactly what we should be doing. Real unemployment \ntoday is not 5.6 percent, it is 11 percent. Youth unemployment is 18 \npercent. African-American youth unemployment is 30 percent. We need to \ncreate millions of decent-paying jobs, and the best way we can do that \nis by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \nset aside and that I be permitted to proceed as in morning business for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       529 College Savings Plans\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, in President Obama's State of the Union \nAddress last week, he outlined an agenda focused on what he called \nmiddle-class economics, which he described as providing Americans with \nthe ``tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams \nwill take them.''\n  Our country thrives when hard-working Americans prosper. The \nPresident was right to praise policies, such as the GI bill and Social \nSecurity, that have helped us to do just that. That is why I am \nperplexed at the President's proposal to tax the earnings of 529 \ncollege savings plan accounts. Rather than help American families meet \nthe onerous cost of a college education, this new tax would greatly \ndiminish the benefits of a law that is helping millions of parents plan \nfor their children's futures. The President's proposal undermines the \nvery values we should be promoting--families making sacrifices today in \norder to better provide for their children tomorrow. The President's \nplan would also lead to more student loan debt for many young people at \na time when concern over the level of debt is rising.\n  I would also note that the President has proposed eliminating the tax \ndeduction on interest on student loan payments.\n  One of the first questions new parents ask themselves is how they \nwill be able to pay for their children's education. For the past 14 \nyears the 529 accounts have been an important part of the answer. They \nhave allowed parents to save for their children's education in tax-\nadvantaged accounts. Regular, affordable contributions made with after-\ntax dollars from their paychecks grow over time. When college years \nstart, those savings and the earnings from their investments can be \nwithdrawn tax free for educational expenses. These small sacrifices \nmade from paycheck to paycheck can have an enormous impact, making real \nthe dream of higher education.\n  Parents know that receiving a college degree greatly improves their \nchild's future earnings potential. In fact, according to data compiled \nby the U.S. Census Bureau in the year 2011, individuals with college \ndegrees earn approximately $1 million more over the course of their \ncareers than do workers with high school diplomas. Census data also \nshowed that people with higher levels of education are more likely to \nbe employed full time year-round. College graduates also tend to have \naccess to more specialized jobs that, in turn, yield higher wages.\n  Critics of the 529 plans assert that they disproportionately benefit \nvery high-income families who could afford to pay for college without \nthe tax-free growth in these dedicated savings accounts. Data from the \nCollege Savings Foundation, however, counters this assertion. According \nto the foundation, the average value in one of these 529 accounts is \n$19,774. Additionally, the average contribution to accounts that \nreceive regular electronic contributions, such as those coming from \npaycheck withholding, is just $175 a month. That is clearly more in \nline with hard-working families trying to make ends meet than with \naffluent families who enjoy significant disposable income.\n  My home State provides a great example of the benefits of the 529 \nlaw. After this law was passed in 2001, thousands of Maine families \nestablished these accounts, but then came a powerful extra incentive. \nIn 2008 the Harold Alfond Foundation, which was established by one of \nMaine's greatest philanthropists, created the Harold Alfond College \nChallenge. This program now provides a $500 contribution to the college \nsavings account of every baby born in Maine. To date, some 23,000 Maine \nfamilies have used this generous gift to begin planning for the future \neducation of their children. As their parents' own contributions are \nadded to the account, the future becomes even brighter for these \nchildren and for our State. As the children grow and make their own \ncontributions from afterschool and summer jobs, so too grows their \nappreciation of financial responsibility and self-reliance.\n  The President says his proposal is driven in part by the need to \nsimplify the Tax Code. Our Tax Code certainly needs simplification, and \nI hope that becomes a major accomplishment of this Congress. But the \nquestion must be asked--how does creating a difference between the 529 \ncontributions already made, which would remain untaxed, and new \ncontributions, which would be taxed, simplify anything? And perhaps \nmore to the point, in addition to simplification, our Tax Code needs \npredictability.\n  Before I joined the Senate, I was employed at Husson University in \nBangor, ME--an outstanding institution that has a high percentage of \nstudents who are the very first in their families to attend college. \nEvery day, I saw how hard parents and students worked, how many \nsacrifices they made in order to make higher education a reality.\n  My experience at Husson is the chief reason why one of the very first \nbills I introduced in this Chamber was the College Affordability and \nAccess Act. That bill called for creating tax-preferred education \nsavings account--the precursor to the Coverdell savings accounts--tax \nincentives for employer-provided educational assistance, and a tax \ndeduction for student loan interest. Many provisions of that bill are \nnow law but would also be harmed by the President's proposal.\n  The 529 college savings plan program channels the determination that \nI saw while working at Husson University and that exists throughout our \ngreat country into a tangible benefit built upon the virtues of saving \nand planning for the future. Changing the tax rules for the 529 \naccounts would break a promise to families across this country who are \nworking hard to save for their children's educations to help them \nattain a brighter future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in working to make college more \naccessible and more affordable and to save the 529 college savings plan \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\n  I thank the sponsors and managers of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise and thank my colleague from \nMaine for bringing up this very important issue. I would like her to \nknow that I join with her in a concern that has been raised with the \nPresident and this proposal.\n  As the mom of two young men who are just finishing their years in \ncollege--I have one who graduated last year and one who will graduate \nin May. Very early on we participated in the 529 plan that was offered \nin the State of Alaska.\n  In fact, in my early years as a State legislator, it was my \nlegislation in the Statehouse that set up the University of Alaska 529 \nCollege Savings Plan, and our boys were direct beneficiaries of that, \nif you will, because it allowed us, as parents, to begin our savings in \na way we knew, when it came time for them to go to schools, we would be \nas prepared as we could be at that point in time.\n  I don't think any family is ever really prepared, particularly for \nthe extraordinary costs of higher education. We were fortunate in that \nour sons chose to attend schools that were not some of the most \nexpensive schools in the country--they attended State universities--but \nwhat we paid as a family for their college education, and having two \nboys in college at the same time puts a stress on families that is very \nreal. So the suggestion that somehow these 529s benefit a very limited \ngroup of families across the Nation, I think, belies the obvious.\n  I think we all try to do the best we can by our kids, and saving for \ntheir future when they are very young is important.\n  So when we have these programs that will allow and encourage families \nto do this, knowing there will be a tax benefit, it is important. It is \nimportant for the families, it is important for the young people \nlooking to their opportunities in college and, hopefully, when they \ncomplete their college education, they are not bearing these incredibly \ncrushing financial burdens.\n  Again, I applaud the efforts of my colleague and I look forward to \nworking with her on this very important issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FUNDING OF CLIMATE \n                   CHANGE ADAPTATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) President Obama has committed $3,000,000,000 from the \n     United States to the Green Climate Fund, with the objective \n     of helping developing countries deal with the impacts of \n     climate change and advancing mitigation efforts;\n       (2) many communities in the United States, including many \n     rural and indigenous communities, face social and economic \n     challenges that rival those in developing countries and are \n     also being impacted by climate change;\n       (3) these communities include indigenous and traditional \n     communities in the Arctic region of the United States;\n       (4) similar opportunities for adaptation projects exist \n     across rural and other vulnerable communities in the United \n     States; and\n       (5) the United States should prioritize and fund adaptation \n     projects in vulnerable communities in the United States, \n     including rural and indigenous communities, while also \n     helping to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation in \n     developing countries.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, in very brief format, this amendment is \nabout recognizing that global warming is having an impact on some of \nthe poorest countries around the world, and that the United States \nshould work with these nations in terms of helping them address some of \nthose consequences. But the amendment also notes that we have \ncommunities in the United States that are poor and struggling with the \nimpacts of climate change and that we should give much attention to \nhelping those communities address the impacts as well and that these \ntwo issues--helping poor countries around the world and helping \ncommunities within the United States--are not in conflict with each \nother in that we should be doing both of these things.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 125 to Amendment No. 2\n\n       (Purpose: To eliminate unnecessary tax subsidies and \n     provide infrastructure funding.)\n\n  I wish to call up a second amendment, so I ask unanimous consent to \nset aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 125.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this amendment recognizes that \nconstruction jobs can play a key role in strengthening our economy, and \nnot just strengthening our economy with current jobs but rebuilding \ninfrastructure or building new infrastructure that will facilitate a \nvery successful economy in the future.\n  This particular amendment proposes that we not create 4,000 \nconstruction jobs in the pipeline but that we create 400,000 jobs \nrebuilding key infrastructure in a variety of ways across our Nation.\n  I think as we wrestle with both the current economy and the strength \nof the future economy, this is an idea well worth considering.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 131 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 131.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself and \n     Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 131 to amendment \n     No. 2.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that if the Keystone XL Pipeline is built, it will \n  be built safely and in compliance with United States environmental \n                                 laws)\n\n       In section 2(a), strike the period at the end and insert \n     the following:\n     , subject to--\n       (1) all applicable laws (including regulations);\n       (2) all mitigation measures that are required in permits \n     issued by permitting agencies; and\n       (3) all project-specific special conditions listed in \n     Appendix Z of the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact \n     Statement issued by the Secretary of State in January 2014.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, as my colleague said, we are going \nback and forth on offering amendments to this bill and I hope this \nprocess will lead us toward getting this bill wrapped up. I know many \nof my colleagues have been talking about various aspects of this \nlegislation, and this particular amendment focuses on making sure that \nif this project goes forward that we meet certain environmental \nstandards.\n  I can't say how important that is because the first serious delay in \nthe approval process came because a bad route was selected. The \npipeline was\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\noriginally proposed to go through an aquifer that is critically \nimportant to a large percentage of agriculture in the area. So this is \nvery important to me, and that was a very glaring example that we need \nto get this right.\n  What was wrong then is that Congress was set to intervene and \nbasically say the State Department was wrong and just go ahead and \napprove this pipeline. So I feel we are about at that same point again \nin saying just forget the administrative process and let us go ahead \nand deem this approved. So if Congress, rather than the administration, \napproves this pipeline, the American people will lose all the \nprotections and conditions attached as part of the national interest \ndetermination.\n  Just so people understand, according to Executive Order 13337, the \nState Department can require permits to contain ``such terms and \nconditions as the national interest may . . . require.'' So the \nPresident can decide a pipeline is in the national interest if it is \nconstructed to meet those specific standards.\n  In this case, the State Department's environmental impact statement \noutlined hundreds of conditions that should be met to ensure the \npipeline is built to the highest safety standard. To quote the \nenvironmental impact statement:\n\n       If the proposed Project is determined to serve the national \n     interest . . . the applicant would be required to abide by \n     certain conditions listed in this Supplemental EIS and the \n     Presidential Permit.\n\n  So these conditions, or mitigation measures, as the report refers to \nthem, are compiled in one section of the report and it highlights the \nmeasures TransCanada needs to take to deal with and reduce the impacts \nwhen they are operating this pipeline. These are higher standards for \nenvironmental and public safety that the company would be obligated to \nmeet.\n  The problem is the bill before us would authorize the pipeline \nwithout those mechanisms and without those conditions. If TransCanada \ndeclined to meet these conditions, there would be no legal recourse for \nthe injured parties to take TransCanada to court.\n  I wish to talk about those conditions that are included in the \nenvironmental impact statement so that my colleagues understand what we \nare talking about when they say they would vote to bypass this process. \nI will give three examples of the conditions included in the \nenvironmental impact statement.\n  First, along the proposed pipeline there are areas where the terrain \nis fragile. There has been a lot of discussion of the Sand Hills region \nof Nebraska and how difficult it would be to site a pipeline on those \nvery fragile sandy soils. The Sand Hills are so fragile that the \ncurrent route goes around them just to compensate. However, in southern \nSouth Dakota and northern Nebraska, there are areas that, according to \nthe environmental impact statement, ``exhibit conditions similar to the \nSand Hills Region and are very susceptible to wind erosion.''\n  Let me read from the appendix about how TransCanada would be required \nto operate the pipeline in those areas.\n\n       This document proves site-specific reclamation plans that \n     itemize construction, erosion control, and revegetation \n     procedures for those fragile areas . . . To reduce the \n     potential impacts related to severe wind and water and \n     erosion, the following summary . . . of best management \n     practices would be implemented during construction, \n     reclamation and post-construction.\n\n  This document then goes on to list 16 specific bullet points outlined \nthat TransCanada must meet. These conditions for the Sand Hills-like \narea along the route include: avoiding wetlands, avoiding erosion-prone \nareas such as ridgetops, working with landowners to build fences to \nprevent livestock from the construction, providing compensation to \nlandowners who need to let pastures rest until vegetation can be \nreestablished.\n  Most people would agree TransCanada should do these things. I think \nthe American people would say follow the rules and do the things that \nare required. It makes sense to do these things for the protection of \nour environment and vulnerable areas and for the landowners whose \nlivelihoods depend on the land around the pipeline. But if S. 1 became \nlaw, the State Department would not have the authority to ensure the \nthings I just mentioned--that they build the fences, they compensate \nthe ranchers as outlined, and the conditions be required that the State \nDepartment has laid out.\n  So the State Department, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and \nTransCanada are working on a plan to ensure the protection of \nendangered species along the pipeline route and these important things \nare part of what we want to see addressed. Implementation of an \nagreement that is designed to avoid harm to these species is what we \nare trying to make sure of if the President has the authority to issue \na permit.\n  In contrast, the bill we are considering, S. 1, exempts the pipeline \nfrom further review under the Endangered Species Act. According to the \nState Department, the process that is now underway to establish these \nimplementing agreements to protect these vulnerable species would \nstop--would stop--if this bill became law.\n  Finally, the conditions would require TransCanada to improve its \nsafety standards. And my colleagues may not know that TransCanada \nreceived a ``warning letter'' from the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterials Safety Administration for violating pipeline safety \nregulations over a year and a half ago. As outlined in a September 26, \n2013, letter from the administration:\n\n       TransCanada experienced a high rejection rate for welding \n     and failed to use properly qualify welders.\n\n  So in 1 week alone, 72 percent of TransCanada's welds had to be \nreplaced. After TransCanada's shoddy work came to light, the State \nDepartment added 2 new safety conditions to the 57 conditions that the \nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration had already \nrequired.\n  One of those conditions required TransCanada to hire a third-party \ncontractor to monitor pipeline construction and report back to the U.S. \nGovernment whether that construction is sound.\n  So this new condition was that TransCanada adopt a quality management \nprogram to ensure ``this pipeline is--from the beginning--built to the \nhighest standards by both the Keystone personnel and its many \ncontractors.'' But if this legislation is approved, this pipeline and \nall the conditions I just mentioned fall away. That is why I do believe \nthat, with this legislation, we are acting prematurely. So I am \noffering this amendment.\n\n  Last week we had a very big reminder that pipeline spills do happen \nwhen 30,000 gallons of oil spilled into the Yellowstone River in \nMontana--not the first spill into that river, unfortunately.\n  So I ask my colleagues, why would we continue on a process without \nmaking sure that TransCanada follows the established safety issues on \npipelines and we make sure that they comply with these environmental \nlaws?\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this amendment. I \nhope my colleagues will stand with 61 percent of the American people \nwho believe that due process is more important than special interests.\n  Madam President, I yield to my colleague from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we have a number of amendments \npending on both sides of the aisle and there are other Senators who are \nworking with us to offer them tonight.

Madam President, earlier this week--actually, yesterday \nand today--the Department of the Interior announced a plan that will \nallow the permitting in 2017 for offshore oil and gas drilling off the \nOuter Continental Shelf of our beautiful east coast.\n  The concern we have with this measure is not unlike the concern my \nfriends may have in Alaska, with steps taken by the administration that \nactually limit the true potential of these regions. Like Alaska, we \nhave a number of opportunities for offshore oil and\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nnatural gas drilling that have not been exploited in the past, and I am \nafraid that under the current course and speed of the administration's \naction, they will not be fully exploited to the benefit of North \nCarolinians and many east coast States.\n  That is why Senator Burr and I have sponsored an amendment that \ndirects the administration to take more decisive and more comprehensive \naction so we can seize the opportunity for North Carolina and many of \nour neighbor States.\n  The main reason we are doing this is because I think North Carolina \nand the east coast can do their part to make our Nation an energy super \npower. We can also have enormously positive impact on our economy as we \nmove forward. This slide depicts some of the initial estimates for the \neconomic impact that we could have by simply directing the Department \nof the Interior to issue leases and to allow exploration and ultimately \nextraction off the coast.\n  This graphic gives us an idea, from Delaware down to Florida, of the \npotential jobs creation. We can see that in North Carolina that is \n55,000 jobs. It is 55,000 jobs in some of the hardest hit areas of \nNorth Carolina, where people are out of work, and the unemployment rate \nis well above the State average. It is a jobs creation opportunity that \nwe are just waiting to be able to provide to the States with the \nultimate authority to decide whether they are going to move forward.\n  In terms of the economic impact, it is over $190 billion in capital \ninvestment and nearly $51 billion in revenue to the Federal Government \nand to State governments between 2017 and 2035.\n  This opportunity is something that I hope doesn't go without the full \nefforts of the State to actually determine how we can do it in an \nenvironmentally responsible way.\n  I was speaker of the house before I came into this great body, and we \ntook the steps to put into place a regulatory framework to allow \npotential natural gas drilling within the State of North Carolina. We \ndid it in a very responsible way, and we did it in a way that made sure \nstakeholders had the opportunity--environmentalists, business people, \ntravel and tourism--so we make sure we get it right. I believe we have \nlaid the groundwork with the State. Now we want to do the same thing \nfor the opportunity that we have near the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  The process will involve the input of several stakeholders. It will \ninvolve the input of environmentalists and key stakeholders across the \nState to make sure we get this right. Ultimately, it gives the States \nthe right to determine whether they want to pursue this--from Florida \nto Delaware.\n  The other thing it does is addresses a number of concerns I heard \nwhen I was a legislator and since I was speaker. It has to do with one \nof the greatest assets we have in North Carolina; that is North \nCarolina's beautiful coast.\n  This is a picture of a North Carolina beach today. It is beautiful. \nIt is why we have millions of people come visit our coast every year. \nBased on our amendment, this is a picture of how that same beach will \nlook after we authorize drilling and we are actually creating those \njobs. It is that same beautiful beach because we have taken the steps \nto make sure that any drilling would be beyond the sight line of our \nbeautiful beaches. I believe, as a result, we will have travel and \ntourism on our side because those jobs create additional opportunity to \nexpand opportunities for travel and tourism.\n  Then, finally, I want to talk about what good the revenue to the \nState can do for this very same area. We desperately need increased \ninfrastructure in the eastern part of our State. We desperately need \nfunds to renourish our beaches, and we desperately need funds to clear \nour inlet and outfit our ports so that North Carolina can play a part \nin the new shipping patterns that will occur post-Panama Canal upgrade.\n  So in terms of economics, it is fairly simple. We are looking for \nabout 50 percent of a revenue share, with 37 percent of that going to \nthe States and for the effective regions for items such as inlet \nclearing and beach renourishment.\n  We are also looking to have 12.5 percent of the revenues dedicated to \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund so we can continue the good work \nof setting aside irreplaceable lands and increase outdoor recreation \nactivities.\n  I believe this is an opportunity for North Carolina to do its part to \nmake America the energy super power that we need it to be, to improve \nour economy in North Carolina, and to contribute to improving the \neconomy of this great Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the subject matter of these two \namendments is, No. 1, the Canadian oil company that wants to build a \npipeline through our country right now is exempt from having to pay \ntaxes into the oilspill liability trust fund. In other words, if there \nis an actual accident in the United States, if the oil pipe breaks or \nsomething happens, the Canadians will not have paid into the oilspill \nliability trust fund the way every American pipeline company has to do.\n  So my first amendment would just say that they cannot be exempt from \nthat, and the hundreds of millions of dollars which they are \nresponsible for would have to be put into the trust fund.\n  The second amendment is an extreme weather amendment. That amendment \nwould call for a requirement and analysis of the impact that global \nwarming would have from the tar sands pollution and would require that \nwe have that scientific analysis just so that we can understand it and \nits impact on extreme weather events in the United States and across \nthe planet.\n  We would need both of those amendments to be debated in order to make\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\nsure we fully understand the implications of what is being debated \nhere.\n  Finally, I wish to say that I note Senator Cruz from Texas has an \namendment which would almost automatically approve any natural gas \nexports that were going to any WTO country in the world. I think that \nis a very bad stance for the Senate to take.\n  We have to debate what the impact of the exportation of natural gas \non a mass basis is going to be on the price of natural gas here in the \nUnited States--the price that utilities are going to have to pay for \nnatural gas to generate electricity, the speed with which we will be \nable to transform our automotive sector from oil over to natural gas, \nthe impact on the petrochemical industry and other industries that are \nnow increasingly using low-priced natural gas in our country. We also \nhave to deal with the fact that the Energy Information Agency says that \nthe already-approved export of natural gas will lead to a more than 50-\npercent increase in domestic natural gas prices for Americans at home.\n  I understand why the natural gas industry wants to do it, but I think \nwe have to have a big debate here in Congress over the impact that \nthose natural gas imports are going to have, especially if they are \napproved automatically if they are heading to any WTO country in the \nworld.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I just wish to speak briefly to this \namendment, which I hope might help answer the mystery as to why the \nfirst order of business of the new majority in the Senate is S. 1, a \nbill that allows a foreign corporation to run a pipeline across our \ncountry, seizing American farms and ranches along the way. That would \nnot ordinarily seem to be our country's first and highest order of \nbusiness given all of the issues that we face.\n  We have seen news reports just today that the legendary Koch brothers \nare gearing up to spend $900 million in the coming election. We have \nseen news reports that compare their political operation to the \nRepublican National Committee's political operation--favorably to the \nKoch brothers as having a bigger political operation.\n  We know that since Citizens United there has been a torrent of \ncorporate money poured into our elections, and a great deal of it has \ncome from the fossil fuel industry. We know also that beside that \ntorrent of disclosed money has been another torrent of dark money that \nhas poured into our elections. We don't know quite where that has come \nfrom, but there are plenty of reasons to suspect and to suggest that \nmoney has also come from the fossil fuel industry.\n  So we have a situation right now where I think reasonable people \ncould look at the facts and draw a sensible inference that the \nRepublican Party has been acquired by the fossil fuel industry as its \npolitical subsidiary. If that were the case, then that might be an \nexplanation of why S. 1 does this extraordinary service to a foreign \ncorporation at peril to all of the American farms and ranches and \nfamilies whose land would be taken from them in order to give this \nforeign corporation this great boon.\n  This amendment would require that companies that will make more than \n$1 million off of the Keystone Pipeline should meet the disclosure \nobligations that we have voted on before in the Senate. These are \ndisclosure obligations that Republican Senators have often supported in \nthe past.\n  Indeed, until 2010 and until the Citizens United decision actually \nshowed where the money was coming from and to whom it was going, one of \nthe most ardent and eloquent advocates for disclosure was none other \nthan the distinguished Senator from Kentucky who is now our majority \nleader. So it would not seem to be out of place to ask for a little bit \nof disclosure, a little bit of transparency, about where the political \ncontributions went from the corporations that are going to make so much \nmoney from this, whether it is more than $1 million made off the \npipeline or whether it is opening up the tar sands and having tar sands \nleases.\n  So I hope we will have a chance to vote on this, and if we are in \nfavor of transparency and disclosure and voters understanding what is \ngoing on around here, this ought to be an amendment we ought to be able \nto support.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. First of all, I want to say how good it is to see the \nPresiding Officer, and also recognize that he is a member of the \nnascent Cory caucus, and I respect that quite a bit.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 155 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to call up amendment No. 155.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Booker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 155 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To allow permitting agencies to consider new circumstances \n                          and new information)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following:\n       (f) Environmental Impact Statement Savings Clause.--Nothing \n     in subsection (b) relieves any Federal agency of the \n     obligation of the Federal agency to comply with the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), \n     including the obligation of the Federal agency to prepare a \n     supplement to the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact \n     Statement described in subsection (b) in connection with the \n     issuance of any permit or authorization needed to construct, \n     connect, operate, or maintain the pipeline and cross-border \n     facilities described in subsection (a) if there are \n     significant new circumstances or information relevant to \n     environmental concerns and bearing on the environmental \n     impacts resulting from the construction, connection, \n     operation, and maintenance of the pipeline and cross-border \n     facilities, including from greenhouse gas emissions \n     associated with the crude oil being transported by the \n     pipeline.\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want to say that amendment No. 155 is a \nvery important amendment. It is common sense. It is practical. The \nNational Environmental Policy Act, NEPA as it is known, is one of the \nmost emulated statutes in the world. It is something that many people \nsee as valuable in other countries because NEPA, in fact, by many is \nreferred to as the modern-day environmental Magna Carta.\n  NEPA regulations require agencies to supplement already-issued \nenvironmental impact statements when significant new circumstances or \ninformation is found to exist relating to the environmental impact of a \nproject. The pending Keystone bill, however--and quite surprisingly--\nwould deem the final environmental impact statement issued last January \nto fully satisfy this NEPA requirement going ahead. This would remove \nthe obligation from permitting agencies to supplement any environmental \nimpact statements if significant new circumstances or information is \ndiscovered.\n  This amendment I am putting forward, No. 155, would change that and \nwould preserve a commonsense obligation of agencies to supplement the \nenvironmental impact statement for significant new circumstances or \ninformation. In other words, if very pertinent information comes \nforward, it would require there be a need to supplement the \nenvironmental impact statement.\n  For example, if the proposed route of the pipeline were changed, it \ncould mean that drinking water supplies or critical resources would \nhave a higher risk of contamination from a spill. This amendment would \nsimply require consideration of significant changes so we don't go \nblindly and put natural resources at greater risk without understanding \nthe impact.\n  This bill is for me common sense. It says, basically, if \ncircumstances change, we should make sure a new environmental impact \nstudy is considered.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment and not provide \nspecial treatment to a foreign company that American companies don't \nget that could result in harm to fellow Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 102\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pledge my \noverwhelming support to Senator Tillis on the Outer Continental Shelf \namendment that has been placed on the Keystone bill, and I think it is \napparent with the direction the administration is going that they \nfinally realize this is the right thing, but I think codifying that \ninto this bill is important.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 92 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  I also come today because many of my colleagues in this body support \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. Just to remind some who might not \nhave been here as long, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was \ncreated and funded by royalties off of this exploration explosion we \nhave had over decades in this country.\n  I might say a disappointment to me is that over the life of this \ntrust fund we created, it never received the appropriations that it \naccrued in a balance. It accrues a certain amount off of royalties and \nit was directed in statute that money goes to fund the Land and\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\nWater Conservation Fund. Let me say to my colleagues, this is the best \norganization to choose where to make that investment. This is not about \na land grab; this is about providing contiguous pieces of land that \nhave restored value. But this is not about initiatives to create new \nnational parks. It is to protect the infrastructure that is out there \nin their control, and we have battled for years.\n  I would love to come to the floor right now and say I want to offer \nan amendment for full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nwhich should be $900 million a year, but we appropriate $350 million to \n$450 million a year to fund it.\n  Unfortunately I am not here to offer that amendment, although I think \nit would receive tremendous support in this body, primarily because I \nwould have to find about $8 billion worth of offsets. This is \nincredible, that we could have a trust fund that is funded with the \nroyalties off of production that has an $8 billion balance but to \nactually say if we are going to begin to fully fund it, you have to \ncome up with $8 billion worth of offsets because we spent the money on \nsomething else. We spent the money on something else, therefore we have \ngot to find an offset.\n  So I am not coming to the floor today to propose we fully fund it, \nalthough I am an advocate of it, and I think many people are.\n  In a minute I will ask unanimous consent to have amendment No. 92 \npending, which is the Burr-Bennet-Ayotte amendment. It is to \npermanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I am sure the President is aware that the program expires the end of \nSeptember, and we can wait, but I don't think we should wait to \nreauthorize what I believe is, dollar for dollar, the most effective \ngovernment program we have. We can save any kind of funding-level \nfights for another day. The simple truth is this program is a trust \nfund that is codified in law. So we are not debating whether this \nexists or doesn't exist. It does exist and every year $900 million in \nroyalties are paid by energy companies that drill for gas or oil in the \nOuter Continental Shelf and are put into this fund, but for some \nreason, that group, that conservation effort, only finds what the \nappropriators are willing to pass on to it.\n  Our amendment would reauthorize the program itself on a permanent \nbasis, and I am going to ask all of my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment to call up amendment No. 92.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina, [Mr. Burr] for himself, \n     Ms. Ayotte, and Mr. Bennet, proposes an amendment numbered 92 \n     to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. BURR.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding climate change and \n                            infrastructure)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE AND \n                   INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) climate change is already impacting the safety and \n     reliability of the critical infrastructure systems of the \n     United States, including buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, \n     rail, ports, airports, levees, dams, and military \n     installations through sea level rise, rising temperatures, \n     and more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as \n     droughts, floods, wildfires, and heat waves;\n       (2) significant energy, industrial and transportation \n     infrastructure in the United States is located near the \n     coast, in floodplains, or in other areas vulnerable to sea \n     level rise;\n       (3) the impacts to infrastructure described in paragraph \n     (1) have caused tangible economic costs that are likely to \n     increase over time;\n       (4) it is fiscally prudent to prepare for and seek to \n     mitigate the impacts described in paragraph (1), as it is \n     estimated that every dollar spent on mitigation saves $4 in \n     disaster relief;\n       (5) the Federal Government self-insures, offers insurance \n     programs such as crop insurance and the national flood \n     insurance program, and, in the case of extreme weather \n     events, also serves as the insurer of last resort for public \n     and private infrastructure;\n       (6) the Federal Government has a crucial role to play as a \n     partner in working with State, local, tribal, and territorial \n     jurisdictions to help ensure coordinated efforts to keep \n     communities resilient;\n       (7) the role of the Federal Government should include \n     prioritizing climate resilient projects when administering \n     Federal grants, providing technical support, and sharing of \n     data and information in user-friendly and accessible formats, \n     among other actions;\n       (8) Federal agency climate change adaptation plans that \n     assess the risk to physical assets and missions of the \n     Federal agencies can help create savings for taxpayers; and\n       (9) Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, \n     should quantify the economic value of the physical risks of \n     the agencies from climate change.\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, this amendment recognizes that climate \nchange is not a hoax, that climate change is a reality, and that we \nneed to do some things together to begin to plan for and prepare for \nthe inevitable consequences and impacts on our infrastructure.\n  As someone who was in local government for a long time before coming \nto this body--I was a county executive--I have a sense of what it means \nfor our States, our municipalities, and our county governments to have \nto plan for and deal with the inevitable consequence, the impacts on \nour local infrastructure of the coming changes through climate change.\n  I happen to represent the lowest mean elevation State in America, and \nour Governor Jack Markell and his able folks in the Delaware Department \nof Natural Resources and Environmental Control have led a grassroots \nstatewide effort to begin planning for the future impacts of climate \nchange. Because of the combination of subsidence and sea level rise, \nDelaware will see earlier than many States impacts on vital local \ninfrastructure. So whether it is our sewer systems, our roads, our \nwater systems or other infrastructure, we need to begin to plan now to \nbake resiliency into the future of our community.\n  Given the unique and important role that the Federal Government plays \nin financing infrastructure and in responding to disasters such as \nSuperstorm Sandy that destroyed a lot of the infrastructure in the \nnearby States of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, we need to be \nmindful of what these costs could be.\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\n  The U.S. Department of Defense is already preparing plans to \nunderstand how climate change will impact its infrastructure. My \nthinking is that the entire Federal Government should make responsible, \ntimely, and thoughtful plans to assess and to prepare for prudent \nmitigation of the future impacts of climate change on our \ninfrastructure. So I am hopeful that this will be among the many \namendments that will be taken up, debated, discussed, and passed in the \ncoming hours and days.\n  I am grateful that we continue to have an open amendment process and \nthe opportunity to discuss and debate the issues in front of us, and I \nvery much look forward to passage of Coons amendment No. 115.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, two Senators from Delaware, back to back--\na double shot.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 120 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment in order to call up my amendment No. 120.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the \ncredits for new qualified fuel cell motor vehicles and alternative fuel \n                      vehicle refueling property)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR NEW QUALIFIED FUEL CELL MOTOR \n                   VEHICLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 30B(k) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     ``December 31, 2014'' and inserting ``December 31, 2019''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to property purchased after December 31, 2014.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity today.\n  My colleague from Delaware, Senator Coons, knows that Delaware, until \n4 years ago, developed and built more cars, trucks, and vans per capita \nthan any other State in America. We lost within literally 6 months a GM \nplant that employed thousands of employees and a Chrysler plant that \nemployed thousands of people. Those companies went into bankruptcy.\n  For a number of years before that and since then, I have gone every \nyear in January to the North American auto show in Detroit. I remember \nbeing there half a dozen or so years ago and walking through the \ndemonstrations--they call them the stands--where the auto companies, \nwhether they happen to be domestic, Ford, Chrysler, GM, or companies \nfrom Europe or Asia, had on display their vehicles, in some cases the \nvehicles they were introducing that year for the next buying year, and \nin some cases concept cars that may never be built but are just \ninteresting, exciting new technologies that are represented in those \nvehicles.\n  I have never forgotten about a half dozen years ago walking through \nthis enormous cavernous auto show and coming across what they call the \nstand where a number of the Honda vehicles were being displayed. One of \nthem was in a makeshift garage. I thought that was interesting. You \ndon't see makeshift garages in the Detroit auto show.\n  I asked the Honda people, what is this about? They said, imagine a \nvehicle that is in a garage alongside a house. The technology in this \nvehicle will actually provide for the propulsion of that vehicle, \npropel the vehicle, and the fuel this vehicle uses will also cool the \nhouse next to this garage in the summer and warm and heat this house in \nthe winter. I said, you are kidding. I said, what kind of technology is \nthis? He said, this is fuel cells. I said, no kidding. Are you really \nserious about this? He said, yes, we are.\n\n  As it turns out, a few years after that, I was back in Delaware at \nDover Downs. A lot of people think of Dover Downs now because we have \nmusical festivals. Firefly was there, and we had 80,000 people there. \nWe also have 80,000 people show up for a couple of Sundays every year \nfor the auto show.\n  A couple of years ago, I was at Dover Downs, and I had a chance to \ndrive around the Monster Mile when no other cars were racing. I drove a \nGM minivan. The thing that was unique about the GM minivan was how much \nit cost. I have a Chrysler Town & Country minivan that has about \n386,000 miles on it. The vehicle I drove that day had less than 1,000 \nmiles on it, and it was powered by fuel cells.\n  I said to the guy I was driving with, how much does this vehicle cost \nif I wreck it? He said, probably $1 million. I said, I better be \ncareful. And right about then somebody came out of the infield and \ndrove right in front of me and scared the guy next to me to death. I \nwas able to avoid a crash.\n  GM, Chrysler, and Ford have put a lot of money into fuel cell \nvehicles. One of the people who helped to run GM for a number of years, \na fellow named Tom Davis, a longtime friend, when he stepped down from \nGM several years ago ran the part of the company that dealt with light \ntrucks and SUVs. Almost half of their revenue was generated from those \nsources.\n  Earlier this month he and I talked about the future of the auto \nindustry and GM in particular. I said, what do you think the future is \nfor providing propulsion for cars? Is it like the hybrid electric? He \nsaid, no, it is not. I said, is it like the diesel electric? He said, \nno, it is not. I said, is it pure electric? He said, no, it is not. I \nhave said for years that the future is fuel cells. I said, no kidding. \nThat is just like I saw at the auto show years ago and just like the \nfuel-cell powered minivan I drove at Dover Downs a couple of years \nafter that. He said, that is the future.\n  It turns out in Japan they have a word that actually means future \nthat they use to describe this technology, and it is called ``mirai.'' \nHonda and Toyota are betting a little bit of their money--actually \nquite a bit--just as some of our domestic auto companies are betting \nsome money of their own.\n  The great thing about this technology is that it reduces the \nconsumption of oil. We are still the leading consumer of oil in the \nworld. A lot of our oil is from foreign sources, and some of it is \nunstable. I think some of the countries use our money to harm us. This \ntechnology has the ability to reduce our dependence on that foreign oil \nfrom unstable countries. It has the ability to further clean our air \nand to offer a great driving experience. I personally experienced it \nmyself all those many years ago in Dover Downs on the Monster Mile.\n  What I want do today is call up an amendment that will help us to \nseize the day and to take this technology, which is ready now, to be \nmade commercial and to be introduced on both coasts and across the \ncountry in order to provide fuel cell vehicles and to help give it a \nlittle push, if you will, through the Tax Code to encourage them to be \npurchased by our consumers.\n  There are actually two parts to my amendment. One of those is to \nprovide a $4,000-a-year tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles. In \nthis case I am talking about fuel cells, but it could be electric, and \nit could be others as well.\n  The second half of the amendment is to provide the infrastructure. We \nhave heard about fueling stations. Well, these would be infrastructures \nthat would include fueling stations for fuel-cell-powered vehicles.\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\n  It is a two-fold amendment. It reduces our dependence on foreign oil, \nespecially from unstable sources. It provides for new investment and \nfor creation of jobs for that new investment. It is something that \nwould help consumers, it would help our domestic auto industry, and it \nwould enable us to compete with the rest of the world.\n  There are two parts to this amendment--a tax credit of about $4,000 \nfor each vehicle for 5 years, and then an investment tax credit of 30 \npercent to enable us to build the fueling stations. We have gas and \ndiesel stations all across the country. We need alternative fueling \nstations, if you will, for these alternative vehicles if they are to \nrealize their potential and we are to realize ours.\n  Later in the week, I will ask to have the opportunity to offer this \namendment, and I ask that my colleagues keep these arguments in mind, \nand if they see fit, to support this amendment. I hope they will.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 133 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 133.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Ms. Heitkamp], for herself, \n     Mr. Donnelly, and Mr. Coons, proposes an amendment numbered \n     133 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that the Internal Revenue \n  Code of 1986 should be amended to extend the credit with respect to \n     facilities producing energy from certain renewable resources)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 5-YEAR EXTENSION OF \n                   CREDITS WITH RESPECT TO FACILITIES PRODUCING \n                   ENERGY FROM CERTAIN RENEWABLE RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the energy policy of the United States is based on an \n     all-of-the-above approach to production sources;\n       (2) an all-of-the-above approach reduces dependence on \n     foreign oil, increases national security and creates jobs;\n       (3) smart investments in renewable resources are critical \n     to increase the energy independence of the United States, \n     reduce emissions, and create jobs;\n       (4) wind energy is a critical component of an all-of-the-\n     above energy policy and has a proven track record of creating \n     jobs, reducing emissions, and provides an alternative and \n     compatible energy resource to the existing generation \n     infrastructure of the United States;\n       (5) the wind energy industry and utilities require long-\n     term certainty regarding the Production Tax Credit for \n     project planning in order to continue build out of this \n     valuable natural resource; and\n       (6) the stop-start unpredictability of short-term \n     Production Tax Credit extensions should be avoided, as short-\n     term extensions have disrupted the wind industry, slowing the \n     ability of the wind industry to cut costs, as compared to \n     what would have occurred with a long-term, predictable policy \n     in place.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) section 45(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     should be amended by striking ``January 1, 2015'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``January 1, 2020'' in--\n       (A) paragraph (1);\n       (B) paragraph (2)(A);\n       (C) paragraph (3)(A);\n       (D) paragraph (4)(B);\n       (E) paragraph (6);\n       (F) paragraph (7);\n       (G) paragraph (9); and\n       (H) paragraph (11)(B);\n       (2) clause (ii) of section 48(a)(5)(C) should be amended by \n     striking ``January 1, 2015'' and inserting ``January 1, \n     2020''; and\n       (3) the amendments that would be made by paragraphs (1) and \n     (2) should take effect on January 1, 2015.\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Keystone has been described two ways down here, an \nenergy bill and a jobs bill--economic development offering economic \nopportunity. I don't think there could be an amendment that is offered \nthat would fit more both slots of the description of the Keystone bill \nthan the amendment that I am proposing, amendment No. 133.\n  This is a bipartisan proposal that has always been supported by both \nsides of the aisle, and quite honestly, it has tremendous support \nacross the country from the American people. Quite simply what the \namendment does is to provide that it is the sense of the Senate that we \nshould extend the production tax credits for the next 5 years to give \ncertainty to alternative energy companies, particularly to wind energy \ncompanies. It would basically lay down the marker that this is an \nimportant part of our energy and jobs future. Importantly, as we have \nwatched the ups and downs of our tax policy, or lack thereof, in the \nSenate and Congress, we have seen short-term extensions--or as we call \nthem, extenders--being passed in the last moments of Congress, which \ndoes not give the certainty we need to provide the incentives that are \nincluded in those extenders.\n  This sense of the Senate--to the extent it becomes legislation--\nwould, in fact, for the first time give us an opportunity to provide \ncertainty with a glidepath out, and everyone understands that \neventually this industry is going to have to stand alone.\n  I wish to talk about the importance of the wind energy industry, not \njust from the energy standpoint but from the jobs standpoint. Today the \nwind energy industry sustains approximately 73,000 jobs and directs \nover $17.3 billion a year in private investment to the U.S. economy, \nincluding thousands of well-paid wind manufacturing jobs at over 500 \nfactories in 43 States that supply the United States industry.\n  The United States currently has over 60,000 megawatts of installed \ncapacity, and according to the American Wind Energy Association and \nUSDA's Energy Information Administration, the United States produced \nover 167 billion kilowatts of wind power last year alone.\n  If my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are serious about this \nbeing a jobs bill and serious about this being an energy bill, then \nthey you will want to vote in favor of this amendment. Wind energy and \nthe continued buildout of additional capacity in this country is an \nabsolute critical piece of the ``all of the above'' energy policy. \nEvery person in this building and every person you talk to about what \ntheir energy policy is will say all of the above. That has to have \nmeaning, and it has to include this important and critical \ninfrastructure and this important and critical tax credit for wind \nenergy.\n  The other benefit of this amendment is--as you have heard, we have 43 \nStates somehow involved in the manufacture and production of equipment \nin this industry, but we have over 1,000 utility-scale wind projects, \nwhich represent over 62,000 megawatts and over 46 wind turbines and are \ninstalled across 39 States and Puerto Rico. There are also more than \n500 wind manufacturing facilities spread across those 43 States.\n  I am a little bias because we in North Dakota like to say we are the \nSaudi Arabia of wind, and wind is a critical part--in fact 15 percent--\nof our capacity. We think we could do a lot more, but I will tell you \nthe economic impact just in my State. A lot of you know the great \nenergy renaissance that is going on in America that involves the \ndevelopment of fossil fuels--North Dakota being the second largest oil \nand gas producer with the shale development.\n  What you don't know is that North Dakota truly represents all of the \nabove. I want to talk about what we do in wind before I close out here. \nWe have almost 1,600 megawatts of wind capacity installed and another \n740 megawatts under construction. The industry has invested over $3.4 \nbillion in my State with annual lease payments--and these are to \nfarmers who are grateful for that additional revenue. The towers are on \ntheir property and over $5 million of lease payments goes back to \nfarmers.\n  I talked to farmers all across North Dakota who are proud that they \nare part of the energy renaissance in our State and grateful for the \nadditional revenue.\n  We have two educational institutions in our State that have wind \nenergy training centers and do tremendous jobs training the workforce \nfor additional wind energy. The wind energy industry supports close to \n3,000 jobs in North Dakota, and in a State of around 700,000 people, \nthat is a significant factor. In 2013 wind energy was 15 percent.\n  These are numbers that--I saw the Presiding Officer grin when I said \nthat\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\nNorth Dakota is the Saudi Arabia of wind because I think he is thinking \nthat Colorado might be the Saudi Arabia of wind. I know that the \nPresiding Officer is a great supporter of wind energy as well.\n  But when we do these stops and starts, when we don't give a constant \nand predictable policy, we are living hand to mouth. Maybe we are \nmaking some decisions to deploy resources in a way that meets with the \ncongressional schedule and doesn't meet with the business-like or \norderly introduction and continuing development of this industry.\n  If you are looking for a germane amendment that addresses both jobs \nand energy, this is a perfect amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Barack Obama,\n     President, United States of America,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: The Great Plains Tribal Chairman's \n     Association (GPTCA) is made up of the 16 Sovereign American \n     Indian Tribes in the States of North Dakota, South Dakota and \n     Nebraska. All of our Tribes have signed Treaties with the \n     United States in which the United States pledged to protect \n     Indian Tribes, guarantee the right to Self-Government and \n     obligated itself to undertake Trust Responsibility. The Great \n     Plains Tribal Chairman's Association stands in solidarity \n     with the First Nations of Canada and with Tribal Nations in \n     the United States in opposing the Keystone XL pipeline.\n       We are writing to alert you that TransCanada Keystone \n     Pipeline, LP (TransCanada) is in the midst of the \n     recertification process of its 2010 permit from the South \n     Dakota Public Utilities (SDPUC) for the Keystone XL pipeline. \n     While we are aware the Nebraska Supreme Court issued a \n     decision to vacate a lower court decision that held a \n     Nebraska statute concerning the Keystone XL pipeline \n     unconstitutional, we write to urge you to consider the fact \n     that TransCanada's permit to traverse South Dakota is still \n     under review and does not authorize construction of the \n     project in South Dakota unless and until the SD PUC grants \n     certification.\n       Four Federally Recognized Tribes have signed on as Party \n     Intervenors in the SD PUC proceedings as well as numerous \n     Native and nonnative concerned citizens. The Tribes include \n     the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Cheyenne River Sioux \n     Tribe, Rosebud Sioux Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe. Other \n     Great Plains Tribes are poised to comment and are monitoring \n     the proceedings. The pipeline is planned to traverse through \n     our homelands that still possess substantial treaty \n     obligations, cultural and natural resources and water rights \n     for all the Great Plains tribes. These are also the homelands \n     of numerous animals, birds and fish including several \n     endangered species.\n       Under South Dakota law, TransCanada must declare that the \n     conditions under which the permit was issued in 2010 remain \n     the same despite submitting along with its application a \n     matrix of 30 Changed Conditions. These 30 Changed Conditions \n     show that significant design and construction changes are \n     planned for the pipeline that make it substantially different \n     in our eyes. The 2010 permit was also issued with 50 Special \n     Permit Conditions that TransCanada also must prove it still \n     meets before it can legally commence construction of the \n     project. While there is an evidentiary hearing currently set \n     for May 2015, it is unclear when a final decision will be \n     issued in that case.\n       We therefore urge you, consistent with your stance on the \n     previously pending Nebraska litigation, to refrain from \n     making any decision regarding whether the Keystone XL \n     pipeline would be in the national interest until you have all \n     the necessary facts before you. Tribal leaders request you \n     deny the permit as contrary to the national interest.\n       It is the position of the GPTCA that your administration \n     does in fact have incontrovertible evidence that the proposed \n     Keystone XL pipeline would be a detriment to the American \n     public and the national interest regardless of whether the SD \n     PUC ultimately authorizes construction under TransCanada's \n     2010 permit due to the risks the project poses regardless of \n     the particular route through South Dakota. The GPTCA urges \n     you to deny the Presidential Permit for the reasons set forth \n     in the attached GPTCA Resolution among others. However, \n     should you have reservations about denying the Presidential \n     Permit at this time, please grant South Dakota the same \n     respect you accorded Nebraska and refrain from making your \n     decision until after the legal processes regarding the South \n     Dakota permit have been resolved. We strongly urge you to \n     veto any legislation passed by Congress that mandates the \n     issuance of a presidential permit to TransCanada. We believe, \n     consistent with federal separation of powers, that a decision \n     to deny TransCanada a federal permit must be made by your \n     Executive branch and it is not appropriate for legislation.\n       We further assert that construction of any pipeline \n     violates the Fort Laramie Treaties of 1851 and 1868, which \n     impact the greater population of the Oceti Sakowin or the \n     Seven Council Fires of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Tribes. \n     We are known to many as the Great Sioux Nation and are the \n     keepers of the sacred, cultural and natural resources located \n     in the KXL corridor. Literally, thousands of sacred and \n     cultural resources that are important to our life-ways and \n     for our future generations will potentially be destroyed or \n     compromised by the pipeline construction. Many of these \n     sacred sites have not been surveyed by outsiders less they be \n     looted or plundered but are known to those designated by our \n     people considered to be sacred keepers of this knowledge. The \n     Programmatic agreement entered into for compliance with the \n     National Historic Preservation Act acknowledges that \n     construction of the pipeline would cause destruction to many \n     sacred and cultural sited.\n       With regards to our tribal federally reserved water rights \n     in the Great Plains Basin, the pollution risk via benzene and \n     other carcinogens from the tar sands sludge spilling into the \n     tributaries that lead into the Missouri River or leaching \n     into the Oglala Aquifer, should a pipeline break occur, is \n     too great. The Missouri River is the source of drinking water \n     for many communities along the Missouri River main-stem. The \n     Oglala Aquifer supplies drinking water throughout the Great \n     Plains region. All of this development further impacts \n     reserved rights of our Oceti Sakowin which were unceded by \n     treaties, including the right to live in a safe manner and be \n     in control of our human, cultural and natural resources as \n     outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \n     Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Consultation has not occurred in \n     a manner that recognizes free, prior and informed consent for \n     the construction of this\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\n     pipeline. We believe it is our Human Right to live safely on \n     our homelands with clean water and lands.\n       Very importantly, the KXL Pipeline and the continued \n     development of the Alberta tar sands will increase the carbon \n     footprint in our sacred lands for the enrichment of foreign \n     countries and oil companies. As you know, climate change will \n     impact and affect all of us including the generations to come \n     unless we do something to stop it now. The Oceti Sakowin \n     tribes are making important strides toward renewable energy \n     with the Oceti Sakowin Power Project (OSPP) that recognizes \n     fossil fuels are relics that contribute to phenomenal climate \n     change. The OSPP leaders met with the White House \n     representatives in our effort to turn the tide against \n     globing warming through solar and wind development on our \n     lands. We do not have to be held prisoners of fossil fuels \n     but can create stories of redemption for Mother Earth through \n     exciting renewals development, not in the future but now.\n       Because of the dire concerns outlined above, we request an \n     emergency meeting with Department of Interior Secretary Sally \n     Jewell, who as our Trustee, has a responsibility to hear \n     directly from tribal leaders in a government-to-government \n     meeting. We are prepared to put forth our concerns for \n     inclusion in the forthcoming Final Environmental Impact \n     Statement (FEIS) regarding the impacts the Keystone XL \n     pipeline may have on Tribal homelands as well as our sacred \n     sites, cultural resources, natural resources and water rights \n     protected by treaty and other agreements.\n       The Executive Director of the GPTCA, Ms. Gay Kingman-\n     Wapato, is the contact for the GPTCA and is empowered to work \n     with your administration staff to coordinate a meeting at \n     Secretary Jewell's earliest convenience. She can be reached \n     at Cell: 605-484-3036 or e-mail, Kingmanwapato@rushmore.com\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Steele,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Resolution No. 30-9-28-11\n\n\n           GREAT PLAINS TRIBAL CHAIRMAN'S ASSOCIATION (GPTCA)\n\n       Opposition to Keystone XL (``Keystone II'') Pipeline now \n     being considered for authorization by the United States \n     Department of State, on the basis that construction of such \n     pipeline is not in the national interests of the United \n     States\n       Whereas, The Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association \n     (GPTCA) is composed of the elected Chairs and Presidents of \n     the 16 Sovereign Indian Tribes and Nations recognized by \n     Treaties with the United States that are within the Great \n     Plains Region of the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and\n       Whereas, The Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association was \n     formed to promote the common interests of the Sovereign \n     Tribes and Nations and their members of the Great Plains \n     Region which comprises the states of North Dakota, South \n     Dakota, Nebraska; and\n       Whereas, The United States has obligated itself both \n     through Treaties entered into with the sovereign Tribes and \n     Nations of the Great Plains Region and through its own \n     federal statutes, the Snyder Act of 1921 as amended, the \n     Indian Self-Determination Act of 1976 as amended, and the \n     Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 as amended; and\n       Whereas, Indian Tribes are governments that pre-date the \n     United States, and through the Indian Commerce, Treaty and \n     Apportionment Clauses and the 14th Amendment, the United \n     States recognizes the status of Indian Tribes as sovereigns \n     and the status of American Indians as tribal citizens; and\n       Whereas, In treaties, the United States pledged to protect \n     Indian Tribes, guaranteed the right of Tribal self-\n     government, and has undertaken a trust responsibility to \n     promote the viability of Indian reservations and lands as \n     permanent homelands for tribes; and,\n       Whereas, On September 28, 2011, the Tribal Chairmen and the \n     Tribal Council representatives from the Tribal Nations that \n     are members of the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's \n     Association, have been meeting at the GPTCA/BIA/USACE Tribal \n     Water Management Summit, discussing issues of great \n     importance to the Indian Tribal Nations of the Great Plains \n     Region and their members; and\n       Whereas, a major oil transmission pipeline is planned to \n     extend from northern Alberta, Canada, from areas that have \n     sand mixed with tar and oil, called ``tar sands'', to \n     refineries in the United States; and\n       Whereas, the route of the pipeline, called Keystone II, or \n     Keystone XL, because it is the second oil transmission \n     pipeline to be constructed by the same company that built the \n     first Keystone pipeline, crosses through Indian country in \n     northern Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, North Dakota, South \n     Dakota and Nebraska, near and potentially over, many \n     culturally significant areas for Tribal Nations within those \n     provinces and states; and\n       Whereas, based on the relatively poor environmental record \n     of the first Keystone pipeline, which includes numerous \n     spills, U.S. regulators shut the pipeline down in late May, \n     2011, and, therefore, based on the record of the first \n     Keystone pipeline, and other factors, it is probable that \n     further environmental disasters will occur in Indian country \n     if the new pipeline is allowed to be constructed; and\n       Whereas, the First Nations of Canada, representing the vast \n     majority of First Nations impacted by ``tar sands'' \n     development, have unanimously passed resolutions supporting a \n     moratorium on new ``tar sands'' development and expansion \n     until a ``cumulative effects management system'' is in place, \n     and are also in opposition to the pipeline; and\n       Whereas, many U.S. Tribal Nations are also in opposition to \n     the Keystone XL pipeline, including several Tribal Nations in \n     the Great Plains, because it would threaten, among other \n     things, the Oglala aquifer and other major water aquifers, \n     rivers and water ways, public drinking water sources, \n     including the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System, agricultural \n     lands, animal life, cultural sites, and other resources vital \n     to the peoples of the region in which the pipeline is \n     proposed to be constructed; and\n       Whereas, Indian tribes including the Affiliated Tribes of \n     Northwest Indians are also in opposition to the Exxon-\n     Imperial ``Heavy Haul'' proposal to transport ``tar sands'' \n     equipment through the Nez Perce Reservation and across scenic \n     highways, and several Indian tribes have joined in litigation \n     to stop this proposal; and\n       Whereas, the pipeline is unnecessary as a number of other \n     pipelines are not at full capacity to carry oil from Canada \n     to refineries in the U.S., and the oil is also not likely to \n     end up on the U.S. market but will be exported to foreign \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, Tribal Nations and First Nations within Indian \n     country near the route of the proposed pipeline have already \n     stated their opposition to the proposed route of the \n     pipeline, and because of earlier opposition from both Tribes \n     and environmental groups, a supplemental environmental impact \n     statement has been required by the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency from the proposed operators \n     of the pipeline, a draft of which is now available for public \n     comment; and\n       Whereas, since the pipeline is designed to cross the U.S.-\n     Canadian border, the United States Department of State is the \n     lead U.S. agency in evaluating whether the pipeline should be \n     allowed to be constructed in the U.S.; and\n       Whereas, the First Nations of Canada and Tribal Nations \n     within the U.S. have a long history of working to ensure \n     protection of their environment, and the Keystone XL pipeline \n     poses grave dangers if it is constructed; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of State is continuing to \n     accept public comments until October 7, 2011, but despite the \n     concerns of the numerous Tribal Nations and the First Nations \n     of Canada has recently received notice from the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency of a ``Finding of No \n     Significant Impact'' from the proposed pipeline; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of State did not properly \n     consult with the Tribes along the route of the Keystone XL \n     Pipeline and, as a result of the mechanisms used for what \n     consultation was provided, the affected Tribal Nations were \n     not provided the opportunity for ``free and informed \n     consent'' regarding the construction of the pipeline; and\n       Whereas, the GPTCA hereby urges all its member Tribal \n     Nations to submit comments to the U.S. Department of State \n     regarding the Keystone XL project as not in the tribal nor \n     the national interest; and\n       Whereas, Tribal Government Chairs and Presidents, \n     Traditional Treaty Councils, and US property owners, met with \n     the First Nations Chiefs of Canada, impacted by TransCanada's \n     proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and tar sands \n     development present at the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Emergency \n     Summit, September 15-16, 2011, on the protection of Mother \n     Earth and Treaty Territories, developed the Mother Earth \n     Accord for sign on by all First Nations and Tribal Nations: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's \n     Association stands in solidarity with the First Nations of \n     Canada and with Tribal Nations in the United States in \n     opposing the Keystone XL pipeline and the Exxon-Imperial \n     Heavy Haul proposal and their negative impacts on cultural \n     sites and the environment in those portions of Indian country \n     over and through which it is proposed to be constructed, and \n     disagrees with the Finding of No Significant Impact issued by \n     the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and agrees to file \n     these comments regarding this opposition to the Keystone XL \n     pipeline with the Secretary of State as soon as possible; and\n       Be it further resolved that the Great Plains Tribal \n     Chairman's Association approves the Mother Earth Accord among \n     the First Nations of Canada and the Tribal Nations within the \n     United States; and\n       Be it further resolved that the United States is urged to \n     reduce its reliance on the world's dirtiest and most \n     environmentally destructive form of oil--the ``tar sands''--\n     that threatens Indian country in both Canada and the United \n     States and the way of life of thousands of citizens of First \n     Nations in Canada and American Indians in the U.S., and \n     requests the U.S. government to take aggressive measures to \n     work towards sustainable energy solutions that include clean \n     alternative energy and improving energy efficiency; and\n       Be it finally resolved that the Great Plains Tribal \n     Chairman's Association requests a meeting with the Tribal \n     Leaders and Hilary Clinton, Secretary of State, and the \n     Administration to present the Mother Earth Accord and voice \n     the concerns of the US Tribal Nations and the First Nations \n     of Canada opposing the construction of the Keystone XL \n     Pipeline across Treaty Lands as not in the national interest: \n     Now, therefore be it finally\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\n       Resolved that this resolution shall be the policy of the \n     Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association until otherwise \n     amended or rescinded or until the goal of this Resolution has \n     been accomplished.\n\n\n                             CERTIFICATION\n\n       This resolution was enacted at a duly called meeting of the \n     Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association held at Rapid \n     City, SD on September 28, 2011 at which a quorum was present, \n     with 10 members voting in favor, 0 members opposed, 0 members \n     abstaining, and 6 members not present.\n       Dated this 28th day of September, 2011.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about \nPresident Obama's State of the Union Address last week. It was a speech \nthat I believe laid out a positive and forceful agenda for \nstrengthening our middle class and for accelerating our Nation's \neconomic recovery.\n  Over the past year, our Nation's economic progress has become \nunmistakable and undeniable. In our home State of Delaware, more people \nare working. People spend much less time looking for work, and job \ngrowth has been the strongest it has been since the 1990s.\n  Nationally, we are amidst the longest period of sustained private-\nsector job growth on record. Of particular interest to me is that our \nmanufacturing sector has come back and come back strongly as \nmanufacturers have created nearly 800,000 jobs in the last 4 years--\njobs that make up the foundation of our 21st century middle class and \nour economy.\n  Our unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level since before \nthe great recession. Our growing private sector is not just creating \njobs now. They are also laying the foundation for the jobs of the \nfuture. As test scores continue to improve, high school graduation \nrates reach record highs, and, as our President said, ``More Americans \nfinish college than ever before,'' we are laying a path that ensures \nthat future generations of Americans can thrive as well.\n\n  But our work remains unfinished. Although we are right to turn the \npage on the crisis here at home, crises do remain real in the lives of \nfar too many Americans--families I listen to who are struggling to get \ninto and stay in our middle class. For many in the middle class, wages \nhave remained stubbornly stagnant as incomes for the wealthy have \ncontinued to grow. At the same time, too many Americans just stopped \nlooking for work altogether during the recession and haven't begun that \njob search again. So we have a lot of work to do together to ensure \nthat the middle class experiences the benefits of this recovery.\n  On that note, I appreciated President Obama's call for an agenda that \nwould do a lot to strengthen our middle class. Although this isn't what \nwe will hear about on the news, many of these ideas should enjoy \nbipartisan support. I wish to spend a few minutes on some of the areas \nthat I think are ripe for bipartisan cooperation and that would go a \nlong way toward actually helping middle-class families and our Nation \nas a whole.\n  First, it is no secret to anyone that our country's infrastructure is \nbadly outdated and in need of repair. From our ports and roads, to our \nbridges and railways, we have steadily racked up a national debt of \ninvestment that we will need to pay for. The only question is when and \nhow we do it. Historically, infrastructure--fixing roads and bridges \nand ports and railways--has not been a partisan issue. It is something \nthat has been a core value of our Federal Government from its very \nfounding. It is in no small part what the Federal Government was \ncreated to help do.\n  Last Tuesday the President laid out ideas for thinking more \ncreatively about how to make these core investments--from improving \nefficiency to bringing private capital off the sidelines--and I am \nencouraged to hear Republican colleagues discussing infrastructure as \nan initiative they can work on with us. So let's get this done. Let's \nsolve our highway trust fund challenges for good and make the long-term \ninvestments that will put people back to work and strengthen our \nNation's economic backbone.\n  Second, the President's proposal to expand access to community \ncolleges is an initiative that I hope will spark a broader discussion \nabout how to make higher education more accessible and more affordable. \nI understand there is real disagreement here about how best to pay for \nit or how wide its scope should be, but that is what we can and should \nwork on together.\n  We all know that higher education is necessary to ensure Americans \nhave the skills they will need in the 21st century. We know community \ncolleges can and should play a central role in achieving that mission. \nIn manufacturing in particular, community colleges such as Delaware \nTech in my home State play a central role in partnering with local \nbusinesses to create a talent pipeline that sustains a community and \nits economy. In Delaware the SEED and Inspire scholarships give \nstudents who are willing to work hard the chance to go to college and \nto learn the skills that will help them to contribute to Delaware's \neconomy after they finish school. We can replicate Delaware's example \nacross the country and find ways to work together to make community \ncollege and further higher education affordable and accessible. So \nlet's work on this together.\n  Lastly, the President laid out some commonsense tax and work \nproposals to help give middle-class families more of a realistic leg \nup. Expanding the tax credits for families with children and \nstreamlining childcare support makes sense to me. Making it easier for \nmiddle-class families to save for their kids' college education and to \nsave for retirement at the same time would go a long way toward helping \nfamilies to plan for the long term.\n  Around the country, too many of our work places lack family and \nmedical leave policies that appreciate what it really takes to raise a \nfamily and live a healthy life. The President's proposal to work with \nStates to improve their policies would be a great step and would help \nthose communities that choose to, to create policies that suit their \nown local situations.\n  Let's work together on these ideas. Let's do something for middle-\nclass families in our country. With a Republican Congress and a \nDemocratic White House, we need to come together if we are going to get \nanything meaningful done. As President Obama made clear, we have a lot \nof important and difficult work to do. Our economy has come a long way \nfrom the great recession, but there is still work to do to strengthen \nour middle class. There is still work to do to broaden the opportunity \nthat has always been at the heart of the American dream. We can move \nforward together, and it is my sincere hope that we will rise to that \noccasion, that we will seize this opportunity and do the critical work \nof building and sustaining our vital middle class.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 48 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up on behalf of Senator Gillibrand amendment \nNo. 48.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for Mrs. \n     Gillibrand, proposes an amendment numbered 48 to amendment \n     No. 2.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To modify the definition of underground injection)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\n     SEC. __. DEFINITION OF UNDERGROUND INJECTION.\n\n       Section 1421(d)(1) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 300h(d)(1)) is amended by striking subparagraph (B) \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(B) includes the underground injection of natural gas for \n     purposes of storage.''.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this amendment amends the Safe Drinking \nWater Act to protect clean drinking water sources from hydraulic \nfracturing, commonly known as fracking, and from underground storage of \nnatural gas.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act currently exempts underground injection \nof fracking fluids and underground storage of natural gas from \nregulation under the act. The Gillibrand amendment repeals those \nexemptions and makes underground injection of fracking fluids and \nunderground storage of natural gas subject to those regulations.\n  I know my colleague from New York has been on the floor many times--\nactually three times, I think--at various times during this debate \ntrying to offer this amendment. I am offering it on her behalf tonight. \nI am sure she will be looking for time to come and discuss it further.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 55 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 55 on behalf of Senator \nPeters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington, [Ms. Cantwell], for Mr. \n     Peters, for himself and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 55 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a study of the potential environmental impact of \n                by-products of the Keystone XL pipeline)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. STUDY OF BY-PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall complete and make publicly available \n     on the Internet a study assessing the potential environmental \n     impact of by-products generated from the refining of oil \n     transported through the pipeline referred to in section \n     (2)(a), including petroleum coke.\n       (b) Report.--On completion of the study required under \n     subsection (a), the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     results of the study, including a summary of best practices \n     for the transportation, storage, and handling of petroleum \n     coke.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Peters amendment No. 55 would \nrequire the EPA to complete a study on the environmental impacts of \npetcoke. My colleague has been here on the floor speaking on the tar \nsands issue in general because Kalamazoo had one of the worst tar sands \noilspills in the Nation's history. He has been on the floor talking \nabout the things we need to do to protect people not just in the State \nof Michigan but throughout the United States.\n  One of the aftermath effects of this issue is also petcoke, which my \ncolleague from Illinois has been speaking to on the floor. This is a \nvery big issue for midwest Senators who have an amount of petcoke in \ntheir communities and want to see the proper environmental treatment of \nit.\n  I am sure Senator Peters will be back to the floor to speak in more \ndetail on amendment No. 55, but I offer it on his behalf.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey, and I think he is here to speak on \nanother matter, but I will yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n            70th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nof the energy committee for yielding me some time this evening. I am \nnot here for the purposes of legislation we have been debating; I am \nhere to take time on the Senate floor on an occasion that I think is \nincredibly important to recollect, to commemorate, and to talk about.\n  Seventy years ago today a Soviet soldier, Ivan Martynushkin, arrived \nwith his unit at the death camp at Auschwitz, and he said in an \ninterview that he was instantly struck by the silence, the smell of \nashes, and the emptiness. But as they entered the gates, Ivan and his \nunit were unaware of the atrocities, the war crimes that were to come \nto light over time.\n  Today I rise in memory of the 1.1 million persons who perished there, \n90 percent of them Jews. I rise in recognition of 1.1 million lost \ndreams, lost hopes, the lost wisdom of 1.1 million that will never be \nshared, never be known, and the lost potential of a generation that \nperished in that camp between 1940 and 1945.\n  Ivan Martynushkin and his unit entered the camp thinking there would \nbe a Nazi ambush, and then they noticed people behind barbed wire. ``It \nwas hard to watch them,'' he said. ``I remember their faces, especially \ntheir eyes, which betrayed their ordeal.'' Ivan didn't know that the \nNazis had evacuated another 58,000 prisoners 10 days earlier or the 6 \nmillion who were killed in camps across Europe.\n  He stood witness that day to the ultimate manifestation of man's \ninhumanity to their fellow man--7,000 prisoners left behind, 600 \ncorpses born of hatred, intolerance, prejudice, bigotry, and a seething \nanti-Semitism that is again rearing its ugly head in Europe, the Middle \nEast, and around the world.\n  There has been an alarming increase in anti-Semitic attacks and \nincidents in Europe that remain a challenge not only to stability and \nto security but to our shared morality, our mutually ethical core as \nhuman beings. Just two weeks ago, on January 9, 2015, four members of \nFrance's Jewish community were murdered during a hostage crisis at \nHyper Cacher--a kosher supermarket--following the deadly terrorist \nattack on the Paris offices of the newspaper Charlie Hebdo.\n  The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights issued a 2013 report \non anti-Semitism in France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Belgium, \nSweden, and the United Kingdom, where 90 percent of Europe's Jews \nreside, in which three-quarters of respondents said that anti-Semitism \nhad worsened over the past 5 years where they lived.\n  In France, home to Europe's largest Jewish population, it has been \nreported that the number of French Jews immigrating to Israel in 2014 \nhad doubled compared to 2013. And for the first time ever, more Jews \nmoved to Israel from France than any other country in the world.\n  Anti-Semitic acts in European countries in 2014 included violent \nattacks, death threats, and the desecration of Jewish homes, commercial \nproperty, cemeteries, and places of worship. On May 24, 2014, a gunman \nopened fire at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, Belgium, and \nkilled four people. On July 29, Molotov cocktails were thrown at the \nsynagogue in Wuppertal, Germany, which had been burned to the ground by \nthe Nazis during the 1938 Kristallnacht and had only been rebuilt in \n2002.\n  We have all been shocked by the recent disturbingly stereotypical \nanti-Semitic utterances of President Erdogan of Turkey and those around \nhim. He said in February of 2013, ``Today the image of the Jews is no \ndifferent from that of the Nazis.'' Speaking at a campaign rally in the \nBlack Sea province of Ordu, he said the ``terrorist State Israel has \nattacked Gaza once again, hitting innocent children who were playing on \na beach,'' and the crowd chanted ``Down the Israel.'' Erdogan said, \n``The world's media is under the influence of Israel.'' He said, \n``Wherever Jews settle, they make money.'' He claimed during the 2013 \nGezi Park protests that the Europeans and what he stereotypically \nreferred to as the ``interest-rate lobby'' were backing the \nantigovernment campaign, with the ultimate goal of dividing Turkey from \nwithin.\n  A Turkish writer aligned with President Erdogan called for Turkish \nJews to be taxed to pay for Gaza reconstruction. He said:\n\n       The reconstruction of Gaza will be paid for by Jewish \n     businessmen.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The penalty for failing to pay the tax should be the \n     revocation of the Jew's business license and the seizure of \n     his property.\n\n  This is the kind of anti-Semitism we hear in Turkey today.\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\n  Around the world, the numbers are shocking. Based on the global \nsurvey, the ADL concluded that 1.09 billion people harbor anti-Semitic \nattitudes. Thirty-five percent never heard of the Holocaust.\n  If the world does not stand together in never forgetting and if our \nschools, teachers, parents, and communities do not join together in the \nfundamental principle of never forgetting, how can we prevent this from \never happening again? How can we work together to confront the anti-\nSemitism that enables hatred, violence, murder, and genocide around the \nworld?\n  We can only ask what tomorrow might bring. We cannot know what the \nfuture will hold, but we have learned from the past. What we remember \ntoday--70 years after the liberation of Auschwitz--is that the United \nStates and the American people will always stand shoulder to shoulder \nwith the Israeli people and Jewish communities across the world in \nensuring never again. This means confronting modern-day anti-Semitism, \nwhether from the world's leaders, from ivory tower academics, or from \neconomic belligerence pushing the boycott, divestment, and sanctions \nmovement. We must fight back against any and all efforts to \ndelegitimize the Israeli State, the Jewish people, and the Jewish \nreligion.\n  As I have said many times, on many occasions, the Holocaust was the \nmost sinister possible reminder that the Jewish population in exile has \nlived under constant threat. It is the definitive reminder that anti-\nSemitism can appear anywhere, and its horrors galvanized international \nsupport for the State of Israel.\n  But let's be very clear. While the Shoah has a central role in \nIsrael's identity, it is not and never has been the reason behind \nIsrael's founding, and it is not the main justification for its \nexistence. The extreme characterization of this mistaken view is that \nWestern powers established Israel in 1948 based on their own guilt, at \nthe expense of the peoples who already lived there, and therefore the \ncurrent state is illegitimate and, according to religious clerics such \nas Supreme Leader Khamenei, who retains his own aspirations for \nregional hegemony, should be wiped off the face of the map.\n  This flawed argument is not only in defiance of basic human dignity \nbut in plain defiance of history, in defiance of what we remember \ntoday. It is in defiance of ancient history, as told in biblical texts \nand through archeological evidence. It ignores the history of the last \nseveral centuries, and it stands in stark contrast to what we remember \ntoday. Several thousand years of history lead to an undeniable \nconclusion: The reestablishment of the State of Israel in modern times \nis a political reality with roots going back to the time of Abraham and \nSarah.\n  At the end of the day, the argument for Israel's legitimacy does not \ndepend on what we say in speeches and what we say on an occasion like \nthis. It has been made by the hard reality of history. It has been made \nby the men and women who made the desert green, by Nobel Prizes earned, \nby groundbreaking innovations and enviable institutions, by lives \nsaved, democracy defended, peace made, and battles won.\n  There can be no denying the Jewish people's legitimate right to live \nin peace and security in a homeland to which they have had a connection \nfor thousands of years. And there can be no denying the suffering, the \nsenseless slaughter of a generation, and all that the world realized we \nhad lost when Ivan Martynushkin and his unit walked through those gates \nand liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, a reminder for all times of the \nracism and hatred from the most devastating genocide in human history.\n  As we commemorate the victims of the Holocaust, let us never forget. \nBut let us be very clear as we look around the world today that the \nstruggle is not over. Combating anti-Semitism is not only a Jewish \nissue of the past, it is a matter of basic civil and human rights \ntoday, now, in the present.\n  Like those Russian soldiers 70 years ago, I have personally stood at \nthe gates of Auschwitz-Birkenau. I felt the impact, the horror, the \nsilence, the emptiness, and I felt the lives lost. It is a moving \nexperience that should compel all of us to collectively reflect on how \nwe must transform the lessons we should have learned into concrete acts \nto prevent history from repeating itself.\n  Now is the time to renew the vow ``never again'' with even greater \nresolve.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Executive Action\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we Americans are so fortunate to enjoy \nthe blessings of liberty. We protect our rights as individuals, and we \nhave a legal system that demands that government officials respect \nthose rights and respect the law.\n  Historically some nations have lost their freedoms in revolutions. In \nothers a leader gradually undermined the rule of law. Once the rule of \nlaw is dismantled, the road to dictatorship is easily traveled.\n  In a country under the rule of law, government officials are bound by \nthat law.\n  When the Framers wrote our Constitution, they feared that the Federal \nGovernment might grow too strong. They divided and limited the powers \namong three branches. They made sure to preserve State power to serve \nas a check on the Federal power, and they also provided that where the \nFederal Government had the authority to make uniform laws, contrary \nState laws gave way.\n  To make sure everyone would be subject to the law, they entrusted the \nPresident with the duty to ``take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.''\n  President Obama has repeatedly failed to take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed. He has repeatedly violated the Constitution. His \nadministration has not conformed its conduct to law.\n  His administration therefore has undermined the rule of law. Often \npatterns repeat. The President proposes legislation that the American \npeople do not want, so the Congress naturally refuses to enact it.\n  The President then decides that he will take Executive action as if \nCongress had enacted that law. Another pattern is he claims the \nauthority to take various actions but fails to produce an opinion from \nthe Department of Justice that coherently supports his authority. That \ncreates a terrible lack of accountability.\n  We have also seen the President pick and choose which laws he will \nenforce, claiming that the ability to make individual enforcement \ndecisions extends to failing to enforce the laws in millions of \ninstances, and the President has simply failed to take notice when the \nSupreme Court has ruled he has exceeded his powers.\n  I know my colleagues think these are serious charges, and they are.\n  I wish to outline a number of instances where the President or his \nadministration, acting at his discretion, has failed to follow the \nConstitution or the laws. Regrettably I will only be able to touch on \nsome of the examples.\n  The President has attempted to unconstitutionally limit the powers of \nStates through ObamaCare. He threatened the States that did not expand \nMedicaid would lose their existing Medicaid funds. The Supreme Court \nruled 7 to 2 for the first time that a condition on Federal spending \nwas so coercive to the States as to be unconstitutional.\n  Another President might have been careful after such a rebuke by the \nhighest Court in the land to be mindful of State power--after all, it \nincluded one of the Justices that the President himself appointed to \nthe Supreme Court--but not this President taking notice of what the \nCourt said.\n  President Obama's EPA then turned around and has not followed the \nrule of law. It wrongly recognizes no limit to Federal power or to its \nown power.\n  Despite the fact that Congress rejected his cap-and-trade proposal, \nhis EPA issued greenhouse gas regulations\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nthat would require States to develop plans that meet EPA-established \nemission standards. Once EPA approved them, EPA would then order the \nStates to enforce the standards.\n  Supporters of EPA argued that the threat from pollutants under the \nClean Air Act, a category in which they erroneously include carbon \ndioxide, justified EPA's action, but the ``end justifies the means'' is \nan argument that is totally at odds with the concept of rule of law.\n  EPA's approach is unconstitutional. Just as a State cannot be coerced \nby Federal spending programs, it cannot be commandeered to enact \nFederal dictates. This is a well-established rule of the 10th \nAmendment, otherwise the States would lose their sovereignty.\n  Responsibility and therefore accountability would be blurred as \nvoters could not tell which level of government to blame for unpopular \npolicies. Among those who recognize that EPA has acted \nunconstitutionally is the President's own liberal constitutional law \nprofessor, Laurence Tribe of Harvard.\n  He wrote that it was his own view that the EPA is ``asserting \nexecutive power far beyond its lawful authority.''\n  He also wrote: ``Frustration with congressional inaction cannot \njustify throwing the Constitution overboard.''\n  President Obama also acted unconstitutionally when he made what he \nsaid were valid recess appointments, even though the Senate was not in \nrecess. Although Presidents had been making recess appointments for \nmore than 200 years, the President's use of the power was once again \nunprecedented.\n  He was armed with a Justice Department opinion that laughably argued \nthat the President could ignore when the Senate said it was in session \nto make such appointments.\n  The Supreme Court rejected the President's so-called recess \nappointments unanimously. That meant of course that both of the \nJustices President Obama appointed rejected his claim that he could \ndetermine when the Senate was in recess, even though the Constitution \nmakes it very clear, and it also rejected the Justice Department's \narguments that supposedly allowed the President to make that recess \nappointment in violation of the Constitution.\n  But the President, similar to the old French Kings, learns nothing \nand forgets nothing when it comes to respecting the limits of \nPresidential power.\n  Despite the lodging of the power in the Constitution to Congress \nalone to enact uniform laws of naturalization, the President decided to \nenable millions of people who entered the country without documents to \nremain without congressional approval.\n  In fact, at a recent Judiciary Committee hearing we heard testimony \nthat the administration's misuse of parole authority under this \ndirective would allow many individuals who are here illegally to obtain \ngreen cards without Congress changing a word of the immigration laws.\n  This follows the President's earlier decision when Congress would not \npass the DREAM Act to give benefits to undocumented aliens, as if that \nbill had been enacted into law.\n  In both of these instances, the supposed justification for \nnoncompliance with the law is that the need is so great. This is a \nsiren song that supporters of the rule of law must reject.\n  Texas and a number of other States have already filed suit \nchallenging the immigration order's constitutionality, as well as its \nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  In an unrelated case, Federal district court has already found parts \nof the order to be unlawful. The President also has claimed enforcement \ndiscretion in failing to enforce other Federal criminal laws.\n  The Controlled Substances Act prohibits marijuana possession \nnationwide. Under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, State laws \nto the contrary are unconstitutional.\n  Normally the Federal Government sues States that enact such laws. But \nwhen Colorado and other States legalized marijuana, the Obama \nadministration directed Federal law enforcement to refrain from using \nits resources to enforce Federal law in those States. It did not make \nindividualized prosecutorial decisions but a very blanket refusal to \nenforce Federal law, contrary to the oath.\n  Nebraska and Oklahoma, rather than the Federal Government, have sued \nColorado, as those neighboring States argue they face a significant \nincrease in marijuana and other drug-related harms as a result of the \nColorado law.\n  To make matters worse, Attorney General Holder is expanding his \nrefusal to apply Federal marijuana laws to Indian reservations. Those \nreservations depend upon Federal law enforcement.\n  He plans to allow tribes to petition unelected local prosecutors to \ndecide whether the same nonenforcement of marijuana laws' policy will \napply to those reservations. Apart from the rule of law question, it \nmust be kept in mind that these reservations are in States that still \nwant to see marijuana illegal. As a matter of policy, rates of illegal \ndrug use are higher on Indian reservations, with all of the associated \nhealth and crime consequences.\n  Again, this goes to the heart of the rule of law.\n  Does anyone believe if a State decided dealers could sell guns \nwithout conducting the federally required background checks, that the \nObama administration would ignore those States? Anyone who approves \nwhat President Obama has done under the guise of enforcement discretion \nwill have no cause to complain about a future President's decision to \nallocate scarce resources.\n  For instance, he could decide that the ObamaCare individual mandate, \nwhich is constitutional according to the Supreme Court--only because it \nis a tax--will not be enforced against anyone who does not buy \ngovernment-approved health insurance.\n  President Obama has also violated the law when he released five \nTaliban fighters who were detained at Guantanamo in exchange for an \nAmerican sergeant. As the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office \nconcluded, the failure to notify Congress 30 days before such transfer, \nand to provide a justification, was a violation of law.\n\n  I have asked the Justice Department for the justification they \nprepared for this move by the President. To this day, the President \nrefuses to produce the Justice Department's opinion that purports to \nlegally justify this action, contrary to the law passed by Congress.\n  The American people can draw their own conclusions as to whether that \nmeans a well-reasoned legal argument exists that the President could \nlegally act as he did.\n  The rule of law ensures that government officials and agencies obey \nthe law. Under the Constitution, Federal agencies can only exercise the \npower that Congress gives them. They cannot do whatever they want. Now \nthat is obvious to any high school government class. But in the Obama \nadministration, where too many agencies do not believe in limited \ngovernment, agencies are lawlessly exceeding their powers. This \nlawlessness is a major reason why polls show that Americans believe the \nFederal Government is overregulated.\n  Let's take a look at the EPA again. Not only has the EPA violated the \nConstitution and exceeded its powers on the Clean Air Act, that agency \nhas violated a core Federal statute--the Administrative Procedures Act. \nThe Administrative Procedures Act sets forth the process by which \nagencies can issue regulations and conduct other administrative \nbusiness.\n  For instance, under the APA, an agency can issue a regulation that is \nbinding on citizens with penalties for noncompliance only if that \nagency pursues notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  This process, consistent with notions of due process and fairness, \nrequires any agency to issue a proposed rule, seek public comment, \nrespond to public comment, and modify the proposed rule to reflect \nthose comments when it issues a final rule. The process is this way to \nassure accountability, to ensure transparency and input from regulated \nentities. Courts can strike down the regulation if the agency fails to \ncomply with the Administrative Procedures Act.\n  They can also strike down the regulation where the agency exceeds its \nstatutory powers or where the agency's interpretation of law that is \nsaid to justify the regulation does not reflect a legitimate reading of \nthe statute. Courts give greater deference to an agency's \ninterpretations of statutes that are taken after proceeding through the \nnotice-and-comment process.\n  The EPA recently violated the Administrative Procedures Act in my own\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\nState of Iowa. The EPA wrote letters to Iowa municipalities setting \nforth specific requirements that they said must be followed to meet \ntheir obligations under the Clean Water Act. The cities challenged the \nEPA because the two letters effectively imposed new regulatory \nrequirements. They argued the EPA could not impose regulatory \nobligations simply by letter but needed to proceed by notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking--the Administrative Procedures Act requirements.\n  They also argued that so-called informal guidance imposes subtle \npressures on regulated entities to comply even if the EPA does not call \nits actions a regulation.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed and struck \ndown the requirements EPA imposed on those cities just by issuing \nletters. However, the EPA has since publicly stated, as a lot of \ngovernment agencies do, that the EPA would only comply with the ruling \nin the Eighth Circuit.\n  So here we have a situation where there is a national law, the \nactions of the EPA are struck down in the Eighth Circuit, and now that \nlaw is going to be applied one way in the Eighth Circuit and the other \nway in the rest of the States. In other words, the EPA has proclaimed \nit intends to continue to impose these illegal requirements on \nmunicipalities in those States outside the Eighth Circuit, in clear \nviolation of the APA.\n  The EPA is not alone in failing to comply with the Administrative \nProcedures Act. The Department of Education issued what it termed \ninformal guidance concerning campus sexual assault last year without \npublic input.\n  I hope we can see a pattern here, whether it is by letter by the EPA \nto Iowa municipalities or whether it is something called informal \nguidance by the Department of Education. These are all terms trying to \nget around the legal requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act \nto get things done faster by these agencies, because following the rule \nof law is kind of an encumbrance they do not want to go through.\n  In regard to what the Department of Education did, at a HELP \nCommittee hearing the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine \nLhamon stated that she expected colleges and universities to comply \nwith that guidance that was not a regulation under the Administrative \nProcedures Act. Of course, that meant what the Department was calling \ninformal guidance was really a regulation that could only be issued \nafter engaging in notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n\n  When Senator Alexander, who is chairman of the committee now, asked \nher who gave her the authority to issue the guidance, she responded, \nincredibly--and I emphasize incredibly--``Well, with gratitude, you \ndid, when I was confirmed.''\n  So you get confirmed by 100 Members of the Senate and you can do \nwhatever you want to regardless of law? No. This is the United States, \nwhere we operate under the rule of law and the constitution. It is not \nFrance in the age of Louis XIV where government officials say, L'Etat \nc'est moi. I am the State, in other words.\n  Senate confirmation means only that a person has been legally \ninstalled in a job. But once confirmed, the agency official can only \nact in accordance with the laws governing their agency.\n  I support the Department's overall goal of holding accountable those \nwho commit campus sexual assault, but it has to be done lawfully. By \nissuing so-called guidance that, by her own admission, she expected \ncolleges and universities to follow, the Department exceeded its lawful \npowers.\n  Separate from excluding the public from having any say in the rules \nthat have governed their conduct, bureaucrats have many incentives--too \nmany incentives--to ignore the Administrative Procedures Act.\n  Imagine: Formal rulemaking takes time. A formal notice of proposed \nrulemaking is followed by the public's comment period, then the agency \nresponds to comments and modifies their proposed rule before it is made \nfinal. The Office of Management and Budget reviews the regulation and \ncan block or modify it. The Office of Management and Budget makes \nagencies justify the costs and benefits of their rules, reduce burdens \nunder the Paperwork Reduction Act, and also prepare a federalism impact \nstatement for those proposed rules.\n  Agencies that want to regulate without oversight can subvert the \nwhole process of issuing binding rules under the cover of ``informal \nguidance.'' It is so much faster for bureaucrats to issue dictates to \nwhomever they want for whatever reason they want.\n  By avoiding the Administrative Procedures Act, these unelected \nagencies violate the whole separation of powers. They act legislatively \nin violation of the limited authority Congress provides a particular \nagency. Then they are free to issue even more rules, restricting the \nfreedom of American people and increasing the role of unelected \nbureaucrats in telling other people what to do. Reductions in freedom \nare ultimately manifestations of a failure to follow the rule of law.\n  We are already headed in that direction. The Supreme Court has before \nit a case now from the Labor Department, where one of the issues \ndiscussed at oral argument was whether that agency was required to \nproceed by notice-and-comment rulemaking rather than through \ninterpretive rules. We shall see, then, whether the Court addresses \nthat issue or focuses instead on what level of deference a court gives \nwhen agencies change their position without proceeding through \nAdministrative Procedures Act rulemaking.\n  But even if the issue of the necessity of engaging in notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking is not addressed in that case, the Court, before \nlong, will reach that question. When it does, I believe it will find \nthat what the Obama administration has been doing is clearly illegal.\n  President Obama's claims of Executive power are unprecedented. He is \ncreating a general precedent of a Presidency unrestrained by law.\n  When Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated in the darkest days of the \nGreat Depression, he called on Congress to act to respond to the \nemergency as well as giving him powers to address it. He did issue \nExecutive orders, such as declaring a bank holiday, but he did not say \nthat he had a phone and a pen and that he would do whatever he felt was \nnecessary regardless of whether Congress acted. Rather, he said that if \nthe powers Congress gave him to address the emergency were inadequate, \nhe would ask Congress to provide him with the powers Congress would \ngive a President in the event of a foreign invasion.\n  Those are extensive powers. But he was determined to ask Congress for \npower, not to act unilaterally because the ends justified the means. He \nwanted to use all the powers available under the Constitution, not \nexceed those powers.\n  Not only does the Constitution further government compliance with the \nrule of law through the separation of powers, it also sets up an \nexecutive branch that can act to check itself. Executive officials have \ntheir own legal powers that the President cannot interfere with. They \ncan also refuse to carry out illegal Presidential orders.\n  We have a very good example from the dark days of Watergate. The \nNixon administration exceeded its powers too. When that happened, there \nwere administration officials who pushed back against their own \nPresident who appointed them. The appropriate Justice Department \nofficial told President Nixon he would haul him into Federal Court if \nthere were evidence of his criminality. Attorney General Elliott \nRichardson and Deputy Attorney General Ruckelhaus resigned rather than \nfire the Watergate special prosecutor, as the President had \nordered. People of conscience do sometimes resign or threaten to do so, \nand that increases public pressure on the President to obey the law.\n\n  Who in the Obama administration has ever stood up against his \nlawlessness? No one, as far as I know. No one has resigned from the \nJustice Department as it has become a rubberstamp for wild claims of \nPresidential power that exceed the Constitution and violate the laws.\n  What lawyer in the EPA or any other Department has stopped her agency \nfrom acting unconstitutionally by exceeding the powers that Congress \nhas specifically delegated under various statutes? What lawyer has \nstopped an agency from violating the Administrative Procedures Act by \nissuing binding rules on the public without public comment?\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\n  I regret to say that the Congress up to now has too often been \ncomplicit with Presidential assaults on the rule of law. When President \nObama eviscerated the core Senate prerogative of advice and consent by \nmaking unconstitutional recess appointments, not one single Democrat in \nthis body objected. This is where the real harm of excessive \npartisanship manifests itself.\n  Time and again, the previous majority in this body refused to take \naction against any Presidential action that violated the law if they \nagreed with the policy being pursued by the President. This sort of \nnonactivity is not why the Constitution created the Congress. Whatever \nits flaws, an active Congress that defends its legislative prerogatives \nand conducts effective oversight of Executive illegality is vital to \npreserving liberty.\n  In one historical example, the process of transformation from \ndemocracy to dictatorship was completed when the Parliament voted \nitself out of existence.\n  The Framers did not intend a Congress to sit idly by as the President \nviolates the Constitution and the laws. In Federalist 51, James Madison \nwrote that the separation of powers was vital to the preservation of \nliberty. He noted that checks and balances would be effective in \nkeeping each branch within its prescribed constitutional role because \neach had, in his words:\n\n       . . . the necessary constitutional means and personal \n     motives to resist encroachments of the others. . . . Ambition \n     must be made to counteract ambition.\n\n  Recently, the Senate has failed to counteract unlimited Executive \nambition. That must change and, as a result of the last election, \nshould change. Will it change? I sure hope so.\n  I trust that under our new leadership, the Senate will take action \nfor the government to control itself, and to restore the rule of law \nthat has been so badly damaged in recent years, because if we take the \nspirit of the Declaration of Independence--and remember, prior to that \nDeclaration, the colonies decided they did not want one person, George \nIII, making decisions affecting millions of people on this side of the \nocean. So they were very careful, when they declared independence and \nthey wrote a Constitution a few years later, to make sure they carried \nout the spirit of the Declaration of Independence that:\n\n       . . . they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  Not by our government, but by nature or by our Creator.\n  So they put into this Constitution assurances so there could never be \na George III again, and separated all the powers so one person didn't \nhave all the power.\n  Now we see one person trying to exercise the power of several \nbranches of government, as George III tried to do. So we are over that \nhurdle. All we have to do is make sure that the checks and balances the \ngovernment worked--the same checks and balances that every high school \nkid learns in government class, to make sure that one person doesn't do \nit, and that our liberties are protected by a government that operates \nunder the rule of law. And that Constitution is our rule of law.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

These are traditions I have enjoyed in my \nlife and traditions I have also enjoyed with my kids.\n  It is important our State's outdoor heritage is protected for future \ngenerations. That is why protecting and increasing access to public \nlands is so important. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been \ninstrumental in increasing access to our public lands, growing \nopportunities for outdoor recreation and protecting wildlife. There is \ngreat potential for the program to be used to improve the management of \nour existing Federal lands.\n  In fact, there is much improvement to be made to make Federal land \nmanagement more effective. My amendment will express the sense of the \nCongress that the Land and Water Conservation Fund plays an important \nrole in improving wildlife habitat and increasing outdoor recreation \nopportunities on Federal as well as State land. It will also convey \nthat reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund should be a \npriority for Congress and should include improvements in the structure \nof the program to more effectively manage existing Federal land.\n  Montana's outdoor heritage is of great importance to our State's \neconomy and thousands of Montanans' way of life. We must work to \nimprove programs such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund so it \nwill work better for Montanans and all Americans.\n  Supporting and improving the Land and Water Conservation Fund will \nhelp us ensure this legacy is continued for future generations.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the privilege of being a lifelong \nVermonter, as were my parents and my brother and sister. All Vermonters \nrealize that in a small State like ours, it takes the dedication and \nhard work of very special and talented people to make our State great.\n  I will take a moment as a proud brother to mention one such person, \nmy younger sister, Mary Leahy. Mary's work with adult basic education \nand teaching and her ability to give adults who have not had the \ncapability to read a newfound ability is profound. It is impossible to \ncalculate the number of lives she has dramatically improved in our \nState through her work. I still carry the memory of watching a \ngrandfather with tears in his eyes, as he read a simple child's book to \nhis grandchild. He then told me that he had never been able to read to \nhis child, the grandchild's parent, but at least in his later years he \ncould read to the grandchild. I thought what a gift. I thought again of \nMary as I read an article printed in a number of our media in Vermont, \nwritten by Nancy Graff, about this part of Mary's career. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From VTDigger.org, Dec. 28, 2014]\n\n      In This State: For Mary Leahy, Literacy Goes Beyond Reading\n\n                            (By Nancy Graff)\n\n       Several miles up a dirt road in Marshfield, Mary Leahy's \n     driveway swings up a modest rise on the right. In the wake of \n     a recent snowstorm, ice, clumps of snow, ruts, and shattered \n     branches have created endless road stubble. Traffic is \n     infrequent. Leahy hasn't seen Camel's Hump, a breathtaking \n     view normally framed by her house's large west-facing \n     windows, for almost a week due to stubborn low-hanging \n     clouds. No other structure or human being intrudes.\n       In this isolated spot, Leahy has spent 20 years thinking \n     through what it means to be literate. She believes it all \n     comes down to creating communities that welcome everyone.\n       Two years ago Leahy, a Montpelier native, retired from \n     Central Vermont Adult Basic Education after 34 years as co-\n     director and four years before that as a field tutor. \n     Throughout her tenure, she says in her soft voice, she worked \n     to make adult literacy programs ``as inclusive as any other \n     form of education, so that everyone could become part of the \n     cultural community.''\n       Leahy is sitting in her living room, her telltale shock of \n     white hair the same color as the walls inside and the snow \n     piled outside. She can tell hundreds of stories about people \n     she has encountered over the past decades. One woman holds a \n     special place in the evolution of her thinking. According to \n     Leahy, when this woman came to be tutored in reading, Leahy \n     asked her why she felt the need to learn now, long after she \n     had left school. She replied that she had a big maple tree in \n     her front yard, and a dream that one day when she finished \n     her chores, she would take a book and sit under that tree and \n     read it.\n       ``That became the beacon for the rest of my work,'' Leahy \n     says.\n       One book in particular provided more inspiration. A middle-\n     aged man under Mary's tutelage asked if they could read \n     ``Black Beauty'' together. ``'Why that book?''' she remembers \n     asking. He had shown no interest in horses. He explained that \n     ``Black Beauty'' had been popular when he was in school, but \n     he could never join in the discussions about it because he \n     couldn't read. He wanted to know how it ends.\n       ``I think `Black Beauty' was the most formative book I read \n     as a child. It taught me about being compassionate. I read it \n     over and over and over,'' she says.\n       And then there was a favorite nun at Leahy's college, St. \n     Catherine University, in Minneapolis. She taught Leahy that \n     ``work has to serve the world.''\n       After graduating and returning to Vermont, Leahy briefly \n     tried her hand at farming before she started working in \n     literacy.\n       ``Literacy took up my imagination,'' Leahy says. ``It took \n     up my heart, and I could see the changes in people's lives.''\n       Among the mementos from her father's shop that Mary Leahy \n     keeps in her house is the letterpress type that once printed \n     the ``ICE'' cards that people would put in their front \n     windows when they wanted the iceman to make a delivery. \n     Beautifully rendered in wood to begin with, the letter faces \n     are as smooth as glass after decades of use. Beside them is a \n     well-used brass can that contained solvent to clean the type.\n       Soon, however, she began to see that being able to identify \n     a letter, being able to associate that letter with a sound, \n     stringing letters into words, and understanding the meaning \n     of the words were not enough. She recalls men at a local \n     electric company who were afraid to requisition a part to fix \n     a machine they could run with their eyes closed because they \n     were unable to fill out the form needed to get the part. They \n     learned the fundamentals of reading for their jobs, but until \n     they could engage with ideas they remained outliers in the \n     world's cultural community.\n       ``They needed to be included,'' Leahy says. And that meant \n     being able to help their children with schoolwork, being able \n     to articulate their ideas and opinions, being able to teach \n     themselves to learn.\n       Bringing the newly literate into the life of their families \n     and home communities, into the community of ideas that \n     explore our humanity and world, became Leahy's goal.\n       These days CVABE serves approximately 600 clients, down \n     from a high of 800 a few years ago. Leahy is quick to praise \n     the people with whom she has worked over the years and other \n     organizations that have made literacy work possible, \n     especially the Vermont Council on the Humanities, with its \n     emphasis on teaching reading not just as a vital skill but as \n     a revelation of the human condition.\n       Each student presents unique challenges. Some are well-\n     educated immigrants who need to learn English to work in \n     their field. Some have learning disabilities that weren't \n     addressed. Others have lived in such chaotic situations that \n     school wasn't a priority. Still others have come from such \n     poverty that illiteracy was a legacy passed from generations.\n       When she began working for CVABE, the organization stressed \n     one-on-one in-home tutoring. ABE itself was a feature of the \n     war on poverty that was an extension of the Department of \n     Education. Leahy's job was to develop tutoring programs by \n     recruiting students and volunteers. To find students, she \n     went door to door asking if anyone needed literacy \n     assistance.\n       Being illiterate is not something people want to admit, she \n     says. ``There's a chronic fear of being found out that you \n     can't do what everyone else can. You think you're alone in \n     not being able to do this.''\n       And so she met them wherever they felt comfortable. She \n     tutored in homes, in restaurants, in libraries, sometimes in \n     her car.\n       Eventually, the Department of Education pushed the ABE \n     program to move toward a more center-based structure. So \n     Leahy oversaw that change, as well as many others, including \n     gaining independence, forming a board, fundraising, starting \n     an alternative high school program for teens, and very \n     important, from her perspective, hosting reading and \n     discussion programs. In 1989 she helped organize the first \n     statewide conference for Vermont's newly literate, ABE\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\n     students who had once believed their opinions did not matter.\n       Leahy learned early in life what it means to be part of a \n     community. Her father, a printer, had a shop near the \n     Statehouse, and like her brothers (one of whom is Vermont's \n     U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy), she regularly delivered printing \n     jobs to the capitol. In the process she learned about \n     government and politics and the obligations of citizenship. \n     She learned about history and immigrant communities through \n     their Irish and Italian ancestors, including one grandmother \n     who was illiterate. These interests have carried over into \n     her current volunteer work for the Friends of the Vermont \n     State House, the Vermont Historical Society, and the \n     Marshfield Historical Society. She wants everyone to have \n     full access to communities like these that will enrich their \n     lives.\n       According to Leahy, her students were a joy to teach \n     because they were so motivated. With her eyes tearing up she \n     tells the story of a man who wrote a letter to his first \n     grandchild. ``Things are going to be different than they were \n     for me and your mother,'' he wrote. ``Your mother would bring \n     papers home from school, and I'd keep my distance because I \n     didn't want her to know. But things will be different with \n     you and me.'' That change in one family's quality of life, \n     says Leahy, will resonate for generations. Another student \n     was 93 when he learned to read. He had vowed to learn to read \n     before he died.\n       These Vermonters and all the others whose lives Leahy has \n     touched in her life's work are no longer outliers.\n       ``We all belong to a very special group of people,'' she \n     says. ``We can read and write.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S538-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S538-S539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Jones Act, an \nimportant law for our Nation's maritime industry and for our national \nsecurity. Senator McCain has filed an amendment to repeal the Jones \nAct, and I urge its defeat.\n  In Louisiana, we know how important the maritime industry and Jones \nAct-related jobs are to our State and our economy. According to the \nAmerican Maritime Partnership, Louisiana leads the Nation in maritime \njobs by a number of measurements of the domestic maritime economy. For \ndomestic maritime employment, Louisiana has more jobs than any other \nState--55,000 jobs out of close to 500,000 nationwide. Louisiana also \nleads the Nation in per capita maritime jobs, with 1 in 83 jobs being \ntied to our domestic maritime industries, nearly twice that of any \nother State. For total economic output from domestic maritime activity, \nLouisiana again leads the nation with more than $11 billion per year.\n  Louisiana's 2,800 miles of navigable waterways handle more waterborne \ncommerce than any other State. Tugboats based in Louisiana facilitate \nentry of cargo into the Mississippi River and then up the river and \nthroughout the Nation on our inland waterways. This vast infrastructure\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\nand the maritime operators using it directly benefit the entire Nation. \nFor example, 60 percent of export grain travels to the Gulf of Mexico \nthrough Louisiana. Also, one-fifth of our domestic energy is produced \noff the coast of Louisiana with support from the domestic fleet of \noffshore workboats.\n  The Jones Act helps ensure the strength and stability of our domestic \nmaritime industry, and it will help ensure that it continues to \nflourish. These jobs and the economic benefits from them would be at \nrisk if the Jones Act were repealed. I have no doubt that our \nindustries can and will compete effectively against their counterparts \naround the world. However, they cannot compete fairly against the heavy \nsubsidization that foreign governments give to their industries. Also, \nthere cannot be fair competition when foreign vessels are not subjected \nto the same requirements for safety, fuel containers, labor standards, \ntraining, incidental vessel discharges, other environmental \nregulations, taxes, and more that our industries have to follow.\n  Also, the Jones Act is vital to the military as it protects our \nnational security. In order to ensure our Navy remains the best \nequipped and most powerful Navy in the world, we must have domestic \nskills base and shipbuilding capacity. Also, we need to have an \nadequate domestic fleet to ensure the fast and secure delivery of vital \nmilitary cargoes around the world.\n  For our homeland security, the Jones Act helps keep our ports and \nwaterways safer from attack. Imagine if our inland waterways and ports \nwere fully open to foreign vessels. The Coast Guard and our other law \nenforcement agencies would have no real, effective way to know if \nvessels are safe as they travel through our river communities, if the \ncrews are properly licensed for the vessel's operation, or if anyone or \nanything on the vessels pose a risk. The Jones Act helps our first \nresponders and law enforcement better know any potential threats and \nallows them to be better prepared to act in an emergency.\n  In short, any legislation to repeal or lessen the protections of the \nJones Act would threaten jobs, economic growth, military strength, and \nhomeland security. I will continue working to support the U.S. maritime \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S540-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HOWARD GEORGE HITCHENS\n\n Mr. COONS.

Howard previously served as fire chief, assistant \nchief engineer, and director of the fire company. He also started its \nSanta Claus show for children, which still occurs each year during the \nholiday season. Howard has served the fire company for more than 60 \nyears and is the only living charter member.\n  On February 14, 2015, the Memorial Volunteer Fire Company will honor \nHoward for his service. Howard is a true Delawarean and a model \ncommunity leader. I would like to honor Howard and his more than six \ndecades of service to his family, friends, community, and the State of \nDelaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S540-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JAMES ALLEN\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life and \nlegacy of Rogers Police Chief James Allen, who passed away on Thursday \nafter a long battle with cancer.\n  After more than three decades of public service, Chief Allen was well \nrespected in the law enforcement community across Arkansas. He was a \ndedicated leader who devoted his life to law enforcement.\n  Chief Allen graduated from Arkansas State University with a degree in \ncriminal justice. Following graduation he joined the Jacksonville \nPolice Department and within a few short years was named the captain of \nthe Pulaski County Sheriff's Office. Chief Allen was the youngest \npolice chief to serve on the Bentonville Police Force, a position which \nhe held for 22 years. During his time at the helm of the Bentonville \nPolice Department, Chief Allen graduated from the FBI National Academy. \nIn 2011, he became the Rogers police chief.\n  I am greatly appreciative for Chief Allen's continued service over \nthe years to Arkansas and Rogers, the community I call home. Chief \nAllen was a man of the law, and he was always looking for opportunities \nto improve the resources for his staff and the community by applying \nfor grants. I was happy to help support his endeavors.\n  I pray for his family and friends during this trying time, and I hope \nthey find comfort knowing that Chief Allen touched so many lives in the \nState. He will be missed but leaves a lasting legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S540-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TOM GRADY\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Assemblyman \nTom Grady, of Yerington, on his retirement. After serving 12 years in \nthe Nevada Legislature, Assemblyman Grady is retiring from public \nservice. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate him not only as a \ncolleague but also as a friend on his retirement after more than 36 \nyears of hard work and dedication to the Silver State.\n  A devoted husband and proud father of three, Assemblyman Grady stands \nas a shining example of someone who has dedicated his life to serving \nhis community. Upon graduating from the University of Nevada, Reno, \nAssemblyman Grady went on to attend the Washington State Bankers \nSchool. After moving back to Nevada, he served as the secretary-\ntreasurer of the Truckee Carson Irrigation District before advancing to \nvice president of Pioneer Citizens Bank of Nevada. After leaving the \nbank, Assemblyman Grady reentered public service after winning a seat \non the Yerington City Council. After 3 years of service on the \nYerington City Council, Assemblyman Grady was elected mayor, a position \nhe held for 12 years.\n  Assemblyman Grady's experience as a local government leader qualified \nhim for a seat in the Nevada Assembly, where he dutifully served his \nconstituents for 12 years. During his time in the legislature, \nAssemblyman Grady served on the Taxation, Ways and Means, and \nGovernment Affairs Committee. Although I missed him by a few years in \nthe assembly, I am proud to have served with Assemblyman Grady in \nNevada State government as secretary of state.\n  His service to his community goes far beyond the many positions he \nhas held in the Silver State over the years. Assemblyman Grady also \nserved his country in the U.S. Army Reserve. I extend my deepest \ngratitude to him for his courageous contributions to the United States \nof America and to freedom-loving nations around the world. His service \nto his country and his bravery and dedication to his family and \ncommunity earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who have \nvaliantly defended our Nation. As a member of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility not \nonly to honor these brave individuals who serve America but also to \nensure they are cared for when they return home.\n  I am grateful for his dedication and commitment to the people of \nYerington. He personifies the highest standards of leadership and \ncommunity service and should be proud of his long and meaningful \ncareer. Today, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating Assemblyman Grady on his retirement, and I offer my \ndeepest appreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada an even \nbetter place. I offer my best wishes to Assemblyman Grady, his wife \nPatricia, and their three children and seven grandchildren for many \nsuccessful and fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S540-4", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S540-5", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S540-S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/27/senate-section/article/S541-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:11 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 357.

A bill to amend the definition of ``homeless person'' under \nthe McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to include certain homeless \nchildren and youth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with my colleague Senator Portman that would expand the \ndefinition of ``homeless'' used by the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, HUD, to ensure all homeless children and families \nare considered eligible for existing Federal homeless assistance \nprograms. This change in the definition would be in alignment with what \nis already currently used by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education, approximately 1.2 \nmillion children were homeless during the 2012-2013 school year, which \naccounts fora 6 percent increase from the 1,166,436 homeless students \nenrolled in the 2011-2012 school year.\n  In California, 259,656 children experienced homelessness last year. \nThis increase is nearly four times the 65,000 homeless children that \nwere reported in California in 2003.\n  Unfortunately, the numbers reported by the HUD ``Point-in-Time \nCount'' fail to accurately reflect the upward trend in homeless \nfamilies.\n  According to the 2013 HUD ``Point-in-Time Count,'' there were only \n222,197 people counted as homeless in households that included \nchildren, a fraction of the number reported by the Department of \nEducation.\n  This issue is important because only those children and their \nfamilies counted by HUD are eligible for vital homeless assistance \nprograms. The rest of these children and families are simply out of \nluck and are turned away by providers that do not want to be \nreprimanded for not following HUD regulations.\n  The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2015 would expand the homeless \ndefinition to allow HUD funded homeless assistance programs to serve \nextremely vulnerable children and families, specifically those staying \nin self-paid motels or in doubled up situations because they have \nnowhere else to go.\n  These families are especially susceptible to physical and sexual \nabuse, trafficking, and neglect because they are often not served by a \ncase manager, and thus remain hidden from potential social service \nproviders.\n  As a result of the current narrow HUD definition, communities that \nreceive federal funding through the discretionary grant process are \nunable to prioritize or direct resources to help these children and \nfamilies.\n  This bill would provide communities with the flexibility to use \nfederal funds to meet local priorities.\n  I would also like to note that this legislation comes at no \nadditional cost to taxpayers and does not impose any new mandates on \nservice providers.\n  Finally, this legislation improves data collection transparency by \nrequiring HUD to report data on homeless individuals and families \ncurrently recorded under the existing Homeless Management Information \nSystem survey.\n  I am pleased that Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) has joined me as an \noriginal cosponsor on this bill.\n  Homelessness continues to plague our Nation. If we fail to address \nthe needs of these children and families today, they will remain \ninvisible and stuck in a cycle of poverty and chronic homelessness.\n  It is our responsibility to ensure that we do not erect more barriers \nfor these children and families to access services when they are \nexperiencing extreme hardship. I believe this bill is a commonsense \nsolution that will ensure that homeless families and children can \nreceive the help they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n200 NW 4th Street in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as the William J. \nHolloway, Jr. United States Courthouse; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to name the \nFederal courthouse serving the Western District of Oklahoma after the \nlate Judge William J. Holloway.\n  This legislation has the support of the judges on the Western \nDistrict, retired Judge Ralph Thompson who served on the bench in the \nWestern District for from 1975 to 2007, and many in the legal community \nin the Western District of Oklahoma.\n  Judge Holloway was born in Hugo, OK, and his father was the eighth \ngovernor of the State of Oklahoma. He served in the U.S. Army during \nthe height of World War II, received his law degree from Harvard \nUniversity in 1950, and worked in private practice with a 2-year stint \nfor the Department of Justice. President Lyndon Johnson nominated Judge \nHolloway to the 10th Circuit in August 1968, and the Senate confirmed \nhim on September 13, 1968, where he served as chief judge from 1984 to \n1991. Judge Holloway assumed senior status in May 1992 and passed away \nApril 25, 2014, in Oklahoma City.\n  Judge Holloway was the longest serving judge on the 10th Circuit, and \nduring his service, he authored over 900 opinions. He was well regarded \nby all who worked with him, appeared before him, and knew him. I have \nnot found a person knowledgeable of Judge Holloway or his service who \ncould not unequivocally tell you that Judge Holloway adhered to \nprecedent when deciding cases. He did not proclaim any type of \nphilosophy. As new 10th Circuit Judge Robert Bacharach described Judge \nHolloway, ``He simply decided cases by asking `What does the statute \nsay? What does the Constitution say? What are the facts of this case?'' \nWe know that is a high standard, and a standard lost sometimes in our \njudiciary.\n  When he passed away last year, 10th Circuit Judge Jerome Holmes said \nof Judge Holloway, ``The nation has lost a thoughtful, dedicated, and \ncompassionate jurist, and, as a former law clerk of Judge Holloway, I \nhave lost a mentor, dear friend, and colleague. I know that Judge \nHolloway was very honored to serve his nation as a judge on the Tenth \nCircuit, and he served with great distinction.''\n  On behalf of Judge Holloway and his family, I introduce this bill in \nhis honor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WILLIAM J. HOLLOWAY, JR. UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at \n     200 NW 4th Street in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``William J. Holloway, Jr. United \n     States Courthouse''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall \n     be deemed to be a reference to the ``William J.

James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: We are writing to respectfully request \n     that the United States Courthouse in Oklahoma City be named \n     the ``William J. Holloway, Jr. United States Courthouse.'' \n     Judge Holloway died on April 25, 2014, at the age of 90. At \n     that time, he was the longest serving judge in the history of \n     the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, having served for over 45 \n     years. During his remarkable tenure on the court, Judge \n     Holloway authored over 900 opinions and participated in the \n     decision of thousands more.\n       Judge Holloway was a kind, compassionate man who quietly \n     and diligently spent his lifetime working for justice. He did \n     so without fanfare, seeking only to fulfill the great \n     responsibility given to him. Though Judge Holloway is \n     deceased, we can think of no more noble name for our \n     courthouse than the ``William J. Holloway, Jr. United States \n     Courthouse.'' He embodied every trait that all federal judges \n     should strive to achieve.\n       This request is made by every federal judge in Oklahoma \n     City. Please do not hesitate to contact any of us if you have \n     any questions about our request.\n           Yours very truly,\n         Jerome A.

A bill to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the Leahy-\nCollins Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act. It \nis deplorable that in the wealthiest country in the world, 1.6 million \nteenagers live on the streets because they have no home. We know that \nthose who do not have a safe place to sleep at night are particularly \nvulnerable to being exploited and trafficked. A recent study found that \nnearly one in four homeless young people have been victims of \ntrafficking or sexual exploitation. We often talk about human \ntrafficking as an international problem, but the sad truth is that it \nis a major problem right here at home. It is time we provide the \nresources to help protect our children from this very real threat.\n  The Runaway Youth Act, first signed into law in 1974, has proven \nessential to providing the basic services and resources that runaway \nand homeless youth need, and our continued support is vital. Thirty-\nnine percent of the homeless population is under the age of 18, and the \naverage age at which a teen becomes homeless is 14.7 years old. Think \nabout that. The average teen living on the streets is not even old \nenough to drive. These young people represent our country's future and \nits optimism, and as a father and a grandfather, I believe that we must \ndo more to address the needs of the 1.6 million homeless youth in our \ncountry.\n  Teens run away and become homeless for myriad reasons. A U.S. \nDepartment\n\n[[Page S545]]\n\nof Health and Human Services study found that 46 percent of homeless \nyouth had run away because of physical abuse and 17 percent because of \nsexual abuse. Nearly 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT and \nreport leaving home because of a lack of acceptance. By including a new \nprovision that prohibits grantees from denying services based on the \nsexual orientation or gender identity of the homeless youth, this bill \ntakes important new steps to make sure that we are meeting the needs of \nthis growing and particularly vulnerable population. No young person \nshould be turned away from these essential services.\n  We have made great strides in recent years in our efforts to combat \nhuman trafficking. Most recently, we reauthorized the comprehensive \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act, a bipartisan bill I introduced and \nwas proud to see enacted as part of the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act. And last year, we saw historic levels of \nfunding for victims of trafficking, an urgently needed increase that I \nwas proud to support as the most senior member of the Appropriations \nCommittee. But we must not forget the importance of investing in \nprevention efforts as well, and I was disappointed that Congress failed \nto pass the bipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking \nPrevention Act. If we are to make a real difference to end modern day \nslavery, we must protect those who are most vulnerable and prevent the \nexploitation in the first place. We cannot simply focus on ending \ndemand and arrest our way out of this problem; we must eliminate the \nconditions that make these children so vulnerable. That means investing \nin stable housing and support services for more kids in need; we are \nnot doing enough. I hope that we can finally enact this meaningful bill \nin 2015.\n  In addition to the dangers of human trafficking, homeless youth are \nat greater risk of suicide, unintended pregnancy, and substance abuse. \nThey are less likely to finish school, more likely to enter our \njuvenile justice system, and are often ill-equipped to find a job. The \nservices authorized by this bill are designed to intervene early and \nencourage the development of successful, productive young adults.\n  I have heard from dozens of service providers from across the \ncountry, including in my home state of Vermont, that these programs \nwork. I am proud to say that last year, 95 percent of youth receiving \nservices from the Vermont Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth \nPrograms were able to exit to a safe living situation upon their \ncompletion of programming. Without the programs funded through the \nRunaway and Homeless Youth Act, hundreds of thousands of children would \nbe left on the street and vulnerable to exploitation. Congress has an \nopportunity to respond in a meaningful and historic way.\n  I thank Senators Collins, Booker, and Ayotte for working with me on \nthis legislation and for joining me as original cosponsors. We have the \nchance to make a real difference by passing the Runway and Homeless \nYouth and Trafficking Prevention Act. Every day we wait is another \nnight too many children are sleeping on the streets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 271. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain retired members of the uniformed services who have a service-\nconnected disability to receive both disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired \npay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related \nSpecial Compensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans to once again discuss the unjust and outdated policy of \nfailing to give our veterans the full military retirement and veterans \ndisability compensation benefits that they have earned in their service \nto the Nation. Full payment of retirement and disability benefits, \ntogether known as ``concurrent receipt,'' is an issue that I have \nstrongly advocated for more than a decade.\n  In the past, veterans were prevented from receiving the full pay and \nbenefits they earned in dedicated service to our country. The law \nrequired that military retirement pay be reduced dollar-for-dollar by \nthe amount of any disability compensation a veteran received. I am \npleased to say that many Senators have joined me in fighting this \npolicy, and we have made some progress on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans\n  In 2003, Congress passed legislation that allowed disabled retired \nveterans with at least a 50 percent disability rating to become \neligible for full concurrent receipt benefits by 2013. In 2004, the 10-\nyear phase-in period was eliminated for veterans with 100 percent \nservice-related disability. With the phase-in period now complete, I am \ndeeply gratified that all those veterans with over 50 percent \ndisability ratings are now receiving the full benefits they earned from \ntheir service. These are significant victories that put hundreds of \nthousands of veterans on track to receive both their retirement and \ndisability benefits. However, many more of our veterans remain unjustly \nimpacted by the denial of concurrent receipt.\n  For me, this is a simple matter of fairness. There is no reason to \ndeny a veteran who has served their country honorably the right to the \nfull value of their retirement pay simply because their service also \nresulted in a disability that affects them each and every day for the \nrest of their lives. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the current \nlaw does. This legislation will bring that indefensible practice to an \nend.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Our Nation has been at war for over a \ndecade, through both Republican and Democratic administrations, and our \nservice members have performed with unmatched valor around the world. \nOur utmost duty as lawmakers should be to ensure that the brave men and \nwomen who served in the United States Armed Forces receive the benefits \nthey have earned.\n  So once again, I rise on behalf of our Nation's veterans. Today, I \nintroduce legislation that will eliminate all limitations to concurrent \nreceipt. We must take action now to support our veterans who have never \nfaltered in their unwavering service to this grateful Nation. This is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
