Mr. President, I move to proceed to S. 1.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S. 1, a bill to \n     approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 26\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nleader remarks the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 26, the \nHouse-passed TRIA bill; further, that the only amendment in order be an \namendment to be proposed by Senator Warren, which is at the desk, with \nthe time until 1:45 p.m. equally divided in the usual form. I further \nask that no other amendments or motions be in order, aside from budget \npoints of order, if applicable, and that if a point of order is raised, \nthe motion to waive be considered made. I further ask that following \nthe use or yielding back of time and the disposition of any pending \nmotions to waive, the Senate vote on adoption of the Warren amendment, \nthe bill then be read a third time, followed by a vote on passage of \nthe bill, as amended, if amended; and the votes on the Warren amendment \nand passage of the bill, as amended, if amended, be at a 60-vote \naffirmative threshold.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with this agreement we are able to \ncomplete some unfinished business from last Congress and reauthorize \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. These votes will occur this \nafternoon at 1:45. The Energy Committee is meeting this morning to \nreport out the Keystone bill. We will begin processing that bill next \nweek. Those with amendments to Keystone should be working with Chairman \nMurkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell to schedule a time to come and \noffer them. I hope that our colleagues on the Democratic side will \nallow us to get on the bill and start with a fair and open amendment \nprocess on Monday or Tuesday of next week.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. President, the new Republican majority has pledged to run the \nSenate differently and to stop protecting the President from good \nideas. That is why we look forward to the Senate beginning \nconsideration of a bipartisan job-creating infrastructure project, the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. Right now the Keystone jobs bill is being \nconsidered by the committee. The Keystone jobs bill will then be \nsubject to real debate and amendment on the floor of the Senate. Then \nwe plan to send the Senate Keystone jobs bill to the President's desk \nwith bipartisan support.\n  That may be a departure from what Senators have become used to, but \nfor Members on both sides, I think the change will certainly be \nwelcome. I think Senators in both parties are ready to have their \nvoices and the voices of their constituents heard in the Senate. \nSenators understand that Keystone presents a real opportunity for \nWashington to finally prove to America that it can prioritize jobs for \nthem over the demand of powerful special interests. That is what the \nvoters told us they wanted just last November, and that is just exactly \nwhat Washington should aim for now by passing this bipartisan, job-\ncreating infrastructure project.\n  As we consider the Keystone jobs bill, let's keep focused on the real \nissues at hand, such as jobs for the middle class and reliable energy \ncosts for families. Let's also acknowledge that this is not really a \ndebate about the environment. President Obama's own State Department \nhas previously said that Keystone's impact on the environment would \nbasically be negligible. So let's maintain our focus. Let's keep the \nvoters in mind who sent us here and let's remember what they told us \njust last November.\n  One of the things they told us is they would like to see more team \nwork across the aisle. So for a President who\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\nsaid he would like to see more bipartisan cooperation, this, my \ncolleagues, is a perfect opportunity.\n  A number of the many Democratic supporters of this bill have already \nwritten to the President urging him to choose jobs, economic \ndevelopment, and American energy security and approve this pipeline. We \nare asking the President again today to do that by working with us to \nend the gridlock and get this job-creating infrastructure project \nmoving. Keystone has been studied endlessly from almost every possible \nangle, and the same basic conclusion seems to be coming back. The \nconclusion is: Build it. Build it. Keystone construction could support \nthousands of jobs. It could invest billions in our economy. That is why \nDemocrats say build it, Republicans say build it, prominent labor \nunions say build it, and most importantly, the American people say \nbuild it.\n  The President has called for Congress to send him infrastructure \nprojects to sign. Keystone is the largest shovel-ready infrastructure \nproject in the country that makes sense. So we are going to send it to \nhim, and we hope he will sign it. He may ultimately veto an \ninfrastructure project that would increase workers' wages by $2 \nbillion, a project whose construction alone could, according to the \nPresident's own State Department, support many thousands of jobs. He \nmay. Or he may decide to try and make divided government work. Either \nway, this Congress is determined to do what we can to pass bipartisan \njobs legislation. That is what the American people asked us to do, and \nthat is just what we are going to do.\n\n\n               Recognition of the Acting Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The assistant Democratic leader.\n\n\n                           Keystone Pipeline\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the majority leader has stated this \nmorning that we have to stop protecting the President from good ideas \nand use this as his exhibit A--the Keystone Pipeline bill--which is \nlikely to come up for debate before the Senate the beginning of next \nweek. It is an important measure, an important issue that has been \ntalked about over a long period of time, and the actual debate on the \nSenate floor will commence the beginning of next week.\n  The majority leader has moved a bill through the rule XIV process, \nwhich under the Senate rules is an effort to bring a bill directly to \nthe floor and not through the committee. At the same time there is a \nparallel effort under way in the newly formed energy committee of the \nSenate--formed as of yesterday, I might add--to consider this bill, as \nwell, to mark it up. So I am not sure which bill will come to the \nfloor. Perhaps the effort will be merged at some point. But there is no \ndelay from our point of view from any of the motions or objections that \nwe have raised. We ask only that the committee structures be \nestablished so that the bill could go through the orderly process of \ncommittee. That happened yesterday and now it is in the hands of the \nenergy committee. If their markup is going to be perhaps later this \nweek or next week, then we will be prepared to bring this measure to \nthe floor after the regular order process of committee consideration of \nthis bill.\n  This bill, of course, is going to be subject to the new approach of \nthe new majority--amendments on the floor. I welcome that. I have been \nlooking forward to that and a return to that for a long time. We have \nalready said that although we plan on being in the minority for a short \nperiod of time, while in the minority we will not be obstructionist. We \nare going to do our best to work in a constructive fashion toward \nbipartisan solutions. There will come moments of disagreement, and \nMembers will assert their rights and privileges as Members of the \nSenate and will follow the traditions in the rules of the Senate in \nthat regard.\n  I will state that when this measure comes to the floor, there are \nsome important questions that need to be answered. I listened to \nRepublican Senators Blunt and Thune yesterday come to the floor and say \nsomething which puzzled me. I thought there was a question--at least a \nquestion was raised earlier--as to whether the oil that is flowing \nthrough this pipeline is ever going to be sold as a product in the \nUnited States. I don't know the answer to that as I stand here.\n  For the longest time, the companies that wanted to develop this \npipeline and the refinery have not agreed that their product would be \nsold in the United States. Yet I have heard Senator after Senator come \nto the floor and say we have to have more oil in the United States.\n  Initially, as I understand it, this pipeline was to end at a refinery \nin Texas where it could be exported overseas, meaning that the actual \noil product may not benefit American consumers of gasoline and diesel \nfuel.\n  So during the course of this debate on this Keystone Pipeline, \namendments are going to be offered to give Members an opportunity to go \non the record as to whether the ultimate product from the Keystone \nPipeline is going to be sold in the United States and ultimately \nwhether there will be jobs created in the United States as a result of \nit. These are worthy policy questions, and I think they will come up \nduring the course of our amendments.\n  I also take exception to the majority leader's suggestion that this \nparticular measure, the Keystone Pipeline, has been studied endlessly \nand stranded because of the efforts of the President. Let me say, as we \nstand here today discussing the Keystone Pipeline, the court system in \nthe State of Nebraska is still trying to resolve some questions about \nthe location of this pipeline--sensitive questions to our environment.\n  There is an aquifer in this area that they don't want to jeopardize \nby placing the pipeline in the wrong location. They are fighting it out \nin the courts of Nebraska as to the right location and the authority of \nofficials in Nebraska to choose that location. That goes on as we \ndebate it on the Senate floor. So to suggest that this is so-called \nshovel ready and all we need is a green light from Congress and the \nPresident to move forward oversimplifies and overstates the case. I \nwanted to clarify that for the record.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. President, there is an effort under way in the House of \nRepresentatives today to amend the Affordable Care Act. For those of us \nwho voted for it and proudly support the Affordable Care Act, this is \nno surprise. Many of the people who did not vote for it and those on \nthe other side of the aisle have opposed the Affordable Care Act since \nit was signed into law by President Obama. Some believe that opposition \nis grounded in this notion that this is President Obama's Affordable \nCare Act, the so-called ObamaCare. I would say that opposition is not \ngrounded in the reality of what has happened since we passed the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  There are Members of the Senate--Republican Members--who have said \nthey want to veto and eliminate every single word of the Affordable \nCare Act--every single word. One of the Senators from Texas on the \nRepublican side said that the other day. Well, if they do this, it will \nbe disastrous.\n  Let me state the record of the Affordable Care Act to date. The \nAffordable Care Act has given millions of Americans access to health \ninsurance--many of them for the first time in their lives. I have met \nthem in the city of Chicago and around my State. At the same time it \nhas reined in insurance companies and has lowered health care cost \nincreases. Because of this law a person no longer needs to stay in a \njob simply to have health insurance or be denied coverage because of a \npreexisting condition.\n  Who among us does not have a family Member or friend with a \npreexisting condition? Almost anything qualifies as a preexisting \ncondition under the old law. Under the Affordable Care Act you cannot \nbe discriminated against because of a preexisting condition that you \nsuffered from or someone in your family did. When the Republican \nSenator from Texas says he wants to repeal every single word of the \nAffordable Care Act, he is repealing the protection of those with \npreexisting conditions and families with children with preexisting \nconditions from having access to health insurance they can afford.\n  That was the reality of the situation facing America before the \npassage of this bill.\n  I might add that because of the Affordable Care Act, preventive care \nis free and the cost of prescription drugs\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\nfor senior citizens is substantially lower. Those who want to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act are really putting at risk preventive care, \nwhich eliminates some of the worst and most expensive medical \nconditions, and at the same time, they are suggesting that we ought to \nsay to seniors: Pay more for your prescriptions.\n  If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, you will be repealing \nprovisions that help make seniors' prescription drugs affordable.\n  Out of the gate, House Republicans are pursuing an extreme bill that \nthey are considering this week that undermines the Affordable Care Act \nand that is likely to come to the Senate soon and we are told is a high \npriority by the new majority in the Senate.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the House Republican \nbill would increase our Nation's deficit by $45 billion. What happened \nto all these deficit hawks who have been preaching to us day after day \nand week after week about our Nation's deficit? Apparently, when it \ncomes to the Affordable Care Act, they are going to ignore the reality \nthat the bill being considered by the House will add $45 billion to the \nNation's deficit.\n  That bill would also cause 1 million people in America to lose their \nemployer-based health insurance. The purpose of this effort on the \nAffordable Care Act was to give more people insurance coverage. The \nfirst action by the Republican Congress is to take up to 1 million \npeople off of health care coverage from their own employers.\n  This action by House Republicans--soon to be brought to the floor of \nthe Senate--would increase Medicaid and CHIP enrollment by 500,000 to 1 \nmillion people. It will take people off of their coverage where they \nwork and move them into government health insurance programs. Does that \nsound consistent with what we are told over and over is the Republican \nphilosophy? I don't think so.\n  We have had 8 million Americans enroll in private health insurance \nplans since October 1. That is the enrollment. Over 9 million people \nhave gained coverage through Medicaid and CHIP. In Illinois more than \n800,000 people now have health insurance because of the Affordable Care \nAct. Over 217,000 people purchased plans through the Illinois \nmarketplace. My wife and I purchased our plan through a marketplace \nthat was created by the Affordable Care Act. An additional 530,000 \npeople have enrolled in Medicaid in my State.\n  In Illinois, 125,000 young adults have been able to join their \nparents' plan. Any parent with a child in college who is about to \ngraduate knows that this change in the law is dramatic and helpful. \nThose of us who have had kids graduate from college and have worried \nabout their health insurance coverage once they were out of school--\nthis Affordable Care Act says these young people can stay on their \nparents' health insurance policy until they reach the age of 26. While \nthey are looking for a job--internships, travel, part-time jobs--they \nare covered by their parents. It is peace of mind for parents. When \nRepublican Senators say they want to repeal every single word of the \nAffordable Care Act, they want to repeal this provision, which in my \nState is providing coverage for 125,000 young people who can stay under \ntheir parents' plan.\n  According to a Gallup poll released yesterday, the uninsured rate has \ndropped over 4 points since the Affordable Care Act went into effect a \nyear ago. That was our goal--more and more people with health insurance \ncoverage. The uninsured rate that they now report is 12.9 percent. That \nis the lowest point since Gallup began to track this measure of health \ninsurance coverage.\n  The Affordable Care Act includes several changes that are meant to \nhelp slow the growth of health care costs, and they are working. \nInstead of paying hospitals for the services they provide--the old fee-\nfor-service program--hospitals are paid on the basis of making patients \nbetter. If their patients have to go back into the hospital, the \nhospitals are paid less. There is an incentive to take care of people \nand to make sure that when they are finally released, they are ready to \ngo home and not likely to return. Despite climbing readmission rates \nsince 2007, those hospital readmission rates are now falling since the \npassage of the Affordable Care Act and our change in outlook when it \ncomes to health care. Hospitals are responding in a positive way to the \nincentives in the Affordable Care Act, and more of their patients are \ngoing home in better and stronger condition and staying at home.\n  Health care spending per enrollee has slowed in the private insurance \nmarket, in Medicare, and in Medicaid. For the first time in years we \nare seeing the rate of growth in health care costs slow down. That is a \ndramatic increase in opportunity, not just for individuals and \nbusinesses that pay health insurance premiums, but it means less \nexpense for our government. It helps to reduce our deficit.\n  The solvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund is now 13 years longer \nthan it was prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which the \ntrustees in 2010 said had substantially improved the financial status \nof the trust fund.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the law is also helping seniors with the cost \nof their prescription drugs by closing the so-called doughnut hole. \nRemember that crazy provision? It said that if you are getting \nprescription drugs as a senior under Medicare, it would cover the \npurchase of drugs up to a certain point and then you had to pay out-of-\npocket for a certain period of time and then it came back and covered \nagain. We closed the so-called doughnut hole with the Affordable Care \nAct. The Republican Senators, who have vowed to repeal every single \nword of the Affordable Care Act, are going to reopen that doughnut \nhole, which means seniors will have more out-of-pocket expenses for \nprescription drugs.\n\n  Despite all of the successes, some Governors have decided not to \nexpand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, thereby denying health \ninsurance coverage for millions of people in their States. The \nAffordable Care Act has already given about 9 million Americans access \nto Medicaid. By not expanding Medicaid in these other States, these \nGovernors are leaving billions of dollars on the table that could be \nused to cover people in their States, dollars that could be used for \nhealth care for people who need it the most. I met those people. One of \nthem is Ray Romanowski--a great Chicago name. He is a big, barrel-\nchested Polish musician who has played at wedding receptions and \ndifferent events with his band all of his life. That is what he has \ndone for a living. Until now he has never ever had health insurance. He \nqualifies for Medicaid. He has that coverage and carries it in his \npocket proudly, and at age 62 he is glad to have it so he can deal with \nsome of the issues that folks face as they get a little older.\n  Unfortunately, when these Governors decide not to expand Medicaid to \ncover people in their States, everybody pays. People who would \notherwise qualify for Medicaid still need health care. They still get \nsick, they still show up in the emergency room, and basically they get \nthe services at the hospital and the rest of us pay for it. Isn't it \nmore responsible to say that individuals should have their own \nresponsibility to have their own insurance and show up for preventive \ncare to avoid terrible medical conditions?\n  One of the things I worry about is that the proposal before us, which \nSenator McConnell has said is a high priority, will address one of the \nissues regarding when employers have to provide health insurance \ncoverage. It is an issue which was addressed in the bill but has been \ncontroversial.\n  Senator McConnell said: ``Making the switch from 30 to 40 hours is at \nthe top of the GOP's Obamacare priorities.'' This is a provision being \nconsidered by the House of Representatives now, and it is one we ought \nto reflect on for a moment. It may seem simple to some that if you \nraise the requirement to 40 hours of work before the employer has to \npay for health insurance, that it will mean fewer people are going to \nbe disadvantaged. Exactly the opposite is true. The workweek bill \naffects how many people are covered by the employer mandate--the \nrequirement that an employer pay for health insurance which went into \neffect January 1 for businesses with 50 workers or more. These \nbusinesses with more than 50 workers have to offer insurance to 70 \npercent of their full-time workforce this year or pay penalties. Under \nthe law, full time is defined as 30 hours.\n  Critics of this 30-hour rule say it will force employers to slash \nworkers'\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\nhours to escape the penalties. Many Democrats and even some prominent \nconservative policy experts say that the change being considered by the \nHouse of Representatives now will do more harm than good. Millions more \npeople work a traditional 40-hour workweek than a 30-hour workweek, so \nputting the cutoff at 40 hours gives employers an incentive to game the \nhours of their workers--a much larger group of workers. In other words, \nif you are not required to provide health insurance unless an employee \nis working 40 hours, the House action creates an incentive for \nemployers to avoid the mandate by reducing the hours worked by those \nwho are currently working 40 hours.\n  The Cato Institute is no liberal think tank; it is one of the most \nconservative. Cato Institute scholar Michael Cannon wrote Wednesday \nthat the bill now being considered by the House might lighten \nObamaCare's business burden but drive up government spending by making \nmore people eligible for health care subsidies. He wrote, ``How is that \na policy victory?'' and added that it is a wrongheaded strategy. He \nsaid, ``This proposed change would actually do a lot of harm, not just \nto the Affordable Care Act but to a substantial number of people across \nthe country.''\n  Our leader on this issue is Senator Patty Murray. Senator Murray is \nthe ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee, and she issued a \nstatement this week which really is spot-on when it comes to the \nwrongheaded approach being considered by House Republicans and soon to \nbe brought up here. The Senate HELP Committee may take up the bill as \nsoon as the end of this month.\n  The Senate HELP Committee ranking Democrat, Patty Murray, pledged to \nfight the change. Here is what she said:\n\n       It's deeply disappointing that as one of their first \n     priorities, Republicans are putting forward a proposal that \n     would not only hurt workers by denying them the health care \n     coverage they depend on, but would actually encourage \n     companies to cut many workers' hours across the country.\n\n  The independent Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that the \nHouse bill would add $53.2 billion to our Nation's deficit from 2015 to \n2025 because fewer businesses would pay the fines and because some of \nthe employees who would have been covered at work are now going to be \ncovered by government programs. The CBO estimates that 1 million \nAmericans would lose the health care coverage they currently have at \nwork if the Republicans proposal prevails and up to 1 million will end \nup on government programs as result of it. This is the wrong approach.\n  I say to my friends in the retail and restaurant industry, the offer \nthat I made and that I am sure many others have made is still there. \nLet's sit down on a bipartisan basis and find the right solution. This \neffort to stop the progress of the Affordable Care Act, increase the \ndeficit, push more people into government coverage, and eliminate \nhealth coverage for millions of Americans across the country is the \nwrong way to approach it at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/08/senate-section/article/S72-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S72]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, both \nDemocratic and Republican, to urge the swift passage of a bill in the \nSenate that would create jobs, strengthen our economy, and put more \nmoney in Americans' pocketbooks--the bipartisan Hoeven-Manchin bill to \nauthorize the Keystone XL Pipeline. I will talk about that for a few \nminutes, and then I might have some remarks about what the assistant \nminority leader has said.\n  I wish to address the Keystone Pipeline project and why it is \nimportant, but first I will focus on how the Keystone debate reflects \non the state of the Senate and on good governance more broadly. After \nall, this project is now in its sixth year of limbo, waiting for a \nsingle permit to be issued. This debate has gone on longer than an \nentire term of the Senate.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, recently commented that the \nAmerica public no longer has confidence that the Federal Government \nworks anymore. He is right, and the American people are justified in \ntheir skepticism. He is right. This project is a perfect example of \nwhy.\n  A debate over the merits of and drawbacks to the pipeline--a debate \nthat centers upon sound science and agreed-upon ground rules--is long \noverdue.\n  Such a debate represents the best traditions of the Senate--a meeting \nof minds where respect and tolerance shape the contours of debate. Such \na debate is particularly valuable because a commonsense regulatory \nprocess is integral to a sound economy and the rule of law.\n  Time and again, President Obama has suggested that an issue such as \nthis is too important to get bogged down in politics and that we should \ntrust in the integrity of the regulatory process. To this I have two \nreplies.\n  First, this is exactly the sort of debate we should be having in the \nSenate. This is the body that is supposed to debate the important \nissues of the day. When a project as important as this is stalled \nwithout meaningful justification for so long, our investment and \ninvolvement is even more important. In this case, we have sought to \nlegislate according to the best traditions of this body, reaching \nacross the aisle and taking all voices into account.\n  Second, curtailing debate on this issue has only had the result of \nturning the construction of what should be a commonsense infrastructure \nproject into an abstraction, a political symbol that has little to do \nwith the actual proposal under consideration. Without discussion of \nfacts and evidence in this Chamber--all of which I believe counsel in \nfavor of approving the project--the opposition has been able to \nobfuscate the facts and avoid having to defend their position. The \nSenate is a place where we can best accomplish good policymaking, not \npolitical grandstanding, especially on an issue of such importance as \nthe Keystone Pipeline.\n  I was encouraged by yesterday's colloquy on the resolution to allow \nthe Keystone Pipeline to move forward because it represents a return to \nthe way we should talk about serious issues; that is, through actual \ndebate. But that colloquy and the work we are doing today has been met \nwith further resistance from the White House. Even before we consider \nany number of amendments from both sides of the aisle, the President \nhas already threatened to veto our legislation calling for pipeline \nconstruction to move forward. This is an unfortunate way for any \nPresident to begin work with a new Congress.\n  Our country and North American energy security will greatly benefit \nfrom this project. It improves efficiency and energy infrastructure. It \ntakes pressure off of moving oil by rail. It will increase our GDP by \napproximately $3.4 billion annually. The State Department, which has \nprovided clear-headed analysis of the benefits of this project, has \nfound that Keystone will support roughly 42,000 jobs during the \nconstruction phase alone. It will provide refineries with up to 830,000 \nbarrels a day of North American oil.\n  The Keystone Pipeline is an environmentally sound way to transport \nthis oil. In fact, the State Department's extensive environmental \nimpact statement concluded that building the pipeline would actually be \nbetter for the environment than not. We have to be clear: The oil is \ngoing to go to market no matter what--by truck or rail, if not by \npipeline. Building this pipeline takes this oil off of the tracks, off \nof\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nthe roads, and transports it in a way that is safer, more efficient, \nmore environmentally sound, and better for creating good-paying \nAmerican jobs.\n  At the end of the day, the Keystone Pipeline and so many other \nbureaucratic failures demonstrate that the regulatory process is \nbroken. It should not take years and years navigating the Federal \nbureaucracy only to have the Federal Government decide not to make a \ndecision. In this new Congress we are focused on helping to create jobs \nand getting our economy back on the right track, which is why \nregulatory reform will be a key part of our agenda over the next 2 \nyears. I hope the President will change his mind and join us not only \nin approving this important project but also in preventing similar \nabuses from occurring in the future.\n\n\n                          affordable care act\n\n  Mr. President, having said that, I wish to make a few remarks about \nwhat the distinguished assistant minority leader had to say this \nmorning about the Affordable Care Act. I have a great deal of \nadmiration for him and his abilities, especially to articulate matters. \nI have to disagree with him on this issue, because after all of this \nhoopla, after all of the problems, after all of the costs, after all of \nthe rising costs, after all of the many problems with the Affordable \nCare Act, we are still going to have about 30 million people who don't \nhave insurance.\n  Think about it. That is why we passed the Affordable Care Act--or why \nthe Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act--was to take care of those \npeople. We have a great many people covered, but there is still going \nto be almost the same amount of people without health insurance that \nexisted before.\n  A number of the provisions he finds so good about the health care \nbill, we would have included in a health care bill ourselves. Yes, \nthere were needed changes, such as this business of putting children on \nthe parents' policy until age 26 and some of the other provisions the \ndistinguished Senator spoke to.\n  I have a great deal of admiration for the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois. He is a very bright guy. He is one of the most articulate \nSenators in this body. Having said that, I was a little disappointed in \nsome of the statements he made.\n  Just this week Harvard University--these are professors who are \npretty well paid--yes, it is an expensive jurisdiction, I know, because \nI have some family there. The fact is that at Harvard these professors \nare upset because their costs are going up, which they will have to pay \nout of their own pockets. My goodness gracious. If they think they are \nbeing hurt, with their high salaries--and most of it is covered by \ntheir insurance from Harvard--can we imagine how the average person is \ngoing to feel. They are going to have a rough time because they have \nheld off on a lot of the Affordable Care Act--I should say ``Affordable \nCare Act''--they held off on this until after the election that just \noccurred, knowing the costs are going to continue to escalate and rise \nin ways that we can't even take care of them. If we don't do something \nabout it now, it is going to be a doggone mess in this country that \nnobody--nobody--not my friends on the other side who voted for it or \nRepublicans or anybody else can truly contemplate.\n  All I can say is that it is a mess. Most people are admitting it is a \nmess, except those who want to take us down this social path toward \nhaving the government control every aspect of our lives in health care. \nTo be honest, I could talk all day on this issue, but we are on the \nKeystone Pipeline. I have to say, as somebody who helped put through \nsome of the most important health care bills in history, ranging from \nthe orphan drug bill to the Children's Health Insurance Program, many \npharmaceutical bills and others as well, I have always been willing to \nsit down and try and work these matters out. I have to say that my dear \ncolleague from Illinois, having chosen one Senator's comments about \nevery word, doesn't represent everybody on this side. Any Senator is \nentitled to their viewpoint and opinion, but a lot of us believe there \nis a great deal of work that has to be done if we are going to have \nhealth care truly improve in this country and work the way it should \nwork.\n  I could go on and on, but I just wanted to make a few of those \ncomments. Even with the so-called 8 million they claim have health \ncare--I don't know that that is true.\n  They have problems in every step of this program, and the reason is \nbecause it is a poorly written program that was forced through in ways \nthat didn't allow the real process in the Senate to work. Whenever we \nhave a bill that is that high off the floor, passed by only one side--\nin both Houses by only one side--we know it is a lousy bill. There is \nnothing that costs as much as this bill is going to cost.\n  I would challenge my friends on the other side--especially my friend \nfrom Illinois--to acknowledge that we need to work together to solve \nthese problems because they are not going to go away. That bill is one \nof the lousiest pieces of legislation I have seen in the whole time I \nhave been here, and that is why it was only supported in a totally \npartisan way.\n  I have talked long enough on this. I don't want to take more time \naway from the Keystone Pipeline because that also is extremely \nimportant. Right now we are down to 50 bucks a barrel or even below, \nbut that isn't going to last a long time. The fact that we have oil \nnow, that we are discovering oil now--something that wasn't allowed in \nyears past--the fact that we are working to have this country be \ntotally oil independent is terrific, and the Keystone Pipeline will \nhelp us in that regard. It is hard for me to understand why my friends \non the other side or at least some of them--and maybe the President, \nwho has issued a veto threat which I found profoundly disappointing--\ncontinue to argue the way they do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, just for clarification, it is my \nunderstanding that H.R. 26 has been reported on the floor and we now \nhave 2 hours of debate equally divided; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 1:45 p.m. is equally divided.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise to speak in favor \nof H.R. 26, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act or \nwhat is more popularly known as the TRIA legislation.\n  During the last Congress my colleagues and I worked hard to put \ntogether a bipartisan bill that gained wide support. However, literally \nin the waning hours of the session, we were unable to complete our work \nat the end of the last Congress. I am very glad to see that this \nlegislation has now been moved promptly by the House of Representatives \nand again promptly today in the Senate toward finalization and passage.\n  I particularly wish to thank the majority leader for bringing this \nbill to the floor so quickly because reauthorization of the TRIA \nProgram is essential for the certainty we need in our insurance \nmarketplace and for other important functions in our markets. I also \nwish to recognize some of the Senators who have been very heavily \ninvolved in this process in the past. There are many who could be \nnamed, but in particular I think we need to recognize Senator Kirk and \nSenator Heller on the Republican side and Senator Schumer and Senator \nReed on the Democratic side, as well as Senator Brown, our new ranking \nmember on the Democratic side, and many others who have worked to help \nus move this legislation forward.\n  Additionally, I wish to give thanks to the former chairman of the \nbanking committee, Senator Johnson and his staff, who deserve a great \namount of thanks as they have worked with us very closely in moving \nthis bill forward, and of course my own staff on the Republican side \nwho have put in so much time and effort to make sure we got this \nimportant legislation moved over the finish line. Working together we \ndeveloped a bill that was supported unanimously out of the banking \ncommittee in what was a very partisan environment that we can all \nrecall from last Congress. We then approved it in the Senate by a vote \nof 93 to 4, showing the broad, bipartisan support that has been \ndeveloped for this legislation.\n  Building on the Senate's framework, the House passed their own \nversion of TRIA last Congress by an overwhelming vote of 417 to 7. \nYesterday in\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nthis new Congress the House again voted by a margin of 416 to 5 to \nextend the program another 6 years--the legislation that is currently \nbefore us in the Senate. These strong votes demonstrate the importance \nof this program.\n  Chairman Hensarling, Representative Neugebauer, Senator Schumer, and \nothers deserve our thanks for bringing the differences to a focus and \ngetting us to this point.\n  This bill requires the private insurance industry to absorb and cover \nthe losses for all but the largest acts of terror--ones in which the \nFederal Government would almost certainly be forced to step in if this \nprogram were not in place.\n  The bill increases the insurance industry's aggregate retention level \nand the company coinsurance level, meaning that it increases the \nparticipation of the private sector in responding to the insurance \nissues created by an act of terrorism in the United States but still \nprovides the stability the market needs to assure there is coverage and \nprotection. Once it reaches that level, the recoupment will be indexed \nto the amount of insurer deductibles for all insurers participating in \nthe program. This is a significant reduction in the potential exposure \nand cost to taxpayers.\n\n  Under this bill each company will take on a greater portion of losses \nabove their deductible. This is done by increasing the coinsurance \nlevel from 15 percent to 20 percent and raising the level at which the \nprogram is triggered from $100 million to $200 million. As these levels \nare increased, the Federal share is reduced.\n  This bill maintains the amendment offered by Senator Flake to create \nan advisory committee focused on finding additional private sector \nsolutions to lowering the Federal exposure to loss from a catastrophic \nterrorist incident in the United States. Getting terrorism risk \ninsurance right is important in order to protect taxpayers and to limit \nthe economic and physical impact of any future terrorist attack on the \nUnited States.\n  This bill will help us maintain a properly balanced terrorism risk \ninsurance program that increases the Nation's economic resilience to \nterrorism.\n  The bill also includes separate legislation that will establish the \nNational Association of Registered Agents and Brokers or what is \ncommonly known as NARAB. I have been an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation in the past because it simplifies the process of agent \nlicensing across State lines while preserving States rights--\nspecifically, the authority of state insurance regulators.\n  The bill has broad support from the insurance community, including \nthe National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Independent \nInsurance Agents and Brokers of America, the National Association of \nInsurance and Financial Advisors, and the Council of Insurance Agents \nand Brokers.\n  By reducing costs and increasing competition among insurance \nproducers, we will generate lower costs and better service for \nconsumers.\n  Importantly, NARAB II, this legislation, deals specifically with \nmarketplace entry and would not impact the States' day-to-day authority \nover the insurance marketplaces. State regulators will serve on the \nboard of NARAB with the same objectives they have as insurance \ncommissions--to protect the public interest by promoting the fair and \nequitable treatment of insurance consumers. The idea for NARAB is now \n14 years old, and I am very glad to see we are now going to get it \nacross the finish line.\n  The final TRIA bill includes the Vitter amendment that was added in \nthe Senate to require that the Federal Reserve Board have at least one \nmember with experience working in or supervising community banks.\n  Finally, the bill also includes a very critical reform to the Dodd-\nFrank financial legislation. This commonly has been referred to as the \nend user amendment issue--a piece of legislation that historically has \nalso received wide bipartisan support. This is a targeted fix I have \nbeen pushing for over 4 years. Ever since the Dodd-Frank conference, \nthere has been a debate regarding whether nonfinancial end users were \nexempt from margin requirements. Most Americans won't really understand \nthe details of these kinds of transactions if they aren't involved in \nthe derivatives industry. But it is critical that we allow end users, \nthose who produce products or provide services--those are the ones who \nare using the financial system and the benefits it can provide to \nprovide productive additions to our economy--that they not be subjected \nto the rigorous requirements that were put into place to control \nfinancial sector dealings in derivatives.\n  Then-Chairman Dodd and Senator Lincoln acknowledged that the language \nfor end users was not perfect and tried to clarify the intent of their \nlanguage with a joint letter. In the letter, they stated:\n\n       The legislation does not authorize the regulators to impose \n     margins on end-users, those exempt entities that use swaps to \n     hedge or mitigate commercial risk. If regulators raise the \n     costs of end-user transactions, they may create more risk. It \n     is imperative that the regulators do not unnecessarily divert \n     working capital from our economy into margin accounts, in a \n     way that would discourage hedging by end-users or impair \n     economic growth.\n\n  I might add to that quote from these Senators that it would also \nincrease costs in the marketplace to consumers.\n  Stand-alone legislation passed the House to fix this problem last \nCongress with 411 votes--broad bipartisan support. In the Senate, \nlegislation to deal with the end-user program was introduced originally \nby a bipartisan group of six Democrats and six Republicans. \nCongressional intent was to provide an explicit exemption from margin \nrequirements for nonfinancial end users that qualify for the clearing \nexemption, which this language accomplishes.\n  Unless Congress acts, the new regulations will make it more expensive \nfor farmers, manufacturers, energy producers, and many small business \nowners across this country to manage their own unique business risks \nassociated with their daily operations--an unintended and harmful \nconsequence of the language in the Dodd-Frank legislation.\n  I mentioned in my earlier statement that this bill had the support of \n93 Senators in the last Congress. The final bill before us today passed \nthe House by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 5.\n  Again, I encourage all of the Senators to vote for the legislation we \nhave before us today and help this first piece of legislation in the \nSenate in this Congress get a quick resolution so we can resolve one--\nin fact, two or three--of the critical issues facing our economy today, \nhelp strengthen our economy, promote jobs, and increase our movement \nalong the pathway toward economic recovery.\n  Again, I thank Senator Schumer, Senator Reed, Senator Kirk, and \nSenator Heller for their partnership in bringing this bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on H.R. 26, the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program. I thank Senator Crapo, and I \nappreciate and enjoy the relationship we have had over the last 8 years \nsince I joined the banking committee. He was already a relatively \nveteran member of that committee and very knowledgeable and very \nstraightforward and fair. I appreciate his work, especially on this \nlegislation.\n  I support the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance \nProgram, and I did not want it to expire in December. Many of us on \nboth sides of the aisle in the Senate worked to try to get this \nreenacted in December. Unfortunately, because of partisan games in the \nHouse of Representatives, it didn't happen. But that is why I voted for \nTRIA reauthorization, S. 2244, in the banking committee last June. I \nsupported the bill that the full Senate passed in July by a strong vote \nof 93 to 4. S. 2244 made important reforms to TRIA in order to gain \nbipartisan support, but it still provided long-term certainty in the \nmarketplace.\n  What was unfortunate was that last fall the House Republicans were \nunable to embrace the Senate bill--similar to immigration, if you \nwill--that had broad bipartisan support. They waited until the last \ndays of the last Congress to engage the Senate in an effort to \nreauthorize TRIA. The situation could be dangerous if it is \nunauthorized. Fortunately, we will be able to move today and get this \nto the President pretty quickly and at least protect our cities and our \ncommunities and our people.\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n  While the TRIA provisions the House and Senate eventually agreed on \nwent further than I would have liked, they represent a compromise--\nsomething we obviously don't see enough around here these days. \nUltimately, though, the swap end-user provision that was added by House \nleadership to the TRIA bill at the last moment was not a compromise. It \nwas moving in a different direction. It was a weakening of Dodd-Frank. \nIt was not the way this Congress or any Congress should enact \nlegislation and should proceed. That end-user provision did not go \nthrough regular order in the Senate. The committee held no hearings and \nno markups to consider its merits or its demerits. This bill was never \nbrought to the Senate floor to be debated.\n  That is what people, whether in Florida or Idaho or Ohio, are unhappy \nabout--legislation that needs to pass, things for which there is \nstrong, bipartisan, across-the-board, almost unanimous support, and \nthen special interest groups get provisions in that don't belong there \nthat were not debated and never discussed.\n  Unlike TRIA, the swap end-user provision is controversial and \noverrides regulators' proposed rules. It prevents future regulatory \nflexibility. It allows another avenue for derivatives risk to build up \nin the financial system.\n  These actions of inserting this provision in legislation with \noverwhelming, almost unanimous support--adding these kinds of \nprovisions simply doesn't work for our system. It is not the way we \nshould be legislating. It begs the question, Did we learn nothing less \nthan a decade ago? We know what happened to our financial system. The \ngreed on Wall Street and the pain it caused on Main Street in Boise, \nPocatello, Columbus, and Cleveland was pretty hard to measure.\n  The financial crisis exposed risks in all areas of the market, and \nthe provisions in Wall Street reform target dangerous exposure in the \nsystem by strengthening protections using clearing and margin \nrequirements.\n  Under Wall Street Reform, commercial end users are exempt from \nclearing requirements, and regulators have provided them with \naccommodations from margin requirements, recognizing the business-\nrelated need of the companies.\n  The end-user legislation added to the TRIA bill goes above and beyond \nthe existing law and the existing rulemaking and could tie regulators' \nhands in the future if excessive risks were to develop, thus exposing \nthe financial system and taxpayers to more harm.\n  In just one example that this end-user provision could cut both ways, \n2 days before Christmas Reuters reported that ``major U.S. airlines \nincluding Delta and Southwest are rushing to finance losing bets on oil \nand revamp fuel hedges as tumbling crude prices leave them with \nbillions of dollars in losses, according to people familiar with the \nhedging schemes.''\n  We know most of us are thrilled with the price of gasoline at the \npump going significantly below $2 a gallon. We know there are other \npeople who are a little bit less thrilled, as this story illustrates \nwith Delta and Southwest. We know the economy of Texas and North Dakota \nhave had problems because oil revenues declined. We know all of that, \nbut we also know that when you enact provisions such as this that \naren't debated and aren't discussed, that haven't had hearings, there \ncould be unforeseen consequences.\n  Less than 7 years after the financial crisis, we shouldn't forget the \nrisks involved. Let's not forget the impact of the financial crisis on \nconsumers, investors, taxpayers, and the financial system as a whole. \nWhat we do here has impact in Omaha and in Cleveland, and it is \nimportant that we really understand what we are doing by going through \nregular orders. Slipping this provision in the TRIA bill is just the \nlatest Republican effort to roll back Wall Street reform.\n  In December, we know the same cast of characters attached an \neffective repeal of section 716, the Lincoln amendment, to the end-of-\nthe-year spending bill. Yesterday they tried--and thankfully failed--to \npass a bill consisting of 11 smaller bills that included attempts to \nweaken a number of important Dodd-Frank provisions.\n  I don't like the way this has been done today. I want to see TRIA \npass. We have seen this movie before. We will keep seeing it over and \nover again. This seems to be the new Wall Street playbook. It seems to \nbe the new Republican playbook. I hope it is not the Senate \nleadership's playbook, where you take a bill that most people like, \nthat has pretty much overwhelming support, is a must-pass bill, and you \nhelp Wall Street and Wall Street lobbyists get provisions in, and they \ncan weaken consumer protections. Consumer protections rules on Wall \nStreet will keep Wall Street safer so we don't have to have another \nFederal bailout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I wish to thank my colleagues \nwho were here today. This is Senator Brown's first--just a day into the \nsession as ranking member, and it is clear to all of us in the caucus \nthat he is going to be a hard-working, conscientious ranking member, \nand I look forward to working with him and congratulate him on his new \nposition. I thank my good friend Senator Crapo, who will be leaving as \nranking member. We have the new ranking member and the former ranking \nmember. I wish that were not the case but so be it. Senator Crapo has \nbeen a pleasure to work with on this bill and on so many other bills. I \nappreciate his hard work as well.\n  I rise today in support of reauthorizing the terrorism insurance \nprogram--a purpose that has brought me to the floor of this body \nseveral times in the last year. We all know what a crucial piece of \nlegislation TRIA is for our country. It should be reauthorized and \nreauthorized without political jockeying and attempts at point-scoring \nthat we have seen through several months. But the good news is that \nTRIA will pass today and millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of \nrelief, not just those who insure buildings and build buildings but \npeople who work in buildings, office workers, restaurant workers, those \nwho work at shopping centers, sports fans, those who care about having \nnew stadiums. All of those depend on terrorism risk insurance.\n\n  We all know the history. After 9/11, when my city was devastated, \npeople could not get financing to build new buildings. Insurance said \nthe damage from terrorism, both loss of life and property damage, is so \ngreat that they were not going to insure without a Federal backstop.\n  In a bipartisan way we came together in 2002 and passed the TRIA \nbill. It helped propel the economy for the last decade. Because some on \nthe other side are not sure this should be a government function, we \ncould not make it permanent. It would be a lot better if we could, but \nwe extended it for periods of years. It came to pass that it expired on \nDecember 31 of this last year, 2014.\n  In the Senate the bill I was proud to sponsor, helped by my \ncosponsors, Senators Murphy, Jack Reed, Tim Johnson, Menendez, Kirk, \nHeller, Crapo, Blunt, and Johanns, we anticipated no problem. The bill \npassed 93 to 4. Senators from Bernie Sanders to Ted Cruz voted for it.\n  Everyone thought it worked. It has not cost the government a nickel. \nIt will pass easily. But unfortunately it got caught up in the \nmachinations of the House. There were some on the House side who did \nnot want terrorism insurance at all and some who were extremely \nreluctant. I will say this: I believe Speaker Boehner and Majority \nLeader McCarthy understood the importance of this. I worked with them \nin the latter months of last year to try and get a bill done. At the \nend of the day I was able to negotiate a bill with the chairman of the \nHouse banking committee who was at best a reluctant supporter of \nterrorism insurance and came up with a proposal that made some changes \nbut kept the program intact.\n  It was a good compromise. It is the compromise that is before us \ntoday. It is a little different than the original bill. Instead of 7 \nyears, it extends us for 6 years. The $100 million limit has been \nraised to 200. But still, the program can function very well under \nthese proposals. I am very glad we have brought it to the floor very \nearly in this session. I am glad it passed the House. I am glad that \nhopefully by the end of today it will be moving to the President's \ndesk.\n  But there is one sour note in all of this; that is, the attempt--and \nI agree completely with my colleague from\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\nOhio, the ranking member, Mr. Brown, that the idea to add extraneous \nmeasures to this provision is a wrong one. In my view, Dodd-Frank has \nstrengthened the financial system, the banking system, and this \ncountry. The loose regulatory regime that was in place before, everyone \nagreed, helped cause the worst financial collapse we have had since the \nGreat Depression.\n  There are some on the other side I understand who disagree with that \nview. That is something that will obviously be subject to debate. But \nto attach a provision at the last minute, which is what the House did \nat the end of last year, put it on the bill and said take it or leave \nit, is wrong and unfair. I think every fairminded person, whatever \ntheir view of Dodd-Frank is, would feel that we should debate an \nimportant amendment, any amendment, that would roll back parts of Dodd-\nFrank, given the fact that most everyone who has looked at it has \nthought it has been a success.\n  So that, plus a change in the NARAB provision, which my colleagues \nhave mentioned, led to some problems. We on this Democratic side, while \nwe do not like the rollback of Dodd-Frank in the end user provision, \neven last year were not prepared to stop the bill from going forward.\n  But the change our House Republican colleagues made was blocked by a \nRepublican, Senator Coburn, and at the last minute, in the waning hours \nof the session, it was stymied. Today Senator Coburn, my dear friend \nwhom I miss--and I wish him the best of health--is not here. He will \nnot be here. He will not be here to object to the unanimous consent \nrequest that was made in a bipartisan way. So we were voting on this \nbill.\n  But the bottom line is simple. Republicans monkeyed around with the \nbipartisan compromise to earn a pound of flesh in what they knew was a \nmust-pass piece of legislation. I am glad it will not kill the bill, \nbut it never should have been there to begin with. The amendment that \nwill be proposed will allow many on this side of the aisle who believe \nin TRIA but did not want to see at the last minute a rollback of Dodd-\nFrank, albeit one of the smaller rollbacks that has been proposed, to \nride on the back of the important antiterrorism proposal.\n  Using must-pass unrelated legislation to chip away at Dodd-Frank \npiece by piece, even small pieces such as the end user provision, \nwithout debate or even in the committee process, is not how we should \ngo about the business of considering important regulations on financial \nservices. I join Ranking Member Brown in saying that should not happen \nin the future, and we should do everything to stop it from happening.\n  The good news is in this new session there were attempts by some on \nthe Republican side to dilute the TRIA provisions further. From what I \nam told, Chairman Hensarling wanted to dilute it further, despite the \nnegotiations we had. I thank our Republican leadership for not allowing \nthat to happen, the Republican leadership in the House. So the same \nbasic compromise that Chairman Hensarling and I negotiated in the wee \nhours of the last year's session will be on the floor today. TRIA will \nnot be weakened any further. I am proud of the compromise Congressman \nHensarling and I reached on the substance of TRIA. I am hopeful we can \npass a bill without extraneous issues. I certainly believe TRIA should \nbe signed into law as quickly as possible, because we all know that if \nwe do not have terrorism insurance, it is going to greatly hurt our \neconomy.\n  The damage has been minimized because most of the insurance clauses \nhave 30- and 60-day notice provisions, so there has been no effect up \nto now. But if we dither any further, it will have serious effects on \nour rebounding economy, effects that I think no one who cares about \njobs, who cares about working people, who cares about new construction \nin America would want to count.\n  I am glad TRIA will pass today. Our country needs it. I thank again \nall of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both Houses who \nworked hard to do this. I hope we will not find what happened today \nhappening again, which is adding extraneous rollbacks to Dodd-Frank, \nwithout debate, without discussion, to future legislation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I do not see another speaker on our side \nso I would like to take a few minutes and just respond to some of the \nremarks of my colleagues.\n  First of all, let me say I am very pleased to see that we have strong \nsupport across the aisle on a bipartisan basis for two of the three key \nparts of this legislation, the reauthorization of TRIA--or the \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program--and the NARAB provision for the \ninsurance industry. It appears that the focus of the debate between us \nor disagreement between us is going to come down to that part of the \nbill that deals with the end user exemption under the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation. So I would like to talk about that for a little bit, \nbecause in some of the arguments about this provision there has been \nthe implication that this is an effort to help strengthen Wall Street \nat the expense of Main Street. The reality is just the reverse. This is \nan opportunity to try to stop unintended and bad legislative language \nfrom hammering Main Street under the guise that it was to protect us \nagainst Wall Street.\n  Let me explain what I mean. Derivatives are--I am reading right now \nfrom the summary of the House bill, which is the version of the \nlanguage we are going to be voting on today. I will be reading and \nsummarizing some. But derivatives are contracts whose value is linked \nto changes in another variable, such as the price of a physical \ncommodity.\n  My colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, referenced Delta Airlines, \nwhich buys contracts for fuel for their airplanes. They do this in \norder to hedge the risk on the price of fuel. It is a critical part of \ntheir risk management for their business. Other businesses, farmers in \nIdaho, hedge their risks in their farming and ranching operations in \nthe same way, by trying to make sure they have protected the price of \ncertain commodities they need to utilize in the conduct of their \nbusiness.\n  Derivatives have historically been used by large businesses, such as \nDelta, and small, such as the Idaho farmer, and everything in between, \nto manage the risk of their business. End users trade in derivatives to \nhedge business and economic risk. That is very important to understand \nbecause over time derivatives have grown and the use of an investment \nin derivatives has grown. Instead of just end users trying to manage \nrisks in commodities for their products and for their physical needs \nand business needs, many derivatives, in fact probably most of the \nmany--more than a majority of the derivatives that are invested in \ntoday are no longer based on a physical commodity but are linked to \nvariables such as interest rates or stock prices or currency valuations \nor other factors such as that.\n  The market in derivatives has moved into areas that are similar to \ninvestments such as in the stock market. Because of that, Dodd-Frank \nsought to--and one of those kinds of activities was one of the big \nproblems in the financial collapse. So Dodd-Frank tried to address that \nabuse of derivatives that was found during the time of the financial \ncollapse.\n  But it was never intended to deal with the original utilization of \nthe derivatives by end users--again, as I said earlier, those who \nproduce a product such as a farmer or deliver a service such as airline \ntransportation similar to Delta Airlines or others, those who utilize \nderivatives in their business to hedge a business risk and economic \nrisk as opposed to those who invest in derivatives for speculation in a \nmarket. That distinction was very important.\n  I was on the conference committee when we did the conference \ncommittee on Dodd-Frank. We discussed this then. Everyone, literally \nall of us, including the two sponsors of the bill, Senator Dodd and \nRepresentative Frank, agreed that end users were not intended to be \ncovered.\n  In fact, I will quote again the language that Dodd--after the passage \nof\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\nDodd-Frank--put into a letter along with his then-colleague Senator \nLincoln. This is Senator Dodd's language:\n\n       The legislation does not authorize the regulators to impose \n     margins on end users, those exempt entities that use swaps to \n     hedge or mitigate commercial risk. If regulators raise the \n     cost of end user transactions, they may create more risk.\n\n  I am still quoting Senator Dodd--continuing: ``It is imperative that \nthe regulators do not unnecessarily divert working capital from our \neconomy into margin accounts, in a way that would discourage hedging by \nend users or impair economic growth.''\n  So it was not the intent, although it was a concern at the time that \nthe language may have gone too far. But clearly the sponsors of the \namendment--and I don't have the language in front of me, but \nRepresentative Frank has made similar comments that it was not intended \nfor this to be covered by the legislation. But the language actually \ndid go so far as to cover end users.\n  Now the regulators, in hearings before the banking committee, have \nuniformly told us they feel their hands are tied and that following the \nlanguage of Dodd-Frank they have to start imposing margin requirements \non end users, which will cause the kind of economic harm which I have \ndiscussed earlier. So it is necessary for Congress to respond and \nclarify that this exemption exists for end users in our financial \nsystem.\n  Now, one of the arguments that has been made--actually, before I move \non to that, let me go back and give a couple of examples. This is, I \nbelieve, from testimony that was given in the House, where hearings \nhave been held multiple times on this issue. It is true we haven't been \nable to get hearings in the Senate on this issue, but it doesn't mean \nthe issue hasn't been raised in the Senate.\n  I personally, in 2011, brought an amendment to an appropriations bill \nto make this exemption part of the law and was stopped by the then-\nmajority, who said they would not allow either a vote or a hearing on \nthe issue. So it is true that we have not been able to engage in \nhearings or votes in the Senate on this issue, but it is not true that \nwe have not been engaging in trying to get to this issue in the Senate.\n  In the House they were able to hold hearings. I wish to quote a \ncouple of examples of testimony that were made in the House. This first \none is from the CEO of MillerCoors, Craig Reiners, who gave this \ntestimony said:\n\n       MillerCoors uses derivatives for the sole purpose of \n     reducing commercial risk associated with our business. At \n     MillerCoors, we brew beer, and our commitment to our \n     customers is to produce the best beer in the United States \n     and to deliver it at a competitive price. In order to achieve \n     these goals, we must find a way to mitigate and prudently \n     manage our inherent commodity risks.\n\n  This is what the end users do. The other example is Ball Corporation, \nwhich is a supplier of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and \nfood industries. In testimony in the House, the CFO of Ball stated:\n\n       A requirement for end-users to post margin would have a \n     serious impact on our ability to invest in and grow our \n     business. For example, Ball is currently investing \n     significant amounts of capital in plant expansions in Texas, \n     Indiana, California, and Colorado, totaling well in excess of \n     $150 million, and adding several hundred jobs when complete. \n     Tying up capital for initial and variation margin could put \n     those types of projects at risk at a time when our economy \n     can ill afford it. The impact of posting initial margin for \n     us can easily exceed $100 million, while the change in value \n     on our trades over time could easily surpass $300 million. \n     Diverting more than $400 million of working capital into \n     margin accounts would have a direct and adverse impact on our \n     ability to grow our business and create and maintain jobs.\n\n  Again, my point is the end-user exemption must distinguish between \nthose who invest in derivatives for speculation and those who invest in \nderivatives in order to control and hedge risk in their business--a \ncritical distinction. Economists, experts, and regulators alike have \nsaid that imposing those extra margin requirements on the end user will \nhave negative economic effects and not positive stabilizing economic \neffects.\n  Having said that, I want to move forward. Again, going back to the \nHouse report--and I am almost done--it says:\n\n       However, derivative end-users, the firms trying to manage \n     their risk, rather than speculate for profits, do not pose a \n     systemic risk. Furthermore, forcing end-users to post margin \n     in the form of cash or government securities could cause \n     harmful effects for the economy and consumers. If end-users \n     are posting a margin, those funds are unavailable for \n     investment in jobs and expansion.\n\n  That means we are pulling capital out of our economy unnecessarily \nand in a harmful way, in the very arena--not Wall Street but Main \nStreet--the very arena where we need capital formation and need the \nkind of growth in our economy that would then cause us to generate \ngreater jobs, strength, and stability.\n  The examples I have used were examples of companies that were dealing \nin hundreds of millions of dollars of issues. But as I said earlier, \nthis is not just that. Small businesses, ranchers, farmers, and others, \nall utilize this in order to hedge their commodity risks and their \nbusiness risks in our economy.\n  I want to reinforce the point and make it clear that this is \nsomething that was never intended to be in the law and that our \nregulators have said they have to do. In hearings before the Senate \nbanking committee I have asked our regulators about this. In fact, \nfrankly, that reminds me that we have actually had testimony in the \nSenate on this issue because I have raised it in multiple banking \nhearings with our financial regulators.\n\n  They have told us they believe this fix is a prudent fix. We have our \nregulators telling us they have to issue regulations they don't feel \nare needed or necessary and that a congressional fix would be helpful \nto our financial markets and to our business productivity in America.\n  We have those being regulated as end users pleading for relief from \nthis harmful statutory language, and we have an opportunity today to \ncorrect that problem. I encourage all Senators to recognize the \ncritical need to move forward rapidly on fixing this end-user exemption \njust as we need to move forward rapidly on reauthorizing TRIA and \npassing the NARAB legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I will be no more than 3 minutes.\n  I wish to make a short response to my friend from Idaho that the \nissue here is more about process than substance. We have slight \ndisagreement on substance, partly from the delta issue. I understand \nthe farmer and rancher in Idaho and the farmer in Ohio and the \nimportance of managing risks.\n  I was also a bit amused by the examples he used of manufacturers, \nthose same manufacturers who came in front of our committee that \nproduce beer or soft drinks that were paying more for their metals, for \ntheir aluminum cans because of the overreach in some commodities from \nsome Wall Street firms. But this is not the time to debate that.\n  The issue is really the process of this change. I was part of \nlegislation with Senator Collins and with Senator Johanns in the last \nsession. It was a lengthy process. Senator Crapo supported our efforts \nin committee and beyond.\n  It was a slight change to Dodd-Frank. It was a change that we did \ncautiously. We made agreements and compromises. We brought in Sheila \nBair, who had helped in some of the crafting of the language with the \nCollins amendment.\n  We worked with her, we worked with Senator Collins, we worked with \nSenator Johanns, and I started the process. Senator Collins became the \nlead sponsor of it--the compromise through hearings in both Houses and \nhearings in the Senate banking committee. There were discussions in \nboth Houses. We eventually came to that agreement with a free-standing \nbill.\n  That is the way this should be done. I would be happy to have a \ndebate on the end-user provision with Senator Crapo, Senator Shelby, \nand the rest of us. Then we come to a conclusion, we get compromise, \nand we move forward.\n  The lesson, before Senator Coats gives his comments, is let's do this \nin the future the way we did--Senator Collins, Senator Brown, and \nSenator Johanns last year, and do this right so all sides can be \nrepresented, we come to a compromise, and the stand-alone bill goes to \nthe President.\n  That is the way this should have been done, and I am hopeful that is \nthe way it will be done in the future.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Crapo and Senator Coats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes or such time as he may \nconsume to Senator Coats.\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Idaho for yielding time. I don't \nanticipate using that much time.\n  I apologize to my colleague from Ohio whom I didn't see standing \nbefore I rose for recognition.\n  I very much appreciate comments made that support the legislation \nthat is before us.\n  However, I wish to make a few remarks relative to the start of a new \nCongress and a new Senate in this new cycle.\n  This is a fresh start for us and an opportunity to reverse course \nafter a very frustrating period of time of dysfunction in the Senate.\n  I am hopeful and I am optimistic that all of us--colleagues, both new \nand old, Republican and Democrat--will be able to work together to \nachieve serious and positive results on the many issues before our \ncountry that we face.\n  We have to put the days behind us when Congress careened from one \ncliff to the next, from one crisis to another, and fail to successfully \nbring forward positive legislation that addresses the problems we face. \nThere are threats to our national security--including radical extremism \nsuch as ISIS, terrorists such as those responsible for the horrendous \nmurders in Paris yesterday, cyber attacks, and inadequate border \nsecurity. There are a number of foreign policy issues that also \nthreaten the security of the United States.\n  Unfortunately, many of the administration's responses to these \nchallenges have fallen short of what is needed to successfully address \nthese threats.\n  Therefore, addressing these issues and protecting our homeland is \nparamount in this critical time. Congress has an important role to play \nin 2015. I want Hoosiers whom I represent to know that I will continue \nto engage fully in what I believe is this essential priority. Here on \nthe home front, the 114th Congress must prioritize legislation that \nsets the conditions for economic growth. I consistently hear from \nHoosiers at home who tell me that Washington needs to focus on building \nan economic climate that encourages job creation and expands \nopportunity for all who seek to work.\n  We have staggered through a very difficult period of time. I believe, \npersonally--and I think it has been demonstrated by the results--that \nthe policies of this administration have not successfully addressed \nthis problem, falling far short of what is needed. These concerns must \nbe addressed. They must be addressed now. There are several areas where \nRepublicans can work with the President and work with our colleagues to \ngrow our economy if the President is willing to work with us.\n  Many of these issues have bipartisan support in this Congress--items \nthat we will be taking up very shortly, such as the Keystone Pipeline. \nUnfortunately, the President has already issued a slap in the face to \nthose of us who simply want to bring up something that is supported by \nnearly 70 percent of the American public and has been cleared of any \nkind of negative environmental impact. But it has been resisted over \nand over with less feeble and more and more feeble excuses from our \nPresident as to why we can't go forward.\n  Repealing the excise tax for medical devices is something with very \nsignificant bipartisan support. Seventy-nine Members of this body in \nthe last cycle voted for repeal of this egregious tax on gross sales \nthat has hampered growth of one of the most dynamic industries in our \ncountry and something that provides exports, revenue, and high-paying \njobs that put people back to work and give them a good income.\n  Reforming Federal regulations, that are currently preventing \nbusinesses in my State from hiring and growing, opening more markets to \nAmerican-made products, and reforming our Tax Code are just a few of \nthe issues that have bipartisan support and can be addressed in this \nSenate. Hopefully the President will join us in that effort.\n  In addition to what I have listed, there are many other issues the \n114th Congress must tackle. For example, just last week an employer \nsurvey revealed a majority of small businesses say Obamacare has \nreduced their profits, causing many of them to freeze or cut workers' \nwages or reduce other benefits. This survey affirms the constant flow \nof letters and emails I receive from Hoosiers who have seen their \npremiums and deductibles rise because of Obamacare.\n  We were promised by the President that premiums would not rise--not a \npenny, he said.\n  That has obviously not been the case. We have seen egregious and \ncrippling increases in deductibles and premiums as a result of \nObamacare.\n  Now, with a divided Federal Government and in order to achieve needed \nresults, we have no other option but to work together on responsible \nlegislative solutions to grow our economy, tackle our debt and deficit, \nand keep America's homeland safe from terrorist threats. That is the \nchallenge that is before us. That is the challenge the American people \nwant us to address.\n  So I look forward to rolling up my sleeves, redoubling my efforts, \nand getting to work on behalf of Hoosiers and the Nation, and I trust \nmy colleagues will join in that effort and we can move forward in a way \nwe haven't in the last few years.\n  With that, I thank my colleague for the time, and I yield back \nwhatever time may be remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I yield 10 minutes or such time as he may consume to \nSenator Heller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I rise to speak on TRIA, the Terrorism \nRisk Insurance Program. Before I get started with my remarks, I thank \nmy friend from Idaho for his hard work and efforts on behalf of all of \nAmerica on this issue. I think his efforts to educate us in our \nconference and others on both sides of the aisle speak volumes to his \nability to lead on an issue such as this. As a member of the banking \ncommittee and a coauthor of the Senate TRIA reauthorization bill, this \nis a critical issue I have worked on closely with my colleagues for \nnearly 1 year.\n  Terrorism is a real threat to both rural and urban areas, whether it \nis north, south, east or west, and that is why I have been so involved \nwith trying to get TRIA extended. When we think of terrorism, we think \nof Los Angeles, we think of New York, we think of Chicago, and some of \nthese bigger cities. But as I have said before, and I will say again, \nin my home State Las Vegas is considered to be one of the leading \ninternational business and visitor destination cities in the world. \nSouthern Nevada welcomes 40 million visitors annually and has a \npopulation of nearly 2 million people. We have 35 major hotels along \nthe Las Vegas strip, many of which have 15,000 occupants at once. If a \nterrorist attack were to occur in Las Vegas, our entire State economy \nwould be devastated without TRIA.\n  But it is not just about Las Vegas. In northern Nevada our visitor \nand gaming industry is one of the largest employers in Washoe County, \nwhich includes the city of Reno. They know unless they have access to \naffordable terrorism coverage they will have difficulty starting new \ncapital projects and creating new jobs. TRIA has helped many hotels, \nhelped hospitals. It has helped office complexes, shopping centers. \nColleges and universities have access to terrorism insurance coverage, \nand I want that to continue.\n  While I was disappointed we could not reach agreement before TRIA \nexpired at the end of 2014, I am pleased this legislation has been \nbrought to the floor so quickly by the majority leader. This bill \nbefore us is a good bill. Yesterday it passed the House with 416 votes. \nLet me repeat that: 416 Members of the House, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, supported this legislation.\n  I strongly support this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to support \npassage of this bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that during the quorum calls all \ntime that elapses be allocated equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Commending Pope Francis\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, a little over 5 years ago a USAID worker \nnamed Alan Gross--a contractor with USAID--went to Havana, Cuba. He \ntook with him some Internet equipment he was going to leave at a small \nsynagogue that has survived for decades in Havana, Cuba. He checked in \nat the airport when he arrived, took all of the equipment he had \nbrought and put it right through Customs for inspection by the Cuban \nGovernment. Shortly thereafter he was arrested and charged with spy \nactivities and the like and imprisoned for 5 years--Alan Gross of \nMaryland.\n  I am happy to report that just before we adjourned for the holiday \nrecess we were greeted with the great news that Alan Gross, who had \nbeen jailed in Cuba for 5 years, was finally on his way home.\n  I met with Alan in Havana at his holding area in a prison hospital \nseveral years ago. I couldn't understand how this man could survive day \nafter weary day of being imprisoned for trumped-up charges that truly \nbore no relationship to reality. He was given a 15-year sentence for \nsimply bringing Internet equipment to the Cuban people.\n  When I saw Alan, he had lost more than 100 pounds and had been unable \nto visit back home with his mother, who later passed away. Amid their \nown enormous pain, the Gross family remained tirelessly committed to \nensuring his well-being and return to the United States.\n  Many Members of the Senate and House of Representatives visited him \nin Havana, when they had the chance, to keep his spirits up. We tried \neverything imaginable with the Cuban Government and with our own \ngovernment and others to secure his release. Tragically, Alan's \ndetention was yet another obstacle in trying to turn the page on what I \nconsidered a decades-old failed foreign policy toward Cuba.\n  Many people helped make Alan's joyous homecoming a reality; notably, \nPresident Barack Obama and many Members of the Senate. Senators \nMikulski and Cardin, from his home State of Maryland, helped to lead \nour efforts; Chris Van Hollen, Congressman from the State of Maryland \nas well; and I can't leave out Senator Pat Leahy, who truly took a \npersonal interest, as his staff did, in trying to help.\n  President Obama was the one who helped to finally engineer his \nrelease, but I think the President would be the first to say he could \nnot have achieved this goal without the able assistance of an amazing \nman, who has millions of fans around the world, named Pope Francis.\n  Pope Francis urged both sides--the United States and Cuba--to meet \nand talk with one another, to work to find a solution for the release \nof Alan Gross and try to resolve other humanitarian issues between our \ntwo nations. Writing personally to both President Obama and Cuban \nPresident Raul Castro, Pope Francis played an important role in finally \nbringing these sides together after decades of separation.\n  Over 18 months quiet talks moved forward, including a critical one \nlate last year hosted by the Vatican. Pope Francis said to a group of \nnew Vatican Ambassadors the day after the release of Alan Gross:\n\n       The work of an ambassador lies in small steps, small \n     things, but they always end up making peace, bringing closer \n     the hearts of people, sowing brotherhood among people. . . . \n     And today we're happy because we saw how two peoples, who had \n     been apart for so many years, took a step closer yesterday.\n\n  What wise and beautiful words from this impressive new Pope Francis--\nthe first Pope from Latin America and one widely recognized for his \nhumility, his dedication to the poor, and his commitment to dialogue \nand reconciliation. He is clearly continuing the role of the Vatican in \npursuing peace and freedom, whether it be the role of Pope Paul II in \nhelping to encourage the Solidarity movement in Poland or the Vatican's \nhelp in diffusing a border standoff between Chile and Argentine in the \n1970s and a 2007 dispute between Britain and Iran over hostages.\n  That is why Senators Leahy, Flake, Cardin, Mikulski, Enzi, Collins, \nUdall, and Brown will join me in submitting a resolution that praises \nPope Francis's role in securing Alan Gross's release and fostering \ndialogue between the United States and Cuba.\n  The resolution's message is simple and straightforward. It extends \nits gratitude to Pope Francis for his extraordinary efforts in helping \nto secure the release of Alan Gross; it commends His Holiness for his \nrole in encouraging improved relationships between the United States \nand Cuba; and it warmly welcomes home Alan Gross to the United States.\n  I know that Cuba itself elicits many strong and passionate political \nfeelings here in the Senate and across America. I respect the \ndifferences many of us have on this issue. I am certainly no fan of the \nCastro regime, neither Fidel nor Raul, and I have pursued \naccountability and progress on human rights violations on that island, \nincluding the suspicious death of Cuban patriot and democracy activist \nOswaldo Paya.\n  While many of us may disagree on the best path forward in seeing \ndemocratic change in Cuba, I think and I hope we can all agree that \nPope Francis deserves special thanks and praise for his role in \nbringing Alan Gross home.\n  I will submit this resolution. I ask any of my colleagues of either \nparty who would like to join in cosponsoring it--if they would like to, \nI would be honored to have them. I will try to move this resolution in \na timely fashion, but I hope we can at least go on record in the Senate \ncommending the Pope's efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Democratic whip for his \ncomments. I was part of a group, with Senator Leahy, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Flake, who worked on this. The credit \noverwhelmingly goes to Congressman Van Hollen and Senator Durbin and \nSenator Leahy in the negotiations and discussions the administration \nhad. It was so important.\n  I also appreciate the opportunity to be a cosponsor of Senator \nDurbin's resolution. I mentioned to him that one of the most intriguing \nand most admirable things Pope Francis has said as he travels the world \nand ministers to the poor and talks to his flock--one day he exhorted \nhis parish priests to go out and smell like the flock--a good \nadmonition to all of us to make sure to go out and know how people live \ntheir lives so that we can minister to them and govern this country \nbetter. So I appreciate Senator Durbin's words.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield for a moment, I failed to \nmention Congressman Jim McGovern. Congressman Van Hollen and \nCongressman Jim McGovern were both very committed to Alan Gross's \nrelease.\n  Mr. BROWN. Senator Durbin is right about that.\n  Madam President, before putting us in a quorum call, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Remembering Reverend Michael C. Murphy\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to pay special tribute to \nRev. Michael C. Murphy, a dear friend of mine, a man of great faith who \nfor decades inspired the people in Lansing, MI, and who passed away \nrecently in Washington, DC, a city where he had only just begun to make \nhis mark.\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n  Reverend Murphy talked often about being called--being called in the \nspiritual sense--into service. In the spiritual sense of the word, he \nfollowed that calling at pivotal moments in his life, and we are all \nbetter for it. For instance, even though he was born and grew up in \nChicago, Reverend Murphy felt a calling not long after he arrived in \nMid-Michigan. While enrolled at Michigan State University in pursuit of \na master's degree in counseling, he got a job at the Michigan Consumers \nCouncil. As he learned about the legislative process and how public \npolicy affects families and individuals and communities, he decided he \nwanted to devote himself to that kind of important work. Yet at the \nsame time he felt a spiritual call to the ministry, which led him back \nto a seminary in Chicago. For some time he drove back and forth from \nLansing to Chicago, balancing a public service mission with a mission \nthat was more personal and spiritual.\n  Ultimately, in 1987 my friend Mike Murphy, as a recently ordained \nminister, founded St. Stephen's Community Church in Lansing. It would \nbelong to the United Church of Christ, a denomination that appealed to \nReverend Murphy because it was multicultural, committed to social \njustice and human rights, just like Reverend Mike Murphy himself. For \nthe next 22 years these causes were consistent themes of Reverend \nMurphy's sermons.\n  Even as the minister of a growing congregation, however, Reverend \nMurphy felt the calling to serve a broader public, a broader community \nbeyond his church. In the mid-1990s he won election to the Lansing City \nCouncil, and then in 2000 he won a seat in the Michigan Legislature. I \nwas honored that year to be on the ballot with Reverend Murphy, as I \ncame to the U.S. Senate at the same time.\n  During Reverend Murphy's three terms in the Michigan house, he was a \nchampion for improving education, enhancing access to health care for \nall citizens, and policies that would promote job growth in his great \ndistrict and all across Michigan.\n  More than anything, though, Reverend Murphy's constituents knew that \nwhen times were tough, he would be their champion. In May 2003 a 13-\nyear-old middle school student named Jasmine Miles was struck by a car \nand killed. She was walking home from school on a road that didn't even \nhave sidewalks. Reverend Murphy decided that the best way to help \nJasmine's family was to prevent any other family from being devastated \nin the same way, so he gave Jasmine's family a role in the bill he \nsponsored in the Michigan house to require crossing guards, skywalks, \nand other safety enhancements at crossings used by schoolchildren. \nSince the Jasmine Miles School Children Safety Act became law--and with \nhis leadership, it is law--there is no telling how many young lives \nhave been saved. That was one of so many ways his actions impacted the \npeople in Lansing and in Michigan.\n  Even after he stepped down due to term limits, he continued working \nwith the State as an activist who offered tips on how transportation \nofficials could improve the safety of walking routes for children \nacross Michigan. He also continued to be a force for bringing neighbors \ncloser together.\n  Lansing never felt more vibrant than it did on the day of the Capital \nCity African American Parade--a great celebration, an annual event \nReverend Murphy founded. There were marching bands, floats, delicious \nfoods, music, and dancing.\n  About 5 years ago Reverend Murphy was called again, and this time he \nwas called to come to Washington, DC, where he would become pastor of \nthe Peoples Congregational United Church of Christ.\n  We tend to find comfort in knowing that a person we loved passed away \nwhile doing the thing he or she was most passionate about, and that is \ncertainly most true about Reverend Murphy. He spent his final moments \nin prayer preparing for one of those wonderful sermons he always gave \nthat were uplifting to everyone who was fortunate enough to listen. He \nbrought his spirituality into his service to the community, and his \nservice to the community is what strengthened his spirituality. He was \na wonderful man who touched so many lives, including mine, in very \npowerful ways.\n  To Reverend Murphy's son Brandon, his daughter Rachel, and all of his \nfamily, we will keep you in our thoughts and prayers. We are grateful \nto you for sharing your father's gifts with us, and we will dearly miss \nhim.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Mike Hybl\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to begin my \nremarks by expressing my deep gratitude to a hard-working public \nservant and loyal friend, Mike Hybl. Mike and I have known each other \nfor more than 10 years. I was so grateful that after I was elected to \nthe Senate his wife Chris gave her blessing so he could come to \nWashington to serve as my chief of staff.\n  Mike has had a long career of public service working for his fellow \nNebraskans, including two decades in the Nebraska legislature, where he \nprovided policy and legal advice to a number of our State's top \nleaders. In this role and in the private sector, Mike has brought a \nwealth of experience on a range of issues. Before coming to the Senate, \nhe also served as executive director of the Nebraska Public Service \nCommission for nearly 6 years. When I chaired the Nebraska \nLegislature's Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, I had \nthe chance to work closely with Mike to improve infrastructure across \nour State. When the time came for me to choose a chief of staff, I had \nexactly one name in mind, and that was Mike Hybl. His integrity, his \nlevel head, and his tireless work have served him well in Washington.\n  Anyone who has ever opened a Senate office from the ground up \nappreciates the unique challenges that come with being a chief of staff \nand being a chief of staff for a freshman Senator. A wide range of \nskills are required to hire staff, establish operations, and even to \npick out paint samples. Through it all Mike was patient, he was \npersistent, and he worked closely with me to always ensure that the \ninterests of Nebraskans were and remain the top priority.\n  He never lost his sense of purpose. He always kept us laughing with \nthose deadpan one-liners.\n  After 2 years on the job, Mike will be returning home to God's \ncountry, the State of Nebraska, which we both love so much.\n  I have no doubt that in whatever path Mike chooses next, he will \ncontinue to work for the people of Nebraska. I thank his family, his \nwife Chris, his son Patrick, his daughter Emma, for letting me have him \nand letting the State have him here for 2 more years. I know they are \nlooking forward to spending more time with Mike as he moves back home \nin the coming weeks.\n  On behalf of all Nebraskans, I do thank Mike Hybl for his many years \nof service to our State and for his leadership as my chief of staff for \nthe last 2 years. I thank him for his counsel, his candor, and his \nleadership.\n  Mike, you are going to be missed, but know you have made a \ndifference.\n\n\n                        Welcoming New Colleagues\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to welcome our new colleagues to a \nnew year and a new Congress and to the Presiding Officer as well.\n\n\n                    Great Challenges For Our Nation\n\n  Our Nation is facing many great challenges from threats to our \nnational security to a languishing economy that is starting to show \nsigns of revival. We have been granted a sacred trust by the people we \nrepresent to decrease barriers to opportunity and growth, and we have \nbeen entrusted by voters to alleviate the burdens that misguided \npolicies have placed on the backs of hardworking American families. I \nhave been honored to serve as the voice for Nebraska in the Senate for \nthe past 2 years, and I am excited to take on the important issues we \nface in this new Congress.\n  As we begin this new year, I wish to share some of the priorities I \nam going to be focusing on. Congress's first duty is to defend this \nNation. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am \ncommitted to working to neutralize the growing threats to our homeland, \nto our allies, and to destroy our enemies. We must maintain our \npresence as a powerful force for good. Peace through strength is a \nproven strategy. However, it also requires us to meet the changing \ndemands and\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\nneeds of our military, including the need for a more robust strategy to \ncounter increased cyber warfare.\n  At the same time, providing for a strong defense abroad also requires \na robust economy here at home. In my home State of Nebraska people have \nfaced an onslaught of Washington redtape--from middle-class families \nstruggling with Obamacare's broken promises to community banks that are \nforced to meet impossible new standards. Moreover each new day seems to \nbring about costly new Federal regulations from agencies such as EPA.\n  Washington's invasive reach is unending. Now we have bureaucracies at \nthe EPA attempting to regulate everything from farm ditches to backyard \nponds. This overregulation is killing jobs, driving up consumer costs, \nand disproportionately hurting families who still feel too much \neconomic pain. Far too often we focus on complex terms and big picture \npolicies without looking at people and families and how they are \nimpacted. From a mother working multiple jobs to put her children \nthrough school to a young woman who is a college graduate hoping to \nstart a career, millions of people are being impacted by policies that \nare hampering our growth and our potential.\n  Similar to most Nebraskans, I believe we need to do more to promote \ninnovation and economic growth so there are more opportunities and \ngreater options. That means a simpler, fairer Tax Code, more regulatory \ncertainty for job creators and modern rules for new technology. We must \nhelp and not hold back innovators and small businesses so they can \ngrow, expand, and invest in the people who make them great. Tackling \nany of these problems must begin by shining the light on the waste, \nfraud, and abuse occurring in our Federal Government.\n  The American people have sent a clear message to Washington this past \nNovember. They have had enough. They have had enough of a do-nothing \nSenate. They have had enough of the White House side-stepping Congress \nand running roughshod with Executive orders.\n  The American people are demanding accountability and now with this \nCongress that is going to happen. There is much to be done and it \nstarts with keeping the priorities of our middle class at the \nforefront. I for one am excited to face these challenges each and every \nday in 2015, and I thank Nebraskans for the privilege of serving as \ntheir voice in the Senate.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I will speak for the last time on this \nbill, but I wish to also speak about an amendment that I expect will be \nbrought forward by the Senator from Massachusetts in a few minutes. \nBecause we are running out of time, I will respond to her amendment \nbefore she actually offers it, and then I expect she will offer it in \nthe next few minutes.\n  Senator Warren I expect will offer an amendment to strike the end-\nuser provisions of the legislation before us today, and I have already \ndiscussed those to some extent so I will not get into too much detail \nabout it, but I do wish to respond once again on the importance of \nkeeping this end-user exemption in this legislation.\n  For those who did not hear the earlier debate, this provision would \nenable nonfinancial end users--these are organizations that are trying \nto manage their own economic risk in their businesses. This is not Wall \nStreet. This is Main Street. These are farmers, ranchers, small \nbusinesses, and large businesses across this country. It would allow \nthem to keep their limited funds and capital in play for their use for \ninvestment, growth, and for expansion and job development in our \neconomy.\n  In recent months there has been an increased discussion by both sides \nof the aisle about the issues relating to the Dodd-Frank legislation \nand the need for fixes. Some of these fixes should not be controversial \nor political. There is bipartisan agreement that the Dodd-Frank rules \ngo too far, and some of them need fixed, such as fixing the end-user \nexemption that is before us.\n  I have just been notified that there is only 5 minutes remaining. I \nexpect I will only use about 5 minutes, but if I go longer, I ask \nunanimous consent to extend my time for a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The architects of the Dodd-Frank legislation itself--\nSenators Lincoln and Dodd on the Senate side--stated their intent to \nprovide an explicit exemption from margin requirements for nonfinancial \nend users. I know that is a complicated issue to explain. I have \nexplained it in detail already, so I will not do that again now. But \nacknowledging that the language for end users in the draft of Dodd-\nFrank was not perfect, they sent a letter, which I quoted from earlier, \nto then-Chairmen Frank and Peterson, stating that ``[T]he legislation \ndoes not authorize the regulators to impose margins on end-users, those \nexempt entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk.''\n  Despite the clarity of their intent, Dodd-Frank was not fixed in \nconference and regulators had interpreted that in fact the statutory \nlanguage does contain an ambiguity which they interpret requires them \nto impose margin requirements. It is not just current or former \nSenators who have advocated for this clarity. Regulators have spoken \nout about it as well.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, in February 2013 at a Humphrey-Hawkins \nhearing, then-Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, identified \nthe end-user exemption as one of the specific Dodd-Frank provisions \nthat Congress should reconsider. I specifically asked him about it.\n  I asked:\n\n       If we were able to achieve some bipartisan consensus on \n     steps to improve Dodd-Frank, what are some of the provisions \n     that you think need clarification, or improvement for \n     reconsideration?\n\n  An end-user legislation reform was one of those he identified. I also \nasked former Chairman Bernanke about the role of end users in our \neconomy and whether they posed a systemic risk.\n  He stated:\n\n       I certainly agree that nonfinancial end-users benefit, and \n     that the economy benefits, from the use of derivatives. It \n     seems to be the sense of a large portion of Congress that \n     that [end-user] exemption should be made explicit. And \n     speaking for the Federal Reserve, we're very comfortable with \n     that proposal.\n\n  We attempted to address this issue in the last Congress. We \nintroduced a Senate bill with six Republican and six Democratic \nsponsors, which ultimately grew to 20 sponsors, but were unable to get \nany consideration of it in this Congress.\n  Unless Congress acts, regulations based on the current statute will \ngo into place which will make it more expensive for farmers, \nmanufacturers, energy producers, and many small business owners across \nthis country to manage their risks. There are many examples of other \nMembers of Congress in the House and Senate, Republican and Democratic, \nwho have spoken about the need for certainty and exemptions with \nrespect to this provision.\n  I will conclude by reading from a letter sent out by a coalition of \nend users. These are businesses, as I said, large and small across this \ncountry, that are alarmed at the damage this current statutory language \nwill do to their business operation. I gave several specific examples \nof this earlier in our debate.\n  The end-user coalition has said in a letter it sent to Congress that \nthey represent hundreds of end-user companies that employ derivatives \nto manage their business risks; in other words, not to speculate in \nmarkets but to manage their business risks and that they strongly \nsupport this language.\n  Their point is that this language ``would not help financial \ncompanies. It would not create any systemic risk. It would not reverse \nany regulatory policy. And it would not create an exemption that \nCongress did not intend. In fact, it fulfills the commitments made on \nthe record to end-users by the committee chairs and sponsors of the \nDodd-Frank Act at the time of its passage. The end-user language simply \nwould\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nprotect main street companies''--and I emphasize Main Street; we are \nnot talking about Wall Street--``from harmful and unnecessary margin \nrequirements and preserve jobs.''\n\n       A Coalition survey of chief financial officers and \n     corporate treasurers released earlier this year underscores \n     the need. . . .\n\n  Eighty-six percent of the survey of these companies responded ``that \nfully collateralizing over-the-counter derivatives would adversely \nimpact business investment, acquisitions, research & development and \njob creation. Another Coalition survey found that a 3% initial margin \nrequirement could reduce capital spending by as much as $5.1 to $6.7 \nbillion . . . and cost 100,000 to 130,000 jobs.''\n  The issue is not just fixing an issue because it is going to have a \nhuge, damaging impact on companies across this country that need it for \ntheir business risk management, it is an issue for developing more \nrobust economic development and jobs in our economy which badly needs \nit.\n  The idea for providing clarity to end users and regulators precedes \nthe passage of Dodd-Frank, and I am hopeful that now we can get it \nacross the finish line.\n  Including the end-user fix provides certainty for Main Street \nbusinesses that played no role in the financial crisis by establishing \na clear exemption for excessive margin requirements on our economy.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support \nfor the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n  This bill will ensure that communities and businesses will continue \nto have the insurance protection they need to quickly recover after \nmajor terrorist attacks.\n  You see, the September 11, 2001 attacks resulted in approximately \n$32.5 billion in claims paid by insurers to terrorism risk insurance \npolicyholders, which makes the deadly terrorist attack the second most \ncostly insurance event in the history of the Nation.\n  Due to the catastrophic damage, the record breaking insurance payout, \nand the threat of future attacks, the private insurance industry \nstopped offering terrorism risk insurance. The aftermath of the \nSeptember 11, 2001 attacks sent a shockwave through the insurance \nindustry and the lack of the availability of terrorism risk insurance \ncontributed to the economic recession that followed the attacks.\n  To address the issue, Congress established the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Program in 2002. The program is federally backed so private \ninsurers can continue to offer terrorism risk insurance. The Federal \nGovernment only pays out when damage from a terrorist attack exceeds \n$100 million. The program is also designed so the Federal Government \nrecoups any funds that it pays out. I also want to note that the \nFederal Government has not paid out a single dollar since the creation \nof the program in 2002.\n  Congress has created other federally backed insurance programs to \naddress market failures where the risk of damage due to a disaster is \nso large it makes insurance unaffordable. The best example of this \nbeing done at the national level is the National Flood Insurance \nProgram. At a State level, California created a State-backed program \nfor earthquake insurance.\n  Since 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has worked well to \nmake sure the Nation, and California, is prepared to rebuild in the \naftermath of a major terrorism attack.\n  Terrorism insurance is particularly important for California, due to \nmy State's many large metropolitan areas, its public transit systems, \nand its many public events. The program makes sure communities and \nbusinesses across California are resilient and are prepared for the \nrisk of a terrorist attack.\n  The recent World Series held in California, which drew over 40,000 \nfans to each game at the AT Park in San Francisco, is a prime example \nof how terrorism risk insurance works to protect California. The U.S. \nBank Tower in Los Angeles, the tallest building west of the Mississippi \nRiver, is protected by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. Terrorism \nrisk insurance provides workers' compensation protection to many of the \n14.6 million members of California's labor force. California is also \nhome to many major airports, tourist attractions, and sporting venues \nthat all benefit from the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n  The math is simple: terrorism risk insurance means businesses and \nlocal governments will have the resources to repair and rebuild should \nanother major terrorist attack occur in the United States.\n  I also want to point out several positive changes in the \nreauthorization being considered on the floor today. First, this \nlegislation will gradually increase the ceiling at which the Federal \nGovernment would provide payments after a terrorist attack from $100 \nmillion to $200 million. It will also increase the amount of money the \nFederal Government would recoup after any payout from 133 percent to \n135 percent.\n  These smart reforms gradually place more risk in the hands of the \nprivate market. Due to these changes, the Congressional Budget Office \nactually estimates that the reauthorization of the program will save \nthe government $450 million over the next 10 years.\n  I do want to express my disappointment that a provision was included \nin the House-passed bill which would make changes to Dodd-Frank's \napproach to the regulation of the swaps market. Swaps, a kind of \nderivative instrument, played a key role in the financial crisis and we \nshould tread carefully when considering any revisions to our swaps \nregulatory regime.\n  The provision in question prevents regulators like the Commodities \nFutures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission \nfrom imposing collateral requirements on counterparties to swaps \ntransactions with commercial end users. While I am sympathetic to the \nconcerns of commercial end users, preventing regulators from acting to \nimpose collateral requirements on their counterparties could result in \nmore costly risks building up in our financial system. This is the \nwrong approach.\n  However, terrorism risk insurance is critically important to \nCalifornia and to the Nation. As such, I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that all future quorum calls, in \nterms of time, be equally allocated between the two parties and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 1\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.)\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts, [Ms. Warren], for herself \n     and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 1.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, after \n9/11, Congress passed TRIA, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, to make \nsure commercial developers could afford the high costs of insuring \ntheir properties against the possibility of a devastating terrorist \nattack.\n  This is a bill for the people who own the tallest buildings in the \nworld. TRIA is a critical program that helps drive economic development \nand create jobs.\n  Last July Senate Democrats were united in support of a bill that \nwould reauthorize TRIA and establish a National Association of \nRegistered Agents and Brokers, called NARAB.\n  The bill passed with 93 votes. Senate negotiators then reached a \ncompromise with the House on both TRIA and NARAB, but at the eleventh \nhour House Republicans tacked on a provision that would roll back an \nunrelated provision in Dodd-Frank, and then they left town for the \nyear, knowing the Senate would either have to swallow the change or let \nTRIA expire.\n  That same bill, the TRIA compromise with the extra Dodd-Frank\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\nchange attached to it, is currently being debated by the Senate.\n  We have seen this movie before. At the end of the last Congress, \nHouse Republicans tacked a rollback of a ``no bailouts'' provision in \nDodd-Frank on to the must-pass funding bill. That rollback, which was \nliterally written by lobbyists for the giant bank Citigroup, was a Wall \nStreet giveaway--plain and simple. It made our financial system less \nsafe, and it increased the chances of another taxpayer bailout--all so \nthe biggest banks in the country could rake in more profits. But it \npassed the House and then the House left town, and the only way to stop \nit here in the Senate would have been to shut the government down.\n  Now, once again, the House has attached a Dodd-Frank change to a \nmust-pass piece of legislation. Whatever one's views are on the \nsubstance of that provision, none of us should endorse the tactics \nHouse Republicans have used to try to achieve this change. While some \nmight find this particular Dodd-Frank change desirable or \nunobjectionable, that may not be the case with other changes that \nRepublicans decide to strap on to important, must-pass bills. If we \nfail to challenge this cynical strategy now, it will only encourage \nRepublicans to pull our financial regulations apart piece by piece.\n  Just over 4 years ago, every Democrat voted for Dodd-Frank as a \nnecessary response to the worst financial crisis in generations. \nRepublicans have not hidden their intention to try to undo these basic \nfinancial reforms. If Republicans want to try to roll back financial \nreforms, let's have that debate on the merits of each proposal. But we \ncannot have that debate if we permit Republicans to attach financial \nreform rollbacks to must-pass pieces of legislation such as government \nfunding bills and the TRIA reauthorization bill.\n  That is why Senator Schumer and I are offering a substitute amendment \nthat reflects the original compromise between the House and the \nSenate--an amendment that includes the compromise language on TRIA and \nNARAB but omits the Dodd-Frank change.\n  A vote for this amendment is fully consistent with the vote that 93 \nSenators took last July--a vote in favor of a clean reauthorization of \nTRIA and establishment of NARAB. For that reason, I am hopeful it will \npass, we can send the President a clean TRIA bill, and we can debate \nthis Dodd-Frank provision separately.\n  I am also hopeful Senate Democrats in particular will support it on \nthe principle that the Senate expects the House to honor the results of \ngood-faith negotiations and will not support procedural tricks to tack \non Dodd-Frank changes to unrelated, must-pass bills--no matter what \nthose changes might be.\n  The Treasury Department supports this amendment. Here is what they \nsaid:\n\n       We support a long-term renewal of TRIA, given the important \n     role it plays to our national security and economy, while \n     making sensible reforms to further reduce taxpayer exposure. \n     It is unfortunate that some are attempting to use TRIA \n     legislation to modify the Wall Street Reform Act. We support \n     the Warren substitute amendment which represents the \n     bicameral, bipartisan TRIA compromise from last year that \n     would have averted any lapse in the program.\n\n  I agree with the President.\n  I voted for TRIA in the banking committee, and I was one of 93 \nSenators who voted for it on the Senate floor. But I cannot support \nWall Street reform rollbacks through these hostage tactics. So if we \nare unable to pass a clean TRIA amendment, then I will also vote no on \nthe bill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nreauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, which I \nstrongly support. As I have emphasized in the past, reauthorizing TRIA \nis vital. In addition to serving on the Banking Committee, I also now \nserve as the Ranking Member on the Armed Services Committee, and it is \nthrough this dual perspective, and from what we know of the significant \nterrorist threats our Nation still faces, that I am convinced that \nthere is value in reauthorizing TRIA.\n  We must keep markets effectively operating in light of these threats. \nWe must continue to have policies in place to make sure our economy \nstays on track in the event of another attack on our nation. In short, \nreauthorizing TRIA is not only a matter of economic security, it is \nalso a matter of national security.\n  I believe most of my colleagues share this view, and it is one of the \nmany reasons why the Senate in the last Congress was able to pass a \nTRIA reauthorization bill on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis by a \nvote of 93 to 4 in July of last year. This did not happen by accident \nbut through a concerted bipartisan effort in the Senate to steer clear \nof controversial and ideological demands on both sides of the aisle in \nan earnest attempt to work together in defense of our country and our \neconomy.\n  We are here today because the House of Representatives did not abide \nby these same principles and insisted on including in the \nreauthorization bill an unrelated provision that would weaken the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform Act. This provision effectively prevents the \nbanking regulators, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, and the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, SEC, from calling for margin or \ncollateral protections if they happen to notice excessive risk in \nderivatives transactions with commercial end users. In short, this bill \nwould prevent our financial regulators from utilizing this tool to \nprotect our markets.\n  Especially in the wake of the financial crisis, it would seem that we \nshould be providing our regulators with all the necessary tools to \nlimit excessive risk instead of limiting their ability to protect our \nmarkets. Indeed, the financial regulators have already been exercising \nthe discretion we gave them in Dodd-Frank to exempt commercial end \nusers from having to post margin through a proposed rule. But by \npassing this provision today, we eliminate this discretion to protect \nour markets through this particular tool even when the facts on the \nground may call for its use in the name of market integrity.\n  For example, in December of last year, Reuters published an article \nthat explained the unexpected risks that certain commercial end users \nare facing in light of falling oil prices. The article noted, ``with \noil prices tumbling faster and further than anyone had anticipated, the \ncollar hedges left the airlines with insurance against high costs they \nno longer need and on the hook for protection they sold against a \nfurther slide, with potential liabilities on the rise.'' In short, even \ncommercial end users face risks, both expected and unexpected, in their \nderivatives transactions, and if the circumstances call for it, we \nshould be giving our regulators the necessary tools to police and \nprotect our markets; not further restricting them.\n  All of this goes back to the need for considering these very \ncomplicated and consequential bills that impact our financial markets \nin a deliberative manner, not through attaching them at the last minute \nto unrelated and must pass bills. I voted against the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill in the last Congress, in part, because it repealed \nsection 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, which sought to \nprevent bank subsidiaries that are covered by federal deposit insurance \nor that take advantage of Federal Reserve lending programs from \nengaging in the riskiest derivatives trades. In essence, the riskiest \nderivatives trades would have been pushed out from these subsidiaries \nin an effort to reduce systemic risk and provide greater assurances \nthat Wall Street gambles would not be subsidized by taxpayers. \nUnfortunately, this provision was repealed before it even had the \nchance to be fully implemented by the regulators.\n  During my tenure as the then-chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on \nSecurities, Insurance, and Investment, I spent many hours working on a \nbipartisan basis with Senator Gregg of New Hampshire to thoughtfully \nand carefully develop a derivatives compromise. While our effort was \ntransformed during the conference on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nAct, I am keenly aware of just how complicated derivatives can be, and \nI have come to see that even the most seemingly innocuous provisions \ncan have devastating and unintended consequences.\n  Everyone should understand by now that the last thing Congress should \nbe doing is passing derivatives legislation with little deliberation as \npart of any must pass legislation. This assault, bit by bit, on the \nDodd-Frank Act must\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\nstop. It is a disservice to the seriousness of this issue, to our \nconstituents, and to our economy. Lately, my Republican colleagues have \ncalled for working cooperatively through the committee process, and I \nwelcome this opportunity. While this did not happen with this \nparticular derivatives provision, I hope my Republican colleagues will \ndo so in the future.\n  For these reasons, I support the Warren amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am in strong support of Sen. \nWarren's amendment to strike the unrelated swaps provision from this \nvery important TRIA legislation.\n  While I am sympathetic to the concerns of commercial end users about \nincreased transactions costs, it is simply the wrong approach to \nprevent regulators from acting, if needed, to protect our financial \nsystem from risky transactions.\n  We must afford our financial regulators with sufficient discretion to \nact to prevent more financial crises. The financial market regulators \nhave already acted to provide relief for counterparties to swaps \ntransactions with commercial end users. That makes the inclusion of \nthis swaps provision in the TRIA legislation unnecessary. Sen. Warren's \namendment would preserve the current regulatory approach to uncleared \nswaps transactions with commercial end users, while also allowing for \nsufficient regulatory discretion to impose margin requirements on the \ncounter parties to these transactions in the future should it become \nnecessary to protect our financial system.\n  The inclusion of the swaps provision in this critically important \nterrorism risk insurance bill is a part of a disturbing trend. Some \npolicymakers believe that Dodd-Frank should be undone. They believe \nthat the derivatives reforms which for the first time regulated a \nmarket that contributed to the financial crisis should be dismantled \npiece by piece. Just last month, a major reform was repealed in a must \npass appropriations bill, despite being an objectionable policy which \nwould not have passed were it considered on its own merits. This is a \ntroubling trend because the derivatives reforms are in place to protect \nour financial markets and protect the taxpayer.\n  Title VII of Dodd-Frank introduced historic reforms of the \nderivatives market establishing transparency and accountability. Those \nwho would dismantle Dodd-Frank's derivatives reforms should explain to \nthe American people why they should once again be on the hook for deep \nsystemic losses caused in part by these high risk financial products. \nIt does not make sense to undo this important set of reforms. I am \npleased to stand with Senator Warren and with any other Senator on \neither side of the aisle to defend these important reforms and defend \nthe taxpayer.\n  Dodd-Frank's swaps reforms are critically important to addressing the \nregulatory gaps in the swaps markets which contributed to the magnitude \nof the crisis and the costs of the response to it. We should not roll \nback these needed reforms. Regulators have already provided sufficient \nrelief to counterparties on this matter and moving forward with the \nprovision, as it is creates new risks that are unnecessary and which we \nmay one day regret. There is no need to tie their hands on this point.\n  I firmly support Senator Warren's important amendment because it \nprotects the critical swaps reforms made by Dodd-Frank at a time when \nfinancial stability is important in our economic recovery. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand the majority has none.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York. I \nthank him for his leadership for a number of years on this bill and the \nhard work he did leading up to December to try to get this passed \nbefore the unfortunate response of the Republican majority in the House \nof Representatives, and I thank him for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me congratulate my friend from Ohio \non his ascending to the ranking membership of the banking committee. I \nknow he will do a very outstanding job there and we look forward to it.\n  Before we vote on the amendment before us, which I urge my colleagues \nto support, I wish to reiterate the importance of reauthorizing the \nTRIA program.\n  Undoubtedly, TRIA is a national priority, but it is particularly \nimportant to my home State of New York, one of the world's most \ntargeted cities. After 9/11, I helped introduce and pass the program as \na solution to what was a vexing problem in the insurance industry--how \nto calculate the risks associated with a terrorist attack. It was an \nissue we never had to deal with before. Construction and economic \ngrowth did not depend on whether developers could ensure their property \nagainst a terrorist attack. But, of course, 9/11 changed that as it \nchanged so many things that day.\n  TRIA emerged as a responsible partnership between the public and \nprivate sector, with the government providing a backstop for private \ninsurers. As far as new programs go, it has been extraordinarily \nsuccessful.\n  Over the past decade, TRIA fueled the rebirth of Lower Manhattan. I \nsee it every time I drive through it. One only needs to look at the \nskyline because we now have a new World Trade Center which has emerged \nfrom the shadow of the old towers. One need only ask the construction \nworkers who have helped rebuild the area or look at the tens of \nthousands of jobs that came back after we rebuilt. The redevelopment of \nLower Manhattan is first and foremost a symbol of our city and our \nNation's resilience, but it is also a testament to how effective TRIA \ninsurance has been at creating the right conditions for growing our \neconomy and creating jobs in our cities. Passing TRIA today will keep \nthe program alive and continue the remarkable growth we have seen in \nNew York over the past several years. It will do the same for the \nskyscraper in Los Angeles, the stadium in Nebraska, the shopping center \nin Tennessee. So this program affects the whole country. Any large \nproject depends on terrorism insurance.\n  I know there are some of my colleagues, particularly those in the \nHouse, who say this isn't the government's role. Well, government \nhasn't spent one nickel on this program. It has been fully reimbursed, \nand it is the government's role to foster jobs, to foster economic \ndevelopment, to step in not when the private sector can do the job well \nbut when the private sector can't do the job. After 9/11 people weren't \nbuilding, construction wasn't going forward not only in New York but in \nthe country, because people could not get terrorism insurance. That is \nwhy I am glad TRIA will pass today so we can put the temporary \nexpiration of the program behind us.\n  I am proud to say that attempts by the other body to either not pass \nthe program or so limit it that it would be ineffective, which happened \nas recently as within the last few days, have failed. I thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I thank Mike Crapo who was the \nranking member of the banking committee, and I thank Speaker Boehner \nand Leader McCarthy for understanding the importance of passing this \nlegislation. The negotiated bill between Chairman Hensarling and me \npreserves the terrorism insurance program largely intact--just about \nfully intact--to what it was before and has successfully worked. We did \nnot back off on what we had to do.\n  As I have said before, it is regrettable that extraneous measures \nwere attached. They should be openly debated. That is why I will be \nfully supporting the amendment that has been offered by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. But terrorism insurance will be renewed, and I am \nvery glad for that.\n  I thank Senator Johnson, the former chairman; I thank Senator Brown, \nthe present ranking member, and all of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, particularly those who voted yes--from Bernie Sanders to Ted \nCruz--who saw\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\nthe worthiness and the necessity of this program, which will now go \nforward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to S. 1.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     motion to proceed to S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL \n     Pipeline.\n\n         Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, Chuck Grassley, Richard \n           Burr, Tim Scott, John Boozman, Ron Johnson, Lindsey \n           Graham, James Lankford, James M.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, we had hoped to begin working on \nthe bipartisan Hoeven Keystone jobs and infrastructure bill today. We \nhad hoped to continue offering amendments tomorrow. Unfortunately, some \nof our colleagues across the aisle objected to proceeding to this \nbipartisan legislation so that forces a few changes to the schedule.\n  First, it means we will have to file cloture on the motion to \nproceed, which I just did; and then, as a result, it means under the \nrules of the Senate we won't be able to begin offering amendments until \nnext week.\n  Frankly, it is unfortunate. Many Senators on both sides had hoped to \nuse tomorrow to work on the bill, and I did as well. But we will work \nthrough this because we are determined to get bipartisan jobs \nlegislation on the President's desk as soon as we can.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know we are all concerned right now with \nthe progress that is going to be made on the pipeline, and I would like \nto make a few comments about it.\n  I have three charts. Let us look at this one from Oklahoma. I want to \nremind everyone that we had a visitor to the State of Oklahoma--the \nonly time, I understand, the President has been in Oklahoma. President \nObama came to Cushing, OK.\n  Let me explain where Cushing, OK, is. It is in the central part of \nthe State, and it is the hub of all the pipelines--all the way from \nCanada down to New Mexico. Of course this is the pipeline in question \nhere that we have been talking about over and over now for months and \nmonths and months, and it is one we understand just how great it would \nbe. So the President, knowing this is very popular--and this trip was, \nin fact, actually before the election--made a trip to Oklahoma and \ntalked about how good--well, I will actually read the quote. Keep in \nmind this was in Cushing, OK, right in the middle of the hub of the \npipelines going through. The President said he was directing his \nadministration ``to make this project a priority, to go ahead and get \nit done.''\n  That sounded real good. The problem was everyone in Oklahoma knew he \nwasn't telling the truth. I don't like to stand here and use the ``L'' \nword, because nothing really gets done by it, but he has done \neverything since that time to destroy the pipeline.\n  The President was making the statement then that he was not going to \nstand in the way of furthering the production of this pipeline to go \ndown south through Texas. Well, there is good reason for that, because \nhe couldn't do anything about it. It doesn't go across any \ninternational borders. But where he has blocked this is where he can do \nso, because it crosses the international border between Canada and the \nUnited States.\n  I want to mention that there is a person who has been very active in \nthe political realm. His name is Tom Steyer. He has been very much \ninvolved. Quite frankly, I don't object to people who are right forward \nand honest about what their intentions are. This is the man--Tom \nSteyer, who is a billionaire--and he has had several meetings and said \nthat he was going to put up $50 million of his own money and raise an \nadditional $50 million--that is $100 million--to put in races in the \ncoming election, meaning this last November.\n  It is my understanding that, in the final analysis, he wasn't able to \nraise the extra money, but of his own money--and these are his words, \nnot mine--he put in $70 million. Mr. Steyer said:\n\n       It is true we expect to be heavily involved in the midterm \n     elections . . . we are looking at a bunch of . . . races . . \n     . . My guess is that we'll end up being involved in 8 or even \n     more races.\n\n  So we are talking about some $70 million that was going to be \ninvolved, and I would say that wasn't a real good investment because he \ndidn't win any of those 8 races and actually netted out a loss of 9 \nraces.\n  So again, he has a stated goal to try to do two things with his \ninfluence and his money. Again, I don't criticize him for this. He \nbelieves in his cause. His two causes are No. 1, to try to stop any \nfurther development on Federal land--in other words, to try to do what \nhe can with some of the suggested pollution and all these things that \nare supposed to go with it--and another thing is to stop the pipeline.\n  Again, he was the one who made the statement. He also has been very \ninfluential in this administration. It has been reported--this was \nabout 2 weeks ago--that he had visited the Obama White House some 14 \ntimes, which led a member of the watchdog group Public Citizen to say: \n``Tom Steyer has not just got the ear of the President, but he clearly \nhas the President's attention.''\n  Now, these White House meetings were often with President Obama's \ncounselor and chief environmental adviser John Podesta. We all know \nJohn Podesta. We have known his background for a long time. Personally, \nI have known him. He has lobbied for Mr. Steyer to be the U.S. \nSecretary of Energy, saying, ``I think he would be a fabulous choice \nfor energy secretary, and I've let my friends in the administration \nknow that.'' The reports also show that Mr. Steyer and Mr. Podesta have \nmet with George Soros, one of the liberal billionaires.\n\n  So this effort is going on, and I think it is necessary to remind the \nAmerican people because it has probably been about 6 months since \nanyone has even talked about some of the obstacles we can look forward \nto that are in the way of getting the things done that need to be done.\n  The President tries to downplay the job numbers. We talk about the \n42,000 jobs. The President said a couple days ago: Wait, those are just \ntemporary jobs. Well, all jobs are temporary, but these jobs will be \nthere for a number of years and will lead to others.\n  The President tries to downplay the numbers by using rhetoric that \nhas earned his statements multiple Pinocchios. The Washington Post has \na program where they check the facts, and several times he has been the \nrecipient of these Pinocchio awards.\n  Unfortunately, his attitude toward construction and manufacturing \njobs is one that would stop jobs for hard-working Americans.\n  So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--and this is very \nsignificant. We are talking about jobs. We are talking about important \njobs. We are talking about high-paying jobs. I am a little biased \nbecause in Cushing, OK, we are the hub of these pipelines going through \nAmerica. So what is going to positively affect our economy nationwide \nwill probably be even more in my State of Oklahoma.\n  The President has done a lot of talking about the transportation \ninfrastructure. Of course, this pipeline is part of it. We think about \ntransportation infrastructure as roads, highways, and bridges. I \napplaud every time I hear him saying we need to do something about our \ntransportation infrastructure. Unfortunately, it is always just words. \nHe never follows through. He had a program on two different occasions \nthat was going to be very ambitious and was going to start constructing \nnew highways. He was very specific about where they were going to go. \nBut then that was the end of it. He got the word out there, and \neveryone heard about it and agreed that he must be for highways, but \nthen he forgot about it.\n  I am pretty biased here because I chair the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee that deals with all the infrastructure. I would say \nthis: We are embarking on a very ambitious transportation \nreauthorization bill, and it is one that is going to include lots of \nmodes of transportation. Of course, it would all be a part of this \npipeline and the benefits that are coming through it. So I would say he \ndoes a lot of talking about that, but we are going to really have to \nget down and do it.\n  I often wonder what could have happened 6 years ago. Just to refresh \nour memories, the first thing this President did was his $825 billion \nstimulus bill. How better could you stimulate the economy than having \nan ambitious transportation bill? I remember my colleague on the other \nside of the aisle, Barbara Boxer, and I offered amendments on this \namount. I, of course, vigorously opposed the $825 billion--that was a \ncheckbook given to the President in the opening months of his office. \nBut the fact was that it was going to pass, and we knew they had the \nvotes to pass it right down party lines--which it did--and then he was \ngoing to be in a position to say: We are now going to be doing these \nthings. So Barbara Boxer and I thought, well, let's get a percentage. I \nthink our amendment was 8 percent would be reserved--a modest amount--\nfor highways. If we really want to stimulate the economy, there is no \nbetter way to do it than that way.\n  That is kind of a background of what has been happening.\n  I really believe, now that we have a majority, that we are going to \nget busy and try to get this done and will be successful in doing it. \nWe have a lot of critical infrastructure projects. This is supported by \nthe chamber of commerce and by labor unions. Almost everyone out there \nis in support of this.\n  Yesterday, I think it was, in one of the committee hearings--I wanted \nto\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nmake sure this was properly answered in the committee hearing because \nit was in a committee that I am not on, the energy committee.\n  One of my good friends on the Democratic side of the aisle made the \nstatement: We are very proud of the President because our production \nhas dramatically increased during the 6 years he has been President of \nthe United States.\n  Yes, that is true, but it has been in spite of the President. Let me \ngive a couple statistics that people are not aware of. In the shale \nrevolution taking place in this country, we have increased, during that \nperiod of time, our production--we are really talking about shale \nproduction--by 61 percent. So 61 percent in 5 years. That is what it \nhas been. But all 61 percent of that has been on private and State \nland. On Federal land--over which President Obama has jurisdiction and \ncan stop it--while the rest has increased by 61 percent, it has \ndecreased by 6 percent.\n  I think we need to make sure to remind people because we don't want \nthe public thinking that somehow the President is not involved in a war \non fossil fuels. He is definitely involved in a war on fossil fuels.\n  Let me mention one other thing about the shale revolution. Because of \nthe Marcellus, what is happening back East--people have always \nhistorically thought about the West and the State of Oklahoma as being \nkind of where all the oil is and where the production is. That really \nwas true for a long period of time, but with the Marcellus coming in, \nPennsylvania, New York--the Northeast has been a heavy production area. \nIn fact, I have heard figures that in Pennsylvania, the second largest \nemployer right now is people involved in the shale production that is \ntaking place there. I don't know that it is the second largest, but \nthat has not yet been refuted.\n  So very important things are happening there, but the key to making \nall of this happen is the pipeline. We know that eventually we are \ngoing to be there, but there has already been a veto threat. We are \ngoing to pass a bill. I know we are going to pass a bill. It is going \nto pass the House and the Senate. The President will probably veto it. \nHe said he would. I am inclined to think that a lot of my friends on \nthe Democratic side are going to stop and think ``Wait a minute, this \nis good for everyone,'' and there will be a bunch of people overriding \na veto. I really believe something like that is going to happen, this \nis so significant.\n  People have said: The reason we don't want this is because it is \ndirty. This is up in Alberta, Canada. This is going to affect the \nenvironment.\n  First of all, it won't. People understand that is just not a true \nstatement. But if it were true, it is something that is ridiculous \nbecause China is already making their deal. It has been made public \nthat China wants to have transportation across Canada that would go to \nthe west coast and be able to be sent over to China. If that should \nhappen, in terms of the pollution, since they don't have any safeguards \nover there, that would result in increasing, not decreasing, any \npollution that would be associated with this production.\n  I know a lot of people want to talk about this. To give an idea of \nwhat all is there in moving this production around, this is a very \nsignificant chart because it shows what is out there today and what can \nbe produced. A minute ago I talked about the Northeast. That is the \nMarcellus we are talking about. It is a huge benefit out there. Yet a \nlot of the people who represent that part of America are not even aware \nthat this is not just the Western United States. Just look at that, and \nwe can see.\n  We have an opportunity here. I feel very strongly that our friends up \nthere with the pipeline coming down--everyone is going to benefit. We \nhave seen the charts. Certainly the Presiding Officer has many times \npulled out the charts that show the great benefits that are going to be \nthere for the entire country, along with our rapid path to be totally \nindependent of any other country in our ability to produce our own \nenergy.\n  This is a win-win situation. We are eventually going to get it but \nthe sooner the better. I applaud the Chair and others involved in the \nlegislation we are going to be considering.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we have begun the new year of the 114th \nCongress with a Republican majority and a fresh commitment to get \nCongress working again.\n  Overwhelmingly, Americans supported the progrowth ideas of the \nRepublican Party in the polls in the November election, sending a \nstrong message about their frustration with the gridlock we have \nexperienced in the Democratic-led Senate.\n  So it is time to get to work, time to return to regular order and to \ndebate openly legislation, to move bills through committee, to allow \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments, and to get the \nSenate back on track passing bills the way it should be. The American \npeople deserve a Senate that works, and the new Republican majority \nintends to deliver.\n  That is why it is so disappointing that President Obama would \nthreaten to veto the very first bill Republicans plan to bring to the \nSenate floor for a vote--a bipartisan vote to authorize the Keystone XL \nPipeline, a bill that was introduced here in the Senate with 60 \ncosponsors.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline enjoys widespread public support, and that \nis not surprising. Polls have demonstrated that the American people are \nconcerned about jobs and the economy, and they want to get the country \nworking again and to strengthen our energy independence. The Keystone \nXL Pipeline will help do just that. Yet President Obama would rather \nhold the economy hostage to the far leftwing of his party than put \nAmerican workers first. His war on energy runs counter to what this \ncountry needs--jobs and the affordable energy that will support them.\n  I have shared time and time again on the Senate floor what President \nObama's own State Department has said about the project. The State \nDepartment has concluded the pipeline will not only support 42,000 jobs \nduring construction, but it will do so without significant impact on \nthe environment--and, I might add, without spending a cent of taxpayer \nmoney.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline has been stuck in limbo for over 6 years and \nhas become more than just an energy issue. In my own State of South \nDakota, rail backlogs have caused tremendous delays for farmers trying \nto get their harvests to market. The Keystone XL Pipeline will help \nalleviate this backlog by taking 100,000 barrels of Montana and North \nDakota oil off the rails, freeing up nearly two unit-trains per day of \ncapacity that is sorely needed by other rail shippers.\n  The pipeline will also bring tax revenue to South Dakota. The State \nDepartment estimates that in my home State of South Dakota alone, the \nconstruction of the pipeline will support 3,000 to 4,000 jobs during \nconstruction and generate well over $100 million in earnings. It will \nbring more than $20 million in annual property taxes to South Dakota \ncounties. Places like Jones County, where I grew up, could greatly \nbenefit by having this added tax revenue for their schools.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline will also decrease our reliance on oil from \ndangerous countries such as Venezuela. Yet President Obama and some \nDemocrats continue to downplay all these benefits. They say the jobs \nare mostly temporary. Well, construction jobs are temporary by nature, \nbut that doesn't mean they don't matter. Rather, it means we need to \nkeep new projects such as Keystone XL coming to spur growth and to \ndevelop new infrastructure. By shutting down what would be a routine \nenergy infrastructure project, President Obama is creating a difficult \nenvironment for future development and projects.\n  The far leftwing of the President's party claim the pipeline will \nincrease greenhouse gases, but reports from the\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\nPresident's own State Department undermine his claim. In its final \nsupplemental environmental impact statement, the President's State \nDepartment noted that the Keystone XL Pipeline is ``unlikely to \nsignificantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the \ncontinued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United \nStates.''\n  In other words, the emissions associated with the oil sands \nextractions will not change whether or not the pipeline is built. While \noil prices may impact the production rate of oil sands, the State \nDepartment also found that ``the dominant drivers of oil sands \ndevelopment are more global than any single infrastructure project'' \nand that ``the industry's rate of expansion should not be conflated \nwith the more limited effects of individual pipelines.'' And mind you, \nthis is again from one of the five exhaustive reports we have seen from \nthe State Department about this project.\n\n  In fact, the State Department's final environmental impact statement \nalso compared the operational greenhouse emissions that would result \nfrom the pipeline to those that would result from various \ntransportation alternatives such as rail, rail and pipeline, and rail \nand tanker. The report found that the annual emissions from these \nalternative transportation modes would be anywhere from 28 percent to \n42 percent greater than if the oil were shipped through the pipeline. \nPlus, a pipeline is safer than truck or rail.\n  The American people have been clear on their feelings about this \nproject. Poll after poll has shown their strong support for it. \nRepublicans support the pipeline, Democrats in both Houses of Congress \nsupport the pipeline, and unions support the pipeline. The only people \nwho seem to oppose it are President Obama and members of the far \nleftwing of the Democratic Party.\n  After the Senate passes the bill, it will have one final hurdle to \nclear--the President of the United States. I very much hope he will \nreconsider his veto threat and listen to the voices of American workers \nand the bipartisan majority in both Houses of Congress.\n  If the pipeline's economic benefits, the support of the American \npeople, and five successful environmental reviews have not yet \nconvinced the President to approve this project, I am pretty skeptical \nthat he ever will approve it, but I hope I am wrong.\n  I hope even more Democrats here in the Senate will join us and send a \nmessage about their readiness to work with Republicans in this 114th \nCongress.\n  My colleagues can help show the American people that Congress has \nheard their demands for change in Washington and that their economic \npriorities will be addressed.\n  I am sorry American workers have had to wait years for this project, \nbut I am hopeful we can resolve this issue once and for all. The new \nRepublican Senate majority is about creating jobs and economic \nopportunities for the American people, and it starts right here, right \nnow with the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  We hope Democrats and the President will join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, even during moments of intense \npolarization here in Washington, especially over the past 6 years, it \nis really kind of refreshing to find a topic--maybe a handful of \ntopics--on which there appears to be bipartisan consensus, and that \nincludes the topic du jour, the Keystone XL Pipeline. I wish to share a \nfew reasons why I believe that is the case.\n  First, the Keystone XL Pipeline will be good for our economy, and it \nwill be good because it will create jobs. I know there is some \nhairsplitting out there. Some people say: Well, these are not really \ngood jobs; they are only temporary jobs or some such thing. But the \ntruth is--I will tell you what the President's own administration said \nabout that.\n  The State Department--President Obama's State Department--said that \nroughly 42,000 American jobs would be created directly and indirectly \nfrom the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Now, it is true that some of these would be temporary construction \npositions, but by there nature, construction positions are such that \nyou go to work on one job, finish that job, and move on to the next \njob. If the President has a problem with that, I am not sure what he or \nanybody else can do about it. There are also other permanent jobs that \nwill be created by this Keystone XL Pipeline related to refining and \ntransporting this oil, and many of them will be in Texas.\n  As a matter of fact, this pipeline--which will go from Canada into \nNorth Dakota and across the United States--will end in southeast Texas, \nwhere we have most of our refining capacity here in the United States. \nIt will then be refined into gasoline and other types of fuel.\n  By the way, one of the blessings of having a plentiful supply of oil \nas a result of what has happened here in the United States is lower \ngasoline prices. Boy, those came just in time for the Christmas \nholidays and put money in people's pockets. It was like a pay raise for \nhard-working American taxpayers.\n\n  The President has also tried to downplay the job-creation impact of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline by saying it would have a ``nominal'' impact \non consumers and the Nation. I am curious. At a time when the national \nlabor participation rate is hovering at its lowest point in three \ndecades and we are coming off of the financial crisis that we have had \nsince 2008--which has finally, after all of these years, recovered many \nof the lost jobs that were lost as result of that crisis--does the \nPresident truly feel that any additional jobs--especially 42,000 \nadditional jobs--are just nominal and not worth the candle? Well, for \nthose people who don't work and are now able to find work, those jobs \nare not nominal. For the people who are working part time and want to \nwork full time, those jobs will not be nominal. When we need to grow \nthe economy so we create more opportunity for more hard-working \ntaxpayers, no job, in my view, should be deprecated as just a nominal \njob and not worth having. That is what the President is saying.\n  I would also ask that the President visit the Texas leg of this \npipeline. As a matter of fact, the President did go to Cushing, OK. The \nirony of that is, once again, the President seems to be taking credit \nfor something he didn't have anything to do with because this domestic \nportion of the pipeline from Cushing, OK, down to southeast Texas \ndidn't require his approval at all. But what does he do? He holds a \npress conference there. It is just like the President taking credit for \nthis renaissance of American energy. He has had absolutely nothing to \ndo with it. All of that has happened as a result of private investment \non private lands and not on public lands.\n  As a matter of fact, the Federal Government continues to make it \nharder and harder to produce more American energy, which, again, \naccording to the laws of supply and demand, as we have seen, will bring \ndown gasoline prices for American consumers. At a time when wages have \nbeen stagnant for so long as a result of the policies of this \nadministration, why wouldn't we do something to put more money into the \npockets of hard-working American families? Why wouldn't we do that?\n  Well, I would ask the President to visit the Texas leg of the \npipeline, which was constructed and went operational about a year ago \nthis month and is already transporting about 400,000 barrels of oil a \nday to gulf coast refineries. Of course, again, this does not require \nhis approval, but that didn't stop him from claiming credit for it. I \nthink he would find it edifying and educational to go there.\n  In Texas alone more than 4,800 jobs were created to construct that \ngulf coast portion of the pipeline. That includes heavy equipment \noperators, welders, laborers, transportation operators, and supervisory \npersonnel. When our friends across the aisle spend so much time and \neffort trying to argue for a minimum wage increase, they turn around at \nthe same time and deny hard-working Americans from earning these high-\npaying wages and these high-paying jobs.\n  I was reading an article today about a welder in Texas who went to \nschool to learn how to be a welder. Now, it was not a 4-year liberal \narts education such as many of us have had. He didn't go to law school \nor medical school, but he is earning $140,000 a year as a welder. Those \nare good jobs. Those are the\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\nkinds of jobs we ought to encourage, and they are the kinds of jobs \nthat the Keystone XL Pipeline would help pay for.\n  Well, perhaps these kinds of jobs don't count in the President's book \nbecause they are not funded by the taxpayer. In other words, they are \nnot a result of stimulus funds. The President seems to believe that the \nonly jobs worth having are those that are paid for by borrowing money, \nincreasing the debt, and having the Federal Government pay for them. We \nhave recently been down that road once before when we had the nearly $1 \ntrillion stimulus package. Remember that? The President said these were \nshovel-ready jobs.\n  I remember at the time Speaker Pelosi said they were targeted, \ntemporary, and timely, I think it was. It was the three t's. The \nPresident came back later on--when the stimulus did not have the \ndesired effect and the $1 trillion of borrowed money, including \ninterest, didn't create the kind of economic recovery he had hoped \nfor--and said: Well, I guess shovel ready didn't really mean shovel \nready, as if it were a joke.\n  Well, this Keystone XL Pipeline is paid for as a result of private \ninvestment and not as a result of tax dollars--your money and my money \ngoing into this pipeline. The Texas portion of the pipeline was a $2.3 \nbillion private sector investment. The taxpayer funded infrastructure \nproject seemed to be the only kind of investment the President actually \nwants to see and encourage. There are many examples, and perhaps the \nmost notorious of which was Solyndra, where the Federal taxpayer was \nasked to sink a bunch of money into a project that basically flopped \nbecause there was no market for what they were making. It was not \neconomically viable. But that is the kind of investment the President \nwants to encourage while discouraging private investment that creates \njobs.\n  Now, in Texas we are proud of that portion of the Keystone XL \nPipeline, and like so much of what makes my State successful, it was \nnot built by the government. I am proud of the fact that my State is \ndoing better than the rest of the country. I wish the rest of the \ncountry would do as well when it comes to job creation and opportunity \nbecause I worry, as I think many parents worry, that we are somehow \nlosing the hope and the aspiration for the American dream. When young \nmen and women graduate from college and can't find jobs so they end up \nliving with their parents, we here in Washington say, that is OK, \nbecause we will let your parents keep you on their health insurance \ncoverage until you are 26, as if that is supposed to be some kind of \nanswer to their inability to find work commensurate with their \neducation and training.\n  Well, this is not a government solution. Of course, we all remember \nthe President notoriously said to the private sector: Well, you didn't \nbuild that. That certainly doesn't apply here because the private \nsector did build the Texas portion, and what we would like to do is \ncomplete the Canadian-U.S. portion so we can get even more of this oil \ndown to Texas and refine it into gasoline so it is available to \nconsumers here in the United States.\n  The President acts as though if we don't complete this pipeline, this \noil is not going to be produced. That is malarkey. We know that China \nis starved for natural resources, and Canada is not just going to sit \non this valuable natural resource. They are going to build a pipeline \nto the Pacific Ocean, put it on a tanker, and send it to China or other \ncountries that need those natural resources.\n  Well, I am beginning to think the one reason why the Texas leg of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline was so successful is because the Federal \nGovernment didn't have anything to do with it. That seems to be the \ntest. If the Federal Government has something to do with it, it ends up \nnot delivering as promised. But if the private sector does it, it has \nthe potential of living up to expectations.\n  Well, we all know the President has continued to delay making a final \ndecision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. I know last year the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer sponsored the bill in the House that \napproved the Keystone XL Pipeline. Over here in the Senate, I remember \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, was urging--in almost \ndesperate terms--that Senator Harry Reid allow a vote on the Keystone \nXL Pipeline after denying it for many months, even years.\n  Well, we know what happened. It failed because very few Democrats on \nthat side of the aisle decided to support the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nPerhaps it was because even at that time the President said he was \nundecided whether to sign it or to veto it. There have been times when \nthe President has said--of course, he says lots of things, but I have \nlearned one thing around Washington, DC: We can't just listen to what \npeople say, we have to watch what they do. The President indicated, \nwith the start of this new Congress following the November 4 election, \nthat he was looking forward to working with the new Congress in a \nconstructive way. I just have to ask you, Mr. President: Is it \nconstructive to issue a veto threat on a piece of legislation before it \nis even voted out of the energy committee and isn't even on the floor \nfor consideration by the Senate?\n  The majority leader, Senator McConnell, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, has said we are going to have an open amendment process, a \nprocedure many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and \nactually many on this side of the aisle, haven't experienced under the \nformer majority leader--an open amendment process. I anticipate there \nare going to be a number of amendments offered, some of which will \nsucceed and some of which will not succeed. I don't know anybody who \ncan tell us right now exactly how this bill will leave the Senate, \nalthough I am confident it will pass since there are at least 63 \nSenators, on a bipartisan basis, who said they will vote for it. As we \nknow, 60 is the magic number in the Senate, so we have a pretty good \nidea it will pass. But we don't know what other measures will be \nattached to it, some of which may command more Democratic votes, some \nof which may make the President more interested in taking another look \nat this legislation. So to prematurely issue a veto threat before the \nKeystone XL Pipeline is even voted out of committee, much less comes to \nthe Senate floor, does not strike me as wanting to work with the \nCongress; just the opposite.\n  I say enough is enough. That is what we heard from the voters on \nNovember 4: Enough is enough. They are sick and tired of the \ndysfunction in Washington, DC. I heard that story daily back in Texas \nand around the country as I traveled: Enough is enough. We want \nCongress to function. We want our elected representatives to work \ntogether to find solutions to the problems facing our country, and the \nNo. 1 problem is not enough jobs. There are not enough good jobs for \nhard-working Americans.\n  So now the President has, in spite of this, said: I am not going to \nsign that legislation once it reaches my desk. He said this before the \nSenate has even acted on it. It is just breathtaking. Is that within \nthe President's authority under the Constitution? Yes, it is. The \nPresident can either sign legislation or he can veto legislation. The \nConstitution gives him that authority. But I think the President ought \nto have to explain to the American people his reasons for saying he \nwill not sign this legislation. Again, this is the same project his own \nState Department said would create 42,000 jobs, again at a time when \nthe percentage of people in the workforce is at a 30-year low. While \nunemployment is coming down, unfortunately a lot of it has to do with \nthe fact that people are not looking for work and have dropped out of \nthe workforce. They have given up. Hopefully, in spite of the Federal \nGovernment--and I say it is in spite of the Federal Government--the \neconomy seems to be strong enough to be growing, finally, but we need \nto continue to have our economy grow. We need to continue to let this \nAmerican economy create jobs for hard-working American taxpayers.\n  I say in closing that I hope the President makes his decision not \nwearing ideological blinders, not just listening to the hard left base \nof the Democratic Party that thinks we can somehow survive and prosper \nwith only wind turbines and solar panels. By the way, Texas actually \nproduces more electricity on wind energy than any other State in the \nNation. We do believe in an ``all of the above'' policy. The President \nsays he does but apparently does\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\nnot, at least his actions would so indicate.\n  So we are missing out on a golden opportunity to further enhance \nNorth American energy security with one of our strongest allies, and \nthat is another very important reason for this. Why in the world would \nwe continue to import oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries in the \nMiddle East that have their own problems, in an unstable region of the \nworld, when we could import that oil from our best ally and next-door \nneighbor, Canada, and in a way that benefits our economy and creates \njobs.\n  I believe what the American people said on November 4 is they want \neffective, efficient, and accountable government and one that benefits \nall hard-working Americans and especially hard-working American \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                        Tribute To Jeanne Atkins\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Jeanne Atkins, my \nOregon State director, who is retiring from team Merkley this month. \nJeanne is a long-serving member of my team, and she is an outstanding \npublic servant, an individual who has dedicated her life to making the \nworld a better place.\n  Jeanne Atkins and I first began working together a decade ago after I \ntook up the post of Democratic leader in the Oregon State House. It was \na challenging but exciting time as my leadership team worked to build \nour policy agenda and get our caucus operations up to speed. A key \ncomponent of that effort, of course, was to hire a superb caucus \ndirector. Thus, it came to pass that four members of my leadership team \nwere seated in the Old Wives' Tale restaurant brainstorming over \ncandidates for the position. That group consisted, in addition to \nmyself, of Diane Rosenbaum, who is now majority leader of the Oregon \nSenate; Dave Hunt, who became majority leader of the house and then \nspeaker of the Oregon House; and Brad Avakian, who is now Oregon's \nlabor commissioner. As we were brainstorming, Diane spoke up and said: \nI know someone who would be tremendous, but I am sure she would never \ntake the position. Dave Hunt encouraged Diane to put the name forward \nanyway, and when Diane said the person is Jeanne Atkins, Brad Avakian \nresponded: Jeanne? I know her, and she would be great.\n  We immediately called Jeanne, and by that evening I was sitting in \nher living room attempting to persuade her that she would be just the \nright person for the position and that, moreover, she would enjoy the \nchallenge. Fortunately for us, Jeanne did take the position, and thus \nbegan a decade of close collaboration.\n  The leadership, conviction, and hard work Jeanne Atkins brought to \nour team allowed us to make a big impact as the minority party during \nthe legislature and an even bigger impact when we won the majority 2 \nyears later. At that point I became speaker of the Oregon House and \nJeanne became my chief of staff.\n  Few legislative sessions in Oregon history have seen the passage of \nas many major bills as that 2007 session, and no individual was more \nimportant to the success of that session than Jeanne Atkins.\n  We passed domestic partnerships and a broad-based civil rights bill \nthat outlawed discrimination against LGBT Oregonians in employment, in \nhousing, and in public accommodations.\n  We passed legislation setting ambitious renewable energy standards \nand making Oregon a national leader in the transition to green energy. \nWe cracked down on predatory payday lenders that were bankrupting our \nworking families. We passed the Access to Birth Control Act requiring \ninsurance plans in Oregon to cover contraceptives just as they do other \nmedication, a law that is now helping to shield Oregon women from the \nmisguided Hobby Lobby decision.\n  Through this all, we worked across the aisle, encouraging bipartisan \ncooperation, and were able to put together a session that a major \nnewspaper, The Oregonian, deemed the most productive in a generation.\n  After I was elected to the U.S. Senate and took that office in \nJanuary of 2009, Jeanne stayed on in the Oregon House as chief of staff \nto the new speaker, Dave Hunt, who had helped to hire her 6 years \nearlier. In that role, Jeanne played a pivotal role in expanding health \ncare to Oregon children. As Dave relates, after Oregonians rejected a \nballot measure in 2008 that would have raised the cigarette tax to \nexpand health care to low-income children, the Oregon Legislature was \nseeking an alternative strategy to fund that expansion. Jeanne was the \nkey staff member who brought a contentious dialogue among legislators \nto a compromise funding strategy that was successfully passed into law. \nThat achievement brought health care to an additional 90,000 children \nper year. Well done, Jeanne. That was an extraordinary accomplishment.\n  After the completion of that Oregon legislative session, I was hoping \nI would have the opportunity to bring Jeanne back onto team Merkley. \nThe stars aligned and she became my Oregon State director in August of \n2009.\n  Oregon's House loss was the U.S. Senate's gain. In her more than 5 \nyears as State director, Jeanne has overseen hundreds of townhalls, \nthousands of meetings, and has made sure the millions of Americans who \ncall Oregon home have a voice in the U.S. Senate. I wrote the day I \nhired her as Oregon State director that ``Jeanne is greatly respected \nby Oregonians of all political stripes for her hard work and her \ndedication to this State.'' Today, that statement is even more true \nthan 5 years ago.\n  Jeanne is known across the State as an honest broker who works hard \nto bring the voices of all Oregonians into our office. She is a tough \nadvocate for our State and has never hesitated to stand up for what she \nthinks is right and what she thinks is best for Oregon.\n  Of course, over the last 5 years, we have also had the chance to get \ninto a few adventures--and a few misadventures--traveling around the \nState. On one memorable townhall swing, we were on our way between \nrural townhalls when I suggested an impromptu revision of our route. I \nthought it would be interesting to take a shortcut via a minor \nsemipaved road. That road turned out to have been abandoned so long ago \nthat after a few miles it was no longer even visible. So there we were \ntraveling off-road in a van that was not designed for off-road \nnavigation, wondering if we were choosing the right path through the \nfield or between the trees. To make matters worse, we quickly lost cell \nphone communication and couldn't alert the advance team that we were \ngoing to be late to the townhall. In fact, we were wondering whether we \nmight be out there in the woods for a night or two as we worked to walk \nour way out should we break an axle or blow a tire.\n  Through this all, though I could tell Jeanne's blood pressure and \ndistress were elevating, she displayed the same unflappable demeanor \nthat made her so effective in contentious policy dialogues with \noverwrought legislators. In that moment and in so many others, Jeanne \nwas grace under pressure personified.\n  Jeanne is not someone who got into politics to be important or \npowerful. She got into policy and politics because she believed in \npublic service and she believed that each person has the power to make \na difference. It is one of the attributes I most value about having her \non my team. It is an attribute that has allowed her to make a huge \nimpact in many of the different positions she has held.\n  Today, as Jeanne looks forward to the next chapter of her life in \nretirement, it seems only appropriate to reflect back and look at the \nhuge difference Jeanne has made not just in our office but over the \ncourse of her career. She has been a longtime advocate for women's \nrights. This comes from her childhood growing up in Bremerton, WA, in \nthe 1960s. Her own experiences also shaped Jeanne's steadfast \ndetermination for equality.\n  She told me a story about her first job out of college as a bank \nteller in Seattle, WA. During that first job, the women in the bank, \nregardless of their position, were required to take turns making lunch \nfor the entire bank every Friday. Jeanne worked hard to shine at this \ntask, just as she worked hard to shine at all her other tasks, but she \nknew it was wrong that all the women in the office were treated \ndifferently than the men, and she carried her passion for that \nthroughout her career.\n  Jeanne went to work for the Women's Equity Action League here in\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\nWashington, DC, and when she and her husband John went back to Oregon \nshe worked for the Oregon Women's Rights Coalition, the United Way of \nthe Columbia/Willamette, Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette, \nand then as manager of the Women's and Reproductive Health Section of \nthe Department of Human Services. Her long and storied career has been \npowerfully connected to equality and an unshakable commitment to \nwomen's health.\n\n  Along the way, Jeanne also engaged in electoral politics. She ran for \nthe Oregon house twice in the early 1990s, narrowly losing against a \nwell-established incumbent in her second race. As Brad Avakian relates, \nin the process, she restored door-to-door canvassing and relationship \nbuilding in Washington County as a political art form.\n  Jeanne Atkins is an Oregon gem. I wish her the best in retirement and \nknow that she has many more adventures ahead and many more \ncontributions to make.\n  Thank you, Jeanne, for working hard to make Oregon, our Nation, and \nour world a better place. We will miss you.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today at the start of \nthis new year and this new Congress to speak about how we can and why \nwe must work together to improve the Affordable Care Act.\n  Since work on health care reform really began in earnest in 2009, \ndebate in this Chamber and across this country has too often been \ndefined by fantastic claims and fearmongering. In the midst of this \ndivision, I believe that too often the experiences of real people have \nbeen lost. While politicians on both sides cling to their sacred cows, \ntoo many Americans become casualties of our divided politics.\n  On few issues has this been more true than on health care. Critics of \nthe Affordable Care Act seem locked into the belief that it will bring \nabout America's demise--despite little evidence to support them. Too \noften they have been unable or unwilling to grapple with the reality of \nthose whose lives the law has forever changed for the better.\n  Now, on the other side of the aisle, we--mostly Democrats--have often \nshied away from acknowledging some of the law's weaknesses. I know many \nof my colleagues have been eager and have offered fixes to the law. But \nwithout willing Republican partners, we have not made enough progress.\n  As I have spent time in my home State of Delaware in recent months \nlistening to families and other folks who have been affected by the \nlaw--for better or for worse--it has become clear to me that this \nstalemate is unsustainable. On many days, I have met Delawareans who \nlove the Affordable Care Act, whose lives have literally been saved by \nit. But in between those encounters, I have also met many, small \nbusiness owners in particular, who want to offer health insurance to \ntheir workers and are struggling to afford it.\n  This much has become clear to me: No conversation about the \nAffordable Care Act and how to improve it can be complete without \nreconciling the reality of the millions of Americans it has helped and \nthe many others for whom it falls short.\n  Michelle Reed is the Delawarean whom I have come to know and admire \nwith breast cancer and who contacted me first about this issue last \nfall. She is an example of why the Affordable Care Act is so important. \nMichelle was first diagnosed with cancer back in 2008 and went through \nmonth after painful month of chemo and radiation therapy as well as \nsurgery.\n  Over the next few years since her cancer nightmare began she faced \nproblems that were sadly typical of how our health insurance system \nused to work. At the time she was first diagnosed, she and her husband \nreceived health insurance through her husband's employer. Her husband \nis an auto mechanic and worked for a small auto body shop. But though \nthe insurance he got through his work was helpful for routine minor \nhealth care needs, it was a barebones insurance policy, as she \nexplained it to me.\n  It left her and her husband with extremely high copays, straining \ntheir family budget. Naturally her husband began looking for a new job \nto provide better health insurance. But this ended up being much more \ndifficult than it seemed, because transitioning to a new job often \nrequired accepting a large 3-month gap in coverage, a gap Michelle just \ncould not afford, as insurance companies would then deny her care \nconsidering her cancer a preexisting condition.\n  At one point during Michelle's years of treatment, her husband's \nemployer switched health care plans and in the process missed one \npremium payment. Suddenly, after months of having had steady, positive \nprogress in her care, without any warning or notification, Michelle \nstarted getting bills--not just small bills but huge bills, a bill for \n$23,000 for radiation.\n  It took her months of going back and forth between employer and \ninsurance company, all the while as she is also trying to overcome her \ndisease, before Michelle and her husband got a straight answer about \nwhy they were suddenly facing these huge costs.\n  Now, let's step back for a second. Just imagine where she was. \nMichelle has cancer. She is shuttling from chemo to radiation. Her \nhusband is working constantly to try to cover the high premiums, trying \nto get all of the overtime he can. During this, they are also going \nback and forth between employer and insurance company, trying to figure \nout where this new high charge they cannot afford had come from.\n  Meanwhile, Michelle's husband was out looking for a new job with \nbetter insurance, struggling to find one because Michelle would face \ndiscrimination and could not get coverage. The emotional strain on a \nfamily and a loved one battling cancer is enormous, almost \nunimaginable. But if you add to that the financial and the emotional \nstress caused by our relic of a health care insurance system of that \ntime, that is unimaginable.\n  Yet this is the reality that Michelle and her family faced. \nUnfortunately, it is the reality that millions of Americans used to \nface before the Affordable Care Act. These problems all changed last \nyear when the ACA exchanges came on line. As Michelle wrote to me: The \nACA open enrollment began and we could not get signed up quick enough, \nalthough it did take her a little while because the administration's \nWeb site had some problems. She persevered. As she said to me in her \nnote: We have no problems now. We have what we need, and we need what \nwe have.\n  People like Michelle are why Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act \nin the first place. It is because of the law that millions of Americans \nnow have access to quality and affordable health insurance that was \nonce desperately out of reach for them.\n  But the story is not complete, unless we are clear-eyed about where \nthis law also falls short. As the President and many have recognized, \nany significant reform such as the Affordable Care Act is going to have \nweaknesses and unintended consequences that only become apparent after \nthe law is being implemented. This has been true throughout our history \nwith every major event, and health care reform is no different.\n  In Delaware, among the many whom the law has helped, I have also seen \nhow some of those reforms in the costs they have incurred have hurt \nsmall business. To the small business owners with whom I have sat down \nand listened to, their employees are not labor costs or rows on a \nbalance sheet. They are family. They have worked together for years and \nowners provide health insurance because they believe it is the right \nthing to do for the workers who help their business grow.\n  Many of the folks I have sat down and visited with are not required \nto provide insurance because they have fewer than 50 full-time workers. \nThey still want to do so because it is the right thing to do. It helps \nthem incentivize and support their best employees. Many, though, are \nstruggling today because of higher costs and the challenges that come \nwith navigating a changed insurance market.\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\n  This year the biggest issue they face is how higher quality standards \nhave also caused premiums to increase--often to unaffordable levels. \nThis has been especially true for a small State such as like Delaware, \nwhere there is not a lot of competition in the provision of health care \nor in our insurance market. Unfortunately, some of the increases are \nalso due to insurance companies using the health care law as an excuse \nto charge more.\n  Some of this is simply the result of plans that now cover more are \ncosting more. For the most part, that is not a bad thing. But the \nAffordable Care Act was designed to compensate for increased quality \nwith financial assistance to those who cannot afford it. In Michelle \nReed's case, this increased quality was great--almost literally life \nsaving. For people such as her, those insurance plans now need to meet \ncertain standards, and in particular, that they can no longer \ndiscriminate against preexisting conditions.\n  But we have also seen that even though there is assistance to many, \nsome individuals and some small businesses have fallen into gaps where \nthey have to deal with higher costs and they are not getting the help \nthey deserve.\n  Here is where we are. The Affordable Care Act has helped millions of \nAmericans. It also can be improved to help many more. When we talk \nabout health care, it is simply dishonest to leave one side out when \ntalking about others.\n  In this new Congress, I know many of my Republican colleagues are \neager to continue the efforts of their colleagues in the House. In \ntheir majority, I know many will seek an opportunity to vote on \nrepealing or dismantling the Affordable Care Act. But I ask them for an \nanswer to Michelle Reed and to the many Americans such as her who have \nhad their lives changed or even saved by this law.\n  I know many of my Democratic colleagues are as well eager to work \ntogether to improve our health care system, to ensure small businesses \ndo the right thing and can be successful and to ensure that no American \ngets left behind. We know this is possible. There is no reason to \nbelieve that we as a body lack the creativity, the drive, and the \nability to work together across the aisle on these important issues.\n  Surely there is much we can do to reduce the costs through more \ncompetition, to develop new and more efficient delivery systems and \ninnovative payment models. The Affordable Care Act took critical steps \nto move forward in each of these areas. Millions more have health \ninsurance and costs across our health care system have actually \nincreased at the slowest rate in decades. For most, costs have been \nmanageable or even decreasing. But critical work remains. We now have \nthe opportunity, to take the next step to build a health care system \nthat works for every American. It is my sincere hope that we can come \ntogether and seize that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Urgent Priorities\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, these will be my first remarks of the \n114th Congress. I am encouraged by the commitment of many of my \ncolleagues, including the majority leader, to restoring the Senate as \none of America's great institutions. It is time for us to get to work. \nWe begin this Congress with a number of urgent priorities--not the \nleast of which is job creation.\n  More than 9 million Americans are still unemployed. More \nsignificantly, perhaps, millions more have given up looking for work. \nThe latest jobs report from the Department of Labor shows that the \nlabor force participation rate is only 62.8 percent--one of the lowest \nlevels in 36 years. This number matters because it reflects the size of \nthe U.S. workforce. It reflects how many working-age Americans have a \njob or are actively looking for one.\n  Now, some people have suggested we should take heart in the latest \njob figures, that this points to an improving economy. I disagree with \nthat. I am not at all satisfied with these employment numbers, \nparticularly with the fact that only 62 percent of eligible members of \nthe labor force actually are choosing to participate.\n  To me, a shrinking workforce points to a weak economy. Boosting the \njob market is important to boosting future economic growth. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to advance job-creating \nlegislation that has a positive impact on American's daily lives. \nFortunately, dozens of job bills were passed during the last term of \nCongress by the House of Representatives.\n  These ideas deserve consideration and debate in this Chamber. I think \nin the new Congress, these ideas will receive that consideration. I am \naware that there is likely to be disagreement about the details, \ndisagreement about the merits of some of the progrowth ideas that have \ncome over to us from the House of Representatives, as well as proposals \nconcerning energy and health care, to name a few. But resolving our \ndifferences is part of what make this Chamber and our country unique. \nIn a floor speech early last year, Leader McConnell said: I am certain \nof one thing. The Senate can be better.\n  I think that is one of the messages from the American people in last \nNovember and last December's election. The American people believe the \nSenate can be better. We each have a responsibility and a role in \nmaking the Senate better. We could start by legislating through the \ncommittee process. We have begun doing that already. Instead of \nbackroom deals, pushed through at the last minute, which has been the \norder of the day in past years, bills should be thoroughly debated and \nvetted--first in committee and then on the Senate floor.\n  The issues of our day deserve that attention. Forging consensus takes \neffort, but that is how the Senate is supposed to work. Our \nconsideration next week will demonstrate that this is a new day in the \nSenate. I look forward to being a part of the debate and the amendment \nprocess on the Keystone XL Pipeline proposal.\n  Offering amendments is a way in which each of us can have input on \nthe legislation at hand--input on behalf of our constituents, the \npeople who sent us here. For too long the amendment tree has been \nfilled by the majority leader, essentially limiting the right of every \nMember to voice the concerns and opinions of the people they represent, \nessentially limiting the our right to represent the people of our \nStates who sent us here.\n  Instead of a series of continuing resolutions, we should return to \nthe process of 12 separate appropriations bills. In doing so, we could \ncarefully assess Federal spending and reduce waste, and I think the \nAmerican people sent that message to us also in November and December. \nThe Federal debt has reached unprecedented levels, forcing us to make \ntough decisions on how to do more with less.\n  With regard to national defense, I look forward, during the 114th \nCongress, to serving as chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Seapower. Our subcommittee has a wide range of \noversight responsibilities, including the procurement, sustainment, and \nresearch and development needs of the Navy and Marine Corps.\n  From classified briefings and other hearings with senior officials in \nthe Navy and intelligence community, I am well aware of the imminent \nand emerging threats facing our sea services. America should maintain \nits ability to project power around the world while upholding our \nobligations to our friends and allies.\n  Our Navy is now the smallest it has been since World War I, \ndemanding, I believe, a robust investment in sea power.\n  In the coming weeks the Seapower Subcommittee will hold hearings to \ndetermine whether the President's budget proposals for the Department \nof the Navy are sufficient to meet our national security requirements. \nFollowing these hearings, we will draft the Defense authorization bill \nto deliver important capabilities and support for our sailors and \nmarines. This support includes funding for construction of various \ntypes and classes of ships, such as aircraft carriers, amphibious \nships, submarines, and large and small surface combatants.\n  I wish to note that supporting the Department of Defense is best done \nwhen Congress legislates under regular order. The Republican-led Senate\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\nshould take up a defense authorization bill and a defense \nappropriations bill, and we are committed to doing so. Regular order \nwill help provide our military planners with valuable budget \npredictability--something they have suffered without in past years.\n  I was very pleased to learn this week that Chairman McCain plans for \nthe Armed Services Committee to mark up a defense authorization bill \nbefore Memorial Day. Our committee did that under the leadership of \nSenator Levin last year, but where this Senate fell down on its \nresponsibility is that we didn't get the bill to the floor until \nDecember, and then it was in a rushed and unamendable form.\n  Our goal under regular order is for us to take up the bill on the \nfloor this summer and have a conference report between the House and \nthe Senate reported before August. I am heartened that Chairman McCain \nintends to do this. I am heartened by the commitment of the \ndistinguished majority leader that we will indeed take up that \nlegislation before the end of the fiscal year.\n  I should also observe that, absent congressional action, budget \nsequestration will return to the Defense Department in October of this \nyear. Sequestration remains one of the greatest challenges facing our \nmilitary. Unless we take action, the ability of our military and our \nindustrial base to react to unforeseen contingencies will be severely \neroded, and there will undoubtedly be unforeseen contingencies. There \nare always unforeseen contingencies, and we will be unprepared for them \nunless we take action to prevent sequestration.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee and the Budget Committee, \nI will work to help forge a bipartisan path so we can avert a return to \nthe across-the-board defense cuts under sequestration. I am so pleased \nthat a bipartisan task force within the Armed Services Committee is \nalready taking shape to discuss this issue. We will begin to have \ndiscussions beginning Monday and Tuesday of next week.\n  With regard to commerce, I also look forward to assuming the \nchairmanship of the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the \nInternet. My chief focus will continue to be the deployment and \nadoption of broadband in rural America--something I am interested in as \na Senator from Mississippi and something the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer is interested in as a Senator from Louisiana.\n  Broadband has become a vital economic engine in this country and \naround the world. In many ways, the proliferation of the Internet is \nlike the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. We \nneed to ensure that people in rural areas have the same quality \nbroadband as those in urban areas. To that end, our committee will \ncontinue to examine ways to foster broadband growth and development. We \nalso need to find ways to make more spectrum available for wireless, \nwhich can help spur innovation and economic growth in the mobile \nbroadband space.\n  I also expect the Senate this year to deal with legislation regarding \nthe Environmental Protection Agency and the Obama administration's \nenvironmental executive overreach. The administration has proposed a \nlitany of costly environmental rules, targeting everything from coal-\nfired powerplants, to small streams, to small ponds. Many would cause \nsignificant economic harm, while providing little or no help to the \nenvironment--no help to the environment but significant economic harm. \nBy EPA's own estimates, its recently proposed ground-level ozone rules \ncould cost taxpayers as much as $44 billion per year, making it the \nmost expensive rulemaking to date. Meanwhile, EPA's clean powerplant \nrule could lead to a loss of 224,000 jobs each year. These costs are \nstaggering.\n  I am pleased that the final omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2015, which was passed in December, included limits on the \ncontroversial waters of the United States proposal, which regulates \nsmall ponds, streams, and puddles. However, I remain committed to \nensuring that this rule will not be implemented at all. By broadening \nthe definition of ``waters of the United States,'' Washington \nbureaucrats would potentially regulate puddles and ditches on farms and \nin backyards. Is this really what is necessary to protect the \nenvironment? Is this really what the American people require?\n  These regulations would have significant impact on the State of \nMississippi. Our economic growth depends on agriculture, and it depends \non manufacturing and other energy-intensive industries.\n  With each new environmental regulation, the administration is \ncompounding the financial burden on the American people without \ndelivering any environmental benefits. We can have clean air and we can \nhave clean water without losing 224,000 jobs. We can have clean air and \nwater without the cost of $44 billion per year for one single \nregulation.\n  Low-cost and reliable energy is at the core of economic growth. \nEconomic gains from the abundance of affordable energy could be lost if \nthese rules are allowed to be put into place. In an economy desperate \nfor growth, a regulatory onslaught is the worst way to encourage jobs \nand investment.\n  The American people also want us to address the Affordable Care Act, \nObamaCare. I was particularly interested in the thoughtful remarks of \nthe Senator from Delaware, who spoke immediately before me. The remarks \nof my distinguished colleague suggests that Members on both sides of \nthe aisle heard the message from the American people in November and \nDecember in the elections. I think both sides recognize that the \nAffordable Care Act is not affordable and as a matter of fact is \ncausing great hardship and pain to the majority of the American people. \nSo I am pleased to hear Members on the other side of the aisle at least \nacknowledge that many major, significant changes need to be made to \nObamaCare.\n  Overall disapproval of the President's health care law is at an \nalltime high of 56 percent. Americans are suffering under the law's \nmandates and taxes. Many are faced with the financial burden of higher \ncopays and higher deductibles. This is a reality.\n  I must say that I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished senior \nSenator from New York recently when he acknowledged that passing \nObamaCare in the way previous Congresses did was a mistake, that most \nAmericans were satisfied with their coverage and it was a mistake to \nturn that entire system on its head to solve a problem which we very \nmuch needed to solve with regard to the uninsured and underinsured.\n  There was a better way to provide health insurance to those \nindividuals without disadvantaging the vast majority of people who were \nsatisfied with their health care and who now find themselves in a much \nworse position.\n  Congress has the responsibility to ease the burden of ObamaCare by \nrepealing the law's most onerous provisions. I would like to repeal the \nentire act and start over with some good aspects that we could \nincorporate into a better bill but also start off with a better way to \nprovide health care for Americans and provide those who were uninsured \nwith the opportunity to get insurance.\n  At the very least, we should pass legislation restoring the 40-hour \nworkweek. I hope this is one of the things my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are talking about. I note that the President of the \nUnited States has threatened to veto Affordable Care Act amendments \nthat would restore something that has become very traditional in the \nUnited States--the 40-hour workweek. It is very surprising to me that \nit would be on that proposal that the President of the United States \nwould say: No, I will not even sign legislation to restore something as \ntraditional as the 40-hour workweek.\n  We need to repeal the medical device tax, and clearly there are well \nover 60 votes in this body today to do just that. We need to exempt \nveterans from the employer mandate, to provide relief to rural \nhospitals, and we need to repeal the health insurance tax. I hope we \ncan do that, and I hope the sounds I hear from the other side of the \naisle indicate that we can reach bipartisan consensus and send \nlegislation to the President persuading him that there is such broad \nsupport for that and he should sign it.\n  We can do better for the American people than the higher copays, the \nhigher deductibles, and the broken promises they received under the \nACA.\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\nAmericans were flatly told: If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor. That turned out to be a promise the administration could not or \nwould not keep. They were told: If you like your health care plan, you \ncan keep your health care plan. It turned out the administration was \nnot able to make good on that promise. We can do better.\n  With regard to the Federal budget, the national debt now exceeds $18 \ntrillion. During the next 10 years, interest payments on the debt will \nbe the fastest growing budget expenditure. Interest on the debt will be \nthe fastest growing expenditure, more than tripling to $800 billion. \nPut in perspective, one out of every seven tax dollars taken in by the \ngovernment will be used to service the Federal debt.\n  Why is regular order important in this regard? In returning to \nregular order, the Senate Republicans will enact a budget resolution \neach year as required by law. We haven't done this. The law requires \nit, but somehow Congress has waived this requirement for themselves. \nThis contrasts sharply with the past 5 years, during which the \nDemocratic-led Senate passed only one budget. As a result, Congress has \nnot adopted a joint budget resolution since 2009. This will change in \nthis new day of Congress.\n  Under the previous majority, spending bills were not brought to the \nfloor to be debated. Budget laws were routinely waived or ignored, and \nthere has been no plan whatever for finally bringing the Federal budget \nunder control. These are facts. We need to change that, and I hope we \nwill do so in this Congress.\n  In conclusion, we have plenty of work to do. People in my State of \nMississippi, like most Americans, expect results from this Congress. \nThe challenges of our economy, the importance of our national defense, \nand the negative impact of intrusive executive overreach are too great \nnot to address. We need to meet the expectations of the American people \nin this regard.\n  The distinguished majority leader reminded us earlier this week that \nAmericans want a government that works, one that functions with \nefficiency and accountability, competence and purpose.\n  I believe we can do that, but it will take a return to regular order. \nIt will take faith in the committee process. It will take faith in \nreturning this institution to functioning the way the Founders \nintended. And it will take meaningful legislation. It is time to put \nthe priorities of the American people first.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when Sarah Kenney decided to volunteer with \nthe Women's Rape Crisis Center in Burlington, VT, in 1997, she may not \nhave realized just how that experience would shape nearly two decades \nof her life. There, in cramped offices furnished with old futons, she \nrecalls, ``I fell in love with the passion of the place.''\n  That passion led Sarah to the Vermont Network Against Domestic and \nSexual Violence, where she has spent the past 13 years advocating to \nend such violence and to raise public awareness about the abhorrent \ncrimes that account for roughly half of all homicides in Vermont in any \ngiven year.\n  Over the years, Sarah has been a trusted and valuable partner in my \nwork to strengthen support for survivors of domestic and sexual \nviolence, including the successful reauthorization and expansion of the \nViolence Against Women Act so that it better protects all survivors. \nHer understanding of the legislative process, combined with her ability \nto work with all sides, have been the hallmark of her effective \nadvocacy. Sarah has also spent much time at the Vermont State House, \ntestifying on legislation to strengthen protections against victims of \ncrime across our State.\n  Sarah will be leaving her post as the Vermont Network's Associate \nDirector of Public Policy this month, to take on a new advocacy role as \nDeputy Director at Let's Grow Kids in Burlington, where she will use \nher tremendous skills on behalf of bettering children's lives.\n  I am proud to note that Sarah holds a bachelor's degree in political \nscience from my alma mater, St. Michael's College. Her contributions \nare too many to list here, but her work in shaping policy has \nundoubtedly resulted in stronger protections for women and families in \nVermont and across the Nation. In my 40 years in the U.S. Senate, I \nhave worked with many advocates who are passionate about the work they \ndo. I can say that Sarah's passion and commitment make her one of the \nbest. She is superbly effective in turning advocacy into action.\n  In Vermont, we are fortunate to have an organization such as the \nVermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, and even more \nfortunate to have someone of Sarah's talents advocating on behalf of \nvictims. It has been an honor to work with someone whose commitment to \na cause is so distilled and focused. The Vermont Network will miss \nSarah's many talents, but Vermont's children have just gained a \npassionate advocate.\n  I wish Sarah and her family all the best in her new role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/08/senate-section/article/S94-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S94-S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEWART HOLMES\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude for \nthe service of my long-time aide, Stewart Holmes, who is leaving the \nU.S. Senate to pursue a new career. Stewart has served the Senate in \ndifferent capacities over the past 17 years in a manner that reflects \ncredit on the institution and our Nation. During this time, I have \nvalued Stewart as a trusted and loyal advisor with sound judgment on \ncomplex national security issues. More broadly, his public service on \nCapitol Hill has contributed to the safety of the American people and \nour Nation.\n  Stewart's sense of service, responsibility, and dedication to the \nUnited States is closely linked to his own 22-year military service \ncareer. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1979, and was \nappointed a 2nd Lieutenant in 1986. He was deployed during Operation \nDesert Storm. While in the military, he earned a Bachelor of Arts \ndegree from the Citadel in South Carolina and a Master of Arts degree \nin Financial Management from the U.S. Naval Post Graduate School. In \n1997, he became the first military fellow to serve in my Senate office, \na position that preceded his becoming the Marine Corps Appropriations \nLiaison.\n  In 2001, Stewart Holmes retired from the Marine Corps as a major and \njoined my staff as a military legislative assistant. In 2005, he joined \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations and served as an intelligence \nand military advisor to me. He became minority clerk of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee in 2009.\n  Throughout my association with Stewart, he has been a hard worker. He \nhas demonstrated consummate professionalism, attention to detail, and \ndedication to the Senate as an institution. These qualities have served \nhim well as the Defense Subcommittee has worked to overcome the fiscal \nand political challenges inherent in funding our national security \npriorities. I appreciate his work on various issues of importance to \nour national interests and to my State of Mississippi, including \nshipbuilding, supercomputers, next generation technology, shipbuilding, \nNASA and others.\n  As Stewart moves on with the next chapter of his career, I wish him, \nhis wife, Maren, and their children every success and happiness.

Mr. President, as the 114th Congress begins, I would \nlike to pay tribute to a Connecticut native who retired at the end of \nthe last session. Sheila Dwyer, who served as Assistant Secretary of \nthe Senate since 2007, will be deeply missed by many. She worked \nclosely with former Majority Leader Harry Reid and with current \nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had passionate, strong praise for \nSheila's dedication and devotion to this institution. Both recognized \nthat she became known as the ``Mayor of Capitol Hill'' for the skill \nand poise she consistently demonstrated in handling the needs of 100 \nSenators at a time.\n  Sheila was born in Waterbury, CT, and she has remained very proud of \nher roots in our great State throughout her career. While still in high \nschool, she served a semester as a Senate Page, and she later returned \nto spend her career here. After working for such luminaries as Senator \nChuck Robb of Virginia, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, \nand Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, she joined Senator Reid's \noffice.\n  Along the way, Sheila amassed an impressive record of accomplishments \nthat included overseeing logistics for two national Democratic \nconventions, assisting in Presidential inaugurations and countless \nceremonial events, and coordinating the myriad departments and behind-\nthe-scenes operations that keep the Senate running. Throughout, she has \nbuilt and maintained friendships with Senators and staff from all \ncorners of the Capitol and the country. Leader Reid spoke quite \nmovingly about how, in addition to her professional achievements, she \nhas been a strong source of personal support for his family and others.\n  My wife Cynthia and I are honored to know Sheila, and we wish her all \nthe best as she begins the next chapter of her life. I know that all of \nConnecticut joins me in congratulating her on her exemplary \nachievements here in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/08/senate-section/article/S95-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CONGRATULATING FATHER LOUIS LOHAN\n\n Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Henderson \nVeterans Treatment Court Program for its commitment and dedication to \nproviding our veterans with vital services that range from job \nplacement to suicide prevention. Located in Henderson, NV, this unique \nprogram assists our Nation's bravest as they return from the \nbattlefield and readjust to life in their communities.\n  The brave men and women who served the United States and fought to \nprotect our freedom have often come home to a struggling economy. All \ntoo often, returning veterans are unable to find a job or afford to buy \nor rent a home. As the demographics of our Armed Forces have changed \nthroughout the years, so, too, have the needs of our Nation's heroes. \nThe Henderson Veterans Treatment Court, founded in 2011 by Henderson \nChief Judge Mark Stevens, received national recognition and is \nillustrative of how the program should be implemented. With 53 \ngraduates and 41 active participants, this program is a shining example \nof the type of initiatives that will help get our veterans back on \ntheir feet. Although there is no way to ever adequately thank the men \nand women that lay down their lives for our freedoms, the Henderson \nVeterans Treatment Court acts as a one-stop solution for veterans who \nfind themselves in a position of need.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning home from the \nbattlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals but also to ensure they receive the quality care they \nhave earned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise \nfor our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the \nNation. I am very pleased that veterans service organizations like the \nHenderson Veterans Treatment Court are committed to ensuring that the \nneeds of our veterans are being met.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nthe Henderson Veterans Treatment Court, a program with a mission that \nis both noble and necessary. I am honored to acknowledge the Henderson \nVeterans Treatment Court and its tireless efforts to put veterans back \non their feet in Nevada and throughout the United States. Their duty to \nprovide veterans with the skills that will allow them the opportunity \nto change their circumstances is admirable, and I wish the program the \nbest of luck in all of its future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/08/senate-section/article/S95-4", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/08/senate-section/article/S95-5", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/08/senate-section/article/S95-6", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 23.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to extend the authorization of the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program through fiscal year 2020, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. \nOnce enacted, this legislation will continue for another five years the \nimmensely successful grant program that provides matching funds for \nState and local law enforcement agencies to purchase protective vests \nfor officers serving in the field.\n  Our Nation needs no additional reminders of the dangers faced by law \nenforcement officers each and every day. Far too often we have grieved \nas officers are killed in the line of duty. In 2014 alone, 126 men and \nwomen serving in law enforcement lost their lives. Although protective \nvests cannot save every officer, they have already saved the lives of \nmore than 3,000 law enforcement officers since 1987. Vests dramatically \nincrease the chance of survival when tragedy occurs. I have met \npersonally with police officers who are living today because of a \nbulletproof vest, and they will attest to the fact that the vests \nprovided through this program are worth every penny.\n  No officer should have to serve without a protective vest. Yet we \nknow that, for far too many jurisdictions, vests can cost too much and \nwear out too soon. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program helps \nto fill the gap. Since it was first authorized in 1999, it has enabled \nmore than 13,000 State and local law enforcement agencies to purchase \nmore than one million bulletproof vests, including more than 4,000 \nvests for officers in Vermont. As these officers have helped to protect \nour communities, these grants have helped to protect them. \nUnfortunately the authorization for this grant program lapsed in 2012. \nWe must not delay any longer in reauthorizing this program\n  This bill also contains a number of improvements to the grant \nprogram. It provides incentives for agencies to provide uniquely fitted \nvests for female officers and others. It also codifies existing Justice \nDepartment policies that grantee law enforcement agencies cannot use \nother Federal grant funds to satisfy the matching fund requirement, and \nthey must also have mandatory wear policies to ensure the vests are \nused regularly.\n  Protecting those who serve has historically been a bipartisan effort \nin Congress. Republican Senator Ben Nighthorse-Campbell and I worked \ntogether to create this program more than 15 years ago. It was so \nsuccessful that, in the past, it was reauthorized with a voice vote. It \nwas the right thing to do, it saved lives, and that was enough for both \nDemocrats and Republicans. This is not a partisan issue, and I am \npleased that Senator Graham is the lead cosponsor of this measure. \nSenators Coons and Blunt are also original cosponsors of this bill.\n  The law enforcement community speaks with a single voice on this \nissue. And I am proud that this bill is supported by the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, International Association of Chiefs of Police, \nNational Association of Police Organizations, National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, Major County Sheriffs' Association, Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National \nTactical Officers Association, and Sergeants Benevolent Association.\n  There are very few bills that can so directly affect and improve the \nsafety of those who serve and protect our communities. This program \nsaves lives, and I am hopeful that all Senators--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents alike--will join us now to ensure its \nswift reauthorization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 132. A bill to improve timber management on Oregon and California \nRailroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road grant land, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I reintroduce a bill that will end \nthe gridlock on the Oregon and California, O, lands found in my home \nState. I am pleased that my colleague Senator Merkley is joining me in \nthis effort. Last Congress, I introduced this legislation, which went \non to be reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nafter continued work with stakeholders and resulting modifications. I \nfeel that a great deal of progress was made in the last Congress to \nfind a solution for these lands in Oregon, but Congress ran out of time \nto complete work on this bill. That's why I am back at it here today. \nThe bill I introduce today is intended to advance the progress made, \nadopting the modifications from the bill that was reported out of \nCommittee, and paving the way to pass legislation regarding management \nof these lands.\n  My legislation will end decades of uncertainty and broken forest \npolicy with a science-driven solution that moves past the decades old \ntimber wars. It does this by using science to guide management of the \nO lands while upholding bedrock federal environmental laws. This bill \nprovides the jobs that Oregonians need, certainty of timber supply that \ntimber companies require, and continued environmental protections that \nour treasures deserve.\n  First, my legislation divides the O lands, with roughly half set \naside for forestry emphasis and the other half for conservation \nemphasis, to put a stop to the uncertainty and conflicting priorities \nthat have contributed to federal management failure on these lands and \nproduce wins on both sides of the historic timber conflict. The \nforestry emphasis lands will employ proven forestry practices, known as \n``ecological forestry,'' to mimic natural processes and create \nhealthier, more diverse forests. Modeling using Bureau of Land \nManagement and Forest Service analysis confirms that ecological \nforestry will more than double the harvest on O lands, producing \napproximately 400 mmbf on the landscape covered by this bill.\n  On the conservation side, my bill provides permanent protections for \napproximately 1.35 million acres of land, while designating wilderness \nlands, wild and scenic rivers, and other special areas. It creates \n87,000 acres of wilderness and 252 miles of wild and scenic rivers. All \ntold, this would be the single biggest increase in Oregon's \nconservation lands in decades. That includes special areas protected \nfor recreation, which is an increasingly important part of our rural \neconomy, and is responsible for 141,000 jobs in Oregon alone. Perhaps \nthe most important conservation win in the bill is the first-ever \nlegislative protection for old growth on O lands and the designation \nof Late Successional Old-growth Forest Heritage Reserves.\n  The approach of dividing the lands into conservation and timber \nemphasis and protecting old growth will provide clear management \ndirection for the landscape and take the most controversial harvests \noff the table. Significantly, the bill streamlines and front loads \nenvironmental analysis into two large scale environmental impact \nstatements--one each for moist and dry forests--that will study 5 years \nof work in the woods, rather than a single project. It does this while \nupholding the Endangered Species Act and other bedrock environmental \nlaws.\n  Critical to the bill is the belief that forest policy should be \ndictated by science, not lawyers. The forestry principles used in this \nbill are based on the work of Drs. Norm Johnson and Jerry Franklin, two \nrespected Northwest forestry scientists, and built off of forestry \napproaches used around the globe. The bill also establishes the first \never legislative protections for O streams thanks in large part to \nthe work of one of the Northwest's foremost water resources experts, \nDr. Gordon Reeves. The Northwest Forest Plan's stream protections are \nextended to key watersheds and four drinking water emphasis areas, with \nadditional lands designated for conservation, to protect drinking \nwater. Science also guides how the agency can treat trees near streams \nand a scientific committee will evaluate stream buffers and reserves in \nareas dedicated to timber harvests, increasing or decreasing the \nboundaries as needed to address the ecological importance of streams. \nThis\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\nacknowledges that one size does not fit all.\n  Most important is the fact that I will continue to advance efforts to \nsecure a new future for the O lands. My bill certainly doesn't \nprovide everything all sides want, but it can get everyone what they \nneed. I look forward to working with Congressmen DeFazio, Walden and \nSchrader and our colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives \nto pass an O solution into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 133. A bill to approve and implement the Klamath Basin agreements, \nto improve natural resource management, support economic development, \nand sustain agricultural production in the Klamath River Basin in the \npublic interest and the interest of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce a bill that \nwould authorize the implementation of three landmark agreements that \nsettle some of our country's most complex and contentious water \nallocation and species preservation issues. Water management crises \nthis century have plagued the Klamath Basin, leading to devastating \nwater years for communities throughout the Basin. Overcoming that \nadversity, stakeholders including State and Federal agencies, tribes, \nfarmers and ranchers, and environmental groups, have spent years coming \ntogether to hammer out solutions. They swallowed hard and worked \ntogether to bring costs down and deliver economic certainty and \nstability for the Basin in the name of the greater good.\n  Last year, I introduced the Klamath Basin Water Recovery and Economic \nRestoration Act of 2014 to finally authorize the three historic \nagreements reached by Basin partners--the Klamath Basin Restoration \nAgreement, the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement, and the \nUpper Basin Agreement. I was deeply disappointed that the bill did not \nget passed into law last Congress, delaying the implementation of these \nimportant agreements and creating even more uncertainty and anxiety for \nstakeholders in the Basin.\n  Inspired by the perseverance and dedication demonstrated by the \nstakeholders, today I once again bring forward this bill, the Klamath \nBasin Water Recovery and Economic Restoration Act of 2015, to put a \nrubber stamp on the historic agreements and finally help heal the \nKlamath Basin. With this bill, the Basin will no longer be known for \npersistent drought, water disputes, and conflict, but rather for the \ndedicated and enduring collaborative efforts that have honed in on a \nsustainable and more economically certain future; an example that other \nregions can emulate for their watershed challenges. I continue to \nexpress my gratitude to the interested groups who came to the table and \nformed partnerships, engaged in conversations, made agreements and \nconcessions, and ultimately found a path forward.\n  I'm pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators Merkley, Boxer and \nFeinstein on this bill. Senator Merkley has worked tirelessly to \nencourage and support the years of conversations and collaborative \nefforts of the countless stakeholders who have committed to finding a \nbalanced solution. Senators Boxer and Feinstein have provided \nunwavering support for the communities impacted by unprecedented \ndrought in the Klamath Basin, which spans Oregon and California, while \nalso reaffirming the need to support fish and wildlife. Together, we \nare committed to working with our colleagues in the Senate and House to \nadvance this bill and get it signed by the President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. \n        Paul):\n  S. 134. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to exclude \nindustrial hemp from the definition of marihuana, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nMerkley, McConnell, and Paul in introducing the Industrial Hemp Farming \nAct of 2015.\n  I introduced this bill during the 113th Congress with these same \ncolleagues to amend a regulation that is holding America's economy \nback. I am committed to empowering American farmers and increasing \ndomestic economic activity, and that is exactly what this bill will do.\n  The United States is the world's largest consumer of hemp products, \nyet it remains the only major industrialized country that bans hemp \nfarming. As the United States imports millions of dollars of hemp \nproducts, such as textiles, foods, paper products and construction \nmaterials, American farmers who could grow hemp right here at home are \nunable to profit from this growing market. This is an outrageous \nrestriction on free enterprise and does nothing but hurt economic \ngrowth and job creation.\n  The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015 would amend the definition of \n``marihuana'' in the Controlled Substances Act to exclude industrial \nhemp, allowing American farmers to produce domestically the hemp we \nalready use. Industrial hemp is a safe, profitable commodity in many \nother countries, and I've long said that if you can buy it at the local \nsupermarket, American farmers should be able to grow it. This \ncommonsense bill would end the burdensome restrictions on industrial \nhemp and is pro-environment, pro-business, and pro-farmer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take the time to learn about the great \npotential for farming industrial hemp in the United States, and to \nunderstand the real differences between industrial hemp and marijuana. \nUnder our bill, industrial hemp is defined as having extremely low THC \nlevels: it has to be 0.3 percent or less. The lowest commercial grade \nmarijuana typically has 5 percent THC content. The bottom line is that \nno one is going to get high on industrial hemp. And to guarantee that \nwon't be the case, our legislation allows the U.S. Attorney General to \ntake action if a state law allows commercial hemp to exceed the maximum \n0.3 percent THC level.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Merkley, McConnell, Paul, and \nme by cosponsoring and ultimately passing this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Industrial Hemp Farming Act \n     of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP FROM DEFINITION OF \n                   MARIHUANA.\n\n       Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     802) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (16)--\n       (A) by striking ``(16) The'' and inserting ``(16)(A) The''; \n     and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) The term `marihuana' does not include industrial \n     hemp.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(57) The term `industrial hemp' means the plant Cannabis \n     sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, \n     with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more \n     than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. INDUSTRIAL HEMP DETERMINATION BY STATES.\n\n       Section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     811) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Industrial Hemp Determination.--If a person grows or \n     processes Cannabis sativa L. for purposes of making \n     industrial hemp in accordance with State law, the Cannabis \n     sativa L. shall be deemed to meet the concentration \n     limitation under section 102(57), unless the Attorney General \n     determines that the State law is not reasonably calculated to \n     comply with section 102(57).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 135. A bill to prohibit Federal agencies from mandating the \ndeployment of vulnerabilities in data security technologies; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that I \nintroduced at the end of the last Congress along with a bipartisan \ngroup of colleagues in the House of Representatives. We call it the \nSecure Data Act, because it is designed to help protect the sensitive \ndata of American citizens\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\nand businesses from being compromised by foreign hackers. And I believe \nit will also help protect and promote the American digital economy at a \ntime when growing the number of family-wage jobs is so important both \nto Oregonians and to people across the country.\n  Hardly a week goes by without a new report of a massive data theft by \ncomputer hackers, often involving trade secrets, consumers' financial \ninformation, or sensitive government records. It is well known that the \nbest defense against these attacks is strong data encryption and more \nsecure technology systems.\n  This is why I and many others have been troubled by suggestions from \nsenior officials that computer hardware and software manufacturers \nshould be required to intentionally create security holes, often \nreferred to as back doors, to enable the government to access data on \nevery American's cell phone and computer, even if that data is \nprotected by strong encryption. The problem with this proposal is that \nthere is no such thing as a magic key that can only be used by good \npeople for worthwhile reasons. There is only strong security or weak \nsecurity.\n  Americans are rightly demanding stronger security for their personal \ndata. And requiring companies to build back doors into their products \nwould mean deliberately creating weaknesses that hackers and \nunscrupulous foreign governments could exploit. The results of this \napproach can be seen elsewhere--in 2005, citizens of Greece discovered \nthat dozens of their senior government officials' phones had been under \nsurveillance for nearly a year. The eavesdropper was never identified, \nbut the vulnerability was--it was built-in wiretapping features \nintended to be accessible only to government agencies following a legal \nprocess.\n  Mandating back doors would also remove incentives for innovation. If \nyou're required to build a wall with a hole in it, you aren't going to \ninvest a lot of money in developing better locks. And these mandates \ncould also do enormous harm to U.S. technology companies that are \nworking hard to overcome the damage that has been done by recklessly \nbroad surveillance policies and years of deceptive statements by senior \ngovernment officials.\n  This legislation would expressly prohibit the government from \nmandating that tech companies build security weaknesses into their \nproducts. I would note that similar legislation from Representatives \nMassie and Lofgren passed the House of Representatives on a bipartisan \nvote of 293-123 in June of last year. So, I look forward to working \nwith colleagues on a bipartisan basis to advance this bill, and to \nreceiving feedback and input from colleagues and interested \nstakeholders, so that it can be further improved as it moves forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Data Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON DATA SECURITY VULNERABILITY MANDATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), no \n     agency may mandate that a manufacturer, developer, or seller \n     of covered products design or alter the security functions in \n     its product or service to allow the surveillance of any user \n     of such product or service, or to allow the physical search \n     of such product, by any agency.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to mandates \n     authorized under the Communications Assistance for Law \n     Enforcement Act (47 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``agency'' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 3502 of title 44, United States Code; and\n       (2) the term ``covered product'' means any computer \n     hardware, computer software, or electronic device that is \n     made available to the general public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 136. A bill to amend chapter 21 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide that fathers of certain permanently disabled or deceased \nveterans shall be included with mothers of such veterans as preference \neligibles for treatment in the civil service; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our country has asked a lot of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines throughout its history and it \nwill continue to do so as long as the world looks to America for \nleadership in crises. These brave men and women don't join the military \nlooking for public accolades and all they ask in return for their many \nsacrifices is for the government to honor its commitments to them--\nsomething I have certainly always tried to do.\n  Of course our men and women in uniform and our veterans aren't the \nonly folks who make sacrifices in the name of national security. From \nchild care, to household repairs and bills, to legal issues, our \nmilitary families are called on to provide support in innumerable ways \nas their loved ones serve and deploy. While we hope and pray that all \nthose sent abroad return safely to the arms of their loved ones, we \nknow that this isn't always the case. When servicemembers return home \nwounded or weakened as a result of combat, it is our military families \nwho step up to take care of their son or daughter, husband or wife. \nWhen servicesmembers do not return, it is our military families who \nendure that searing pain that comes with such a terrible loss.\n  It is an understatement to say that government cannot take away that \npain; but what government can, and must, do is honor that sacrifice. \nOne way we do that is by extending certain benefits to the families of \nthose who are killed or permanently and totally disabled in action. \nToday, along with Senator Brown, I am introducing the Gold Star Fathers \nAct to update one of those benefits.\n  The Office of Personnel Management currently allows unmarried mothers \nof fallen soldiers to claim a 10-point veterans' preference when \napplying for Federal jobs. Our legislation would simply extend this \npreference to unmarried fathers of fallen soldiers. Updating this \npreference is about fairness and recognizing that fathers, too, share \nin the sacrifice that their family has made for this country. Updating \nthis preference will also expand opportunities for Gold Star families \nto bring their dedication and compassion into the federal government, \nwhere it can be put to great use.\n  Gold Star Mothers and Gold Star Fathers have incurred a debt that \nCongress cannot ever hope to repay. All we can hope to do is ensure \nthat these sacrifices are acknowledged and honored. It is my hope that \nthe Senate will pass this legislation swiftly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PREFERENCE ELIGIBLE TREATMENT FOR FATHERS OF CERTAIN \n                   PERMANENTLY DISABLED OR DECEASED VETERANS.\n\n       Section 2108(3) of title 5, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking subparagraphs (F) and (G) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(F) the parent of an individual who lost his or her life \n     under honorable conditions while serving in the armed forces \n     during a period named by paragraph (1)(A) of this section, \n     if--\n       ``(i) the spouse of that parent is totally and permanently \n     disabled; or\n       ``(ii) that parent, when preference is claimed, is \n     unmarried or, if married, legally separated from his or her \n     spouse;\n       ``(G) the parent of a service-connected permanently and \n     totally disabled veteran, if--\n       ``(i) the spouse of that parent is totally and permanently \n     disabled; or\n       ``(ii) that parent, when preference is claimed, is \n     unmarried or, if married, legally separated from his or her \n     spouse; and''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendment made by this Act shall take effect 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 137. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary of the Treasury to regulate tax return preparers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if you go to get your hair cut, your barber \nor\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\nstylist must be licensed. If you need to get the locks on your home \nrepaired or replaced, the locksmith needs a license. But if you have \nsomeone prepare your tax return, there is no requirement that the \npreparer meet any minimum competency standard. It is time for that to \nchange so taxpayers are protected when they file their taxes.\n  On April 8 of last year, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing \nto discuss ways to protect taxpayers from incompetent, unethical and \nfraudulent tax return preparers. There is no question the tax code is \noverly complex and confusing. For that reason among others, more than \n80 million Americans pay someone else to prepare their income tax \nreturn each year.\n  That's why it was so alarming to learn that most paid tax return \npreparers don't have to meet even basic standards of proficiency or \ncompetence to prepare someone else's tax return.\n  A series of investigations by the GAO and Treasury Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration, TIGTA, illustrated some of the problems with \nincompetent tax return preparers. As a consequence, the IRS took steps \nto require paid tax return preparers to demonstrate they have the know-\nhow to provide the taxpayer with a service he or she can reasonably \nrely upon.\n  I am proud to say my home state gets this issue right. Tax preparers \nin Oregon study, pass an exam and keep up with the changing landscape \nof the tax code in order to maintain their licenses, and those \nstandards work. The GAO took a look at the system a few years ago and \nfound that tax returns from Oregon were 72 percent likelier to be \naccurate than returns from the rest of the country. That puts fewer \nOregonians at the mercy of unscrupulous preparers and reduces the risk \nof the dreaded audit.\n  These independent analyses, combined with too many taxpayer horror \nstories of identity theft, refund and liability errors, and audit \nchallenges, demonstrated clearly that a lack of basic tax return \npreparer competency standards is a serious consumer protection issue. \nToday, I am introducing legislation that will help restore standards to \nprotect American taxpayers.\n  This legislation, the Taxpayer Protection and Preparer Proficiency \nAct of 2015, which I am pleased to introduce with the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin--will grant the IRS the ability to \nmove forward with the type of education and examination program \ncontemplated under the 2011 Circular 230 program, specifically, the \nRegistered Tax Return Preparer, RTRP, Program.\n  Testing and minimum competency requirements have been clearly shown \nto be effective at reducing error, fraud and tax preparer incompetence.\n  We need to protect American taxpayers, and this bill helps do just \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REGULATION OF TAX RETURN PREPARERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 330 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) regulate--\n       ``(A) the practice of representatives of persons before the \n     Department of the Treasury; and\n       ``(B) the practice of tax return preparers; and'', and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``or tax return preparer'' after \n     ``representative'' each place it appears, and\n       (B) by inserting ``or in preparing their tax returns, \n     claims for refund, or documents in connection with tax \n     returns or claims for refund'' after ``cases'' in \n     subparagraph (D).\n       (b) Authority to Sanction Regulated Tax Return Preparers.--\n     Subsection (b) of section 330 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``before the Department'',\n       (2) by inserting ``or tax return preparer'' after \n     ``representative'' each place it appears, and\n       (3) in paragraph (4), by striking ``misleads or threatens'' \n     and all that follows and inserting ``misleads or threatens--\n       ``(A) any person being represented or any prospective \n     person being represented; or\n       ``(B) any person or prospective person whose tax return, \n     claim for refund, or document in connection with a tax return \n     or claim for refund, is being or may be prepared.''.\n       (c) Tax Return Preparer Defined.--Section 330 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Tax Return Preparer.--For purposes of this section--\n       ``(1) In general.--The term `tax return preparer' has the \n     meaning given such term under section 7701(a)(36) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       ``(2) Tax return.--The term `tax return' has the meaning \n     given to the term `return' under section 6696(e)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       ``(3) Claim for refund.--The term `claim for refund' has \n     the meaning given such term under section 6696(e)(2) of such \n     Code.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 138. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Incentives to \nEducate American Children, the ``I Teach'' Act, which would provide a \n$1,000 refundable tax credit to elementary and secondary school \nteachers who teach in schools located in rural or impoverished areas. \nIt would also provide a $1,000 credit to teachers who achieve National \nBoard certification, and provide National Board certified teachers \nserving in rural or impoverished schools a $2,000 credit. It was \npreviously introduced in the 113th Congress by Senator Rockefeller.\n  U.S. classrooms are increasingly filled with less experienced \nteachers, as older teachers retire and the retention rate among young \nteachers continues to decline. According to the most recent data, 1.7 \nmillion teachers, representing 45 percent of the workforce, had less \nthan 10 years of experience. Policy makers need to take steps to ensure \nthat students have the most qualified and best trained teachers \npossible.\n  Nearly a third of public schools in the United States are in rural \nareas. And rural schools often face challenges that others don't, like \nsmaller tax bases and higher recruitment costs, which means they often \nhave less money for classroom materials and salaries. Department of \nEducation data show that rural school districts have the lowest base \nsalaries for starting teachers, a trend that continues even as teachers \nmove to the top of the local salary range. Rural schools face these \nchallenges across the country.\n  The most recent study by the Education Trust found that high schools \nwith high poverty rates are twice as likely to have teachers who are \nnot certified in their fields than high schools with low poverty rates. \nThe same study found that schools serving impoverished areas have a \nhigher percentage of first year teachers. Rural schools face similar \nproblems.\n  According to the Department of Education, Oregon faces a shortage of \ncertified teachers for the 2014-15 school year in subject areas such as \nmath, science, Spanish, special education, English as a second \nlanguage, and bilingual education. A major deterrent to pursuing a \nmaster's degree in teaching is the soaring cost of tuition, which, \nespecially for those candidates with strong science and math \nbackgrounds, drives them into other fields instead of educating the \nnext generation of scientists and researchers.\n  In other words, due to the high cost of education and teachers' \nsalaries which have failed to keep pace, additional incentives through \nthe tax code could encourage highly qualified individuals to look to or \ncontinue to pursue teaching as a viable profession.

A bill to permanently allow an exclusion under the \nSupplemental Security Income program and the Medicaid program for \ncompensation provided to individuals who participate in clinical trials \nfor rare diseases or conditions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bipartisan \nEnsuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. I would like to begin \nby thanking Senators Hatch and Markey for joining me in cosponsoring \nthis legislation. I would also like to thank the Cystic Fibrosis \nFoundation for working with me on this important issue since 2010.\n  This bill is simple: it would remove a sunset that exists for a law \nwe passed in 2010 making it easier--and more likely--for people \nreceiving Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid to participate in \nrare disease clinical trials. As I explained in 2010, we wanted to \nproceed carefully when altering how compensation for participating in \nclinical trials is treated for SSI and Medicaid purposes. That is why \nwe included a 5 year sunset and asked GAO to report on how the law is \nworking. Five years have passed and GAO has issued its report.\n  GAO's frank assessment is that not a lot is known about how the law \nmay or may not have affected the decisions an SSI recipient makes about \nparticipating in clinical trials. At the same time, GAO provided \nimportant context about factors affecting a decision to participate, \nsuch as time and travel. The GAO report suggests that the law has \nremoved a barrier to participation for the individuals that rely on SSI \nand Medicaid's safety net, and GAO's consultation with the National \nInstitutes of Health, the National Organization of Rare Diseases, and \nthe Social Security Administration did not identify any negative \naspects from the change in the law.\n  That is comforting and important, and it is reason enough to make \nthis law permanent. We all know what's at stake and how it's often \ndifficult to find participants for rare disease clinical trials. This \nlaw has helped increase the number of people who can participate and, \nhopefully, be a part of the effort to improve treatments and find \ncures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that recipients \nof SSI and Medicaid can have the same opportunity to participate in \nclinical trials as individuals who do not rely on these important \nsafety net programs. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \npassing this bill soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Access to Clinical \n     Trials Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF SUNSET PROVISION.\n\n       Effective as if included in the enactment of the Improving \n     Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-255, \n     124 Stat. 2640), section 3 of that Act is amended by striking \n     subsection (e).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Portman, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, and Mr. Kirk):\n  S. 140. A bill to combat human trafficking; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce, along \nwith Senator Portman, the Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015.\n  Human trafficking is estimated to be a $32 billion criminal \nenterprise, making it the second largest criminal industry in the \nworld, behind the drug trade. Many steps need to be taken to combat \nthis problem. But we cannot escape this simple truth: without demand \nfor the services performed by trafficking victims, the problem would \nnot exist.\n  The bill we are introducing today would reduce the demand for human \ntrafficking, particularly the commercial sexual exploitation of \nchildren, by holding buyers accountable and making it easier for law \nenforcement to investigate and prosecute all persons who participate in \nsex trafficking.\n  Sex trafficking is not a victimless crime. In the United States, the \naverage age that a person is first trafficked is between 12 and 14. \nMany of these children continue to be exploited into adulthood. A study \nof women and girls involved in street prostitution in my hometown of \nSan Francisco found that 82 percent had been physically assaulted, 83 \npercent were threatened with a weapon, and 68 percent were raped. The \noverwhelming majority of sex trafficking victims in the United States \nare American citizens--83 percent by one estimate from the Department \nof Justice.\n  I am encouraged that Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies are taking steps to combat human trafficking. Between January \nand June of last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered \n168 trafficking victims and arrested 281 sex traffickers in ``Operation \nCross Country.''\n  I commend these efforts, but more needs to be done to target the \nperpetrators who are fueling demand for trafficking crimes--the buyers \nof sex acts from trafficking victims. Many buyers of sex are \n``hobbyists'' who purchase sex repeatedly. Because buyers are rarely \narrested, much less prosecuted, the demand for commercial sex continues \nunabated.\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\n  Without buyers, sex trafficking would cease to exist. As Luis \nCdeBaca, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for the Office to Monitor and \nCombat Trafficking in Persons, noted, ``[n]o girl or woman would be a \nvictim of sex trafficking if there were no profits to be made from \ntheir exploitation.''\n  The Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015 would address this problem \nby incentivizing Federal and State law enforcement officers to target \nbuyers and providing new authorities to prosecute all who engage in the \ncrime of sex trafficking.\n  First, the bill would clarify that buyers of sex acts from \ntrafficking victims can be prosecuted under the Federal commercial sex \ntrafficking statute. This provision would codify the Eighth Circuit's \ndecision in United States v. Jungers, which held that this statute \nencompasses buyers, in addition to sellers. Despite this favorable \nruling, there is no guarantee that other courts will follow this \nprecedent.\n  Second, the bill would hold buyers and sellers of child sex acts \naccountable for their actions, even if they claim they were unaware of \nthe age of a minor victim. At times, it can be difficult for a \nprosecutor to prove that a buyer was aware of the victim's age. \nSuccessful cases can require the child victim to testify to this fact, \nsubjecting the victim to re-traumatization. The bill would draw a clear \nline: if you purchase sex from an underage child, you can be \nprosecuted. Period.\n  Third, the bill would grant judges greater flexibility to impose an \nappropriate term of supervised release on sex traffickers. Current law \ncontains an anomaly: a person convicted of violating the commercial sex \ntrafficking statute or attempting to violate the statute may be subject \nto a longer term of supervised release than a person who is convicted \nof conspiring to violate the statute. Conspiring to traffic underage \nchildren is as serious as attempting to commit this crime and should be \npunished the same.\n  Fourth, the bill would require the Bureau of Justice Statistics to \nprepare annual reports on the number of arrests, prosecutions, and \nconvictions of sex traffickers and buyers of sex from trafficked \nvictims in the state court system. Very little data is available on the \nprosecutions made under anti-trafficking laws. This provision would \nprovide additional data and encourage State and local governments to \nincrease enforcement against sellers and buyers of sex from trafficked \nvictims.\n  Fifth, the Combat Human Trafficking Act would strengthen training \nprograms operated by the Department of Justice for Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement officers who investigate and prosecute sex \ntrafficking offenses. Under the bill, such training programs must \ninclude components on effective methods to target and prosecute the \nbuyers of sex acts from trafficked victims. This would equip \nprosecutors with the tools they need to target buyers, encouraging \nprosecution of these perpetrators. Training programs must also train \nlaw enforcement in connecting trafficking victims with health care \nproviders, so that victims receive the health care services they need \nto recover.\n  In addition, the bill requires that training programs for federal \nprosecutors include components on seeking restitution for victims of \nsex trafficking. An October 2014 study by The Human Trafficking Pro \nBono Legal Center found that federal prosecutors did not seek \nrestitution in 37 percent of qualifying human trafficking cases brought \nbetween 2009 and 2012, even though restitution for trafficking victims \nis mandatory under federal law. When the prosecutor did not seek \nrestitution, it was granted in only 10 percent of cases.\n  These results make clear that prosecutors play a critical role in \nproviding justice for trafficking victims. Our bill would ensure that \nprosecutors are specifically trained to seek restitution for victims.\n  The bill would also require the Federal Judicial Center to provide \ntraining to judges on ordering restitution for human trafficking \nvictims, so that judges are fully aware that federal law mandates that \nrestitution be ordered for these victims. Overall, restitution was \nawarded in only 36 percent of qualifying human trafficking cases \nbrought between 2009 and 2012, according to The Human Trafficking Pro \nBono Legal Center's study. Too many trafficking victims are not \nreceiving the compensation they need to rebuild their lives and to \nwhich they are entitled under the law.\n  Sixth, the bill would authorize federal and state officials to seek a \nwiretap to investigate and prosecute any human trafficking-related \noffense. Under current law, a federal law enforcement officer may seek \na wiretap in an investigation under the commercial sex trafficking \nstatute, but not under a number of other statutes that address human \ntrafficking-related offenses, such as forced labor and involuntary \nservitude. Similarly, a state law enforcement officer may seek a \nwiretap to investigate a kidnapping offense, but not an offense for \nhuman trafficking, child sexual exploitation, or child pornography \nproduction. Our bill would fix those omissions.\n  Finally, this legislation would strengthen the rights of crime \nvictims. The bill would amend the Crime Victims' Rights Act to provide \nvictims with the right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea \nagreement or deferred prosecution agreement. The exclusion of victims \nin these early stages of a criminal case profoundly impairs victims' \nrights because, by the nature of these events, there often is no later \nproceeding in which victims can exercise their rights.\n  The bill would also ensure that crime victims have access to \nappellate review when their rights are denied in the lower court. \nRegrettably, six appellate courts have mis-applied the Crime Victims' \nRights Act by imposing an especially high standard for reviewing \nappeals by victims, requiring them to show ``clear and indisputable \nerror''. Three other circuits have applied the correct standard: the \nordinary appellate standard of legal error or abuse of discretion. This \nbill resolves the issue, setting a uniform standard for victims in all \ncircuits by codifying the more victim-protecting rule, that the \nappellate court ``shall apply ordinary standards of appellate review.''\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of numerous law \nenforcement and anti-trafficking organizations: the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, Shared Hope International, ECPAT-USA, Coalition Against \nTrafficking in Women, CATW, Human Rights Project for Girls, Survivors \nfor Solutions, Sanctuary For Families, World Hope International, \nProstitution Research & Education, MISSSEY, Breaking Free, Equality \nNow, National Organization for Victim Assistance, Seraphim Global, Los \nAngeles County Board of Supervisors, City of Oakland, Chicago Alliance \nAgainst Sexual Exploitation, Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition, and \nCasa Cornelia Law Center. These groups are on the forefront in the \nfight against sex trafficking, and I am proud to have their support.\n  Many of the provisions in the Combat Human Trafficking Act were \nincluded in the substitute amendment to the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nand Trafficking Prevention Act, S. 2646, 113th Congress, which passed \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee last September. However, that bill was \nnot enacted into law before Congress adjourned. I am hopeful that we \ncan pass the bipartisan Combat Human Trafficking in this Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Portman in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 140\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Combat Human Trafficking Act \n     of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \npromulgate a rule to require child safety packaging for liquid nicotine \ncontainers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we all recognize the danger that many \nhazardous chemicals and over-the-counter drugs pose to children. That's \nwhy we require child-resistant packaging for these substances to \nprevent accidental poisonings that could result in serious injury or \ndeath.\n  Unfortunately, there is no child-resistant packaging required for \nconcentrated liquid nicotine, which can be toxic if ingested or even \nabsorbed through the skin. According to the American Academy of \nPediatrics, AAP, some of these small bottles of liquid nicotine contain \na concentrated and deadly amount of the substance. The AAP notes that \nthis small bottle contains enough nicotine to kill four small children. \nJust a few drops of the liquid\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\nsplashed on a child's skin can make the child very ill.\n  The American Association of Poison Control Centers reports that \npoison control centers received 3,957 calls in 2014 related to liquid \nnicotine exposure. This is more than twice as many calls as in 2013, \nwhen AAPCC reported 1,543 calls related to liquid nicotine exposure.\n  Sadly, it was only a matter of time before one of these accidental \nnicotine poisonings resulted in death. This past December, a 1-year-old \nboy in New York State died after ingesting liquid nicotine in his home.\n  We have to do more to protect children from deadly accidents like \nthis.\n  Today I am reintroducing the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act \nwith Senators Ayotte, Bennet, Blumenthal, Boxer, Brown, Durbin, \nGillibrand, Klobuchar, Markey, Merkley, Reed, Schatz, and Schumer to \nprevent these unnecessary tragedies. This common-sense legislation \ngives the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, authority and \ndirection to issue rules requiring safer, child-resistant packaging for \nliquid nicotine products within 1 year of passage.\n  The CPSC already requires child-resistant packaging for many \nhousehold products, including over-the-counter medicines and cleaning \nagents. These rules have prevented countless injuries and deaths to \nchildren. There is no reason why bottles of liquid nicotine should not \nbe required to have child-resistant packaging as well.\n  I invite my colleagues to join us to support the Child Nicotine \nPoisoning Prevention Act. Last Congress, this legislation was reported \nout of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee by voice \nvote. Continuing our work together this Congress, we can pass this \nbipartisan legislation and help prevent accidental child nicotine \npoisonings.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 142\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Nicotine Poisoning \n     Prevention Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 24\n\n       Whereas on January 9, 2015, Bowie State University, located \n     in Bowie, Maryland, will celebrate the founding of the \n     university on January 9, 1865;\n       Whereas Bowie State University is the oldest historically \n     black institution of higher\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\n     education in the State of Maryland, and 1 of the 10 oldest in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas in 1864 the Baltimore Association began fundraising \n     to open and support schools for African-Americans, and \n     established 7 schools, the second of which, known as the \n     ``Normal School'' (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``School''), was the forerunner of Bowie State University;\n       Whereas the School began by educating approximately 370 \n     students in the African Baptist Church in the Crane's \n     Building on the northeast corner of Calvert and Saratoga \n     Streets in Baltimore, Maryland;\n       Whereas in 1867 the School purchased the Friends' Meeting \n     House at the corner of Courtland and Saratoga Streets in \n     Baltimore, Maryland, to use for the School;\n       Whereas during the earliest years of the School, the school \n     received financial support from the City Council of \n     Baltimore, the Freedmen's Bureau, several northern relief \n     societies, and the estate of Nelson Wells;\n       Whereas in 1893 the name of the School was changed to the \n     ``Baltimore Colored Normal School'';\n       Whereas in 1908 the General Assembly of Maryland approved \n     legislation that allowed the trustees of the School to donate \n     assets of the trustees to the State of Maryland in return for \n     a $5,000 annual appropriation to maintain a permanent normal \n     school for the training of black teachers;\n       Whereas in 1908 the General Assembly of Maryland changed \n     the name of the School to ``Baltimore Normal School No. 3'';\n       Whereas in 1910 the State of Maryland purchased 187 acres \n     of land formerly known as ``Jericho Farms'' to relocate the \n     School;\n       Whereas in September 1911 the new location of the School \n     opened with 50 students enrolled;\n       Whereas in 1935 the School began operating as a 4-year \n     program for training elementary school teachers and was \n     renamed the ``Maryland Teachers College at Bowie'';\n       Whereas in 1954, when the National Council for \n     Accreditation of Teacher Education was formed, the education \n     program of the School was among the first to receive national \n     accreditation and that distinction has been continuously \n     reaffirmed;\n       Whereas in 1963 the School began a liberal arts and teacher \n     training program for secondary education and the institution \n     was renamed ``Bowie State College'';\n       Whereas in 1988 the School, which offered several master's \n     degree programs, joined the University System of Maryland and \n     was finally renamed ``Bowie State University'';\n       Whereas in 1995 Bowie State University became 1 of only 6 \n     Model Institutions for Excellence in science, engineering, \n     and mathematics in the United States with support from the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n       Whereas as of January 2015, Bowie State University serves \n     approximately 5,600 students annually with challenging and \n     rewarding academic programs and individual support to prepare \n     attendees with the skills needed to compete and succeed in a \n     changing world;\n       Whereas Bowie State University was listed as 1 of \n     ``America's Top Colleges'' by Forbes magazine from 2011 to \n     2013, and ranked among the top 25 historically black colleges \n     and universities by U.S. News & World Report;\n       Whereas Bowie State University has been recognized as a \n     leader in training African-American professionals in the \n     science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (``STEM'') \n     fields;\n       Whereas Bowie State University was named a National Center \n     for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education by \n     the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland \n     Security;

Johnson \n     called on Congress to provide health insurance for the \n     elderly and most vulnerable;\n       Whereas over the past 50 years, Congress has strengthened \n     Medicare and Medicaid with improvements to, and expansion of, \n     health care benefits;\n       Whereas today, as a result of President Johnson's call to \n     action and Congress' bipartisan initiative that created the \n     Medicare program, 54,000,000 seniors and people with \n     disabilities have access to guaranteed health care benefits;\n       Whereas today, 68,000,000 Americans, including children, \n     pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, elderly who \n     are poor and frail, and low income adults and parents have \n     access to health care through Medicaid;\n       Whereas Medicare and Medicaid have been leaders in \n     improving the quality of care delivered to the Nation, \n     resulting in 1,300,000 fewer infections, accidents or other \n     adverse events and avoiding 150,000 unnecessary hospital \n     readmissions;\n       Whereas Medicare has been an innovator in developing \n     alternative ways to pay for health care that emphasize care \n     coordination across all health care providers and settings;\n       Whereas Medicare provides access to needed care, including \n     primary and specialty care, free preventative services, and \n     prescription drugs;\n       Whereas the creation of a prescription drug benefit in 2003 \n     has ensured that nearly 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \n     have prescription drug coverage, and since 2010, over \n     8,200,000 seniors have saved more than $11,500,000,000 on \n     their prescription drugs as a result of closing the Medicare \n     Part D coverage gap;\n       Whereas in 2013, an estimated 37,200,000 people with \n     Medicare took advantage of at least one preventative service \n     with no cost sharing;\n       Whereas Medicaid is a critical source of comprehensive, \n     affordable health coverage for millions of otherwise \n     uninsured low-income adults and parents, including millions \n     of nonelderly low income adults in states that expanded their \n     Medicaid programs as part of health reform;\n       Whereas Medicaid ensures access to long-term services and \n     supports for vulnerable low income seniors and persons with \n     disabilities by covering 60 percent of nursing home \n     residents, picking up 40 percent of the Nation's long-term \n     care costs, and allowing loved ones to live with health and \n     dignity in their own homes and communities;\n       Whereas Medicaid provides early comprehensive childhood \n     screening, diagnosis, and treatment for 32,000,000 of the \n     Nation's children, including half of all low-income children; \n     and\n       Whereas Medicaid provides crucial services for pregnant \n     women and babies in that Medicaid covers 45 percent of births \n     nationwide, 53 percent of hospital stays for infants born \n     prematurely or with a low birth weight, and 45 percent of \n     hospital stays for infants with birth defects: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) all efforts to improve Medicare and Medicaid must \n     support and build upon President Johnson's vision ``to assure \n     the availability of and accessibility to the best healthcare \n     to all Americans, regardless of age or geography or economic \n     status'';\n       (2) Medicare's guaranteed benefit is a lifeline to millions \n     of Americans and must remain intact for this and future \n     generations;\n       (3) Medicare should not be transformed into a voucher \n     program, leaving seniors and people with disabilities \n     vulnerable to higher out-of-pocket costs;\n       (4) with the strong support of the Federal Government, \n     Medicaid continues to serve as a safety net for vulnerable \n     children, pregnant women, persons with disabilities, elderly \n     who are poor and frail, and other low income adults; and\n       (5) Medicaid should not be dismantled through block grants, \n     per-capita caps, or by other policies that slash funding, \n     shift cost to states, reduce benefits, and erode the safety \n     net relied on by over 68,000,000 Americans.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to highlight a Presidential message \nthat was delivered to Congress 50 years ago today.\n  But before I reiterate the importance of Medicare and Medicaid--facts \nthat I think my colleagues and I can all agree to I would like to look \nback at where we have been, to recall what life was like for so many \npeople who were poor and disabled, uninsured or unlucky before these \nvital safety net programs were here.\n  Those were the days of the ``poor farm'' and the ``almshouse,'' \nplaces the poor and uninsured would go for care. It wasn't a happy \nchoice and more often than not, it was the only choice.\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\nThese places provided care, often rudimentary, and often carried a \nstigma. Accommodations were sparse at best. In return for health care \nand housing, residents were expected to work in the adjoining farm or \ndo housework or other menial labor to offset the cost of their stay.\n  This was the primary option for someone whose extended family \ncouldn't provide help or didn't want to--right here in the USA. Few \nAmericans today remember those days.\n  When President Johnson submitted his message to Congress 50 years ago \ntoday, fewer than half of America's elderly even had health insurance. \nIn that era, and it wasn't that long ago, it wasn't uncommon for the \nsick elderly to be treated like second class citizens, and as a result, \nmany aging Americans without family to care for them ended up \ndestitute, without necessary health care, or on the street.\n  It was a time no one wants to revisit, a time that one sociologist \nsaid was ``another America'' where ``40 to 50 million citizens were \npoor, who lacked adequate medical care, and who were `socially \ninvisible' to the majority of the population.''\n  It is worth remembering how far we have come. Today, I ask my \ncolleagues to use this anniversary as a vivid reminder of the \ndifference Medicare and Medicaid make in the daily lives of Americans, \nand also the health care advances that have occurred as a result.\n  A couple facts to highlight for my colleagues:\n  Today, with rock-solid essential health services, 54 million \nAmericans--nearly every senior and person with disabilities--has access \nto Medicare's guarantee.\n  Meanwhile, Medicaid has made a critical difference for 68 million of \nthe Nation's most vulnerable, including more than 32 million children, \n6 million seniors, and 10 million persons with disabilities. Because \nMedicare and Medicaid made health care possible for millions of people, \nthey have also been the catalyst for innovations in treatment that \nbenefit people of all ages. Here's one example:\n  In the first 30 years of Medicare alone, deaths from heart disease \ndropped by a third for people over age 65. By providing coverage and \naccess for millions, these programs became catalysts for changes in how \nmedicine is practiced and paid for, while finding the root causes of \ndisease and perfecting better therapies to treat them.\n  As time has marched on, these programs evolved and improved, and the \nrest of the health care system followed.\n  In 1967, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment, \nEPSD, comprehensive health services benefit for all Medicaid children \nunder age 21 was created--helping improve the health of our Nation's \nkids.\n  In 1981, home and community-based waivers were established so that \nstates could provide services in a community setting, allowing \nindividuals to remain in their home for as long as possible. Every \nstate now uses this option to facilitate better care and services to \ntheir Medicaid population.\n  In 1983, Medicare took one of many legs away from fee-for-service \nwith the advent of the hospital prospective payment system, a system \nthat pays hospitals based on a patient's illness, and how serious it \nwas, not based solely on how much it cost to treat them. This change, \nonce considered drastic, has become common place and accepted.\n  In 2003, the prescription drug coverage was added to Medicare's \nbenefit, providing access to necessary medications for those most \nlikely to need them. As a result of greater access to prescription \ndrugs, beneficiaries' health have dramatically improved.\n  In 2010, as a result of health reform, preventive services became \nfree to patients, prescription drugs became cheaper for those \nbeneficiaries who fell in the donut hole, Medicare began to move away \nfrom purely volume-driven care, and onto paying for quality and value, \nand the life of the Medicare trust fund was extended.\n  Finally, in 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid began \nreleasing loads of claims data for the public to use. Access to this \ninformation has been game-changing in understanding the cost of care \nand variations in the way medicine is practiced across the country.\n  Today, any of these examples are easy to forget because they are \ncommonplace. But that makes them no less remarkable.\n  I will close by noting something else, just as striking about \nMedicare and Medicaid: It was a bipartisan effort. The enactment of \nthese programs shows that Congress can craft bipartisan solutions to \nvery complex and politically difficult problems. That's what happened \nin 1965 when the Senate passed the legislation creating Medicare and \nMedicaid by a 68-32 vote after the House approved it three months \nearlier on a robust 313-115.\n  As the 114th Congress gets underway, my colleagues and I could all \ntake a page from President Johnson's playbook: Congress shouldn't use \npartisan tactics when the solutions can be bipartisan.\n  And there's the lesson; that despite sharp differences and \npartisanship, the Congress of Johnson's day was able to rise above that \nculture and those challenges to find agreement and make America a much \nbetter place. As this new Congress begins, I hope we can use that 50-\nyear-old spirit to strengthen, protect and improve Medicare and \nMedicaid to keep the guarantee strong and ensure health care to those \nwho need it most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/08/senate-section/article/S110-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 2--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF EMANCIPATION \n   HALL IN THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER FOR A CEREMONY TO PRESENT THE \n    CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO THE FIRST SPECIAL SERVICE FORCE, IN \n        RECOGNITION OF ITS SUPERIOR SERVICE DURING WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. TESTER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                             S.
