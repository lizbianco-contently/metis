Mr. President, when Americans hear ``USO,'' they often \nthink of Bob Hope. There is no question that he helped to lift the \nspirits of countless men and women in uniform, but the USO impacts \nmilitary personnel in a number of other important ways, too, which is \nsomething it has been doing literally for decades--in fact, 75 years to \nthe day. I think every colleague will join me in commemorating this \nimpressive 75-year history.\n  Our men and women in uniform sacrifice a great deal to defend us, and \nso do their families. One of the things the USO excels at is helping \nthem to stay connected--connected to hometowns, connected to loved \nones, connected to the simpler joys in life. From providing deployed \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines with an opportunity to phone \nhome, to providing world-class entertainment, to helping servicemembers \nfind meaningful employment once their service is complete, the USO's \nmission is broad in scope and has made a lasting and positive impact on \nmany since it was first conceived just before World War II. Much of \nthat credit is due to Americans' willingness to volunteer.\n  Our military personnel--especially our forward deployed and combat \narms units--willingly trade the comforts of home for harsh living \nconditions. They often forgo life's precious moments, such as \ncelebrating a child's birthday or a first day at school, and they are \nwilling to put everything on the line for us. The USO provides one more \nplatform to say ``thank you'' for that service, to show gratitude for \nthat sacrifice, to let every man and woman in uniform know what they \nmean to us.\n  Congratulations to the USO for 75 years of service to our troops and \ntheir families. We hope you will continue your important work for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S635-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, 100,000 people in Flint, MI, have been \npoisoned, but sadly the Republicans are doing nothing. Nine thousand \nchildren, all under the age of 6, have been poisoned. Their brains have \nbeen attacked. Still, Republicans have refused to do anything to help.\n  For the last 2 weeks, the Senators from Michigan have worked on an\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\namendment that would allow Federal funds to address the Flint water \ncrisis. Senators Stabenow and Peters worked hard to negotiate with \nRepublicans. But almost having an agreement in place is not an \nagreement. We need Republicans to work with us to reach an agreement \nand let the people of Flint know that help is on its way; otherwise, \nSenate Republicans will continue ignoring Flint. If that is the case, \nthen I would like my Republican colleagues to come to the floor and \nexplain to this country why this manmade disaster in Flint is not \nworthy of the Republicans' attention. Tell us why 100,000 Americans \nshould be forced to drink polluted water and bathe in poisonous water.\n  One mother told Senator Stabenow: I was doing everything I could for \nmy children. I made sure that they stopped drinking soda pop. So they \ndidn't have soda pop. They drank water. But it was horrible water, and \nit has affected my children's lives. She said: I am responsible for the \npoisoning of my children.\n  I heard statements made by the assistant Republican leader earlier \nthis week, and here is a direct quote: ``While we all have sympathy for \nwhat's happened in Flint, this is primarily a local and State \nresponsibility.''\n  I don't know if ``outrageous'' is sufficient to describe this. After \nall, it was the assistant Republican leader who just last year welcomed \nFederal disaster assistance for the people of Texas because of the \nterrible flooding that was taking place. Again in 2013, the town of \nWest, which is in Texas, suffered a catastrophic explosion of a \nfertilizer plant--another manmade disaster. The Senator from Texas was \nquick to seek Federal assistance. He said:\n\n       We will aggressively pursue this matter with FEMA and \n     pursue all appeals and remedies available to us. . . . This \n     was a disaster area and their failure to acknowledge it as \n     such is just inexcusable. We're going to get the residents of \n     West the assistance they need.\n\n  The junior Senator from Texas--one of the many Republicans running \nfor President--was just as eager to accept Federal funds. He said:\n\n       I am confident that the Texas congressional delegation, \n     Senator Cornyn and I . . . will stand united as Texans in \n     support of the Federal Government fulfilling its statutory \n     obligations, and stepping in to respond to this natural \n     disaster.\n\n  According to Senator Cruz, the Federal Government had an obligation \nto help Texas. He is right. We had an obligation, and we fulfilled that \nobligation. But we also have an obligation to help Flint, MI.\n  I ask my colleagues from Texas and the other Republicans here in the \nSenate, why are floods and explosions in Texas disasters worthy of \nFederal support and not the help needed for 100,000 poisoned people in \nFlint, MI? Why do Texans deserve Federal assistance but not the people \nof Flint? What could the reason be?\n  The sad thing is that this sort of hypocrisy isn't limited to just \nthe Senators from Texas. The junior Senator from Florida--one of the \nmany running for President on the Republican side--is doing the same \nthing.\n  Last year Florida was hit with extreme flooding. Senator Rubio \nappealed for Federal assistance. He wrote a letter to the President. He \nsaid: ``As Floridians continue to reel from the effects of last month's \ntorrential rains and flooding, I respectfully request you consider \nGovernor Scott's appeal for a Major Disaster Declaration for Individual \nAssistance for the five impacted counties.'' That is what he wrote to \nPresident Obama last year, but, like it always is with the Senator from \nFlorida, that was then and this is now. This is what the junior Senator \nfrom Florida says now: ``I believe the federal government's role in \nsome of these things [is] largely limited unless it involves a federal \njurisdictional issue.'' That is a buzz word for saying ``Good luck, \nFlint.'' According to Senator Rubio, Floridians deserve disaster \nassistance but not the people of Flint. This Senator hopes to become \nPresident; yet he refuses to treat all Americans the same.\n  There are plenty of other examples. Whenever their States have been \nhard hit, Republican Senators run here to the Senate floor and demand \nFederal aid--as well they should. The Federal Government should help in \ntimes of disaster. There has to be a bit of consistency from \nRepublicans. They must be fair to everyone. The people of Flint are \njust like every other American. They are deserving of the Federal \nGovernment's help.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the Congressional Black Caucus. I \nam not going read the whole letter, but I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Black Caucus,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2016.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The state of emergency in Flint, \n     Michigan requires immediate action from the United States \n     Senate. Our children have been poisoned because of poor \n     decision-making by some and inaction by others who are \n     responsible for protecting the most vulnerable among us. \n     Senate Republicans should not prevent federal emergency \n     assistance to the people of Flint by blocking the common-\n     sense amendments offered by Michigan Senators Debbie Stabenow \n     and Gary Peters to the Energy Policy and Modernization Act. \n     Instead, both parties should come to an agreement on an \n     emergency relief package for the people of Flint.\n       While there are no flooded streets or people stranded on \n     the roof of their home, poisoned water still runs through the \n     faucets in Flint. There are children with visible scars, and \n     those who will have mental health issues and learning \n     disabilities that we cannot yet see. Bottled water is not a \n     solution. It is a band-aid that will not heal this gaping \n     wound. The City of Flint is in crisis.\n       Providing emergency assistance to Flint is not a bailout. \n     The Stabenow-Peters amendments would: a) provide emergency \n     finding to help repair Flint's water infrastructure, b) \n     notify the public of concentrations of lead in the water, and \n     c) connect children and adults exposed to lead poisoning with \n     community services and health experts. Moreover, other \n     communities currently dealing with lead water crises in \n     states like Ohio and elsewhere could also benefit from these \n     resources.\n       Republican senators have routinely requested this type of \n     assistance when disasters occurred in their states. The \n     people of Flint deserve nothing less. Republicans must join \n     Democrats in meeting our moral obligation to protect the \n     health of our children.\n       Senator McConnell, we are asking for your leadership to \n     ensure your Republican colleagues do not condemn the people \n     of Flint to more pain and suffering by blocking these \n     amendments.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                            G. K. Butterfield,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n                                   The Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n  Mr. REID. Here is what is said in the final two paragraphs:\n\n       Republican Senators have routinely requested this type of \n     assistance when disasters occurred in their states. The \n     people of Flint deserve nothing less. Republicans must join \n     Democrats in meeting our moral obligation to protect the \n     health of our children.\n\n  This is what is said by Congressman Butterfield, who is the chair of \nthe Congressional Black Caucus.\n  The final paragraph in the letter says:\n\n       Senator McConnell, we are asking for your leadership to \n     ensure your Republican colleagues do not condemn the people \n     of Flint to more pain and suffering by blocking these \n     amendments.\n\n  I would hope my Republican colleagues would look in the mirror and \nask themselves a simple question: What would I do if 100,000 of my \nconstituents were poisoned?\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join us in addressing this \ncritical issue.\n  In a conference held in Las Vegas, NV, yesterday, one of the foremost \nexperts dealing with water, Pat Mulroy, said that the ``stupid stunt'' \nthat led to widespread lead contamination in Flint, MI, has dealt a \nblow to public confidence in water systems everywhere--even in places \nsuch as Southern Nevada, where lead pipes are not an issue. ``It has \ngiven a black eye [to water management] not just in Michigan, not just \nin the United States, but around the world.''\n  She went on to say:\n\n       I was angry. I was very angry. They did it to save money. \n     But was it really worth affecting these children's lives \n     forever to save a couple of bucks?\n\n  She also said that complaints about the water began a month after the \nswitch, but officials waited for almost 2 years. By then, tests showed \nelevated levels of lead, which causes brain damage.\n  She said:\n\n       The finger-pointing is going to be endless for a while, \n     especially as lawsuits begin to emerge. . . . I think there \n     will be criminal charges.\n\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\n\n  I don't know if there will be criminal charges, but these are pretty \negregious actions taken by the State of Michigan.\n  She said that ready access to clean water is something most Americans \ntake for granted, but something like this can cast doubt on the whole \nsystem. ``Now there is a crack in that trust relationship,'' she said. \n``In Flint it is gone.'' That is certainly true.\n\n  So I would certainly hope my Republican colleagues will understand it \nis important that we do something now to help these people. We have \nsomething that can be done. It should be done. Republicans should stop \nit. It is not something that is a local issue or a State issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S637-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS LIBERTY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, President Obama visited a mosque \nin Baltimore, MD. It was a powerful expression to counter the divisive, \nhateful rhetoric used by too many Republicans and to emphasize the \nimportance of giving all Americans the respect and dignity they \ndeserve. For years rightwing extremists have attacked the religion of \nIslam and stoked fear about the presence of Muslims in our country.\n  Some of those same extremists attacked President Obama for visiting \nthe mosque yesterday. That is an attack on millions of American \ncitizens who are being slandered. I was so gratified that the Presiding \nOfficer had the courage to show solidarity with the Muslims in the \nState of Arizona and the country by visiting a mosque a short time ago. \nThe Presiding Officer was attacked by rightwing extremists for this \nvisit. I am sorry about that, but I admire what he did.\n  When hateful extremists set their sights on attacking one religion, \nthey are attacking the core values of American society upon which our \nNation was founded. President Obama could not have made this point more \nclearly yesterday. He said, ``An attack on one faith is an attack on \nall our faiths.''\n  Religious liberty is a priceless American value that should be \ncherished. We cannot allow the threat from menacing radicals to change \nwho we are and how we treat our fellow citizens. As President Obama \nalso said yesterday, ``We are one American family. We will rise and \nfall together.'' So I applaud the President for his courage and \nwillingness to combat the detestable hatred that leading Republicans \nhave embraced and far too few Republicans have spoken out against--the \nhateful rhetoric--especially in the Presidential election by our \nRepublican colleagues.\n  As defenders of democracy, we must stand against the bigotry wherever \nit arises. Doing so is the only way to ensure that we stay true to our \nfundamental values. As election season begins to kick into high gear, I \nencourage the American people to heed the call that President Obama \nmade yesterday at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, when he closed by \nsaying, ``We have to reaffirm that most fundamental of truths--we are \nall God's children, all born equal with inherent dignity.''\n  Will the Chair announce the business before the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S637-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what happened in Flint, MI, is incredible. \nIn the 21st century, in the most developed country on Earth, to think \nthat 100,000 people were exposed to contaminated water, to think that \n9,000 or 10,000 children were exposed to lead poisoning--it was not a \nnatural disaster but the results are disastrous. It was a disaster \ncreated by those who were in charge of managing the city of Flint.\n  The governmental agencies and those who worked for them made what \nthey considered to be the right budgetary decisions, but they certainly \nmade the wrong decisions when it came to the health and the well-being \nof the poor people who were victimized by their wrongdoing. Every time \nI hear the story, the same question comes to my mind: Who is going to \njail for poisoning 9,000 children? Think about the circumstances here. \nA knowing decision by a city manager to switch to a water supply which \nwas contaminated endangered the health of thousands of children, tens \nof thousands of citizens. If that is not the grounds for at least \ninvestigation, I don't what is.\n  So the Senators from Michigan, Senator Peters, Senator Stabenow, have \ncome to the floor of the Senate and said to America: Will you help \nFlint, MI? It is right that they do so. I have been fortunate to serve \nin the House and Senate for many years. I cannot tell you how many \ntimes Senators from States all across the Nation have asked that same \nquestion: Will you help us in Louisiana? Will you help us in Alabama? \nWill you help us in Texas?\n  There is hardly a State that has not come to the floor of the Senate \nasking for help. Yet, for reasons I cannot explain, the Republican \nmajority in the Senate is resisting this idea. Almost 100,000 people \nwere forced to live without access to clean water in their homes. They \ncould not turn on their faucets in the morning to make breakfast or to \ntake a shower, as all of us do. They started their day by waiting in \nlong lines for bottled water to feed and bathe their kids, to take \nshowers, and to stay healthy. They started rationing the water.\n  The elderly and disabled who could not make it to a pickup location \nfor bottled water, they were left with the option of continuing to use \nwater they know was poisoning their bodies. This is a disaster by any \ndefinition. I cannot understand why there is not more understanding and \nempathy from my colleagues when it comes to Flint, MI. It could happen \nanywhere. If it happened, would you hesitate for a moment as a Member \nof the Senate to ask for help?\n  Nine thousand children exposed to lead poisoning has been called an \nearmark by the critics of our Senators from Michigan. They said it is \njust special interest legislation to try to help these victims. That is \nhard to imagine, that it could reach that level in criticizing this \neffort. Just like those who suffered from tornadoes and hurricanes, \nthese families did nothing to deserve it. Just as the Federal \nGovernment always helps when Americans are hit by disasters, we should \ndo it in Flint.\n  There were no complaints last May when the Federal Government \ndeclared an emergency and reached out to the residents of Texas to help \nthem rebuild their lives after a tornado hit. So I am wondering if the \nRepublican Presidential candidate from Texas is willing to step up, the \njunior Senator from Texas, and ask for the same level of Federal \nassistance for Flint, MI, that he asked for his own State.\n  This crisis is not the fault of the kids, the pregnant women who \nstill call Flint home. Their only crime was living in a city that was \nso poorly mismanaged by the Michigan State government. Their only \ncrime, if there was one, was being the victims of cheap, dirty water. \nThese kids and pregnant women are the most vulnerable when it comes to \nlead contamination. We are not going to know for years the extent of \nthe damage, but we know there will be damage.\n  Many of them live in homes that have been found to have 10 times the \nEPA limits for lead in drinking water. The Senator from Michigan, Ms. \nStabenow, yesterday told us that some of the lead samples reached the \nlevel of toxic dumps, so far beyond the level\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\nthat is acceptable for human consumption. This means a generation of \nFlint kids are in danger of suffering brain damage, developmental \ndelays, and behavior issues for the rest of their lives.\n  To add insult to injuries, when mothers came to the State nurse to \nfight for their children, they were met with apathy. Listen to what \nthey were told:\n\n       It's just a few IQ points. . . . It's not the end of the \n     world.\n\n  This is supposedly a quote from a State nurse. The Flint water crisis \ntruly is a tragedy. We need to step forward. It does not just mean \nfunding. It reminds us of the importance of clean drinking water that \nwe all take for granted. When I think of all of the efforts on the \nfloor of the Senate to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency \nand to remove their authority to deal with issues involving clean \nwater, it is hard to imagine that they could envision what happened in \nFlint, because having access to clean water should not be determined by \nyour ZIP Code or your government. I hope my Republican colleagues will \nwork with us on a bipartisan basis, the way we always do it when it \ncomes to disasters that hurt innocent people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as all of our colleagues know, we have \nbeen working very hard to come together around a reasonable path to \nprovide some support and assistance to the people of Flint, MI, who got \nup this morning--if they took a shower, it was with bottled water. If \nthey were getting breakfast for their children, if a mom was mixing \nbaby food formula, it was with bottled water.\n  That has gone on now, for some people, 18 months or more. I mean, \noriginally, they were told the water was safe, and they were drinking \nit and then found incredibly high lead levels in their children. Now it \nis bottled water. We have businesses downtown who have gone to the \nexpense of creating their own water systems that are totally safe, but \nno one will come. Doors are closing.\n  We have small businesses in neighborhoods--we have a revitalization \neffort in downtown Flint that has been really quite extraordinary. The \nchamber, a wide variety of organizations, the University of Michigan-\nFlint, a whole range of groups investing in downtown Flint.\n  This is all collapsing because of the fact that people are afraid to \ncome and to drink the water or to eat food mixed with the water, even \nthough our businesses downtown are doing things to rectify this right \nnow. The citizens of Flint, rightly, are in a position where they have \nbeen told that the water was safe to drink. They gave it to their \nchildren. It wasn't. They are poisoned.\n  Now they are in a situation where they have great despair and great \nanger. I share in both of those feelings, a multitude of feelings, as \ndoes my friend and colleague Senator Peters. We are joined together in \nour commitment on a whole range of efforts to be able to help the \nchildren and families of Flint. There was one report--by the way, this \nis what the water looks like--brown, smells.\n  There was one story on the news of a house where they went to talk \nwith folks and looked at the lead levels. It was above toxic waste dump \nlevels. I talked to a mom who talked about--and I heard another mom as \nwell, being interviewed, saying: You know, I took my children off of \nwhat we call pop in Michigan, other people call it soda, Coke, Pepsi, \nbecause I was told that was not healthy for my children. So when my \nchildren were playing last summer, I told them to drink water to \nhydrate because I did not want them getting the extra sugar, the \ningredients from pop. Now I know I was poisoning my children.\n  I can only imagine what that mom feels right now. We have a lot of \ninfrastructure problems around the country, no question. We have \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle working together on various \nproposals that I support to deal long term with infrastructure.\n  But this is way beyond that. This is an entire city of 100,000 people \nwho have poisoned water because of decisions that none of them made. We \ncan talk later about whose fault it is. There is certainly culpability \nand accountability. But right now we are focused on helping the people \nwho had nothing to do with creating this. It is 100,000 people. The \nentire system has lead in it. Some levels are thousands of points \nhigher than is acceptable. No lead is acceptable, but some of it is \nhigher than a toxic waste belt.\n  So we are on the floor asking to help the children of Flint by doing \nwhat we do all the time. We just step up as Americans and help a \ncommunity rebuild their water system. There is a lot more to do. We are \nso grateful for colleagues who have reached out to say we want to help \nin a variety of ways--with their education needs, nutrition needs, and \nhealth care needs,--but the basic issue is fixing the water system so \nthat the people of Flint have the dignity that we have of knowing that \nwhen they turn on the faucet there is going to be clean water.\n  You have probably seen the picture, but in this example in Time \nmagazine, this is a child whose mom was bathing her children, and there \nare rashes. We have seen rashes, sores, hair falling out, and lead \nlevels because a community drinking water system has been decimated.\n  Americans responded across the country by sending bottled water, and \npeople are very grateful for that. But we also know Americans support \nand join us by saying bottled water is not enough. This baby cannot be \nbathed in bottled water every day for years and years and years.\n  I had one citizen say to me: Ma'am, I can't take a shower in bottled \nwater. We have to support fixing the infrastructure. We do that all the \ntime.\n  So what we have done--and I appreciate the chair of the Energy \nCommittee working with us. She spent a lot of time--as has the ranking \nmember, who has been ferocious in her support, for which we are so \ngrateful--trying to work this out. Originally, we thought we had a path \nforward. Then there were procedural issues that came up. Yesterday we \nthought we had another path forward that would give us bipartisan \nsupport on a solution that we could get done and passed here. Then that \nwas paused. I am not exactly sure why that happened, but that was \npaused.\n  So today we are asking for colleagues to give us some more time. We \nhave very key people in this Chamber who are now stepping up to give us \nadditional ideas on how we could get this fixed. We can do this quickly \nif there is the will to do that. So we are asking colleagues to give us \nmore time.\n  As we know, the cloture vote in front of us today is to basically \nshut off amendments and go to the next step in third reading. What we \nare saying is give us some time. There are other issues that need to be \nresolved as well, certainly issues with working men and women around \nDavis-Bacon laws. There are other issues. We know that we can come to a \nresolution if there is the political will and a little more time, so \nthat it is not just some bogus proposal. We have had things thrown out \nthat don't solve the problem. We are not looking for something that \njust gives somebody political cover. We have resisted a lot of folks \nwho would love just to make this a political issue. These children \nshould not be a political football.\n  I think Members of this body know that Senator Peters and I are \npeople who want to get things done. We work across the aisle every \nsingle day. If we wanted to blow this up as a political issue, believe \nme, there would be a different way to do it, and the story writes \nitself.\n  We are asking people to care and see these children like you see your \nown children. These children, these families have been ignored and not \nseen. We see them. Their faces are burned in my memory. We are asking \ncolleagues to see them, to hold them with as much value as you would \nchildren in your own family and in the States that you represent. That \nis what we are asking--nothing more, nothing less.\n  We have not proposed that the Federal Government take full \nresponsibility on cost--far from it. In fact, we have been told by \ncolleagues that we have not proposed enough. We have\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nbeen willing, in fact, to come to an agreement on something that is \nless than half of what we originally asked for.\n  But these children deserve the dignity of knowing we will step up and \nhelp them. Too many of these children--9,000 of them under the age of 6 \nand a whole lot of many more thousands above the age of 6--are going to \nbe set back and not have the opportunity to be all they can be. How \nmany scientists, doctors, business people, and teachers are we going to \nlose because of lead poisoning in this community?\n  It doesn't go away. I have learned more than I have ever wanted to \nknow about lead. I didn't know that once it enters the body, it never \ngoes away. So the children who are poisoned are going to have to live \nwith this, and the best we can do is mitigate it through nutrition and \nthrough other strategies. But they deserve to know that we are going to \nfix this, and we can't begin to deal with it unless the water system \nworks. That is all we are asking for.\n  Today, because we know there is a path, people of good will have been \ntrying to get it done. We need a little more time. I think these \nchildren deserve a little more time. I think these families deserve a \nlittle more time.\n  Let us get this together. If we vote next week, next Tuesday, we will \nbe OK. How many kids, how many bottles of water--how many bottles will \nbe used between now and next Tuesday by the people of Flint?\n  We can take a couple of extra days to do something that will \ndramatically change the opportunity for our future in a city that is as \nimportant as any other city in our country. So that is what we are \nasking for. We are grateful that our colleagues are standing with us--\nour colleagues on our side of the aisle--to give us more time.\n  We are hoping that the leadership will decide to give us that time so \nthat we can say to this child: We see you, we hear you, we care about \nyou, and we are doing our part in the Senate to make things better.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to oppose the upcoming cloture vote on the Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act. This is not because I think this is a bad \nbill. In fact, I know this bill is the result of months of hard work on \nboth sides of the aisle, and it contains many provisions that will move \nour economy forward.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member \nCantwell, including their willingness to include bipartisan legislation \nthat I offered with Senators Alexander and Stabenow to support the \ndevelopment of next-generation clean vehicle technologies. While I \nsincerely hope that we are able to advance this bill out of the Senate, \nit is simply too soon to cut off debate and invoke cloture.\n  Senator Stabenow, Senator Cantwell, and I have been negotiating with \nour Republican colleagues to secure critical assistance for the city of \nFlint, MI, whose residents are continuing to suffer from a manmade \ndisaster. Nearly 2 years ago, an unelected emergency manager appointed \nby Michigan's Governor changed the city of Flint's water to a source of \nthe Flint River in an attempt to save money while the city prepared to \ntransition to a new regional water authority.\n  After switching away from clean water sourced from the Detroit water \ndepartment, Flint residents began to receive improperly treated Flint \nRiver water, long known to be contaminated and potentially very \ncorrosive. Brown or yellow water poured from Flint faucets that tasted \nand smelled terrible. This water wasn't just disgusting, it turned out \nto be poisonous. This corrosive water leached lead from aging but \npreviously stable infrastructure.\n  A generation of children in Flint are now at risk for the severe \neffects of lead exposure, which can cause long-term development \nproblems, nervous system damage, and decreased bone and muscle growth. \nEven though Flint is no longer pulling its water from the contaminated \nriver and is back to drawing safe Lake Huron water, the recently \ndamaged pipes and infrastructure contaminate the water before it pours \nfrom the tap.\n  Flint residents are unable to use their showers and need to wash \nthemselves with baby wipes. Some walk as far as 2 miles to pick up \nbottled water to drink--the same bottled water they use to cook and to \nbrush their teeth. This is simply not sustainable.\n  Flint needs the support of all levels of government to overhaul its \ndamaged water infrastructure and help the children of Flint, who will \nbe dealing with the health effects of lead exposure for decades to \ncome.\n  What makes America so exceptional is its resiliency and the unity of \nour people in the face of a tragedy or a crisis. While Flint has faced \ndecades of economic hardship, it is now facing a full-blown crisis, and \nnow is the time for all of us to pull together.\n  On Monday, I heard from a woman who was on the verge of tears as she \ndiscussed her fears of the health conditions that her children face.\n  Yesterday I met another mom from Flint who brought a baby bottle \nfilled with brown water that she poured from her tap--and brought it to \nWashington--to show my colleagues and Congress just how immediate a \npublic health threat this public crisis is. This image that appeared on \nthe cover of Time magazine is clearly a haunting cry for help.\n  I ask my colleagues to look into those eyes and to hear that cry, to \nsee that cry for help. I believe that if any of my colleagues saw this \ntragedy such as we are seeing in our home State--Senator Stabenow and \nI--they would be standing here doing everything in their power to \ndeliver assistance. Whether the crisis is natural or manmade, it simply \ndoesn't matter. This is a crisis.\n  It is also important to know that this crisis has raised questions \nabout the safety of our Nation's infrastructure. It is possible that \nother communities could be affected.\n  While other communities may not suffer a crisis like Flint, across \nthe country communities are learning about the vulnerabilities of their \nown water supply and what may happen in the future.\n  I should also reiterate that the proposal Senator Stabenow and I have \nbeen negotiating would provide funding for any State that has had an \nemergency declaration related to lead or other contamination in public \ndrinking water systems. So it is not just about Flint. This is about \nany community that is suffering from contamination of their drinking \nwater.\n  While we often talk about crumbling roads or bridges, hundreds, if \nnot thousands of American cities, towns, and villages have aging water \ninfrastructure and lead pipes.\n  Should one of our colleague's communities experience a similar crisis \nin in the coming months, this funding we are fighting for today will be \navailable to them as well.\n  Now is the time for action and to help the families of Flint. I hope \nthat we can reach a resolution on our negotiations with our Republican \ncolleagues, but we are not quite there yet. I urge all of my colleagues \nto oppose cloture on this bill until we have a deal.\n  Whether in Flint or elsewhere in America, we have a responsibility to \ncare for our children. We must repair the trust Flint residents have \nlost in the ability of government officials to protect them and provide \nthe most basic of all services.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in our efforts to help Flint \nrecover from this unnecessary, manmade disaster.\n  Standing up for the children of this country is not a Republican or a \nDemocratic issue, and I hope that today we show the American people \nthat we can come together at times of crisis. This is common ground on \nwhich we can stand together and stand up for the people and children of \nFlint.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I see that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska has come to the floor as the manager of the bill. I have a \nstatement I wish to give, but I didn't know if she needed to say \nsomething.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to add my heartfelt and impassioned voice \nto call for action to help the people who live in Flint, MI, with this \nemergency situation. We have to be in it to deal with the emergency \ntoday and the long haul for tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\n  This is of catastrophic, almost Armageddon, proportion. An American \ncity has been poisoned because of a situation that has been self-\ninduced and self-inflicted. What is happening in Flint, MI, is \nappalling. It is a tragedy, it is a disgrace, and it will be for a long \ntime. We need to fix the pipes right away, but the fixing of human \nbeings is going to take a long, long time.\n  Let's get real. We are now bogged down in parliamentary inertia. We \nare now bogged down in Washington wonky budgetary talk: Where are the \noffsets?\n  What is this? What is this? Are we human beings? We take an oath to \ndefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, but \nsometimes an enemy is a tragedy. It can come from--God knows--a \nhurricane or tornado, and we rush in to help. If this had been a \nterrorist attack, oh, my gosh, we would be willing to go to war to \ndefend America. Well, we need to go to the edge of our chair to help \nFlint. My gosh.\n  The Senators from Michigan are looking for $400 million. That is no \nsmall amount of money, but I bring to my colleague's attention that it \nis the price of four F-35s--four F-35s that are supposed to protect \nAmerica. Good for that. But right now I think the people of Michigan \nwould say they would like to have the help they need. If we are talking \nabout a threat to the people, the threat is here.\n  Now, where are we? We have to deal with this. I am the vice chair of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I say to my colleagues: Guess what, gang. \nAll this budgetary stuff, all the battles with sequester and so on--we \nhave only $800 million for safe drinking water, less than $1 billion. \nFlint today is asking for $400 million. We know it is a down payment. I \nsay to my colleagues from Michigan, this could happen to any State. It \ncould happen to any State because our infrastructure is not only aging \nin place, it is becoming dysfunctional in place and it is becoming \ndangerous in place--$800 million.\n  Senators Stabenow and Peters have already shared horror stories. \nGosh, they have done a great job speaking up for the people. I really \ncompliment their advocacy. But we are all Flint. We are all Flint. The \nfacts will speak for themselves as we talk about how the Flint water is \ncontaminated because its pipes are permanently damaged. I understand \nthat replacing Flint's corroded water infrastructure will cost anywhere \nfrom $700 million to $1.5 billion--approximately 500 miles of old iron \npipe and thousands of lead service lines.\n  It is an untold, big cost, but I am going to speak about the \nchildren. I am going to speak about the people. My gosh, what are you \ngoing through? I don't know how you can run a family. Well, you can't \nrun a family on bottled water. You can't run a business on bottled \nwater. You can't run a city on bottled water. I don't know how you \nwash. I don't know how you take care of your children. I wouldn't go \nanywhere in Flint unless I personally prepared my food or washed my \nclothes or saw what I was doing. I would be scared to death. I bet \nthose parents are too. And what are we afraid of? We need to get there.\n  Now I am going to talk about the children and the human cost. I say \nto my colleagues, both from Michigan and here, Senator Cardin and I \nknow a lot about lead poisoning. We have been through really difficult \nproblems in Baltimore because of lead paint poisoning and the legacy of \npaint used during World War II. We know what it does. It lowers IQs. It \ncauses significant developmental delays. There are behavioral issues, \nincluding attention deficit disorder. It is a lifetime; that little boy \nor girl at 6 years old, God willing that they live to their 80s, they \nare going to carry this in their blood unless there are incredible \nmedical breakthroughs for the rest of their lives. Senator Stabenow and \nI have discussed possible medical breakthroughs, but, gosh, we have to \nget on it. We have to get on it. Again, the effects of poisoning could \ntake a lifetime.\n  What I know about lead paint in Baltimore goes back to my days in \ncity council where the paint was poisonous. They were coming into Johns \nHopkins and the University of Maryland Medical Center, kids just so \nsick. I remember the story about a little boy who was so weak that on \nhis way to school he lay down in the middle of the street. He was so \ndepleted because of the consequences of lead paint.\n  That is why I support the Stabenow amendment to provide $800 million \nin loans and grants and also to provide about $20 million to HHS to \nbring together the best thinking to have the best responses to the \nhuman infrastructure.\n  I have worked on this issue for a long time, going back to Senator \nKit Bond, my pal and partner when we had the old VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee. Senator Bond was a real champion on this. There can be a \nbipartisan solution. Let's make it an American solution. This isn't \nabout ``you,'' and it is not about ``Democrats.'' It is about ``us.''\n  As vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, I certainly want to \nwork with my colleagues on how we can do this. But let's get the lead \nout of the pipes, let's get the lead out of the water, let's get the \nlead out of the way the Senate has functioned and move to make a down \npayment on this.\n  Mr. President, I really want us to understand we have to solve this \nproblem.\n  I will conclude with this. I just want to say something to the \nmothers of America: We need you right now. The mothers of Flint need \nyou. The mothers of Flint need you. The fathers of Flint need you. The \nmothers and fathers of Flint need you. If you are a mother or father \nanywhere, you could be a mother or father in Flint. Let's organize \nourselves in the most effective way to solve this problem, and let's \nbegin to heal the critical infrastructure so we begin to prevent this \nfrom happening in any other American city.\n  Mr. President, today I wish to support an amendment filed by my \nfriend and colleague Senator Collins that would require the Department \nof Energy to identify a mitigation strategy to help protect our \ncritical infrastructure in the electric sector from a catastrophic \ncyber attack. When it comes to our national security, there is no such \nthing as partisanship, and we have to work together on a bipartisan \nbasis to ensure our Nation is safe and protected. We need to act, and \nwe need to act in the defense of the United States of America. The \nSenate has a great opportunity today to pass an amendment to help \nprotect and defend our Nation's critical infrastructure from a \ndevastating cyber attack.\n  What do I mean by critical infrastructure? It is our electric power \ngrid, our financial services, our water supplies, those things that are \nthe bread and butter of keeping America, its business, and its families \ngoing. These are entities that are vital to the safety, health, and \neconomic well-being of the American people; so we need to do our part \nto help keep our critical infrastructure hardened and resilient against \nattack.\n  You don't have to be a science fiction enthusiast to understand how \ndevastating an attack that disabled our power grid would be--millions \nwithout power. I am not worried that we will have to put away our \niPhones; I am worried about vulnerable populations lacking heat in the \ndead of winter, about emergency responders who can't get calls, and \nabout patients who need power for lifesaving medical devices.\n  The possibility of an attack on our power grid is not far-fetched. We \nknow that there are already attacks going on in our energy sector. The \ncommittee report accompanying this bill notes that one-third of \nreported cyber attacks involve the energy sector.\n  But not only do I worry about an attack, I equally worry about our \ninertia, where we do nothing. I bring to the attention of the Senate \nthat Jim Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, testified that \nthe No. 1 cyber concern he has is an attack on our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure, saying the greatest threat facing our country was in \nthe cyber domain. His testimony is backed up by several intrusions into \nthe industrial control systems of critical infrastructure, which are \nthe computers that control operations of industrial processes, \nincluding energy plants. Just a couple of weeks ago, Marty Edwards, who \nruns the Department of Homeland Security's Industrial Control Systems \nCyber Emergency Response Team, warned that he had seen an increase in \nattacks over the past year, saying systems are vulnerable because they \nare exposed to the Internet.\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\n  Admiral Rogers, the Director of the National Security Agency, with \nresponsibility for cyber space, testified in a hearing this summer that \nour country was at a ``5 or 6'' in preparedness for a cyber attack \nagainst our critical infrastructure.\n  In November 2015, Richard Ledgett, the Deputy Director of the NSA, \nwas asked if foreign actors already have the capability to shut down \nkey U.S. infrastructure during a CNN interview, such as the financial \nsector, national gas distribution and energy sector, transportation \nnetwork, and air traffic control system. His response was \n``Absolutely.''\n  We don't want a digital Pearl Harbor. We can act now. We can act when \nit is within our power to protect, defend, and deter these attacks. \nThat is what I want. I want us to have a sense of urgency. If we wait \nfor another major cyber attack, we risk overreacting, overregulating, \noverspending, and over-legislating. The time to act is now.\n  This amendment would take the commonsense approach of requiring the \nFederal agencies responsible for the cyber security of the electric \ngrid to review those entities that matter most and to propose actions \nthat can reduce the risk of a catastrophic attack that could cause \nthousands of deaths or a catastrophic blow to our economy and national \ndefense.\n  Congress has missed opportunities to improve our Nation's cyber \npreparedness, and we need to take action before a ``cyber 9/11'' \noccurs. Right now, our adversaries are watching us, and it looks like \nwe are doing nothing--that when all is said and done, more gets said \nthan gets done.\n  Our adversaries don't have to spy on us. They can just look at the \nSenate floor and say, ``What the heck are they doing?'' You know what \nthey are going to do? They are going to look at us and say, ``There \nthey go again.'' Our own inability to pass legislation, our own \npartisan gridlock and deadlock emboldens our predatory enemies who know \nwe have done nothing to strengthen vulnerable critical infrastructure \nby putting in place those hardened, resilient systems and policies to \nprotect, defend, and deter.\n  A cyber attack has the same intent as a traditional terrorist \nattack--to create chaos, to create civil instability, and to create \neconomic catastrophe. Just think about a cyber attack in which our grid \ngoes down. Think of a blackout in New York. Think of a blackout in \nBaltimore. When the Senate, at my urging, did the cyber exercise on \nwhat an attack would look like on our critical infrastructure, it \nshowed what would happen. The stoplights go down, the lights go out in \nthe hospitals, and the respirators go off. Business shuts down. \nCommerce shuts down, and 9-1-1 shuts down. America would be shut down, \nand we would be powerless and impotent to put it back on in any quick \nand expeditious manner.\n  This happened in Ukraine in December 2015. Ukrainians lost power in \nwhat the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Ukrainian authorities \nassessed was a cyber attack. The attack caused a blackout for tens of \nthousands of people, and industry experts identified this as the first-\nknown power outage caused by a cyber attack. This is no longer a \ntheoretical risk; it is here, and it is real.\n  Think of the chaos of no electricity. We will all go through \nblackouts. Snowzilla roared through the east coast last week leaving \nhundreds of thousands without power. No matter how delayed Pepco, BG, \nand Dominion were at responding, they got it back on.\n  But what happens if they can't get it back on? What happens if they \ncan't get it back on for weeks or longer? Remember, the attack is to \nhumiliate, intimidate, and cripple. Humiliate? Making us look \npowerless. Intimidate? To show there is this power that can cripple our \nfunctioning as a society. I find it chilling.\n  I have been immersed in cyber issues since I was elected to the \nSenate. Our cyber warriors at the National Security Agency are in \nMaryland, and I have been working with the NSA to ensure signals \nintelligence was a national security focus even before cyber was a \nmethod of warfare. In my role on the Intelligence Committee, I served \non the Cyber Working Group, which developed findings to guide Congress \non getting cyber governance right, protecting civil liberties, and \nimproving the cyber workforce.\n  As vice chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, I have insisted \non a robust cyber budget and fought to increase our cyber security \ninvestments in the fiscal year 2016 Omnibus to keep us safe, putting \nfunds in the Federal checkbook for critical cyber security agencies on \nthe order of $12 billion. These include the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, which investigates cyber crime; the Department of \nHomeland Security, which safeguards critical infrastructure in cyber \nspace; the Department of Defense, or DoD, which defends our homeland, \nnational interests, and DoD networks against cyber attacks and includes \nintelligence and cyber agencies, like the National Security Agency, \nU.S. Cyber Command, the Central Intelligence Agency, and Intelligence \nAdvanced Research Projects Activity, which are coming up with the new \nideas to keep our country safe; the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, which works with the private sector to develop standards \nfor cyber security technology; and the National Science Foundation, \nwhich researches ways to secure our Nation. These funds are critical to \nbuilding the workforce and providing the technology and resources to \nmake our cyber security smarter, safer, and more secure.\n  Good people in this body have been working on both sides of the aisle \nfor some time now. So I conclude my remarks by saying to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle: Let's do what we need to do to protect and \ndefend the United States of America and adopt this amendment now. \nWorking together, we can make our Nation safer and stronger and show \nthe American people we can cooperate to get an important job done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act that we have been considering on the Senate \nfloor.\n  This bill has a lot of good things in it. It includes provisions to \nsupport a wide array of energy technologies, from improving \nconventional energy sources to promoting renewables to advancing long-\noverdue policies to increase energy efficiency. It supports energy \ninfrastructure, which is critical for energy exporting States like \nMontana. It includes specific provisions that I have worked on to \npromote geothermal development, and I thank Chairman Murkowski and \nRanking Member Cantwell for including them. In the course of this \ndebate, we have adopted amendments to boost research and development \noverall and to clarify policies to recognize the value of energy \ndevelopment from forest biomass. I am also hopeful we will also be able \nto add provisions from the Public Lands Renewable Energy Development \nAct that I have championed for years.\n  Furthermore, this bill includes permanent reauthorization of the land \nand water conservation fund with my making public lands public \nprovision to increase access to our public lands for hunters, fishers, \nand others who want to enjoy them. Although it does not provide the \nmoney to fully fund the LWCF, a permanent authorization would help us \navoid letting the fund lapse, as it did last fall for over 2 months. It \nalso invests in our national parks as we celebrate the centennial year \nof the Park Service. Though I may not agree with everything in the \nbill, these provisions I have highlighted are tremendously important to \nMontana.\n  But we are also in the midst of a developing environmental \ncatastrophe. The people of Flint, MI, including as many as 9,000 \nchildren, have been exposed to lead-contaminated water for a prolonged \nperiod due to decisions made by the State of Michigan in the interest \nof saving money. A generation of kids in this community could see \nlifelong effects from a completely avoidable and manmade disaster. As \nwe know all too well in Montana, clean water is far more valuable than \nmoney. It is completely unacceptable that this has happened.\n  In Montana, there are places where we are still living with the \nlegacy of environmental pollution. In Butte, Anaconda, Libby, and \nelsewhere, long-term cleanups continue from mining development, \nindustrial activities, and the tragedy of widespread asbestos use.\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\nThe human health costs of these disasters have been tremendous. We must \nnot stand by and watch another community and more kids be affected by \nmanmade disasters without stepping in to help. If we have a chance to \nstop this particular catastrophe before it gets any worse, we ought to. \nWe have to.\n  And that is why I am disappointed that we are not currently able to \nprovide meaningful and immediate assistance to help fix the pipes and \naddress broader impacts. I hope we can figure out how to pass this \nbill. Let's stay on this bill, let's find a way to do right by folks in \nFlint, and let's pass this bill.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3140, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a bipartisan amendment \noffered by Senator Collins that was adopted this week. I support this \namendment to help bolster forest biomass in our renewable energy \nportfolio and provide consistency across Federal programs. Our Nation \nhas long depended on the flow of wood and fiber from our forests. Now, \nwe are recognizing the role of forest biomass in lowering our carbon \nemissions and increasing our energy independence. When harvested \nsustainably, the carbon benefits of forest biomass can be great. Carbon \nemitted to the atmosphere from forest biomass is eventually removed \nagain with forest growth, and this cycle can happen again and again.\n  Forest biomass is also good for jobs, particularly in rural \ncommunities. Recognizing the carbon benefits of forest biomass can \nincrease its value. This will help keep our Nation's forests healthy by \nmaking it economically feasible to conduct forest health treatments and \nreduce hazardous fuels that threaten our communities. It will also help \nthe timber industry by allowing them to use more wood that would \notherwise be wasted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Energy Committee has worked really \nhard over the past year to develop the broad bipartisan energy \nlegislation that is before us. Members in both parties focused on areas \nof common ground, worked across the aisle, and developed legislation \nthat ultimately earned the support of more than 80 percent of their \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Here is what some of our Democratic friends have had to say about the \nbroad bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n  The junior Senator from New Mexico said this bill ``is critical to \nprotecting'' his State's ``treasured public lands and outdoor \nheritage.''\n  The junior Senator from Minnesota pointed out that ``several key \nmeasures'' he wrote are in this bill and that this bill represents ``a \ngood step'' forward.\n  The junior Senator from Hawaii noted that her proposals in the bill \n``will bolster energy reliability and security'' in her State.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia said he was able to include \n``critical measures'' in the bill to help coal jobs and low-cost \nelectricity in his State. ``It is critical for America to establish an \nall-of-the-above energy portfolio that includes all of our domestic \nresources,'' he said, and, ``I truly believe that this bipartisan bill \nwill bring us one step closer to achieving U.S. energy independence.'' \nThat is the senior Senator from West Virginia, a Democrat.\n  The top Democrat on the Energy Committee said:\n\n       If we want to continue to compete in th[e] global economy, \n     we must continue to improve energy productivity and that is \n     exactly what this bill does. The Energy Policy Modernization \n     Act will help ensure that the nation is eliminating energy \n     wastage and making improvements in new technologies that will \n     improve our competitiveness for the 21st century.\n\n  That was the ranking Democrat on the Energy Committee. She worked \nhard with Senator Murkowski on the Energy Committee to develop this \nbill, and they have worked together to manage it here on the floor as \nwell. Under their leadership, more than 30 amendments from both \nDemocrats and Republicans have already been adopted.\n  For example, one of our Democratic friends offered an amendment that \nhe said would ``strengthen this bipartisan energy bill and help us move \ntowards a 21st century economy.'' The Senate adopted it.\n  Another of our Democratic friends said his amendment would ``empower \nus with knowledge'' and help us ``make informed decisions to protect \nconsumers, key sectors of our economy and our energy security.'' The \nSenate adopted that amendment too.\n  There is a lot for both parties to like in this bill. The Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act is the result of a year's worth of \nconstructive and collaborative work. So let's not risk that progress. \nLet's keep working together and vote today to advance this measure. If \nwe want to help Americans produce more energy, let's vote to advance \nthe measure. If we want to help Americans pay less for energy, let's \nvote to advance it. If we want to help Americans save energy, let's \nvote to advance it. And if we want to help bolster our country's long-\nterm national security, one more time, let's vote to advance it.\n  I would note one more thing the top Democrat on the Energy Committee \nrecently said: ``Sometimes we can be cynical about this place and what \nwe can get done; then, all of a sudden, we have a great opportunity to \nmove something forward.''\n  She continued:\n\n       This is a milestone for the Senate. The fact that we are \n     considering energy policy legislation on the Senate floor in \n     a bipartisan bill, or any bill, for the first time since 2007 \n     is a tremendous milestone.\n\n  That is the ranking Democrat on the Energy Committee.\n  So let's bring this bill to the finish line. Let's vote to bring \nAmerica's energy policies in line with today's demands so we can \nprepare for tomorrow's opportunities too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I also want to, as I did before, commend \nthose working on this bill, and I share the majority leader's feeling \nthat a lot of positive progress has been made. We are just not done \nyet. So while I commend, and have commended, the chair and the ranking \nmember, we have important issues and an energy bill that deals with \nenergy, water, and all kinds of issues. Certainly addressing what is \nhappening in Flint, MI, with the catastrophe is appropriate. We just \nwant to know that we have an agreement--not vote, but an agreement--to \nget this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my \ncolleagues raising attention to the issue in Flint, MI. I think we have \nhad good, constructive discussions, not only very intensely yesterday, \nbut working with the two Senators from Michigan on this issue for \nseveral months right now. As the Senator said, the discussions are \nstill ongoing, and I want to speak to where we are in that process.\n  I would like to start my comments this morning by recognizing that we \nare very close to the time that has been set for this first cloture \nvote on this broad bipartisan bill.\n  As we approach it, I want to follow on the majority leader's comments \nin terms of reminding Members of what we have incorporated within this \nmeasure, to reiterate the strong bipartisan support that our bill has \ndrawn, and to lay out what I believe is our best path to final passage.\n  This Energy Policy Modernization Act, as I have mentioned, is more \nthan a year's worth of hard work by those of us who serve on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, it has been the result of Member-to-\nMember conversations, listening sessions, legislative hearings, \nbipartisan negotiations, and then we had a marathon 3-day markup in \nJuly. At the end of that markup, we moved it out by a vote of 18-to-4. \nIt was pretty strong support--10 Republicans and 8 Democrats in favor.\n  The reason the bill passed out of the committee on such a strong \nbipartisan basis was not just because of our commitment to good \nprocess. We matched that with an equal commitment to good policy. I \nthink that is important to recognize. It was processed, but it was also \npolicy.\n  We worked together to include the priorities from Members of both \nsides of the aisle as well as from within the committee and outside of \nthe committee. We agreed to include a bill to streamline LNG exports \nthat was written by Senator Barrasso and 17 other bipartisan Members. \nWe agreed to include a major efficiency bill headed up\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nby Senators Portman and Shaheen and 13 other bipartisan Members. We \nagreed to improve our mineral security, an effort that I have led with \nSenators Risch, Heller and Crapo. We agreed to promote the use of \nhydropower, a clean renewable resource that is favored by almost \neverybody in this Chamber. We agreed to expedite the permitting of \nnatural gas pipelines without sacrificing any environmental review or \npublic participation. This was an effort that was led by Senator \nCapito.\n  We agreed to a new oil and gas permitting pilot program, one of \nseveral ideas that Senator Hoeven contributed. We took up a proposal \nfrom Senator Collins to boost the efficiency of schools. We agreed to \napprove our Nation's cyber security based on legislation from Senator \nRisch and Senator Heinrich. We also made innovation a key priority to \npromote the development of new technologies. As part of that, we agreed \nto reauthorize many of the energy-related portions of the America \nCOMPETES Act, thanks to the leadership of Senator Alexander. We agreed \nto take commonsense steps to promote geothermal energy, which is a key \nissue to Senator Wyden, certainly myself, and so many others. We agreed \nto promote vehicle innovation based on a bipartisan measure from \nSenator Alexander and our friends from Michigan, Senator Peters, \nSenator Stabenow. We agreed to reauthorize the coal R program at the \nDepartment of Energy based on yet another bipartisan proposal from \nSenators Manchin, Capito, and Portman.\n  In the context of our broader bill--and only in the context of the \nbroader bill--we also agreed to reauthorize and reform the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. What we came away with was a good, timely \nbipartisan measure that has a very real chance of being the first \nEnergy bill to be signed into law in over 8 years. It is a measure that \nwill help America produce more energy. It will help Americans save \nmoney, and it will help ensure that the energy can be transported from \nwhere it is produced to where it is needed. It will bolster our \nNation's status as the best innovator in the world, something we should \nall aim to support. It will boost our economy, especially our \nmanufacturers, and it will cement our status as a global energy \nsuperpower.\n  As I said, it does all of this without raising taxes, without \nimposing any new mandates, and without adding to the Federal deficit. I \nthink because of all of that, that is why you have seen the good, \nstrong support for this measure. That was our base bill. That was where \nwe started. When we came to the floor, it got better. Our starting \npoint at the Senate floor was good and strong. Since we have taken up \nthe debate for a week now, we have continued to work in a very open, \nvery bipartisan, sometimes a little bit lengthy and tedious process, \nbut it works.\n  We committed to an open amendment process and most Members have held \nback on, whether you call them gotchas or gimmes or poison pills, but \nthere has been a great deal of cooperation. We voted on 38 amendments \nnow. We have accepted 32 of the 38. We have added even more good ideas \nfrom even more Members to an already bipartisan bill.\n  I will recount a few of the things we have done with that. We agreed \nto boost our Nation's efforts to develop advanced nuclear technologies. \nThis was a great amendment led by Senators Crapo, Whitehouse, Risch, \nBooker, Hatch, Kirk, and Durbin. We voiced our strong support for \ncarbon capture and utilization storage technologies thanks to an idea \nfrom Senators Heitkamp, Capito, Booker, Whitehouse, Manchin, Blunt, and \nFranken. We have reaffirmed the need for consistent Federal policies \nthat recognize the carbon neutrality of forest biomass. This was an \neffort that was championed by Senators Collins, Klobuchar, Ayotte, \nKing, Franken, Daines, Crapo, and Risch.\n  You do not often see these large groups of Senators coming together \nin a way that we have seen on this bill. Some would look at the names I \nread off and say: I did not know that they had anything to work on. But \nthese issues have brought them together. This truly has been a team \neffort, with Members reaching out to one another, lining up behind each \nother's ideas, working with Senator Cantwell and me to ensure their \nadoption.\n  The best proof of that is simple review of our bill. Right now the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act includes priorities sponsored or \ncosponsored by at least 62 Members of the Senate. When was the last \ntime we saw that level of cooperation and collaboration? Think about \nit. More than three-fifths of the Senate has contributed something to \nthis Energy bill, and we are not done processing amendments yet. My \nstaff and the staff of Senator Cantwell have been comparing notes about \nthe feedback we have been getting outside the Chamber. What we found is \nthat from the very time we started working through the committee \nprocess to our time on the Senate floor, a very wide range of \nindividuals, businesses, groups have come out and supported the bill or \ncertainly pieces of it. We have had provisions endorsed by major \nassociations whose membership account for hundreds of companies and \nmillions of American workers. This includes the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, American Chemistry Council, National Electrical Manufacturers \nAssociation, the Alliance of Automobile. We have also heard from labor \ngroups--North America's Building Trades Union, the United Autoworkers, \nthe United Brotherhood of Carpenters. They have all weighed in with \nsupport for ideas that are included within the bill.\n  We have a huge coalition from the Alliance to Save Energy to Seattle \nCity Light that has welcomed the work we are doing on efficiency. I \nhave gotten good, strong support from Alaskans from our Department of \nNatural Resources, the Alaska Power Association, the Bristol Bay Native \nCorporation, Cordova Electric Cooperative, and a whole lot more. As you \nmight expect, we have also received great encouragement from the people \nwho keep the lights on, who keep our fuel affordable, who help produce \nthe materials that make modern life that much more enjoyable--whether \nit is the National Mining Association, American Exploration & Mining, \nthe Business Council for Sustainable Energy, American Public Power \nAssociation, Edison Electric, and others.\n  The reality is, those who have weighed in, in support of this measure \nare too many to name this morning, but that is a good problem to have \nwhen you are legislating that you have run out of time in outlining the \ncoalitions that have come together in support.\n\n  So that I do not get into any trouble this morning, I want to be \nclear that many of the groups and the entities I have listed have \nendorsed parts of the bill, not all of it. I am not suggesting that \neveryone who likes our work to streamline LNG Exports is automatically \nsupportive of what we are doing to clean up the U.S. Code. That is \nentirely fair. Not everything in this is going to appeal to everyone.\n  In a lot of ways, that is how things work in a place like the Senate. \nNot everyone likes every provision of this bill. I do not like every \nprovision of this bill. Not everyone is getting everything they want. \nIt is pretty tough to find a situation where you get 100 percent of \neverything you would want. This is not the bill I would have written on \nmy own, but it is the bill we have written together first as a \ncommittee of 22 and now as a Senate working together.\n  Our work has produced a good bill, a good bill worth debating, worth \nadvancing, and worth passing. That brings us to the point where we are \nwith the cloture vote we will soon take. This vote is on the first of \ntwo cloture motions we will need to approve before we can move to final \npassage.\n  There are two votes. There is one on the substitute amendment, and \nthere is one on the underlying bill. This means this vote we will see \nvery shortly is a means to advance debate, not to conclude it, on our \nEnergy Policy Modernization Energy Act. It is also a choice. I think it \nis important to lay out clearly to Members where we are, what we are \nvoting on this morning.\n  By voting for cloture, Members will be ensuring that we remain on \nthis bill for at least another 30 hours of legislative activity. You \nwill be voting to continue this process, to continue this debate, and \nto continue processing amendments whether by voice, as we have done so \nmany of them, or by rollcall vote that we hope to set up. You will also \nbe giving us the time we need\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\nto focus on matters that are simply not settled yet.\n  As we have heard from our colleagues from Michigan, there are some \nmatters they wish to have resolved that are not yet settled, but this \nallows us that time to do that but to do this in a way that is going to \nbe acceptable to the majority of our Members. The reality is, if you \nare not comfortable with where we are 30 hours from now, you can still \nvote against the next cloture motion that comes up. That is one choice, \nand that is going to be my choice. Here is the other: If you vote \nagainst cloture, you will be effectively voting not to prolong debate \nbut to move us off this bipartisan bill. You will be voting to \neffectively be giving up on so much of what we have done, a year of \nprocess, agreement on almost 50 Energy bills that we have incorporated \ninto this base bill, and the strong approval of 32 separate amendments \nand counting that we have advanced through the floor.\n  I believe you will be voting to give up our best opportunity--\ncertainly our most immediate opportunity--to address the issue to help \nthe people of Flint, MI, and in other parts of the country that may \nhave similar issues. Every time I leave the Senate floor--at least this \npast week--I am swarmed by reporters who want to know what is going on, \nwhat is the latest discussion. What is going to happen with Flint? Is \nFlint going to bring this bill down?\n  This morning I want to speak directly to this to let Members know \nwhat has gone on because we were not out here on the floor all day \nyesterday hashing things back and forth. We have been discussing very \nearnestly, and I believe very constructively, what our options are, how \nwe can find a path forward that will yield a result, not just send a \nmessage but yield a result to help the people in Flint, MI.\n  The first thing I will say is that I share the concern, the \nheartbreak for what the people of Flint, MI, have faced and are facing. \nIt is a crisis. It is a tragedy. It is heartbreakingly avoidable. \nUnfortunately, we look at how we got here, and it is a failure of \nlocal, State, and Federal Governments to regulate and monitor that \ncity's water supply.\n  What has happened in Flint has hurt people. It is hurting children. \nIt has damaged property. It has left families in a horrible \npredicament, through no fault of their own, where they cannot drink \ntheir tapwater, they cannot bathe their children. There is plenty of \nblame to go around here. I know my colleagues from Michigan would agree \nwith me, but our job in the U.S. Senate is not to play this blame game. \nIt is to own up to what that Federal role is because I believe there is \nthat Federal role, and then on that basis do what we can to help and \nmake sure that our response is proportionate to that role. So why then \nconsider all of this in the context of an energy bill, you might ask, \nand it is a fair and legitimate question. Well, it is because this is \nthe first piece of legislation that is on the floor since the extent of \nthe crisis in Flint became clear to us.\n\n  Senator Stabenow and I began discussions about the situation in Flint \nin very early December as we were trying to move through an omnibus \nbill to see if there was not something we might be able to address \nthrough the appropriations bill. Since that time, again, more has been \nlearned, and we are here today with legislation that gives us an \nopportunity to consider it.\n  I did not shy away from this discussion, as hard it was. I did not \nsay: Hey, that is going to be a poison pill. I cannot deal with it. I \nsaid: Let us try to figure this out because if we do not address the \nsituation, it is not going to go away. We have a role here. Let us \nfigure out what that responsibility is, and let us engage in this \nconversation.\n  Senator Cantwell and I have been fully engaged, most directly with \nthe Senators in Michigan, trying to find a responsible path forward. \nThe negotiations have been earnest, in good faith, and ongoing, but I \nthink that there has been a little bit of confusion about the status of \nthe negotiations. I want to outline where I believe we are right now.\n  We have made headway on Federal assistance--something that we know \ncannot be borne by our Energy bill alone. We have found programs that \ncould be good fits to provide aid.\n  We also recognize that this is not Flint's burden alone, but there \nare other communities in other States, including my State, that face \nsimilar crises as a result of government failures. We hear about them \nas Members and talk about these situations. I believe the Senator from \nMaryland used the phrase ``We are all Flint.'' I think we all have \nsituations--maybe not to the crisis proportion that they have in \nMichigan right now, where they needed a Presidential declaration, but \nwe all recognize that we all have issues that are troubling us a great \ndeal when it comes to how we provide safe drinking water for our \nfamilies.\n  Our problem is not about whether we should offset the cost of this \nassistance; it is how we do so in a manner that does not destroy the \nunderlying Energy bill and does not violate the Constitution or the \nrules we have here in the Senate. I made myself very clear when we \nbegan, at the outset of the debate on this measure, that we have to \nmake sure we do not have scoring issues with CBO, and we have to make \nsure there are no blue slip issues because that would kill the bill, \nand then where would we be? Then nobody would win in that scenario. In \nthat scenario we would end up with no energy bill and nothing to \naddress the situation in Flint.\n  This morning I filed a second-degree amendment to provide support for \nthe people of Flint. My amendment will make up to $550 million \navailable, including $50 million which will be made immediately \navailable for the people of Flint. What we are seeking to do here is \nbridge the gap between what has been proposed and what I believe the \nSenate can agree to. It requires that 90 percent of the money we \nprovide be paid back over time. Its cost is fully offset with a pay-for \nthat we have been working on back and forth with CBO and are confident \nthat they will accept. It includes provisions--and we have been working \nwith the Senators from Michigan on this issue--as they relate to EPA \nnotification and a loan forgiveness, language that I think has been in \ndifferent iterations of measures that have been going forward. I am \ntold that the House is looking at that as well.\n  That is where we are at this time as we are going into a cloture \nmotion. I believe we have made progress. We are working constructively \nto help the people of Flint, and what this second-degree amendment \nwould do is make $550 million available to them. It has been \nchallenging. We have done a lot of hard work to get to this point, but \nI think we owe it to every American, whether you are in Flint or \nsomewhere else, to do that work and overcome that challenge.\n  We have gotten to where we are in the discussion. Again, we have the \ncloture motion going forward. We have been trying to make good \nprogress. We have been trying to conduct an open and fair amendment \nprocess. We want to process more amendments this morning so that we can \nmove to complete the bill.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to call up the following amendments and make them pending, and \nthat is Stabenow amendment No. 3129; Murkowski second-degree on Flint, \namendment No. 3282; Cantwell amendment No. 3242; Flake amendment No. \n3055; Flake amendment No. 3050; Murkowski-Cantwell amendment No. 3234; \nIsakson amendment No. 3202; Markey amendment No. 3232; and Cassidy \namendment No. 3192.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I first \nwant to thank the chair. She lists a lot of bipartisan efforts that \nhave gone on. I know a lot of work has been done, but nowhere in that \nlist have the needs of the folks of Flint been addressed, including the \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state her objection.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we want to get this solved and not just \nhave votes that go down.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask through the Chair if the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee will yield for a question.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the chairman of the Energy Committee has \ndone tremendous work with the ranking member, Senator Cantwell, to try \nto find some way to address the legitimate concerns we all share and \nhave with what has happened in Flint, but I want to clarify some basic \nfacts. I wish to ask for a comment or answer from the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Isn't it true that there is not yet a comprehensive assessment and \nplan in place by the State of Michigan or Flint as to how they might \neven spend this money at this point to address their concerns about \nlead in the water supply in Flint?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that there is an assessment and \nanalysis that is due out, I believe, toward the end of next week. The \nState has been working aggressively to determine the costs, as well as \nhow they would move forward with an action plan. That is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for another \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Since there is no plan announced yet, or in place, it \nstrikes me as putting the cart before the horse to say that the Senate \nought to vote on a $600 million emergency appropriations deal to pay \nfor a plan that has not yet been created or disclosed to the American \npeople.\n  I ask the Senator through the Chair, isn't it a fact that the State \nitself has already appropriated $40 million to deal with this issue on \nan emergency basis and the Obama administration has made available \nanother $80 million through the EPA that is available to the State of \nMichigan to help Flint deal with this problem, so a total of roughly \n$120 million has already been made available?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I cannot speak to the accuracy of exactly how much has \nbeen made available to the State. It is my understanding that the State \nhas received, through the EPA, the State's annual receipts from the \nEPA's clean water fund. I do not know if that is specific to Flint or \nwhether that is the State's share, as the State of Texas receives and \nthe State of Alaska receives. It is my understanding that the President \ndid make that announcement.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator to yield for a \nquestion so we can share the information?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator is out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Alaska if she would \nyield for one last question on topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Isn't it true that the Senators from Michigan made this \ndemand for a $600 million earmark before a plan was actually put \ntogether by the State of Michigan or the city of Flint--either to \nanalyze the problem or what the solution might look like and how much \nit might cost--and that the Senator from Alaska, in her capacity as the \nbill manager, has made an effort to come up with some compromises? In \nfact, I believe the Senator from Alaska mentioned a compromise that \nwould include upfront funds of $50 million plus a loan, in effect, that \nwould be paid back over time.\n  I ask the Senator, doesn't it make sense--because there is no plan in \nplace and because there is money already available for Flint and \nMichigan to begin to address this problem--for us to take our time and \nhandle any additional requests for funding from Flint or Michigan \nthrough the regular appropriations process? I believe the Senator is \nthe chair of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over these issues, \nand I am just wondering whether that wouldn't be a more orderly, \nresponsible process than a $600 million earmark before a plan is even \nin place.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Well, to answer the Senator's question, I have been \nworking aggressively and constructively with the Senators from Michigan \nto try to figure out how we can provide for a level of response. I do \nnot doubt the anxiety and urgency the people in Flint must feel. This \nis a difficult situation to be in, and it is not a situation that any \nof us would want any of our constituents to be in. I think there is an \nimperative from those who are seeking this assistance that--given that \nthere is a Federal role, how can we help to facilitate the appropriate \nresponse on the Federal side? If there is a way to help expedite \nfunding to move toward a solution, I think that is appropriate.\n  I think the Senator's question is, Are we jumping ahead here if we do \nnot know how much? I think it is fair to say that the original \nestimates were based on the disaster declaration the State had \nrequested. I think it is going to be critical that we understand what \nthe costs will be, and hopefully we will learn about that next week. I \nknow they have been working aggressively to determine that.\n  We also need to know what the spend plan is because we saw what \nhappened with the stimulus. You can almost get too much money--if that \nis possible--going in, and you cannot spend it in the way it is best \nneeded. I think we want to be thoughtful and responsible stewards of \nthe taxpayers' dollars in recognizing that, and I think we want to also \nrecognize that the role we have ought to be a proportionate role, and \nhow we can be working to advance that is something we have been \nattempting to do.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the chair yield for a question?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. In a moment.\n  The solution I have put down this morning is one that I think \nrecognizes that there is assistance that is needed, and this is where \nthe opportunity to access loans through the WIFIA Program that will be \navailable not only to the State of Michigan but to other States should \nthey be in a similar situation--so that avoids the earmark. Because I, \ntoo, want to make sure we have a situation where we do not allow this \nto continue in Michigan, but we also do not want to see it in other \nStates as well. So we do that through opportunities for loans through \nWIFIA. But the direct assistance, which would be $50 million in \naddition to whatever may be out there already from the EPA and through \nthe State, I think is a reasonable approach. Again, it is one that is \nlegitimately paid for, and I think that is an important part of our \nresponsibility here, as well as to make sure we not only address the \nurgency of the situation but also the responsibility we have not only \nto the people of Flint but to all of our constituencies.\n  Mr. President, if I could just conclude, and then I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the distinguished leader yield for a question? I \nhave been asking for the opportunity to ask a question, and I ask \nunanimous consent to ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Is the chair aware that the dollars we have asked for \nrequire a comprehensive plan from the State and that at this point only \n$28 million--most going to health--has been allocated to the State?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Through the Chair, I am aware that what you have \nrequired, as well as what we have been working on jointly, does require \nan action plan that describes the spend-down and how that would be \nallocated. It is my understanding that it will be very helpful to have \nthat analysis from the State. That will be forthcoming--hopefully, next \nweek.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to continue the discussion.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I know there are others waiting to \nspeak, and I will be brief. I want to take a couple of minutes to \nreflect on what just happened on the Senate floor.\n  We had a bipartisan bill that was shepherded through the Energy \nCommittee by the chair, Senator Murkowski, and the ranking member, \nSenator Cantwell. Because our colleagues from Michigan refused to take \nyes for an answer--objecting to a vote on their very amendment--the \nDemocratic caucus has come together and brought down this bipartisan \nbill--killing it, at least for the time being.\n  I share the majority leader's hope that discussions can continue and \ncooler, more reasonable minds will prevail, rather than just the \ngamesmanship that, frankly, frustrates all of us and gives Congress a \nbad name. We know that the vote that just went down was not about the \nEnergy bill. This was about trying to embarrass Republicans and to try \nto make us look bad and portray us as having no compassion for the poor \npeople of Flint--which is exactly the opposite of true.\n  The fact is that Senator Murkowski, who is the bill manager and \nchairman of the Energy Committee, made an offer for a vote on a $550 \nmillion package--a $550 million package. The Senator from Michigan has \nasked for a check for $600 million, but Senator Murkowski, in good \nfaith, trying to be responsible, offered them an alternative of a $550 \nmillion package, and they refused it, instead choosing to bring down \nthis legislation.\n  I think it is important to note that the State of Michigan has \nalready appropriated somewhere close to $37 million, including funds \nspecifically set aside for outside experts to conduct an infrastructure \nintegrity study. The fact is, the State of Michigan and the city of \nFlint don't yet know what they need to do to fix the problem or how \nmuch it will cost, and the Senators from Michigan come in here and say: \nWe don't need a plan. We just need cash\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\nupfront of $600 million. We want this added to the national debt--which \nis already $19 trillion.\n  I think the Senator from Alaska, the bill manager, made a very \nreasonable suggestion: Let the State and the city get started with the \nmoney that has been appropriated by the State, together with the tens \nof millions of dollars the Obama administration is making available to \nthe State of Michigan that can then be available to the city of Flint \nto get started, to do the infrastructure integrity study, to come up \nwith a plan. Then the Senators can come back to Congress--hopefully \nduring the regular appropriations process--and come up with a \nresponsible, shared plan for this local government, for the State \ngovernment, and for the Federal Government to help the poor people of \nFlint out of this terrible crisis.\n  Instead, what we seem to have found happening is, in the immortal \nwords of Rahm Emanuel--now the mayor of Chicago, formerly chief of \nStaff of the White House--never let a crisis go to waste. That is what \nis happening here. It is not responsible. It is not reasonable. And I \nthink Senator Murkowski's counteroffer to the demands of the Senators \nfrom Michigan demonstrates it is not even a good-faith effort to try to \nsolve the problem. It is just trying to put on a show vote and \nembarrass people.\n  We also need to understand that the Environmental Protection Agency \nbears significant responsibility. The Obama administration's \nEnvironmental Protection Agency failed the people of Flint when they \ndidn't act sooner. We heard that one Agency director has already \nresigned.\n  But let me be clear. There is no disagreement that we all want to \nwork together to help the people of Flint find a solution once we have \nmore information about the needs of the city and the State of Michigan \nand they know exactly what kind of help they need and in what amount. \nWhat we disagree on is that this bipartisan Energy bill should be held \nhostage until we know the solution. Frankly, that is beyond \nfrustrating. It is disappointing. It is not serving our constituents \nand the American people the way we should, in a responsible, \ncommonsense, bipartisan way. This is all about gamesmanship. This is \nall about ``gotcha.'' In other words, this is all about the things the \nAmerican people have come to loathe and hate about the political \nprocess in Washington, DC.\n  We can do better. We must do better. And I share the majority \nleader's wish that negotiations continue and that cooler, more sensible \nminds come together on solutions that we can perhaps agree to.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S647-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S647-S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, this is the fourth time I have come \nto the floor urging Senator Cruz to remove his hold on these very \nimportant nominees for two of our best allies, the countries of Sweden \nand Norway.\n  Norway has been without a confirmed ambassador for 860 days. As we \nknow, the first nominee withdrew, but many of these days have been \nfilled up by the second nominee, who is not controversial--Sam Heins \nfrom the State of Minnesota--who made it through the committee without \nobjection. In the case of Sweden, it has been 469 days since the \nPresident nominated Azita Raji to be ambassador.\n  There is no issue with these nominees. In fact, in the words of \nSenator Cotton from Arkansas, my Republican colleague, ``I believe both \n[nominees] are qualified . . . and we have significant interests in \nScandinavia. My hope is that both nominees receive a vote in the Senate \nsooner than later.'' We know we have the support of Senator Corker, the \nhead of the Foreign Relations Committee. We thank Senator Cardin for \nhis support. We thank Majority Leader McConnell. We thank Senator Reid.\n  This vote is not a controversial vote. Senator Cruz is not here to \nobject. We understand Senator Lee is here on his behalf. But I would \nlike to know why Senator Cruz isn't here to object. I think I know why \nhe isn't here to object--because he is in the State of my colleague \nSenator Shaheen.\n  We cannot hold up the business of the Senate like this. We have two \nnominees for two countries, the 11th and 12th biggest investors in the \nUnited States of America, Sweden and Norway. The country of Norway is \nthe purchaser of 52 Lockheed fighter planes, 22 just ordered at $200 \nmillion apiece, all made in Fort Worth, TX, the home State of Senator \nCruz.\n  These are allies who are taking in refugees by the thousands. These \nare allies who are at our side in the fight against Russia to stand up \nagainst their aggression in Ukraine. They have stood with us in the \nfight against Islamic extremism. They have stood with us in the fight \nagainst ISIS. And what do we say to them? You can have ambassadors from \nRussia or from China, you can have ambassadors from every country but \nnot from the United States of America.\n  I ask Senator Cruz and I ask his colleagues--or perhaps his staff to \nask him--why every other European nation of any major size has an \nambassador and why not these two Scandinavian countries.\n  So it is my hope--and the reasons for these holds are completely \nunrelated. They are varied. They are many. They change every day. I am \nhopeful that we are able to negotiate something because Senator Shaheen \nand I have pledged to come to the floor nearly every single day when \nthe Senate is in session to continue asking, and his colleagues are \ngoing to have to come and object on his behalf.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: the nomination \nof Samuel Heins to be Ambassador to the country of Norway, Calendar No. \n263; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination: the nomination of Azita Raji to be Ambassador to the \ncountry of Sweden, Calendar No. 148; that the Senate proceed to vote \nwithout intervening action or debate on the nomination; that if \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I see the Senator from New Hampshire \nis here. She is a leader on the Foreign Relations Committee. I know she \nhas a few things to say. But, again, we are simply asking for a vote. \nSenator Cruz can choose to be here or not. He can choose to vote or \nnot. He can choose to vote no if he wants. We know these two nominees \nwould pass because they are not controversial. I am tired of hearing \nfrom people in America and people who represent and live in these \ncountries: What is wrong with America? Why are you ``dissing'' us when \nwe stand by your side every day? This has to stop.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am joining my colleague, Senator \nKlobuchar, to talk not just about these two positions of Ambassadors to \nSweden and Norway but also about some of the other 27 nominees who deal \nwith national security issues.\n  As Senator Klobuchar said yesterday when we were on the floor, we \nsaid we were going to come down here every day. The Senate is not going \nto be in session every day, so we won't be here every day, but we will \nbe back as often as possible to point out that we need to confirm these \nnominees. It is in the country's national security interests.\n  The Presiding Officer serves with me on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, so she understands just how\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\ncritical it is that we have a team in place that can be part of the \nteam that protects this Nation.\n  As Senator Klobuchar said, Azita Raji has been waiting over a year \nsince she was nominated. She went through the Foreign Relations \nCommittee unanimously. Nobody objected. Sam Heins was nominated almost \na year ago. He is nominated to be U.S. Ambassador to Norway.\n  Again, this is not about just these two individuals; this is also \nabout the message we are sending to two of our best partners and \nallies, Sweden and Norway. Both of these countries have been part of \nthe anti-ISIL coalition fighting with us against the terrorists. Sweden \nhas been on the frontlines of the refugee crisis, taking in thousands \nof refugees in Europe. As we think about the strains that the European \nUnion is under right now, for us to have failed to put ambassadors in \ntwo of our most important allies is unforgiveable.\n  Yesterday I said it was in 1914 that Norway had to scramble their F-\n16 fighters. We know they didn't have F-16 fighters in 1914. It was \n2014. So a little over a year ago, Norway, which is a NATO ally, \nscrambled its F-16 fighters 74 times to intercept Russian warplanes.\n  As we think about the threats from Russian aggression, Sweden and \nNorway are right there. They are on the frontlines. Norway has \ncommitted to participate in NATO's missile defense system. So, again, \nit is very important as we are looking at our efforts to stop Russian \naggression.\n  Yesterday in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee we were talking \nabout the strains on Europe. We had witnesses for both the majority and \nthe minority who confirmed that our failure to move these nominees on \nthe Senate floor is ``an enormous issue,'' a ``disastrous policy,'' and \nsends the message that Washington does not ``care about European \nsecurity''--both minority and majority witnesses--even arguing that the \nUnited States does not have ``players on the field.''\n  Not only are there national security implications, but, as the \nSenator from Minnesota pointed out, vacancies in Sweden and Norway mean \nthat some $11.3 billion in U.S. exports lack a strong champion in-\ncountry.\n  I hope the Senator from Texas--who is out running for President--will \ncome back or will lift his hold so we can send the message that we \nshould be sending to our European allies about how important they are \nand how strongly we want to support what is happening in those \ncountries.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to move two other national \nsecurity nominees.\n  The first is Ambassador Tom Shannon. He has been nominated to be \nUnder Secretary of State for Political Affairs. Again, he has been \nwaiting 136 days since being nominated. He also went through the \nForeign Relations Committee without any opposition. He would be \nresponsible for working with Europeans on the implementation of the \nIran agreement, on coordinating the G7 to combat Russian aggression, as \nwell as providing daily oversight and direction to all the Department's \nregional bureaus.

Madam President, finally, I want to ask unanimous \nconsent to move Adam Szubin, who has been nominated to be Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes. He has also been waiting \nalmost a year. He is somebody who Senator Shelby, chairman of the \nBanking Committee, has said is eminently qualified, but the Banking \nCommittee still has not voted to move his nomination to the Senate \nfloor.\n  His position is very critical because he would lead the policy, \nenforcement, regulatory, and intelligence functions of the Treasury \nDepartment. They are aimed at identifying and disrupting the lines of \nfinancial support to international terrorist organizations to a whole \nrange of other bad actors.\n  Next week on the Senate floor we are supposed to take up sanctions on \nNorth Korea. How can we in good faith tell the American people we are \ngoing to enforce sanctions on North Korea when we haven't been willing \nto fill the position that is responsible for doing that enforcement? It \nbelies understanding that we are not going to move forward.\n  Again, this is a position that I know is supported by the Foreign \nRelations Committee. The Republican chair of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has been very supportive of moving Adam Szubin's nomination, \njust as he has been supportive of moving the two Ambassadors, of moving \nAmbassador Shannon.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about what we are \ndoing to ensure the national security of this country. It is \nunfortunate we have rules in the Senate that allow one person to hold \nthings up for an indefinite period of time when the national security \nof the country is at stake.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and the Banking Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of PN371, the nomination of Adam Szubin to be Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes; that the Senate proceed \nto its consideration and vote without intervening action or debate; \nthat if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to \nthe nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. On behalf of the senior Senator from Alabama, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Again, it is disappointing that the senior Senator from \nAlabama isn't here to talk about his concerns about Adam Szubin and why \nhe is still on hold in the Banking Committee and that we haven't heard \nfrom the majority leader in the Senate about the importance of moving \nnot only Adam Szubin's nomination but these other nominations that are \ncritical as we make sure we do what we need to, to protect this \ncountry.\n  I am disappointed, but as Senator Klobuchar said, we will be back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to chronicle for the Senate and \nto make a part of the Congressional Record that nearly 5,000 people \ngathered this morning for the annual National Prayer Breakfast with the \nPresident, members of the Cabinet, members of the Joint Chiefs, most of \nthe Diplomatic Corps, and a lot of the Members of Congress.\n  The national breakfast is sponsored by the Senate prayer group that \nmeets on Wednesday morning and the House\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\nprayer group that meets on Thursday morning. This year it was the \nHouse's turn to be the cochairs. We do have cochairs in the House and \nthe Senate prayer group, one from each party. In the case of the Senate \nprayer group, we were ably represented, as they spoke from the podium, \nby Senator Boozman of Arkansas and Senator Kaine of Virginia. They will \nbe the cochairmen of the breakfast next year.\n  It was the eighth time that President Obama has spoken. This Senator \nfeels it was the best speech at the Prayer Breakfast I have heard \nPresident Obama give. It was one of the best speeches that this \nSenator, after attending Prayer Breakfasts for over three decades, has \never heard. He quoted the Scriptures from the writings of Paul which \nsay that our faith can keep us from fear. The President illustrated \nthat throughout so much of his remarks.\n\n  During his closing remarks, he told a story that he had heard a week \nor so ago, and I wish to share that story here on the Senate floor. It \nwas about a U.S. Army sergeant whose entire unit had been captured by \nthe Nazis during World War II. While he was in the POW camp, a Nazi \ncolonel told the sergeant, who was the senior official: I want the \nnames of the Jewish soldiers in this unit, and I want them to report to \nme. The sergeant refused.\n  The Nazi colonel then decided to assemble all 200 of the sergeant's \ntroops in the POW camp in formation, with the sergeant at the head of \nthe formation. As the colonel approached him again, obviously trying to \nsingle out and take and probably try to annihilate the Jewish-American \nsoldiers, he again said, as all the troops were standing there in \nformation: Sergeant, I want to know who the Jews are. The sergeant \nreplied: Sir, we are all Jews. The colonel then took his pistol out of \nthe holster, cocked it, and put it to the head of the sergeant and made \nthe same demand again. The faith of that Christian sergeant overcame \nhis fear for he was looking out for his troops, and he repeated again: \nSir, we are all Jews. The Nazis backed down in that POW camp. The \nJewish soldiers were not revealed and, therefore, protected.\n  That was just one of the many stories that were recounted as the \nPresident gave what was an extraordinary conclusion for his last \nNational Prayer Breakfast as President. It is an occasion that so many \nof us join in on every Wednesday here as we come together and put aside \nour partisan, regional and any other differences that we have and are \nunified and joined in prayer. So I thought it fitting, the National \nPrayer Breakfast having just concluded, that I share this story with \nthe Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S649-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAKATA AIRBAGS\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, we have had quite a running story about \nthe maker of inflatable airbags, which are usually in the steering \nwheel of an automobile and also over on the passenger side. These \nairbags have saved countless lives. Yet what we have found is that a \nmanufacturer named Takata from Japan has consistently had different \nairbags under recall. Well, we just found out yesterday that another \none of the automobile manufacturers that uses Takata airbags has now \nhad a further recall just yesterday with 2.2 million of their vehicles. \nWhy? Because of defective airbags.\n  These bags are supposed to save lives, not harm and kill lives. Yet I \nremember the lady in Orlando who had a minor fender-bender collision in \nan intersection, and her air bag deployed. When the police got there, \nthey thought there was a homicide. Her neck was lacerated, and she bled \nto death. There is a fireman, also near Orlando, who will never be a \nfireman again because he lost his right eye after the explosion of the \nair bag. The airbag is defectively manufactured and explodes with such \nforce that the air bag becomes a hand grenade which explodes, and \npieces of shrapnel fly into the face of the driver or the passenger.\n  In the case of the lady in Orlando, her jugular was slashed and she \nwas killed. We have seen a score of these deaths around the country. \nThere was recently another one from a defective Takata airbag in South \nCarolina. There are now well over 20 million vehicles that have been \nrecalled.\n  I will be talking to the head of the National Highway Transportation \nSafety Administration and will be asking all of these questions about \nsafety, such as this: Why are we having the drip, drip, drip of recalls \nhere and recalls there? Why isn't this agency taking an aggressive \napproach and going after all of these inflaters?\n  It is expected that it is the explosive compound ammonium nitrate \nthat becomes extremely explosive when exposed to humidity and causes \nthe metal to shred and, therefore, go right into the very driver or the \npassenger it was intended to save.\n  This is a matter of grave concern, and now the latest news is that \nHonda has recalled over 2 million more vehicles nationwide. There have \nbeen over 20 million vehicles that have been recalled worldwide. We \nhave to get to the bottom of this and get those defective airbags out \nof the steering wheels of those cars and replace them with safe \nairbags.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would note for Members that we have \njust concluded the first cloture votes on the Energy Policy \nModernization Act. There has been some interesting discussion about \nwhere we are in the process and how we might find a path forward toward \ncompletion of this very important bipartisan measure--a measure that \nhas, I think, reflected good, strong work throughout the committee \nprocess and good, strong work throughout the floor process, but we have \nyet more work to do. Know that this Senator, along with the ranking \nmember on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is committed to \ndoing just that, along with the Senators from Michigan as well as many \non this side.\n  So I think the message to those who are wondering what is happening \nafter that noon vote--the word is that work is continuing, and I am \noptimistic about the outlook for the final passage of the Energy Policy \nModernization Act.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COOK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise with sadness to remark on the \npassing of an old friend, Kentucky's former U.S. Senator, Marlow W. \nCook. Senator Cook served in this Chamber for only a single term, but \nhis political impact in the Commonwealth of Kentucky was substantial. \nSo was his impact on my life.\n  Marlow Cook gave me my first real opportunity in politics. He gave me \na chance to be a State youth chairman in his successful campaign for \nthe U.S. Senate back in 1968. He also gave me an important opportunity \nin government. He won his election. I came to Washington with him, and \nI was what they called in those days chief legislative assistant. I \nthink the term we use now is legislative director. I worked for him for \n2 years. I recall that time very, very fondly. I can tell you that over \nthe years I remained extremely grateful for the opportunity he gave me \nto get started.\n  Marlow Cook was someone who proved that Republican success was \npossible in a Commonwealth at that time completely dominated by \nDemocrats. That was no easy task when he ran for office, but he \nsucceeded anyway. You might even say he sketched out a political \nblueprint for victory: launch an improbable campaign for\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\nJefferson County judge executive in your thirties and win, secure \nreelection, and then launch a bid for U.S. Senator. That is the \npolitical path Marlow Cook took, and that is the exact political path I \ntook as well.\n  Some might say the similarities end there or note that we haven't \nagreed on every issue in the years since, but what two people ever do? \nIt doesn't change my enduring gratitude for the opportunities Marlow \nCook brought to me. It certainly doesn't change my respect for him. \nThis is a man who enlisted in the Navy when his country called and when \nhe was still a teenager.\n  Marlow Cook served his country honorably in both the Atlantic and \nPacific theaters in World War II. He served his country honorably in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I should note that Marlow Cook was the first Roman Catholic elected \nto statewide office in Kentucky. Believe it or not, that was something \nof an issue back then. It is hard to imagine today.\n  One more thing. Marlow Webster Cook's impact was felt in the course \nof the Commonwealth's history in the shape of the riverfront in \nLouisville. He bought the Belle of Louisville, the sternwheeler that is \nstill going up and down the Ohio River today and is a particularly big \nthing during the Kentucky Derby week every year.\n  He had a huge impact on a lot of young Kentuckians, such as myself. I \nknew his family well. Nancy, his now widow, and his five kids were all \nrunning around during that campaign way back then.\n  I want to say to Nancy and all of Marlow and Nancy's kids how much we \nadmire him. Elaine and I are truly saddened by his loss. We are going \nto continue to remember this veteran, this extraordinary county \nofficial, and our United States Senator fondly. I am sure colleagues \nwill join me in that sentiment. I ask them also to join me in sending \nour best to all of Marlow's family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S650-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, last week I asked students and families \nto share with me their experiences with student loans and college \naffordability, and I want to start by sharing one of those stories. It \nis from a young woman named Rebeckah from my home State of Washington. \nWhen she was 18, Rebeckah signed up for student loans so she could go \nto college, and her parents took out what are called PLUS loans to help \ntheir daughter afford it. Rebeckah worked hard in college and graduated \nwith her degree. But now she is facing a mountain of student debt, and \nthat is preventing her and her partner from buying a house and starting \na family. Not only that, Rebeckah found out that her parents have been \ntaking money out of their retirement savings to pay off their PLUS \nloans, and they have even resorted to taking a lien out on their home \nto pay down the debt.\n  Rebeckah said when she enrolled in college, she was sure that getting \na good education would pay off. But now, with all the overwhelming \nstudent debt, it feels as if she signed her family up for financial \nruin.\n  When I hear stories like Rebeckah's, it is clear that college costs \nand student debt are holding families back. I consider it to be one of \nmy most important jobs as a Senator to make sure Washington State \nfamilies have a seat at the table and a voice in our Nation's Capital, \nand on an issue as important as this, I am going to make sure their \nvoices are heard loud and clear here in this Congress. I am going to \ncontinue to work with my fellow Democrats on ways to make college more \naffordable. I am going to keep fighting to reduce the crushing burden \nof student debt for so many families in my home State of Washington and \nacross the country.\n  Today, the yearly costs of tuition and room and board at a public 4-\nyear institution are 5\\1/2\\ times what they were in the early 1980s. \nThere are many reasons that colleges have gotten more and more \nexpensive, but the result has been the same. It has strained the \nbudgets of middle-class families across the country, and, in some \ncases, it prevents students from even applying and has forced many \nothers to drop out before they ever earn a degree. With skyrocketing \ncollege costs, we are sending the message that college is reserved for \nthe wealthiest few and not for middle-class families and those who want \nto get there.\n  We have all heard the numbers of student debt. Overall, Americans \nhold more than $1.3 trillion in student loan debt. That is a huge \nnumber, and it is actually a little hard to wrap your head around, so \nlet's try this: Every second that goes by, student debt in our country \ngrows by nearly $3,000. That is every second. And behind those numbers \nare people who invested in themselves by furthering their education but \nare now saddled with debt, preventing them from buying a home or even \nstarting a small business or a family.\n  A young man from Washington State named Alex told me his income \nbarely covers his monthly expenses, let alone paying down his student \nloans. He says he feels financially stagnant because ``I don't know if \nI will ever overcome the crippling college debt.''\n  I am glad that Democrats have a plan to help students and families \nwho are in the red. When more students are able to further their \neducation, it doesn't help just them. A highly educated workforce helps \nour economy grow from the middle out, not from the top down, and it \nstrengthens the workforce we will need to compete and lead the world in \nthe 2lst century economy. That is why Democrats want to give students \nthe chance they need to attend community college tuition free.\n  Of course, many students and families take out student loans to help \nthem finance higher education, but some are locked in with a high \ninterest rate. Today, you can find offers to refinance your mortgage at \n3.5 percent or your car loan for around 3.2 percent. I have heard from \nmany borrowers who are paying an interest rate that is twice that \namount, and some are paying even more.\n  Democrats want to make sure that borrowers can refinance their \nstudent loans at today's lower rates. We also want to hold the \ninstitutions of higher education accountable for providing a high-\nquality degree so students have confidence that the education they \nreceive and pay for will get them ahead. Democrats want to increase \ninvestments in need-based aid, such as Pell grants, so students can \nkeep up with the rising cost of college.\n  It has been just one week since I asked students and families to \nsubmit their stories online to us, and I want to hear from many more \nbecause I know there are so many people out there who are struggling. \nBut I must admit, I was taken aback by the constant theme that showed \nup in so many of the experiences that I have seen so far. I heard story \nafter story from people who said they felt hopeless. They feel buried \nunder student debt, and they see no end in sight. It shouldn't have to \nbe this way. Democrats are offering solutions, and I sincerely hope our \nRepublican friends will join us.\n  For me, this isn't just another issue; this is really personal. When \nI was young, my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Within a few \nshort years, he couldn't work any longer, and without warning, my own \nfamily had fallen on hard times. My brothers and sisters and I--and I \nhave six brothers and sisters--were all able to afford to go to college \nwith the help of what we now call Pell grants, and my mom was able to \nget the skills she needed to get a better paying job through a worker \ntraining program at Lake Washington Vocational School. This country was \nthere for us and never turned its back on my family.\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\n  Today, we can't turn our backs on the millions of families just like \nmine who need a path forward to pay back their student debt. These \nstudents want to stay in school to finish their degree even as the \ncosts go up, and they want to one day be able to save up so their kids \ncan afford to pursue their dreams.\n  It is time to make college more affordable and make sure students can \ngraduate without the crushing burden of student debt. It is time for \nDemocrats and Republicans to work together on solutions, and it is time \nto reaffirm that, in our country, earning your degree will pay off for \nyou, your future, and the future of this country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, not surprisingly, the talks that are \ncommonly known as Geneva III, in an effort to stop the ongoing genocide \ntaking place in Syria, have now been ``suspended.''\n  I quote from this morning's Washington Post: ``Syrian peace talks are \nsuspended before they even really begin.''\n  That should surprise no one. The fact is that the situation on the \nground, thanks to our total lack of a coherent strategy or even a \nserious effort, has resulted in Russian airstrikes, ensuring Bashar al-\nAssad's continued strength. Along with the Iranians, along with \nHezbollah that the Iranians have brought in from Lebanon--they all have \ngiven the overwhelming majority position to Bashar Assad, who is not \nabout to leave office with the advantage he has now obtained on the \nbattlefield, to a large degree because of Russian airstrikes that are \nrelentless and that have mostly targeted the Western-backed opposition \nto Bashar Assad's rule. Those airstrikes, according to the Washington \nPost, have proven sufficient to push beyond doubt any likelihood that \nAssad will be removed from power by the nearly 5-year-old revolt \nagainst his rule.\n  The gains on the ground are also calling into question whether there \ncan be meaningful negotiations to end the conflict Assad and his allies \nnow seem convinced they can win.\n  Let's go back about 4 years. Bashar Assad was about to fall. The \nPresident of the United States said that it is not a matter of whether \nBashar Assad will fall, it is a matter of when. All the momentum was on \ntheir side.\n  At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the Secretary of \nDefense--then Leon Panetta--said that the departure of Bashar Assad was \n``inevitable.'' And then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said \nit was inevitable that Bashar Assad will leave.\n  So a policy which was doomed to failure--rejecting a no-fly zone, \nrejecting robust training and equipping of those who were seeking to \nstop the slaughter--has now resulted in what many now view as an \ninternational crisis; that is, the refugee problem where millions of \nrefugees are flowing into European countries not just from Syria but \nprimarily from Syria, Iraq, and other countries as far away as \nAfghanistan. So everyone--especially our European friends--is moaning, \nand their hearts go out and they are trying to accommodate this.\n  This is not the cause of the problem; this is the result of a failure \nof American leadership, a feckless American leadership, and a Secretary \nof State--this Geneva Convention is not the first or the second but the \nthird time--this is the third time our Secretary of State has convened \na whole bunch of people in five-star hotels in Geneva, where, of \ncourse, the result has been nonexistent because the facts on the ground \nfavor Bashar Assad, the Russians, and Hezbollah.\n  So what has happened? Now, for the first time since 1973, when Anwar \nSadat threw the Russians out of Egypt, the Russians now have a major \nrole to play in the Middle East. They now have protected their base at \nLatakia. They now are conducting airstrikes in an indiscriminate \nfashion against--guess who--not ISIS but against the moderates who were \nfighting to overthrow Bashar Assad, while our Secretary of State calls \nhim up, has conversations with him, begs them to start peace talks, et \ncetera. And it goes on.\n  I think sometimes we all get a little numb, but we shouldn't be numb. \nWe shouldn't be numb to 250,000 killed and slaughtered, chemical \nattacks that indiscriminately kill men, women, and children. These \nRussian airstrikes are pervasive in the areas where the moderate \nopposition exists, and they are using what we call dumb bombs--not the \nprecision bombs--slaughtering hundreds of innocent men, women, and \nchildren. Places are surrounded where people are starving to death, and \nour Secretary of State calls for another meeting in Geneva. It is \nabsolutely remarkable.\n  I wish to point out again that according to the Washington Post \nstory, Secretary of State John F. Kerry scrambled to rearrange his \nThursday schedule after de Mistura--that is the U.N. guy--decided to \ndelay the talks. The article states:\n\n       ``The continued assault by Syrian regime forces--enabled by \n     Russian airstrikes--against opposition-held areas, as well as \n     regime and allied militias' continued besiegement of hundreds \n     of thousands of civilians, have clearly signaled the \n     intention to seek a military solution rather than enable a \n     political one,''. . . .\n       Kerry repeated demands made by the opposition groups as \n     preconditions for negotiations. . . . [but] both the \n     opposition and human rights organizations have cited an \n     increase in Russian bombing over the past several days that \n     they said has targeted civilian areas, including camps for \n     displaced persons in the western part of the country.\n       Russia maintains that it is only bombing ``terrorists,'' \n     but its definition of that word includes parts of the \n     opposition that has been fighting a civil war against Syrian \n     President Bashar al-Assad for more than four years, whose \n     representatives are among those on the opposition negotiating \n     team in Geneva.\n\n  How can we expect them to negotiate while the Russian airstrikes are \nintensified? How can we possibly expect something positive to happen, \nwhen clearly the momentum and the strength is on the side of the \nRussians, the Iranians, and Bashar Assad?\n  Friends, this is another chapter in American history of humiliation \nand a failure of leadership. Of course, all of that is no better \nepitomized and symbolized than by what happened when the Iranians \ncaptured two American vessels that happened to stray into their \nterritorial waters. Everybody should know that when a ship goes into \nanother country's territorial waters, the first thing to be done is to \ngo out and guide them out of it. It is against international law to \ntake them at gunpoint all over the world but particularly--all over the \nMiddle East is the picture of American servicemen and one woman on \ntheir knees with Iranian Revolutionary Guards holding their automatic \nweapons on them. This is an incredible act of arrogance and a \nhumiliation for our American sailors.\n  What is the most aggravating is the response by the administration \nafter this totally unlawful action and humiliation of American \nservicemembers and sailors. The response by the administration was--and \nI am not making this up--White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said \nthat the sailors were offered ``the proper courtesy that you would \nexpect.'' Being held at gunpoint on their knees with their hands behind \ntheir neck is, in the words of the White House Press Secretary, ``the \nproper courtesy that you would expect.''\n  The Secretary of State, John Kerry, offered his ``gratitude to \nIranian authorities for their cooperation in swiftly resolving this \nmatter.'' That is the American Secretary of State after a gross \nviolation of international law. Our American servicemen are put on \ntheir knees by a bunch of two-bit Iranians.\n  Vice President Joe Biden described the incident as ``standard \nnautical practice.'' The Vice President of the United States says that \nwhen you put Americans on their knees and point\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nweapons at them with evil intention, that is standard nautical \npractice. What planet has the Vice President of the United States been \non?\n  Now, to cap it all off, this week the Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei \npinned the Order of Fat'h Medal to the chests of those who mistreated \nand humiliated American personnel. These people were given awards and \nmedals by the Ayatollah Khamenei. The Obama administration has still \nfailed to condemn Iran's behavior for what it was, a violation of \ninternational law and centuries of maritime tradition. According to a \nrecent article in the Navy Times, legal experts all agree that this \nhostile incident represents a gross violation of international law.\n  So I ask my friend from South Carolina: Is there any explanation that \ncould possibly be understood about this act, a violation of \ninternational law and the humiliation of American servicemembers? There \nis only one reason; that is, they don't want to upset the Iranians. \nThey don't want to disturb the $100 billion or so that is going to the \nIranians as we speak while they buy weapons and toys all over Europe.\n  So here we have now seen American service personnel put on their \nknees with guns to their heads, and the most important people in our \ngovernment praised the Iranians for their actions. I would ask my \nfriend, how else could you explain--not passivity, but--the absolute \nendorsement by the Vice President of the United States and the \nSecretary of State for this kind of humiliating behavior?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to Senator McCain, I think it is a disconnection \nfrom reality--trying to shape a reality that does not exist.\n  Can you imagine your good friend Ronald Reagan, if he had been \nPresident, what the Iranians would have done?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I remind our colleague that some of our colleagues \nrecall that the day Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President of the \nUnited States, the hostages that were being held from our Embassy in \nIran came home.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is about lack of respect for the Obama \nadministration, John Kerry, and everybody else in our government. The \nIranians did this, Senator McCain, I think for one reason--to show the \nregion they are not intimidated by the United States.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Or that they can intimidate the United States----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right, that they can test our resolve. They do it all the \ntime. They fired two missile tests in violation of existing U.N. \nresolutions. The Obama administration did nothing about it. They \ncaptured two boats. These are lightly armored naval vessels with two \n50-caliber machine guns. One of them became disabled and they drifted \ninto Iranian waters. The Iranians reacted as if it was some kind of \ninvasion by America. They humiliated these sailors.\n  Instead of standing up for our naval personnel, basically we thanked \nthe Iranians for being so nice to people that they captured at gunpoint \nin violation of international law, but it goes to a deeper point. The \nIranians are letting everybody in the region know they are not changing \ntheir behavior with this nuclear deal: Don't mistake us having a \nnuclear agreement with a behavior change.\n  The Ayatollah and his henchmen are still in charge. They are not part \nof a family of nations. Since the deal has been signed, they fired \nmissiles in violation of international resolutions, they are on the \nground helping the ``Butcher of Damascus,'' Iranians are still the \nlargest state sponsor of terrorism, and this is just the cherry on top \nof all that misbehavior.\n  One thing I do want to talk about--and I will get your view of this \nbecause you are so knowledgeable. Syria has literally held on, and \n250,000 people have been slaughtered in Syria by Bashar Assad and his \nregime. Those people who took to the streets during the Arab Spring in \nDamascus were from all different backgrounds and different sects. They \nwanted to live in a country not run by Assad in such a brutal fashion. \nHis response to their plea for better transparency, democracy, and \neconomic opportunity was literally to shoot them down.\n  Now we have an all-out war in Syria. The radical Islamic groups have \nmoved into Syria. The caliphate headquarters of ISIL is in Syria. It \nhas been the biggest misjudgment since Munich by this administration. \nThey had Assad on the ropes 3 or 4 years ago and they didn't act, and \nwhat you see today is a result of a failure to act.\n  What I find astonishing is that the Syrian people, who are being \nslaughtered by the thousands, are being asked by the U.S. Government to \nsit down with Assad and negotiate an end to this war. The Russians and \nIranians are all-in for Bashar Assad. The people we have trained to \nreplace Assad have been killed by the Russian President. Our President \nhasn't lifted a finger. Now we have a Secretary of State basically \nbrowbeating the Syrian opposition to go to Geneva and enter into peace \ntalks with Bashar Assad, who is in full control of his part of Syria. I \ncan't believe we would do this to the Syrian people. The Syrian \nopposition called Senator McCain--this says a lot about you, my friend. \nThey were calling Senator McCain to pass on a message: You have been \nour best friend. We are not going to sit down and talk with Assad until \nthe U.N. resolutions calling for his removal have been honored.\n  Our government wants a deal in Syria--regardless of the quality of \nit--to say they stopped the war on their watch. They are now asking the \nSyrian people basically to kowtow to the man who has killed their \nfamilies.\n  This deal with Iran is a nightmare for the region. You give the \nIranian Ayatollah a pathway to a bomb, even if he doesn't cheat, a \nmissile to deliver the bomb, and money to pay for it all. Now they want \nto take the same negotiating team into Syria and lock into place Bashar \nAssad's regime, which has slaughtered the Syrian people, give the \nRussians and Iranians a foothold in Damascus through negotiations that \nthey could never have dreamed of a year ago.\n  I ask Senator McCain, what do you think the consequence would be of \nany peace agreement as long as the Russians and Iranians are supporting \nAssad and we are indifferent to the Syrian opposition in terms of their \nmilitary needs?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is very possible that the Secretary of State \nwill call another gathering in Geneva. After all, this is only the \nthird. He has another year, and maybe we will have Geneva IV and V.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What leverage do we have over Assad?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is the point. There is no leverage, I say to my \ncolleague. Meanwhile, while the Secretary of State is pressuring the \nFree Syria forces and threatening to cut off assistance to them, Russia \nis escalating their bombing campaign and continues the slaughter of \ninnocent people. Meanwhile, there are also enclaves around Aleppo and \nother places where people are literally starving to death--literally \nstarving to death. There are pictures, my friends, on the Internet, if \nyou would like to see it.\n  What does our Secretary of State do? He calls Lavrov. He calls Lavrov \nand complains. Lavrov, of course--it would be very interesting to know \nwhat is going through Mr. Lavrov's mind--but it is very clear that the \nSecretary of State is a supplicant, and this incredibly weak economy, \nwith a brutal dictator in charge, is now achieving goals that have been \nage-old ambitions of the Russians. They are now playing a major role in \nthe Middle East.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask Senator McCain, may I read to you an exchange?\n  This is John Kerry 2 days ago:\n\n       ``[T]here will be a ceasefire,'' Kerry predicted Tuesday in \n     Rome. ``We expect a ceasefire. And we expect an adherence to \n     the ceasefire. And we expect full humanitarian access.''\n       Two days later, the Russian bombing hasn't stopped and \n     thousands of Syrians remain starving.\n\n  Not only has the Russian bombing continued, Putin has sent in \nadvanced fighter jets to do the bombing.\n\n       Kerry said he was assured by the Russian counterpart \n     [Lavrov] the Russians would stop bombing.\n\n  When asked, Lavrov said, ``Russia's strikes will not cease. . . . I \ndon't see why these air strikes should be stopped.''\n  Whom is he talking to? The Russians are telling John Kerry to his \nface: We are going to keep bombing. John Kerry keeps telling the world \nthey are going to stop bombing. In the meantime, Syrians are being \nslaughtered and starved\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\nto death and we are fiddling while Syria burns.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to mention one other aspect of this with my \ncolleague, and that is the refugee issue.\n  It is surprising to many people in the world, this flood of millions \nof refugees, not just from Iraq and Syria but Iraq and even as far away \nas Afghanistan. Our European friends have treated it like maybe it was \nan earthquake or flood or natural disaster. It was not a natural \ndisaster. It was a natural occurrence when the situation became so \nterrible that people believed they couldn't stay and live where they \nwere.\n  Why did that happen? Because we watched the Russians, Bashar Assad, \nHezbollah, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard--we watched them commit \nall of this slaughter in Syria. No one can live in Syria today without \nfear for their very lives, unless they happen to be one of Bashar \nAssad's allies.\n  So now we have this huge refugee immigration crisis, which sooner or \nlater we are going to have to be involved in, in some way or another, \nand it is a result of the failed policies of this President of the \nUnited States.\n  This President sat by and watched the chemical weapons use. This \nPresident refused to keep a sustaining force in Iraq. This President, \nwhen asked by his Secretary of State, his Secretary of Defense, and the \nhead of the CIA to provide a safe zone turned it down. I still say to \nmy colleague--and I would be interested in his views--that we still \ncould establish a safe zone in Syria, where these people could go, we \ncould protect them, and they wouldn't have to leave and flood Europe \nand eventually try to come to the United States of America.\n  That would be the best thing we could do in the short term, and this \nPresident refuses to do it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, let's get a little closer to the region. John \nMcCain and Lindsey Graham have been saying for 3 years now that if we \ndon't end the war in Syria--which means requiring the Islamic State, or \nISIL, to be destroyed with a ground component and not by the air \nalone--we are going to get hit here at home and a Paris-style attack is \ncoming our way. This strategy to destroy ISIL will never work. \nPresident Obama is trying to pass it on to the next the President. We \nhave been begging the President to change his strategy in Iraq and \nSyria before we get hit here at home.\n  Another casualty of the war in Syria is the neighborhood itself. \nThere are more Syrian children going to primary schools in Lebanon than \nLebanese children. Our friends in Lebanon are being overrun by Syrian \nrefugees because of the Hell-on-Earth nature of Syria.\n  But one of our best allies in the entire world is the King of Jordan. \nLet me tell you what he has experienced as a result of us as a nation \nallowing Syria to fall completely apart. This was yesterday:\n\n       The leader of a key U.S. ally in the Middle East warned \n     Tuesday that his country [Jordan] is so packed with Syrian \n     refugees, many with ties to the Islamic State terror group, \n     that his nation has reached a ``boiling point.''\n       Sooner or later, I think, the dam is going to burst.\n\n  The bottom line is I have been saying this for 2 years now, along \nwith Senator McCain: If you don't end this war in Syria, one of the \nvictims is going to be the King of Jordan. And the King of Jordan says \nthat our welcoming nature has to come to an end.\n  Here is the lay of the land. Jordan cannot take any more. Lebanon is \noverrun. The Europeans are pushing back, and you are going to create a \nprocess where people in Syria have no place to go unless we help them. \nThey are going to be slaughtered. They are in between ISIL and Assad. \nWhat we are suggesting is to create a safe haven inside of Syria where \nthey can go without being killed, raped, and murdered so they don't \nhave to go to Lebanon, Jordan, Europe or the United States.\n  If John Kerry and Barack Obama do not change their approach to Syria, \nSyria is going to be the catalyst for a meltdown in the Middle East. \nTheir approach is going to allow the Iranians to control Damascus. Any \ndeal done in Geneva under these circumstances is going to have one \ncertain outcome: The Russians and the Iranians are going to win, and \nthe Syrian people are going to lose. If we don't destroy the caliphate \nwith a ground component soon--not just from the air--we are going to \nget hit here at home. The center of the caliphate is in Syria. If we \ndon't bring this war to an end soon by getting rid of ISIL and Assad--\nwhich would require both to end the war--Lebanon and Jordan are going \nto fall.\n  So to the Obama administration, when you were Senators, you really \ntook it to President Bush. He made his fair share of mistakes, but at \nleast he corrected them. Senator Obama and Senator Kerry both opposed \nthe surge in Iraq.\n  On President Obama's watch, he was handed an Iraq that was becoming \nsecure and that was on a glidepath to stability, and he chose to \nwithdraw all of our troops--against sound military advice--to fulfill a \npolitical promise. Three years ago, at the urging of Senator McCain and \nmyself, we had Bashar al-Assad on the ropes. His entire national \nsecurity team advised President Obama to arm the Free Syrian Army while \nthey were intact. That would have been the end of Assad, and Syria \nwould be in the process of healing itself. But President Obama said no \nto his entire national security team. He drew a redline against Assad a \ncouple of years ago and said: If you use chemical weapons, I will act. \nAssad used chemical weapons, and nothing of consequence happened. Assad \nis still in power. He will be in power when Obama leaves.\n  In the meantime, Russia has introduced itself in the Middle East \nunlike at any time since the early 1970s.\n  Now the Iranians are on the ground, fully behind Assad. The balance \nof power has shifted. Assad is in a good place. The Syrian people are \nin a lousy, terrible, horrible place. John Kerry and Barack Obama's \nforeign policy is in free fall.\n  I will make a prediction--and I hope I am wrong--that if they don't \nchange their policies toward Syria, the region is going to have an \nimbalance that we have never seen in our lifetime. An attack against \nthis homeland is coming. It is coming from Syria. It is being planned \nas I speak. We didn't know exactly what they were trying to do before \n9/11, but we were worried that we were going to get attacked by Al \nQaeda.\n  I can tell you exactly where the attack is coming from. It is coming \nfrom Raqqa, Syria. It is being planned while I speak. Every day the \ncaliphate is allowed to exist is another day of danger and peril for \nthe United States.\n  So if President Obama and John Kerry do not change their policies to \ndestroy the caliphate sooner rather than later, we will be hit here at \nhome. If we don't get Syria in a better spot soon, Jordan and Lebanon \nare going to be victims of this war.\n  To Senator McCain, I just wish to end with that thought.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me make a couple of additional points and then we \nwill yield the floor.\n  To go back, these refugees are putting a strain on Europe that may \nbasically lead to the dissolution of the European Union. You cannot \nhave so many thousands--tens of thousands or more people--flood into a \ncountry with which they are totally unfamiliar without there being some \nproblems there. So the very fabric of the EU may be tested here.\n  But one of the things I want to mention to my friend is that the \napologists for the Obama Administration have constantly and \npersistently pursued a dishonest line of interpretation of history, and \nthat is that after the surge was won--and it is a fact--at great \nsacrifice, at enormous sacrifice we had Iraq stable. The attacks were \ndown. The Shiite militias were repressed. The battle of Fallujah had \nbeen won at great cost. There was a bright future that could lie ahead \nfor Iraq, but it required a continuing American presence. That was an \nabsolute necessity. It was the same reason why we didn't leave Korea \nafter the Korean war, the same reason why we haven't left Bosnia, and \nthe same reason why we didn't leave Germany or Japan.\n  But the apologists in the liberal media--and we all know who they \nare--are saying: Oh, they couldn't stay because they didn't have a \nstatus of forces agreement through the Iraqi Parliament and it couldn't \nbe done. That absolutely made it impossible for us to say.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, could I interject?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We couldn't have troops on the ground because Iraqis said \nno. Do we have troops on the ground today, I ask Senator McCain?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is the point. Now we have at least 3,500 troops on \nthe ground in Iraq.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Where is the Parliament?\n  Mr. McCAIN. We don't have a status of forces agreement. Their \nParliament has not endorsed it. Where are our liberal friends on the \nother side? Aren't they concerned that there isn't a status of forces \nagreement and we continue to incrementally--a classic example of \nmission creep--gradually increase our presence more and more.\n  Actually--and I don't use this line very often but these apologists, \nparticularly in the liberal media, the so-called commentators--they are \nlying. They are lying when they say that we couldn't keep a sustaining \nforce there. We could, and we could have done it without the approval \nof their Parliament, including the fact that we have troops in a number \nof other countries where their Parliaments haven't approved a specific \nstatus of forces agreement. So it is really aggravating.\n  But the reason why they tell this lie is because if it were really a \nfact that at great sacrifice we had stabilized Iraq and it had a bright \nfuture at that time, their calls for a complete withdrawal and the \nPresident's announcement that the last combat soldier had left Iraq--\nremember that? Remember that one of his underlings said: We are leaving \nbehind the most stable, prosperous, democratic Iraq in history. That \nwas the statement. I think it was Blinken or one of those guys. It was \ngreat.\n  We have gotten everybody out of Iraq, just as the President promised \nwhen he ran for President of the United States. But leading from behind \ndoesn't work. Just because you leave a conflict, that does not mean the \nconflict is over.\n  Again, this morning, they are trying to make that same mistake in \nAfghanistan, although I pray they have learned that they cannot go to \nwhat the President originally announced--that they would go to an \nembassy specific force of about 1,000. The question is how many and \nwhat their missions will be.\n  So I think it is important to emphasize that this did not have to \nhappen. If we had kept that stabilizing force behind, you would never \nhave had Baghdadi break off from Al Qaeda and move to Syria and seeing \nthe things we are seeing today.\n  I am afraid my friend from South Carolina is right. In fact, I know \nhe is right. There will be further attacks on the United States of \nAmerica and Europe because it is inevitable. When Mr. Baghdadi controls \na large piece of geography from which he can train, equip, motivate, \nand send people out to commit acts of terror, that will happen, and the \nresponsibility will lay at the doorstep of Barack Obama and his \nminions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I could, just to wrap this up, I wish we were wrong. \nWhen the President decided to withdraw all troops from Iraq against \nsound military advice, we cautioned--literally begged--the President \nand the Vice President. We went to Baghdad itself to try to help with \nthis problem. I remember saying that I think all hell will break loose \nbecause this is so irresponsible. Iraq is in a good spot, but if we \nleave now, it will all fall apart. I hope I am wrong. Well, we weren't \nwrong.\n  When the Syrian people took to the streets to demand more freedom and \nour response was to ignore their plea, when the people of Iran went to \nthe streets and the Ayatollah shot them down and our President said \nthat he didn't want to discuss negotiations with the regime, when Assad \nhad his back to the wall and President Obama declined to take good \nadvice to arm the Free Syrian Army and the people of Syria to get rid \nof their dictator, all the things that Senator McCain and I have \npredicted have come true.\n  The point of being here today is that the worst is yet to come and, \nGod, I hope I am wrong because this is what I think is going to happen. \nI think there is going to be an attack on our country that is being \nplanned as I speak, coming from Syria. If we went on the ground in the \nregion--not 100,000 U.S. troops but mostly people from the region with \nsome of us--we could destroy the caliphate and we could disrupt their \nplans against our homeland, but we are not doing that.\n  If we don't change our strategy regarding Syria, we are going to lose \none of the best allies America has ever had, and that is the Kingdom of \nJordan, because it is being overrun by refugees. The whole seam of the \nMiddle East is splitting wide open.\n  I will say this. Everybody makes mistakes--Bush, Lindsey Graham, and \nJohn McCain. The key is to adjust. The problem I have with this \nadministration is that they seem unable and unwilling to adjust. If \nthey don't change their strategy, we are all going to regret it. As bad \nas it is today, the worst is yet to come.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I just add one other point to my friend from South \nCarolina?\n  The President is very good at setting up straw men. He says that we \nonly have two choices--to send in a couple of hundred thousand troops \nor to do nothing. Neither Lindsey Graham or I or any smart person I \nknow are advocating that.\n  What we are advocating is about a 10,000 American force providing the \ncapabilities of ISR training, forward air controllers and others, with \na large contingent of Arab countries that would then move to Raqqa on \nthe ground with the use of American air power.\n  Please do not be fooled by this constant barrage of untruths that are \nbeing said about those of us that we want to send in hundreds of \nthousands. We do not. This has to be an Arab coalition with the United \nStates a small part of it, and, by the way, have them pay for it as \nwell. With the proper American leadership and commitment and \ncredibility, which is totally absent now in the region, that could be \ndone. Otherwise, we will fight them there or we will fight them here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The senior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S654-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S654-S655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had planned to be in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee today, debating and pushing for passage of the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. Unfortunately, the markup was \npostponed. I wish it had not been. So I hope next week we can make \nprogress on this important bill. We have a need for this legislation, \nand we also need the money for it. Senator Shaheen has an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill. These are actually both urgent \nmatters.\n  States such as mine, Vermont, and our neighboring State of New \nHampshire have been deeply affected by this wave of addiction. The \nmedia has covered this very personal and ravaging epidemic as never \nbefore. We have seen a transformation in how we talk about this issue \nand the need for solutions. It used to be that if you had a drug \nproblem, they would bring in the police to straighten it out. We have \nremoved the stigma of drug addiction, but we need more than talk. I \nhave visited many of these communities. They are devastated by this \nepidemic and need resources for prevention and treatment. It is time \nfor Congress to act.\n  For years I have been convening field hearings and sitting at kitchen \ntables, listening to Vermonters discuss innovative approaches to \nconfront drug abuse and related crimes. I have also sat at kitchen \ntables and listened to tragic stories about a member of the family who \nhad been hit with opioid addiction. What I have heard in the meetings I \nhave had with the police, doctors, family members, faith community, and \neducators is that we cannot arrest or jail our way out of this problem. \nWe have lost the war on drugs--if we were ever winning it--because we \nrelied primarily on unnecessarily harsh sentencing laws.\n  I spent 8 years in law enforcement, and I know that law enforcement \npractices will always play an important role. That is why I have worked \nto secure funding for State-led, anti-heroin task forces. But if we \nwant to find lasting solutions to these problems, we have to identify \nand support effective\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\nprevention, treatment, and recovery programs. CARA does just that. This \nlegislation would support innovative, evidence-based solutions--best \npractices that are already showing great progress in States like mine.\n  We need to do all we can to prevent and treat the abuse of \nprescription opioids. I have pushed for years to have the FDA promote \nsafer alternatives to powerful prescription pain killers and to remove \nfrom the market the older, less safe drugs. The FDA's announcement to \nexpand access to abuse-deterrent formulations of these powerful drugs \nis a step in the right direction in response to my concerns, but the \nFDA can and must do more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe April 28, 2014, Leahy-Blumenthal letter to the FDA Commissioner.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2014.\n     Hon. Margaret A. Hamburg,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, \n         MD.\n       Dear Commissioner Hamburg: We are writing to urge the \n     expedited review of New Drug Applications for abuse-deterrent \n     formulations of single-entity hydrocodone products. Zohydro \n     ER was the first pure hydrocodone product to receive FDA \n     market approval. The drug was approved despite lacking any \n     abuse-deterrent properties and over strong objections from \n     the FDA's own independent advisory committee. We share the \n     concerns of the many governors and state attorneys general \n     who believe this powerful drug is all but certain to \n     exacerbate our nation's addiction to opioid analgesics, which \n     results in tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year.\n       Given their potency and ease of abuse, we have little doubt \n     that pure opioid products may lead more Americans to \n     addiction, some even to heroin. The FDA has already \n     recognized the heightened risks of overdose and death with \n     Zohydro ER, even at recommended doses. Drug developers \n     continue to seek regulatory approval for other easy to abuse \n     opioids, such as Moxduo IR. To the extent that pure opioid \n     products fill a necessary niche in responsible pain \n     management practices, the FDA must now take all available \n     measures to ensure that patients are soon provided safer \n     alternatives. This process begins by prioritizing review of \n     abuse-deterrent formulations. Such formulations are much more \n     difficult to crush or dissolve, two preferred methods of \n     abuse.\n       As safer, abuse-deterrent opioids are approved, the FDA \n     should act swiftly to remove any older, less safe versions. \n     In the past, it has taken up to three years for the FDA to \n     ban products that lack abuse-deterrent properties when a \n     safer equivalent exists. Americans should not have to wait \n     this long with Zohydro ER.\n       We also request that the FDA brief our staff on your plans \n     to monitor the use of Zohydro ER, including what metrics will \n     be used to potentially reevaluate its status as an approved \n     drug if widespread problems develop. We also ask that you \n     share your planned efforts to curb prescription drug abuse \n     generally, including the development and approval of \n     effective non-opioid painkillers that may finally break the \n     cycle of opioid addiction. Each year, the opioid epidemic \n     seeps into more communities and takes more lives. We are \n     eager to learn how we can assist the FDA to finally get ahead \n     of this scourge.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. We look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Blumenthal,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am also concerned that rural communities are in \ndesperate need of the lifesaving drug naloxone so that opioid overdoses \ncan be stopped. I have heard from law enforcement officers and grateful \nfamilies what a miracle this drug can be, so we need to make sure we \nhave it supplied where it can literally save lives. I have had police \nofficers tell me that they arrived at a scene with an overdose, and \nbecause they had that with them, they saved the life of the person. If \nthey had not had it, the person would have been dead by the time the \nambulance arrived.\n  In Vermont, we have seen a 65 percent increase in the number of \nVermonters getting treatment for their addiction over the past 2 years. \nThis is encouraging progress and reflects the fact that our Governor \nand also State legislators of both parties have stepped up. But we know \nthat there are hundreds more who are on waiting lists, and patients in \nthe very rural corners of my State travel hours just to get their \nmedication. We need to do more about this real threat to our \ncommunities.\n  I am very proud to cosponsor Senator Shaheen's emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. I want to be able to fund additional public health \noutreach, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement efforts. We have \npassed much larger emergency supplemental bills to address swine flu \nand Ebola. We passed huge supplemental bills on Ebola when we did not \nhave a single case of Ebola originate here in the United States. We \nwere worried about it coming in, but it did not originate here. But \nhere, we have tens of thousands in the Presiding Officer's State, in my \nState, and in every other State. We have to take the health epidemic \nalready in our communities just as seriously as we did those diseases \nthat did not originate on our shores.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy and Mr. Franken pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2506 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the first week of February, and a \nnew month brings a new ``Waste of the Week'' speech from the Senator \nfrom Indiana. In preparing for this, we learned another disturbing fact \nabout our economy, and that is that the United States has hit yet \nanother new mark. Our national debt now exceeds $19 trillion.\n  It wasn't that long ago that I was standing on this floor and talking \nabout the fact that we are approaching $11 trillion of debt, and in \njust a few years that has accelerated in a most dramatic way. Now it \nhas reached $19 trillion. Obviously, it is having and it is going to \nhave a significant impact on the future of this country and our \neconomic growth. In fact, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said that our \nNation's gross domestic product--the measure of our Nation's economic \nactivity--grew a very anemic 0.7 percent in the last quarter of 2015. \nWe simply cannot sustain our economy and grow and provide economic \nopportunity for Americans and jobs for Americans at a growth rate of \n0.7 percent. In fact, the growth rate on the average is now about 2 \npercent. We can't even keep our heads above water in terms of providing \nemployment opportunities for people if we don't grow at a much faster \npace, particularly following one of deepest and most damaging \nrecessions we have ever had.\n  Clearly there are issues that need to be addressed, issues that need \nto be talked about, and actions that need to be taken that put us on a \nbetter path to growth. Not having come up with the ability to address \nour long-term debt in any kind of a macro sense after many \nopportunities over the years and many efforts--some of them bipartisan \nand all of them denied by the President of the United States in terms \nof going forward for ``political reasons''--I have shifted my talk to, \nsay, at least let's try to stop spending money that falls in the \ncategory of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I have documented over the last year or so well over $130 billion of \ndocumented waste, fraud, and abuse. This isn't just conjuring up some \nstory or picking up stories out of a newspaper; these are documented \nexamples by independent agencies of the Federal Government that examine \nour spending and come up with ways in which they can point out that the \nspending is not necessary and that these funds can be used for much \nbetter purposes, the best purpose of which would be to not increase our \nnational debt in paying for waste and not demanding ever-more tax \nincreases from our constituents to help pay for waste.\n  This week I am going to highlight something that wastes taxpayers' \nmoney and literally wastes space, warehouse space. The Department of \nHomeland Security owns or leases a number of warehouses around the \ncountry. They need this because they need to have in place the \nequipment that is necessary to address a disaster. Whether it is a \nnatural or manmade disaster or whether it is a terrorist attack--for \nwhatever reason, they need a number of these warehouses. They either \nbuy or lease these warehouses to store this equipment that is needed \nfor emergency situations.\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\n  In 2013 the Department of Homeland Security spent $60 million to own \nor lease a total of 1,628 warehouses that, when added together, occupy \n6.3 million square feet. That is a lot of leased space. That is a lot \nof space to own or lease to store equipment. That is the size of 110 \nfootball fields.\n  No one is questioning the need to be prepared for disasters or the \nneed for warehouse space in different locations around the country, \nbut, as is the case with so many government agencies, in the use of \ntaxpayer dollars, we need to oversee and make sure the money is being \nspent in an efficient and effective way.\n  Thank goodness for these inspectors general. Without them, we would \nnot be able to determine and find out what is going on at these various \nagencies regarding the handling of taxpayer money.\n  The latest report from the DHS inspector general said that there are \nsome warehouses that are ripe for elimination, which would save \ntaxpayers about $9.7 million over a 10-year period of time. The \ninspector general said that the first of these buildings holds \nprimarily a bunch of broken chairs--unused furniture. It is storage \nspace for paperwork that is no longer necessary--and indicated that the \nDHS leases this warehouse in Northern Virginia for $934,000 a year. I \nwish I owned that warehouse. I would be prohibited under the ethics \ncode from doing that, but that is a pretty good deal. You build a \nwarehouse and you lease it to DHS and charge them $934,000 a year, and \nit is filled with equipment that is either broken or needs to be thrown \nout. In a macro sense, it kind of reminds me of my garage. I started \nthinking, well, there is a bunch of broken stuff in there sitting \naround on a shelf. Why don't I just get rid of it? Then I would have \nthe space to store something that is needed.\n  I guess what the Inspector General is saying is, look, this stuff \nlooks like a bunch of broken chairs and stuff we don't need, so why \ndon't we get rid of it and save the taxpayers some money? Over the next \ndecade, this could save the taxpayers a lot of money.\n  Let me show another picture. DHS also leases a 6,500-square-foot \nwarehouse in Northern California. That is only $74,000 of taxpayers' \nmoney on an annual basis. The warehouse is virtually empty. Maybe they \nhave a plan to put something in there, but it is sitting there empty, \nand it is costing the taxpayers $74,000.\n  The IG said: There are some old computers there which we don't use \nanymore. We bought new ones. There is a lot of broken equipment in \nthere. There is old office furniture, and there are some books.\n  Again, it sounds a little bit like my garage on a macro basis. Why do \nwe pay over $70,000 to lease this warehouse when that is what it \ncontains? I mean, let's throw it out.\n  These are just a few of the items the IG found. Clearly, though, it \nis an example of an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars, and it can add \nup to some significant numbers. Those numbers, as I have been posting \nhere over the last year or so, are now totaling $130,146,746,016. It is \na waste of a lot of money, and it is a waste that needn't take place.\n  I am going to keep coming down here week after week highlighting to \nmy colleagues that we can do a better job of oversight, we can do a \nbetter job of running this government, and we can do a better job for \nthe taxpayers, who are working hard to earn money that is taxed by \nUncle Sam. Some of it is wasted or spent through fraud or abuse.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S656-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S656-S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about our \nrelations with Iran and the enforcement of the U.S.-Iran--the \ninternational nuclear deal.\n  Let me first start with a few observations to reinforce an important \npoint: that Iran is neither our friend nor our ally. Just last \nWednesday, as the international community marked the 71st anniversary \nof the liberation of Auschwitz as part of UNESCO's Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, when countries from around the world came together in \nsolemn remembrance of the Shoah, united in a shared commitment that the \natrocities of the Holocaust must never happen again, Iran's Supreme \nLeader, Ayatollah Khamenei, issued a very different proclamation. It \ncame in the form of a video uploaded to his official Web site in which \nthe narrator condemns the nations of the world for supporting Israel \nand questions the legitimacy and magnitude of the Holocaust.\n  Just a few days later, the Supreme Leader of Iran awarded medals to \nthe members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps who detained American \nsailors last month under very dubious circumstances. The Iranian \nSupreme Leader, eager to use this incident for his own propaganda \npurposes, called them Medals of Conquest.\n  These two actions are despicable and not the sign of a nation ready \nto rejoin the international community. These actions by Iran's Supreme \nLeader are just the most recent in a series of provocations and \nreminders that the Iranian regime is neither Americas's ally nor \nfriend.\n  A nation such as Iran that continues to suppress dissent, promotes \nterrorism on its regional neighbors, and blatantly disregards \ninternational law and norms, is a destabilizing force, a revolutionary \nregime not to be trusted. It is precisely for this reason--because we \nare deeply distrustful of Iran and its intentions--that we have to come \ntogether to rigorously, aggressively enforce the terms of the nuclear \ndeal with Iran and push back on its bad behavior, from its support for \nterrorism, to its human rights abuses, to its illegal ballistic missile \ntests.\n  Today I wanted to focus on one of the most vital elements of the \nnuclear deal--the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the \nnuclear deal with Iran, which is the dramatic increase in access and \nsurveillance that the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, \nhas gained through this agreement.\n  After implementation day was reached, one of the significant \nconsequences of that milestone is not just that Iran has taken dramatic \naction to push back its own nuclear trajectory but that it has granted \nunprecedented access to the world's nuclear watchdog agency to monitor \nits compliance with the deal. As Congress, the administration, and the \ninternational community now focus on enforcing the terms of the JCPOA, \nit is worth taking a much deeper look at what exactly makes this IAEA \naccess so unprecedented and so important to maintain.\n  I recently visited the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, Austria, \nwith a delegation of eight Senators. This agency has a huge amount \nriding on its ability to successfully detect any Iranian cheating under \nthis deal. It is no understatement to say that the very credibility of \nthe IAEA is on the line as it monitors, inspects, and verifies the \nstatus of Iran's nuclear program--not just for a week, a month, or a \nyear, but for decades into the future. I was pleased and reassured to \nsee that they are using some of the very innovative inspection \ntechniques developed at America's own National Laboratories. These are \njust a few of the topics I want to touch on in the minutes ahead.\n  The nuclear deal reached with Iran required that they provide the \nIAEA with around-the-clock, 24/7 access to monitor Iran's entire \nnuclear fuel cycle. What is a nuclear fuel cycle? It is all the \ndifferent steps required to go from mining the raw ore to actually \nproducing highly enriched uranium--from uranium mines, uranium mills, \ncentrifuge production workshops, to every known and declared uranium \nenrichment site connected to Iran's nuclear program.\n  Simply put, before this agreement--before the JCPOA--Iran could have \nconverted its uranium or its plutonium into material useful for a \nnuclear weapon. On implementation day, Iran disabled its Arak reactor. \nThey filled the core of that reactor with concrete, shutting off the \nso-called plutonium pathway to a nuclear weapon.\n  Today I will focus on the uranium pathway of the commercial nuclear \nfuel cycle, which includes the four\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\nparts I just mentioned--mills, mines, conversion facilities, and \nenrichment facilities. These different components of their entire fuel \ncycle are scattered across the nation of Iran, as you can see in the \ngraphic to my right.\n  The fuel cycle begins at uranium mines where hundreds of tons of \ndirt, rocks, and ore which contain tiny, trace amounts of uranium--\ntypically just 0.1 percent--are dug up, blasted into smaller pieces, \ndumped into huge trucks, and then transported to the next stage, \nuranium mills.\n  Two mills exist in Iran near Gachin and Saghand. Under the JCPOA, the \nIAEA will maintain continuous access to these mills. In these uranium \nmills, the rocks retrieved from mines are then ground into dust from \nwhich uranium is extracted. This raw uranium ore concentrate is then \ntransported--again, under the supervision of the IAEA--to a uranium \nconversion facility at Isfahan, where it is converted into uranium \nhexafluoride gas, or UF-6.\n  The final and most critical step of the fuel cycle takes place at so-\ncalled enrichment facilities where rapidly spinning centrifuges enrich \nuranium hexafluoride to the point where it can be used for research and \ndevelopment, industrial purposes, or, if enriched to a very high level \nas fissile material, it can be used for a nuclear weapon.\n  Critically, the nuclear deal gives the IAEA access to inspect and \noversee every one of these stages, not just enrichment facilities, as \nother deals with other countries previously required. If the JCPOA only \nrequired the Iranians to give nuclear inspectors access to their \nenrichment facilities, Tehran could easily continue to mine, meld, \nconvert, and then quite likely enrich uranium undetected elsewhere, \nsuch as undeclared secret facilities. That is why it is so important \nthat mills, mines, and the whole rest of the fuel cycle are subject to \nregular inspections and continuous oversight. Access to the entire fuel \ncycle means that the IAEA--and thus the world--will know if Iran tries \nto move any nuclear material to undeclared covert facilities.\n  One of the biggest advances in this new, continuous monitoring \napproach is a whole new series of inspection techniques and \ntechnologies. It is not enough for nuclear inspectors themselves to be \nable to access every step of the fuel cycle because it is impossible \nfor even the best inspectors to be physically present everywhere all of \nthe time in a nuclear fuel cycle system as complex as Iran's. That is \nwhy effective oversight and enforcement demands that the IAEA be able \nto monitor enrichment efforts remotely and constantly. That level of \nmonitoring is provided by the continuous real-time monitoring of all of \nIran's declared nuclear facilities.\n  Here is one of the ways that works. The small device to my right here \nis an IAEA monitoring device--known as an online enrichment monitor, or \nan OLEM--which is installed at the Natantz fuel enrichment plant in \nIran. The pipe labeled ``A'' is a processing pipe that transports \ngaseous uranium hexafluoride gas from cascades of spinning centrifuges. \nThese centrifuges are the devices that take the uranium previously \nmined from the ground and then milled to be transformed or enriched \ninto uranium possibly useful for either civilian or military purposes.\n  Inside the box at the bottom right, this ``B,'' is a gamma ray \ndetector which measures the amount of uranium hexafluoride gas flowing \nthrough the centrifuge at key measurement points. These gamma ray \ndetectors send continuous, real-time, 24/7 information to the IAEA so \nit can make sure that Iran's uranium enrichment levels remain at or \nbelow the agreed-upon 3.67 percent--dramatically lower than the 90 \npercent enrichment threshold required for fissile material useable for \na weapon.\n  In addition to these gamma ray detectors, pressure and temperature \nsensors continuously monitor the present quantities of gaseous uranium \nhexafluoride gas. Measurements from these sensors, combined with data \nfrom the gamma ray detectors, allow the IAEA to effectively monitor all \nuranium enrichment. This monitoring equipment runs autonomously, has \nbackup battery power to ensure reliability, and is encased, as you can \nsee, in sealed containers that contain tamper-resistant equipment to \nallow the international community to know if Iran tries to alter or \ntamper with the monitoring equipment.\n  Before the IAEA developed and implemented these continuous monitoring \ndevices, nuclear inspectors had only two options for verifying \ncompliance: Send inspectors directly, physically into each facility to \nretrieve physical samples or attempt to measure compliance, even \nremotely, by taking environmental samples. As a stand-alone method, \nthese two techniques were unreliable and time-intensive, requiring \nweeks to collect, ship, and analyze samples. Today, instead of waiting \nweeks or months for results, the IAEA now has real-time, around-the-\nclock access, so it is aware of exactly what Iran is doing at its \nenrichment facilities.\n  These nonstop monitoring devices that were recently developed will \nalso be supplemented by traditional sampling and analysis performed in \nperson by IAEA inspectors. Continuous monitoring devices are in place \nat all of Iran's uranium enrichment facilities, as well as every known \nsite at which Iran mills and converts uranium and manufactures or \nstores centrifuges.\n\n  That represents every single location involved in Iran's fuel cycle--\nexcept uranium mines. That is because real-time monitoring of a mine \nwould serve no scientific purpose. Uranium mines consist of thousands \nof tons of raw dirt, rock, and ore. Only a minuscule amount of uranium \nis naturally present, and even that raw uranium is typically present in \nsuch tiny concentrations--just a fraction of a percent--that they are \nunusable without further processing and enrichment.\n  IAEA inspectors have regular access, as I have said, to all known \nuranium mines, and because of the huge amount of activity required to \nprocess and mine uranium, regular inspectors are more than sufficient \nto uncover and monitor Iran's behavior at mines.\n  Throughout Iran's nuclear facilities, the IAEA has also installed \nboth still and video cameras. These cameras provide a 90-percent \nincrease in the number of images generated per day compared to before \nthe nuclear agreement, giving the international community another vital \nwindow into Iran's activities.\n  In addition, gamma ray monitors--as well as all nuclear material, \ncentrifuges, and equipment--are all secured with tamper-evident seals \nto protect the integrity of the equipment.\n  In our Nation's history of dealing with rogue states seeking a \nnuclear weapons capability--from Saddam Hussein's Iraq to Qadhafi's \nLibya to North Korea--there has never been an inspection protocol that \nallowed the IAEA this level of access to monitor and oversee every \nstage of the nuclear fuel cycle. Under this level of oversight, to \nproduce a nuclear weapon, Iran would need to construct an entirely \nseparate fuel cycle--a whole supply chain, including mining, milling, \nconversion, and enrichment facilities--completely in secret--an \nexceptionally difficult undertaking.\n  But access alone is not enough. For us to be ensured that Iran is not \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon, the IAEA must also have the resources to \nturn that access into effective oversight.\n  Under the terms of the JCPOA, Iran must declare every nuclear and \nnuclear-related facility that exists within its borders. In response, \ninspectors have three roles: first, to confirm that Iran's site \ndeclarations are accurate and comprehensive; second, to monitor all \ndeclared sites to make sure Iran's behavior complies with the terms of \nthe deal; and, third, to track material that leaves each facility to \nmake sure Iran is not pursuing illicit nuclear activity at undeclared \nsites elsewhere in the country.\n  Inspectors have regular, complete access to every segment of the \nnuclear supply chain: conversion, enrichment, mines, mills, fuel \nmanufacturing, the reactors themselves, and spent fuel. To reach the \nlevel of necessary oversight, the IAEA has increased its number of \ninspectors by 120 percent. But I will remind my colleagues that for the \nnext 25 years or more, these physical inspections will have to be \nsustained to provide a critical supplement to the continuous monitoring \ntechnology I referenced before.\n  Even so, if the IAEA doesn't have enough capable nuclear scientists \nto effectively monitor, evaluate, and investigate every aspect of \nIran's nuclear\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nfuel cycle, the international community will not, for the decades to \ncome, be able to effectively enforce the terms of the JCPOA.\n  It takes years to train capable nuclear scientists and even longer to \ndevelop new and better monitoring technologies.\n  As the name of the IAEA implies, fully supporting the IAEA requires \nsupport from each of our international partners. But Congress can and \nshould take a step forward by providing reliable, continuous, long-term \nfunding for the IAEA so they can increase the number of their fully \ntrained and available inspectors. It would send a strong signal to both \nour allies and to Iran that we are serious about holding Iran to the \nterms of the deal not just this year but over the decades to come.\n  The IAEA needs the resources to do its job effectively and \nefficiently. Working effectively means the inspections are not only \nuncovering violations or potential violations of the deal but also \ndeterring Iran from covert action by knowing with certainty that they \nwill be caught. Working efficiently means the IAEA can devote as many \nresources as necessary to searching for undeclared sites and monitoring \nthose that are known. To this end, I hope that when the President's \nbudget is released next week, it will include a significant increase in \nresources for the IAEA.\n  Adequately funding the IAEA is something I will be speaking about in \ngreater detail in the weeks to come, but it is also important to note \nthat there is a direct correlation between our investments in Federal \nresearch and development--specifically, in our National Laboratories--\nand our effectiveness in keeping Iran's nuclear ambitions and the \nthreat of proliferation throughout the rest of the world in check.\n  For over 35 years--back to 1980--every single IAEA inspector has been \ntrained at least once at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\n  The Idaho, Oak Ridge, and Brookhaven National Labs are also part of \nthe vital training network for IAEA inspectors. On average, our \nnational labs are training 150 IAEA inspectors every year--about one-\nfifth of the entire inspection staff--every single year, developing key \nskills to keep us and the world safe, like learning how to make \naccurate, prompt measurements of nuclear material.\n  Our National Labs also play a key role in improving existing \ntechnologies and developing new ones that we can't even imagine today. \nThe online enrichment monitors I described earlier, which will allow \nfor continuous, real-time oversight of Iran's enrichment activities, \nwere originally developed at Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee.\n  In fact, most of America's 17 National Labs have supported or are \ncurrently supporting some element of the IAEA safeguards technology, \nboth as individual labs and as part of a 10-nation, 20-lab network of \nanalytical labs that include Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Livermore, \nPacific Northwest, and New Brunswick National Labs.\n  In conclusion, congressional oversight is essential to the most \nstringent implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran and for our \nnational security as a whole. Making investments in our National Labs \nand in Federal research and development today means better trained, \nbetter equipped nuclear inspectors for the years and the decades to \ncome. Adequately funding the IAEA today means the international \ncommunity takes full advantage of the unprecedented access we \nnegotiated in this deal.\n  Effectively enforcing the JCPOA and pushing back on Iran's bad \nbehavior today makes it clear that we intend to hold Iran accountable \nand to lay the groundwork for security for generations to come.\n  If we are serious about enforcing the terms of the nuclear deal, we \nneed more than access; we need action.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to the floor to listen to my friend \ntalk about one of the most important issues that we have dealt with in \nthis body for many years. There is no one who is more articulate and \nmore understanding of the issues that face us in foreign policy than \nthe junior Senator from Delaware. So I extend my appreciation to him, \nand I am glad I had the opportunity to come and listen to what he had \nto say. The stuff he talked about is not simple stuff.

Mr. President, we have always known that the Republicans \nhave an obsession with Secretary Clinton's emails, but their obsession \nis a trumped up, partisan political crusade.\n  Today we received a new revelation about just how bankrupt the \nRepublicans' campaign against Secretary Clinton truly is. The inspector \ngeneral of the State Department issued something that is quite \nimportant. It is unclassified. He wrote a memo stating that emails \nreceived by former Secretary Colin Powell and aides to Secretary \nCondoleezza Rice may contain classified information.\n  This is the same trumped up allegation for which Republicans are \ncurrently trying to railroad Secretary Clinton.\n  As vice chairman Feinstein said last week: ``It has never made sense \nto me that Secretary Clinton can be held responsible for e-mail \nexchanges that originated with someone else.''\n  Yet Republicans would have us believe that these emails posed a grave \nthreat.\n  Secretary Colin Powell said it best. Here is what he said upon \nreading such emails: ``A normal, air-breathing mammal would look at \nthem and say, `What's the issue?' ''\n  Just like they turned Benghazi into a political issue, Republicans \nare looking for anything that can be twisted into a partisan political \ntool--for former Senator and former Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton--and for obvious reasons.\n  The pursuit of her email records has caused the Republicans to waste \nmillions of dollars of taxpayers' money and, of course, abuse the \ncongressional oversight process. They have held up scores of State \nDepartment nominees--from USAID workers in Africa and around the world \nto the State Department's Legal Adviser. Because of what is being done \nhere, the State Department--they have numerous people, I say numerous \npeople, who should be confirmed so the State Department can operate. \nBut, no, they are being held up--even the Legal Adviser. The State \nDepartment does not have its own lawyer because it is being held up. \nAll they say is opposition to emails. It is an effort to develop \nopposition research for the campaign trail. This is what some would say \nis a watershed moment.\n  We can now hold Republicans' allegations up to the light and see them \nfor the flimsy, transparent attempts to score political points that \nthey always have been.\n  If we were to believe Republicans, then we would have to criminally \ncharge Secretary Rice, Secretary Powell, their senior staff, and \neveryone else who received these emails. We might have to indict the \nentire senior level of America's national security community.\n  Of course General Powell should not be indicted. Of course Secretary \nRice should not be indicted. But by Republicans' logic, they should be. \nThis is absurd. It is absurd because the inspector general makes it \nvery clear: These charges are a bunch of trumped up baloney. It is \nabsurd because this campaign against Secretary Clinton has always been \na ridiculously partisan, political waste of time and taxpayer dollars.\n  Today we see this more clearly than ever before, but no one has seen \nit more clearly than Secretary Powell. This man has held numerous \npositions in our government--Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a \nfour-star general. I repeat what he said today, and I quote again: ``A \nnormal, air-breathing mammal would look at them and say, `What's the \nissue?''\n  There is no issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Seeing no one on the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to my \nchief of staff of the last 5 years, Todd Webster. It is a bittersweet \nday for me because my office says farewell to someone who has been a \ntrusted, loyal, reliable, energetic, patient, faithful leader of the \nCoons team for my first 5 years here in Washington. He is someone who \nhas been warm and humorous, caring, and always ready with a funny story \nto tell. He is down to earth, someone who takes interest in whomever he \nis speaking to; who seems to know everyone here, and who is well liked \nand well respected. He is a true family man who helped plan a surprise \nbirthday party for his father Peter who recently turned 75; whose \ndelightful and beautiful wife Lisa last fall was named president and \nCEO of Physicians for Peace and who joins him in their commitment to \npublic service; and whose wonderful children, his daughter Sydney, son \nPeter, and daughter Catherine have sustained and supported him in his \nservice--his 5 years with me in the Senate and his years before that \nwith other Senators. Even their dog Kili, an Irish doodle, has been a \npart of the extended Webster family that has helped engage and \nentertain and support my office these last 5 years.\n  When I first came to Washington, under the most unlikely \ncircumstances in 2010, I was looking for someone who could help me \nnavigate the culture and folkways of this building, and there was no \none better suited for that than Todd Webster. He worked on the \ncampaigns of Senators Harkin and Byrd, as the deputy communications \ndirector for the Gore-Lieberman campaign, and as the communications \ndirector for Senator Patty Murray. After that he was the communications \ndirector for Senator Tom Daschle.\n  After those years of service in the Senate, he had gone off on his \nown to form the WebStrong Group, and he was the owner of Webster \nStrategies and a regular commentator on MSNBC.\n  So when I had the chance to first meet him in 2010, I was encouraged \nthat he was willing to offer his significant skills and talent to the \nchallenge of helping me shape my team and decide on my trajectory here \nin the Senate. So this 9-year Senate veteran, this graduate of Bowdoin \nCollege and possessor of a master's degree from the GW Graduate School \nof Political Management set off with me on a fascinating and at times \nchallenging trip.\n  Todd is a great athlete. He is someone who is a dedicated golfer, \n``an honorable player,'' as was commented by JJ Singh, one of our great \nteam members in the office. You can tell a lot about a person by how \nthey behave on the golf course, and Todd is a gentleman. He plays fast \nso as not to hold up others, but will go out of his way to look for \nyour lost ball in the woods.\n  If Todd left the office a few minutes early on Fridays, he would \nannounce that he was ``going to investigate some greenspace.'' Although \nrare, his outings on golf courses, I know, were a source of \nencouragement and relief.\n  On the softball field he was also a great contributor. A member of my \nteam commented that ``he was a valuable member'' of our team, known as \nthe Small Wonders, after Delaware's nickname, ``and was known for his \nability to turn triples into doubles and sacrificing his body at first \nbase to get much-needed outs.''\n  ``He was also instrumental,'' JJ wrote, ``to the team's magical 2014 \nturnaround season and Cinderella run to the playoffs.''\n  On the management side, Todd would constantly walk around the office \nunannounced, just to check in and see how folks were doing. Rather than \nmaking staff find him, he would proactively seek out staff. His door \nwas always open, whether to chat about something work-related or to \nvent or to listen about something personal. He always had a funny story \nto tell and was willing to listen and offer meaningful advice.\n  When Tom sensed that the afternoon was dragging on and our \nsubterranean executive suite was in need of a pick-me-up, he would go \non what we call in Delaware a ``WaWa run,'' picking up snacks and \ncaffeinated beverages to keep everybody focused until the end of what \nare sometimes very long days.\n  I got one interesting comment from a constituent staffer who has \nworked for me and for several other Senators in her many long years at \nthe Senate. She commented that on one visit to DC, Todd cared enough to \nmake sure our whole constituent relations team had lunch in the Senate \ndining room. She was astonished that he took time out of his busy day \nto have lunch and get to know them and get to know what they do on \nbehalf of the people of Delaware every day.\n  Todd also understood and connected with my commitment to my home \nState and enthusiastically made an annual trek to the Delaware State \nFair and devoted himself to learning more about Delaware's all-\nimportant poultry business. I will say that in equal part I did my best \nto learn more about sports, going to Caps events, Wizards events, and \non golf outings with Todd. He joined me in going to memorable visits of \nprocessing plants where thousands of chickens made the eye-opening \ntransition from being broilers to being dinner. In addition, I want to \nthank him for his strong constitution and his dedication for advancing \nthe agricultural interests of my home State, which even included trying \nscrapple on one occasion.\n  At a time when congressional budgets have constantly been under \npressure and many in America believe our political system is \ndysfunctional, Capitol Hill depends on dedicated, loyal, optimistic, \nand positive public servants like Todd--not only for the kind of policy \nand political accomplishments that ultimately show up on a resume or a \njob description but even more for the qualities and characteristics \nthat make this place function--an unquestioningly positive attitude, a \nmanagement style that makes everyone from interns to seasoned \nprofessionals feel welcome and valued, a willingness to speak candidly \nabout himself and the office, about our challenges and prospects, a \nkeen perspective on the absurdity of the many aspects of the modern \npolitical process, and the relentless idealism that inspires those \naround him to keep believing and working hard. These are the hallmarks \nof Todd's time over the past 5 years.\n  In the 5 years I have had the joy of working with him. He has always \nbeen at my side, helping my office get up and running and teaching me \nthe ways of this town and this institution. Walking around Capitol Hill \nwith him was often like walking beside the ``mayor of the Senate.'' \nEvery few steps, every few minutes, someone would stop to say hello, to \ncatch up, to reconnect or talk about what is next. Far too often, \npeople leave the Hill, having forgotten long ago why they ever got into \npublic service in the first place. Todd never has. Throughout his 9 \nyears serving three different Senators, he has remained cheerful, \noptimistic, tireless, and committed.\n  His car is often the very first one in the Russell garage in the \nmorning, and he often has been the last staffer to leave and go home at \nthe end of a long workday. Whether it is his willingness to call a \nstaff member after the passing of a family member or bounding into the \noffice every morning with a smile, saying, ``top of the morning to you, \nhello friends, hello Meg, hello T, hello Chels,'' my office will simply \nnot be the same without him--without his cheer, without his loyalty, \nwithout his hard work, without his energy, and without his optimism \nabout what we can still do together here in this greatest institution \nin the American constitutional order.\n  So with that, I would like to offer my thanks and best wishes to my \ndeparting chief of Staff, Todd Webster.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S659-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S659-S662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       REMEMBERING U.S. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER VERNON ALSTON, JR.\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Delawarean, \nU.S. Capitol Police Officer Vernon Alston, who passed away unexpectedly \nlast month at the much too young age of 44.\n  Officer Alston was a fixture in the House of Representatives, \nspending\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\nnearly 20 years on the Hill with the Capitol Police. As one of his \ncolleagues, Officer Scott McBane, noted, Vernon was a ``gentle giant.'' \nHis wife Nicole describes him as ``a very genuine man'' who had a deep \nand genuine love for people.\n  While I didn't have the privilege of knowing Officer Alston \npersonally, we shared at least two commitments: to be in Washington \neach morning to go to work and to be back home in Delaware to see our \nkids each night.\n  For years, Vernon's shift started at 5 a.m., meaning he would be \nbeginning his 90-minute commute from Magnolia, DE, at a time when few, \nif any, of the people he would soon be protecting would even be awake. \nFor those who knew him, Vernon's willingness to drive 3 hours a day \njust to be home with his family every night wasn't the only reflection \nof his commitment to service and his family.\n  In fact, Vernon's entire career is a testament to his passion for \nhelping others. While still a student at Howard University, he joined \nthe U.S. Army Reserve and served as an Army reservist until 1994. After \ngraduating from college in 1995, Vernon joined the DC Army National \nGuard and served as a member of the Guard for another decade.\n  In 1996, Vernon joined the U.S. Capitol Police and spent the next two \ndecades dedicated not just to keeping lawmakers and their families and \nour offices' visitors safe but doing so with humility, a smile, and \nwith a relentlessly positive attitude.\n  It is not just the job Vernon chose to dedicate his life to that says \nso much about his character but how he did it. Those who served with \nhim will tell you how he always wore a smile on his face and never had \na harsh word to say.\n  Two weeks ago Vernon died as he lived both his professional and \npersonal life--helping people around him. In this case, he was \nshoveling snow for his next door neighbor in the aftermath of one of \nthe biggest storms to hit our beloved home State of Delaware in years.\n  From the employees of the House and Senate who work around-the-clock \nto keep the lights on to the Members of Congress ourselves, everyone \nplays their part in keeping this institution working and in making our \ncountry's legislative process functional and accessible. That \naccessibility, that openness, is a guiding light to which nations \naround the world aspire, and that is in many ways a direct reflection \nof the efforts of Officer Alston and fellow Capitol Police officers who \nserve with bravery and tirelessness, day in and day out.\n  When we talk about public service on this floor, we are often \nreferring to our country or our constituents, but just as important is \nservice to our colleagues, family, and friends.\n  Vernon first met his wife Nicole when they were both students at \nHoward in 1992, but they didn't truly connect until running into each \nother near this Capitol 15 years ago. It was just 6 months after that, \nNicole remembers, that she married the man of her dreams.\n  Let me leave with you a passage from the Scriptures, Galatians 6:9-\n10, which teaches us:\n\n       Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper \n     time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, \n     as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people.\n\n  Whether in the Army Reserve, at his post outside the Cannon House \nOffice Building or at his home in Delaware, Vernon sought the \nopportunity to do good to all people, and in doing so he made a real \ndifference in the lives of those he knew and those he served.\n  While the words and tributes to Officer Alston that have poured forth \nfrom his colleagues and his friends may provide little comfort today to \nhis friends and family, it is my hope and prayer that Nicole, Brittany, \nYasmeen, Brandon, Israel, and Breyden can take solace in knowing in the \nyears to come that the man they so loved was beloved by so many people.\n  Thank you.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Senator, my colleague from Delaware, \nand I are close friends and we ride the same train together a lot of \ndays, coming and going to Delaware. I would like to think that we think \nalike and share a lot of the same values. It was interesting to listen \nto his remarks about Vernon Alston, which actually reflect and track \nvery closely with what I am prepared to say. But there are some \ndifferences. I am happy to be here with him, and I think it is great \nthat we are here. I think we are also speaking for John Carney, who is \nour Congressman, and who would, if he could speak on this floor, join \nus today as well.\n  Mr. President, I also want to join Senator Coons and the Presiding \nOfficer, who presides in the chair almost every time I speak on this \nfloor. I don't know how this works out, but it is good to see the \nPresiding Officer and this new group of pages who have joined us this \nweek to tell you about a man you never had a chance to meet who was a \nCapitol policeman for almost 20 years.\n  Senator Coons talked about him. I am going to say a few words about \nhim, and then we will probably head for the train and head home.\n  Let me just say a few things about Vernon J. Alston, Jr. His Dad is \nalso Vernon J. Alston. As Senator Coons said, he passed away at the age \nof 44. We did have a big snowstorm. We had a lot of snow. We had a \ncouple of feet here and almost that much in parts of Delaware.\n  When Vernon died, he had actually just finished helping a neighbor \nshovel out after the snowstorm, and that sort of epitomized his life. \nHe was always helping other people, not asking for anything much in \nreturn but setting a good example to every one of us. But in life and \ndeath, Vernon epitomized the best of our country--people who put their \nlives on the line to protect and serve in this Capitol Complex and \nthose of us who live and work in this part of the Nation.\n  The U.S. Capitol Police are some of the finest men and women in \nuniform. I say this as a former naval flight officer and a retired Navy \ncaptain. We have wonderful men and women who serve us and all the folks \nwho come from all over the world to visit this place throughout the \nyear. But each day these officers perform perhaps the most important \njobs here on the Hill--protecting those of us who are privileged to \nwork here either as Members of the Senate and the House or staff and \nalso the millions of visitors and folks who travel here from not just \nthe 50 States but from a lot of places around the globe.\n  Whether these officers are patrolling the ground to prevent or detect \nmischief, investigating suspicious activity or responding to \nemergencies, their mission is the same. Their mission is to protect one \nof our country's principal symbols of democracy--the United States \nCapitol. Their mission is not one that comes without sacrifice. Just 17 \nyears ago, I remember this to the day, in 1998, two of our Capitol \nPolice officers, not far from the sound of my voice, were gunned down \nin the line of duty when a gunman opened fire, trying to force his way \ninto the Capitol.\n  Vernon, in his service with the U.S. Army Reserve, with the National \nGuard, and with the Capitol Police force, consistently exhibited \nunwavering courage, devotion to duty, and, above all, honor. In the way \nhe lived his life and how we remember him, Vernon reminds each of us \njust how good we can be and ought to be.\n  Vernon Alston was born in 1971 to his mom Barbara Alston and Vernon \nAlston, Sr.--and not in this country. He was born in Vincenza, which is \na town in Italy where his dad Vernon, Sr., was stationed in the U.S. \nAir Force. Vernon spent the first 10 years of his life in Italy before \nhis father was transferred to Dover Air Force Base in Dover, DE. There \nVernon attended grade school on the Air Force base and later graduated \nfrom Dover High School, a school that I have been privileged to visit \nmany times. He went on to attend Howard University in Washington, DC, \nand graduated from there about 20 years ago in 1995.\n  Vernon was still a student at Howard University when he answered the \ncall of duty, following the footsteps of his dad Vernon, Sr., and his \ngrandfather David Alston, who was a U.S. Army World War II veteran. In \n1991, Vernon--this is the son--joined the U.S. Army Reserve, and he \nserved in the Army Reserve until 1994. After graduating from college in \n1995, Vernon joined the District of Columbia Army National Guard and \nserved as a member of the Army National Guard for another 10 years.\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\n  I am sure our Presiding Officer spends time with his Guard troops in \nhis home State. We do, too. We have an Army Guard and an Air Guard in \nDelaware. We are very proud of the literally thousands of men and women \nwho serve our country. I think 300 are in Afghanistan. We will welcome \nsome folks home this weekend. We are welcoming some folks home this \nweekend.\n\n  But this is what Winston Churchill used to say about people who serve \nin the Guard or Reserve and have their own day jobs. Winston Churchill \nsaid they are twice the citizen. Think about that--twice the citizen.\n  I know a lot of people who are in the Army Guard who used to be in \nthe Army, and a lot of folks in the Air Guard in Delaware who used to \nbe in the Air Force. They have their day jobs, and they serve our State \nand our Nation through the Guard. They are two-times the citizen. So \nwas Vernon.\n  He began his service with the Capitol Police Force 20 years ago, and \nfor those 20 years he protected and served the Capitol Complex and its \ncommunity, including folks such as us here: Senators, staff, our pages \nsitting here at the dais today, members of our families, staffs, \nmembers of their families, and millions of folks who visit our Capitol \nthroughout each year. Vernon's positive energy, which Senator Coons has \nalluded to, and his attitude made a lasting impression with his Capitol \nPolice colleagues.\n  In the latter part of his career, most recently Vernon was stationed \nat the Capitol powerplant, which provides steam and water that is used \nto heat and cool buildings across the Capitol Complex. At that plant, \nit was his responsibility to check visitors and staff at the door and \nwork to keep that facility safe and secure every day, 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, throughout the year.\n  According to his colleagues, he always found time to ask others: \nWell, how are you doing? And he possessed the all-too-rare quality of \nbeing a patient listener. My dad used to say to my sister and me that \nGod gave us two ears, one mouth, and we should use them in that \nproportion--listen a lot more than we talk. I always admire good \nlisteners, and Vernon was one of those.\n  One of his fellow officers described Vernon as a ``beacon.'' A beacon \nof what? Well, a ``beacon of positivity,'' a positive force. No matter \nthe mission--an early morning for a Presidential inauguration or a late \nnight for the State of the Union Address at the other end of the \nCapitol--Vernon always wore a smile on his face.\n  In 2008, while Vernon was on the job and patrolling the Capitol \ngrounds, he ran into a woman whom he had actually run into before named \nNicole Davis. Despite attending Howard University at the same time, \nVernon and Nicole never really knew each other. But earlier this week, \nI talked to Nicole, who for years also made the commute from Magnolia, \nDE--just south of Dover--to serve not in the Capitol Police but to \nserve our country in another capacity here in our Nation's Capital. She \ntold me their love story or an abbreviated version of it. When they \nwere at Howard University at roughly the same point in time, Vernon \nwould see her from afar and would admire her. He never really summoned \nthe courage--if you will, the temerity--to go up to her and say: Here \nis who I am; who are you? But he sort of admired her from afar and \nwished he could get to know her.\n  Many years later, while he was on patrol, I think at the corner of \nFirst and Independence, guess who comes walking along--that same woman \nwhom he had admired from afar all those years ago. They struck up a \nconversation, hit it off, and went out on a date together. The rest is \nhistory. Six months later they were married. I know some people who \nmarried that quickly, and I am one of them. Vernon and Nicole knew what \nthey were looking for. They were looking for each other, and they found \neach other. They have a wonderful family they have raised.\n  Later when they were onboard the Spirit of Washington, they became \nhusband and wife. After they married, they moved, in this case to \nDelaware. As I said, people in Magnolia--their claim to fame is that \nMagnolia, DE, is a little town that is the center of the universe. \nThere are probably other places where people think they are the center \nof the universe, but the Alston family lived in Magnolia, the center of \nthe universe, for a number of years.\n  Nicole, as Senator Coons said--not only did Vernon get up and drive \nto work every day, so did Nicole. And they didn't carpool many days; \nthey each drove separately. They both loved Delaware, but they wanted \nto work here and to serve our Nation in different roles. Nicole served \nand worked for a number of years at the Smithsonian's National Zoo, \nwhile Vernon was keeping things safe here in our Capitol. Together they \nhave five children: Brittany, a sophomore at Delaware State University, \nthe home of the Hornets in Dover; Yasmeen, a senior at Polytech High \nSchool in Delaware, the home of the Panthers, just south of Dover; \nBrandon, a sophomore at Paul Public Charter School in DC; and Israel \nand Breyden, who are both in preschool.\n  I am close to closing, but I want to share a story that we heard from \nVernon's mom the other day. It deals with the time when he was in the \nfourth grade. Vernon's principal told Vernon's parents that he was a \ngreat example to his peers, to other students. The principal said he \nknew he would come to learn about Vernon's accomplishments and \nachievements in the newspapers years down the road.\n  Think of that. I don't know what my principals were thinking about me \nwhen I was in the fourth or fifth or sixth grade, but I don't think any \nof them thought that I would end up in the Senate or that they would be \nreading about me in the newspaper or watching me on television. But \nwhen Vernon was not even 10 years old, his principal knew he was a guy \nwho was on his way to being somebody his parents could be enormously \nproud of.\n  I think it is clear through the outpouring of love and accounts of so \nmany others after Vernon's untimely passing that Vernon's principal was \nright. If he is out there listening somewhere and if his teachers are \nout there listening somewhere, I thank them for helping--along with \nVernon's parents--raise a remarkable young man.\n  Today I rise to commemorate Vernon, to celebrate his life with \nSenator Coons by my side, and on behalf of Congressman John Carney, our \nat-large Congressman from Delaware. We want to offer to Vernon's \nfamily--particularly to Nicole, their children, their friends, and \nfamily--our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss and \nreally the loss to all of us here. We consider Vernon and those with \nwhom he served as part of our family.\n  I asked my staff to see if they could find a couple of people who \nserve in the Capitol Police who might have something to say about \nVernon, and I want to quote them and maybe close my remarks with their \nwords.\n  These are the words Officer Scott McBane said about Vernon Alston:\n\n       Vern Alston was an outstanding human being. To know Vern \n     was to love him. I was privileged to work with Vern for three \n     years at the Traffic One checkpoint of the House Division [on \n     the House side]. He treated everyone he met with patience, \n     good humor, and remarkable kindness. A great talker who told \n     very funny stories, he also had that rare quality of being a \n     sympathetic and a patient listener.\n\n  We heard that before, didn't we?\n  Continuing:\n\n       Smart, positive, and always supportive, people would stop \n     by all day to see Vern and share their stories with him. A \n     warm and sympathetic friend to so many, Vern will be greatly \n     missed by all who knew him.\n\n  Thank you, Scott McBane, an officer with the Capitol Police, for \nsharing those memories of Vern Alston.\n  I have one more from another Capitol Police officer who knew and \nworked with Vernon. This officer's name is Michael Woodward. Michael \nsaid these words about Vernon Alston:\n\n       Of all the people I have had the honor to work with Vernon \n     Alston was by far the most positive, warm, friendly and \n     outgoing person I have ever met.\n\n  Let me just stop there. How many people in the world do you suppose \nthere are who would say those words about us? Whether we happen to be \nSenators, our staff, our families, those are wonderful words for \nsomeone to say about us, that we were the most ``positive, warm,'' or \n``friendly and outgoing person'' that someone ever met. What a \ncompliment.\n  He continues:\n\n       He was always one to greet you with a smile, and ask how \n     you and your family were\n\n[[Page S662]]\n\n     doing. It doesn't matter what was going on--if we were coming \n     in early for the Inauguration or staying late for the State \n     of the Union--he always had a smile. I never heard him speak \n     a negative word or raise his voice. He treated everyone as a \n     close friend and was a beacon of positivity. His passing \n     leaves a hole that cannot be filled.\n\n  Senator Coons closed with a little Scripture from the New Testament. \nI think it was Galatians, if I am not mistaken. I will try to \nparaphrase a little something maybe from Luke and from the Book of \nJames: People may not believe what we say; they will believe what we \ndo. We lead by our example. And in our lives, it cannot be do as I say, \nbut really do as I do.\n  Throughout his life, Vernon was a great example, not just for the \npeople with whom he worked on the police force here, not just for all \nof us who came into contact with him throughout the day or week, but \nfor some of those millions of people whose only lasting impression of \nour country that they took home with them wherever they came from \naround the world was this wonderful Capitol Police officer who took the \ntime to talk with them, to listen to them, to be patient, to be \nhelpful, and to be friendly.\n  There is a great lesson for all of us in that--a great lesson for all \nof us. For that, Vernon, we thank you. God bless you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S662-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S662-S663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AGRICULTURAL EXPORT EXPANSION ACT\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bill which I \nintroduced that I would love to have the Presiding Officer's \nsponsorship, given how important the Port of Louisiana is to American \nagriculture and certainly commodities that we ship across the world. It \nis called the Agricultural Export Expansion Act that I introduced with \nSenator Boozman as my cosponsor. We have a great bipartisan lineup of \npeople who are interested in this.\n  So what does this bill do? I will say, very rarely does a day go by--\nwhether I am in North Dakota or whether I am here in Washington, DC--\nthat I don't speak with or hear from North Dakota farmers and ranchers. \nThe agriculture economy is absolutely critical to North Dakota. Almost \none-quarter of North Dakota workers are farmers and ranchers or they \nare employed in farm-related jobs. During every meeting, farmers and \nranchers express the urgent need--the urgent need--to open trade with \nCuba and to stop tying the hands of our producers.\n  Just on Tuesday our barley growers were in my office telling me about \nhow important the market in Cuba could be. Last week it was the Dry \nBean Council telling me what I already know from my visit with Cuba: \nThe products we grow in the United States--like North Dakota pinto \nbeans or Arkansas rice--are compatible with the Cuban diet, and there \nis high demand for our high-quality products.\n  These aren't just crops that North Dakota grows. These are crops that \nNorth Dakota knows exceptionally well and that we excel in. My State is \nthe No. 1 producer of barley, multiple varieties of beans, lentils, and \ncertain types of wheat. Enabling agriculture exports to Cuba would be a \nhuge boon for North Dakota farmers and ranchers, as well as those from \nmany other States.\n  Unfortunately, because of trade barriers the United States puts on \nitself, the Cuban people aren't eating North Dakota beans, Kansas wheat \nor Arkansas rice. Instead, they are importing those products from \ncountries much further away--like Brazil, Canada, Europe, and even \nVietnam. I would say not only in terms of proximity of our product to \nthe Cuban market--which is a huge freight advantage--we also have the \nhighest quality of products. So we are forfeiting what in fact would be \na natural market for us. Think about that. In this day, where trade is \nso important--where improving our balance of trade is so important--we \nwill not be able to access the Cuban market.\n  Congress has eased some restrictions on exports to Cuba for \nagricultural products. They did that back in 2000 with the passage of \nthe Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. That was a great \nfirst step. We did make some progress in increased sales to Cuba. \nUnfortunately, now that same law is holding us back.\n  The administration made important changes to U.S. policy and opened \nsome travel and some trade to Cuba starting with their January 2015 \nchanges. Most recently, including last month, the administration made \nmore changes, including allowing for financing of authorized exports to \nCuba. Unfortunately, those exports are other than agricultural exports. \nBecause of our once forward-looking bill, agricultural exporters are \nprohibited now from offering financing that all other exporters can \nprovide to Cuba. That needs changing.\n  In 2014 I visited Cuba. I met with Cuban agricultural trade officials \nto discuss bilateral economic benefits of expanding agricultural \nexports from North Dakota and the United States to Cuba. These are \nconversations we need to continue to have.\n  Last April I and Senator Boozman introduced our bipartisan bill to \nlevel the playing field for our farmers and ranchers and make sure we \ncan compete with the rest of the world in Cuba. What does that bill do \nand how does it improve our trade relationship with Cuba? One of the \ngreatest barriers we have in getting our products to Cuba is we can't \nfinance it. Some might say: Well, we don't want to put government \ntaxpayer dollars at risk. This bill does not put one taxpayer dollar at \nrisk. We are talking about opening the market so we can access private \nfinancing for agricultural exports to Cuba. Let me repeat that. No \ntaxpayer dollars are at risk. It is based entirely on individual risk \nassessment and decisions. Our bill is supported by the U.S. \nAgricultural Coalition for Cuba, a wide-ranging coalition including \nevery grower group and industry association.\n  This week, the Cuban Government announced that El Nino is going to \ncreate an even greater loss of agricultural products in Cuba. This is \ngoing to create an even greater opportunity for our agricultural \nexports--a greater opportunity. Why--why--why would we let other \ncountries keep eating our lunch and dominating this important market, \nespecially given our proximity? It is time for Congress to get out of \nAmerican agriculture's way and let private businesses make exporting \nand financing decisions.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor and help pass our bill, S. \n1049, the Agricultural Export Expansion Act.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the challenges that American \nagriculture has. Higher-dollar value has put tremendous stress on our \nproducts. We have seen corn prices drop, we have seen soybean prices \ndrop, we have seen American agriculture challenged in ways we haven't \nseen for the last decade. How do we fix that problem? With another \ngovernment program? Maybe we will have to help or expand the farm bill \nto deal with our food security issues created by low commodity prices. \nI will not take that off the table, but I will say the surest way that \nwe can get out from underneath these challenges is export, is to \nprovide for trade. It is one of the reasons I supported TPA. I believe \nit is great for American commodities to access additional markets and \ntake down trade barriers to provide us with market, but why are we \nartificially standing in the way of private investment and private \nfinancing of American agricultural products? It is time that we do the \nright thing by American agriculture and open this market. We can take \nthis incremental step without having this body agree to lifting any \nkind of embargo. We can take this incremental step without changing the \nprohibition we have on Federal-sponsored marketing programs. We can \nbegin to access the Cuban market and introduce our high-quality beans, \nedible peas, and lentils. We can do that.\n  I will close with a story about my great friend Maria Cantwell from \nthe State of Washington. Washington also grows what we call a lot of \ncross crops--although, I would argue that ours are probably even lot \nbetter than what is grown in the State of Washington.\n  Maria Cantwell went on a trade mission to try to sell Washington \nState\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\nlentils. After hours of listening to the trade officials and Mr. \nCastro, she was successful in convincing him to buy lentils. The \nlentils he eventually bought were from North Dakota.\n  We have an opportunity to access this market--not just for North \nDakota but for the State of Washington, for the State of Louisiana, for \nthe State of Arkansas, for the State of Kansas. For all of our \nagricultural producers, open this market, give us the ability to do \nwhat we do in every other place. We aren't putting taxpayer dollars at \nrisk. We are simply asking for access to markets.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S663-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING GEORGIA POWERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to mourn the loss of an honored \nKentuckian and civil rights icon. Georgia Powers, who fought for civil \nrights and marched in protest of racial injustice, died on January 30. \nShe was 92 years old.\n  As the first African American to serve in Kentucky's State Senate, \nGeorgia Powers paved the way for African Americans in Kentucky to enter \npublic service. Even before her election to the senate, she had earned \nrecognition across the State for her efforts to fight for equal rights.\n  In 1964 she helped organize a march on Frankfort to support a bill \nthat would open public accommodations to African Americans. In 1966, \nthanks in part to her work, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a \ncivil rights law, making Kentucky the first southern State to do so.\n  Among the many supporters Powers brought to Frankfort for the 1964 \nmarch were baseball legend Jackie Robinson--the man who broke the color \nbarrier in professional baseball--and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Powers remained a close confidant of King's until his death \nin 1968.\n  Georgia Powers was born in 1923 in Washington County, KY, as one of \nnine children. Her family moved to Louisville when she was a little \ngirl, and Louisville was the city that she loved her whole life and \nrepresented in the Kentucky Senate.\n  Georgia Powers' political career was born out of her fight for civil \nrights. She tried to work with members of the Kentucky Legislature on \nantidiscrimination laws and found them unreceptive. So when the \nincumbent senator in her home district in Louisville chose not to run \nagain in 1967, she moved from protest to politics.\n  The first piece of legislation she sponsored in the senate, a bill \nfor open housing, passed 28 to 3. That was the beginning of a \nsuccessful 21-year political career. She would go on to become the \nchairwoman of the senate's labor and industry committee and the sponsor \nof the Equal Rights Amendment in Kentucky.\n  One of the earliest bills she introduced in the State senate was to \nremove racial identification from State drivers' licenses. Powers has \nsaid that she was prompted to do this based on her own experience as a \n16-year-old trying to get a drivers' license. She was asked her race \nand the sting of discrimination stayed with her.\n  Georgia Powers built a stronger, fairer Kentucky by her life's work \nand her leadership. She was an inspiration to many, including me, for \nher determination in the face of injustice. I knew and worked with \nSenator Powers back when I served as the Judge-Executive of Jefferson \nCounty. I can personally attest that she was funny, tenacious, and \ntough as nails--an admirable woman and a respected senator.\n  Georgia Powers is remembered and mourned by many, including \nLouisville Mayor Greg Fischer, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, and even \nboxing legend Muhammad Ali. Many Kentuckians in public service today \ncite her as a guiding influence.\n  Georgia Powers made fighting discrimination her legacy. I ask my \nSenate colleagues to join me in honoring her as one of Kentucky's most \nimportant leaders and a champion of civil rights. She will be \nremembered as a Kentuckian of courage and conviction, and she is \ngreatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S663-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       REMEMBERING U.S. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER VERNON ALSTON, JR.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to remember U.S. Capitol Police \nOfficer Vernon Alston, who passed away on January 23, 2016. Officer \nAlston was a fixture on the Capitol Grounds for 20 years, and he is \nmissed by the many who were honored to have known him.\n  Those who knew Officer Alston best describe him as someone who loved \nhis family, his job, and helping others. For two decades, he helped \nmembers of the Capitol Hill community by keeping us safe, and on the \nday he passed away, he helped members of his own community in Magnolia, \nDE, by shoveling snow for his neighbors.\n  Officer Alston was a caring and modest man who took great pride in \nhis work. As a former Capitol Police officer myself, I understand the \ndedication and sacrifice required of members of the Capitol Police \nforce, and Officer Alston was an exemplar of these traits. I am \nsaddened that the U.S. Capitol Police has lost one of our own, but I \nwill always be grateful for Officer Alston's service to the Capitol \nPolice force and to our Nation.\n  Officer Alston was loved dearly by his friends and family. He is \nsurvived by his wife Nicole; daughters Brittany and Yasmeen; and sons \nBrandon, Israel, and Breyden. My condolences go out to Officer Alston's \nfamily during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S663-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S663-S664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECENT REGULATORY CHANGES RELATED TO CUBA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week the administration took another \nstep in unraveling the web of onerous, misguided, and self-defeating \nrestrictions on the ability of American citizens to travel to Cuba and \nto interact with the people of Cuba.\n  Effective as of January 27, the Departments of Treasury and Commerce \npublished revised regulations that end certain payment and financing \nrestrictions, allow for more authorized exports to Cuba in a variety of \nsectors, and expand authorized travel categories and allow additional \ntravel-related transactions.\n  Restrictions on providing access to credit, which have been among the \nmost commonly cited barriers to exporting to Cuba, were removed. \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control amended regulations \nregarding nonagricultural exports, and it is now possible for U.S. \nbanks to provide direct financing for authorized exports to Cuba, as \nopposed to requiring cash in advance or routing through a third country \nwhich had stymied many transactions that could benefit American \ncompanies and Cuban consumers.\n  General licenses, meaning that a specific license application is no \nlonger required, are now provided for a variety of categories, \nincluding telecommunications items that improve communications to, \nfrom, and among Cubans; certain agricultural items, such as \ninsecticides and equipment, although not agricultural commodities; \nitems for the safety of civil aviation and safe operation of commercial \naircraft; and items necessary for the environmental protection of U.S. \nand international air quality, waters, or coastlines including items \nrelated to renewable energy or energy efficiency.\n  And it is now permissible, subject to case-by-case review, to export \nto some Cuban state-owned enterprises that ``provide goods and services \nto the Cuban people.'' This includes items for agricultural production, \neducation, food processing, public transportation, wholesale \ndistribution, and construction of facilities for supplying energy, \namong others. As much as we disagree with many of the policies of the \nCuban Government, it is undeniable that it provides health care, \neducation, public transportation, and many other services that the \nCuban people rely on.\n  However, exports to state-owned enterprises that primarily generate \nrevenue for the government remain ineligible to receive U.S. exports \nalong with military, police, intelligence, and security services.\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\n  Categories for authorized travel to Cuba have been expanded to \ninclude organizing professional meetings and for professional media and \nartistic productions such as movies, TV, and music, among others. These \nare long overdue and will be welcomed by American scholars, artists, \nand journalists. I am disappointed, however, that American tourists are \nstill prohibited from traveling to Cuba, unlike to any other country in \nthe world.\n  These are all positive steps, for which I commend the White House. \nFrankly, it is hard to believe that it has taken so long to finally \nbegin to dismantle a policy of unilateral sanctions against Cuba when \nit has been obvious for so many years that it has failed to achieve any \nof its objectives, while it was hurting the people of both countries.\n  But a great deal remains to be done to reverse 50 years of an ill-\nconceived, punitive policy. It is for that reason that I urge the \nAdministration to act expeditiously to take further action, including \namending regulations that would allow Cuba to use the U.S. dollar in \nthird-party country transactions, which would greatly facilitate U.S.-\nCuban commerce.\n  The Treasury Department should also do what the American people want \nby letting them travel to Cuba on a people-to-people license as \nindividuals and stop treating them like children and making them pay \nthousands of dollars to large tour group operators. The U.S. Government \nis not in the business of requiring costly chaperones for Americans who \ntravel anywhere else overseas, and it should not do so for Americans \ntraveling 90 miles to Cuba.\n  Allowing all Americans to travel under a general license would \nsignificantly boost the number of Americans traveling to Cuba, it would \ncreate a much richer travel experience, and it would save taxpayers \nmoney.\n  There are some who will undoubtedly continue to insist that any \nchange in policy is somehow a capitulation to the Cuban Government and \nthat, because Cuba's Communist Party remains in control, we should \ncontinue supporting a policy that has helped keep them there. That \nillogical, myopic view has been repudiated by a huge majority of the \nCuban people, including some of Cuba's most outspoken critics of the \ngovernment, and it is rejected by a large and increasing majority of \nAmericans, including Cuban-Americans.\n  The White House has all the support it needs from the American \npublic, the business community, farmers, ranchers, energy companies, \nfaith-based groups, academia, the media, the scientific and medical \ncommunity, and so many others across this country to take bold action \nto expand engagement with Cuba. There is no time to waste.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S664-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO STEVEN M. DETTELBACH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize U.S. Attorney \nSteven M. Dettelbach for his years of excellent public service as he \nbegins a new chapter in his legal career. Steve has served as the U.S. \nattorney for the northern district of Ohio for nearly 7 years after the \nSenate unanimously confirmed him to this position in 2009. Steve is a \nformer member of my Judiciary Committee staff, and I have known him for \nmore than a decade. I am very proud of all that he has accomplished.\n  Steve earned his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College and his \nlaw degree from Harvard Law School. After law school, Steve clerked for \nJudge Stanley Sporkin of the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia. He went on to serve in the Department of Justice's civil \nrights division from 1992 to 1997 and then in the U.S. attorney's \noffice for the district of Maryland from 1997 to 2001.\n  In 2001, Steve joined my Judiciary Committee staff. Steve impressed \nme with his sound judgment and his outstanding work with both \nRepublican and Democratic offices. Steve worked on a broad range of \nissues, including drafting and negotiating key whistleblower and \ncriminal fraud provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. He played a \ncentral role on our oversight team and helped draft an important \nbipartisan report on the implementation of FISA. The report, written \nwith Senators Grassley and Specter, was the culmination of the \ncommittee's first comprehensive oversight effort of the FBI in nearly \ntwo decades. After his tenure with my office, Steve served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the northern district of Ohio. He then \njoined Baker & Hostetler as a partner before he was nominated to his \ncurrent position.\n  As the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Ohio, Steve has \nbeen at the forefront of enforcing civil rights laws, including \nbringing some of the first cases under the Matthew Shepard and James \nByrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. He has organized \neducational events on issues such as human trafficking, hate crimes, \nand police use of force, and formed the United Against Hate religious \ncoalition in the wake of a racially motivated arson at a church in his \ndistrict.\n  As a member of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, AGAC, Steve \nled the AGAC's civil rights subcommittee and worked to establish civil \nrights units in U.S. attorney's offices across the country. His work \nwill ensure that civil rights remain a Department priority for years to \ncome. Steve is a model public servant who approaches his job with \nintegrity, tenacity, good humor, and sharp negotiating skills that I \nknow will serve him well as he moves back to private practice.\n  Ohio is a safer and better place because of Steve's tireless effort \nand dedication. I commend Steve for his years of service and wish him \nand his wonderful family the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S664-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S664-S665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ESTHER OLAVARRIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Ms. Esther \nOlavarria, an extraordinary public servant who has worked for decades \nto build an immigration system that is fair and just for all. I know \nEsther from her time in the Senate as Senator Kennedy's lead advisor on \nimmigration matters for the Judiciary Committee. In the Senate and more \nrecently in the administration, Esther's intelligent, thoughtful advice \nand analysis has been invaluable. She is stepping down this week after \nserving as senior counselor to Department of Homeland Security \nSecretary Johnson. I have no doubt the Secretary will miss her, as I do \nhere in the Senate.\n  Esther was an early appointee of the Obama administration, serving \nfirst as a member of the President's transition team on immigration, \nthen as the Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Immigration and \nBorder Security and later as counselor to Secretary Janet Napolitano. \nDuring that time she advocated fixing our Nation's broken immigration \nsystem and the pressing need to provide protection for asylees and \nrefugees, improve detention conditions, and ensure accountability and \ntransparency in immigration enforcement.\n  In 2013, Esther was asked to serve as the White House Director of \nImmigration Reform. Her wealth of experience made her an invaluable \nasset in our bipartisan effort to pass the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity and Immigration Modernization Act in 2013. The bill \noverwhelmingly passed the Senate with the bipartisan support of 68 \nSenators. I remain disappointed that that important bill was not taken \nup in the House, and I hope the Senate will one day turn again to this \nlegislation. When we do, I know that Esther will be ready to provide \nher support once again as she has so many times when the Senate has \nturned its focus to the issue of immigration.\n  In the Senate, Esther understood the importance of working across the \naisle to get something done. Like her boss, Senator Kennedy, Esther \nforged unlikely partnerships and found partners who were drawn to her \npassion, her sense of humanity, and her dedication. She was a key \nadviser for the comprehensive immigration reform bills of 2004, 2005, \n2006, and 2007. Many of us remember Senator Kennedy turning to Esther \nduring the 2007 negotiations not only so that he could seek her \ncounsel, but so that other Senators could benefit from her expertise. \nEveryone--Republicans, Democrats, advocates, journalists--listened, and \neveryone was better off for having Esther nearby.\n  Esther, like her late boss, has always been driven by a deep \ncommitment to making our communities stronger and more vibrant. She has \nadvocated on behalf of immigrant children and she has fought to reform \ninhumane detention practices. And she has underscored the critical \nimportance of the relationship\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\nbetween law enforcement and the immigrant community so that all our \ncommunities are safe.\n  A Cuban immigrant who came to the United States at the age of 5, \nEsther has always sought to advance immigration policies rooted in the \nAmerican values of fairness and family. Her life experiences as a child \nled her to a career in immigration law, first helping low-income \nimmigrants in Florida through direct client representation and by \ncofounding the not-for-profit legal assistance organization Florida \nImmigrant Advocacy Center, and then coming to Washington, DC.\n  I have no doubt that Esther will continue to be an important adviser, \nbut more importantly a devoted friend to so many who have been \nfortunate to know her. She is an exemplary public servant. I commend \nEsther for her years of service and wish her and her family the best in \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S665-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S665-S666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STRENGTHENING THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the European \nUnion, to both recognize the peace and prosperity that it has brought \nto Europe for more than 75 years and the unprecedented challenges \nconfronting the union today.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently held a hearing on the \nthreats to the European Union and the implications for U.S. foreign \npolicy. Our committee was also briefed this week by Assistant Secretary \nof State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland on these issues.\n  Coming out of these discussions, I am absolutely convinced that the \nU.S. has an obligation to stand with our friends in Europe during these \nchallenging times in support of the principles that we all share: \ndemocracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights, economic \nprosperity, and peace and security.\n  I would like to lay out how I see these challenges threatening the \ncohesion and stability of the EU. This is not meant to be an exhaustive \nlist, but is intended to create a sense of urgency among my colleagues \nregarding the crises faced by the EU and our transatlantic alliance.\n  First, I want to reiterate the remarkable trajectory of the \ndemocratic process and peace in Europe since the World Wars of the last \ncentury. Emerging from the ashes of World War II, what started as the \nEuropean Coal and Steel Community expanded to become the European \nEconomic Community, which created a single market for the free movement \nof goods, people, capital, and services. The ideal of a single market \nguaranteeing freedom of movement for all member citizens still \nunderpins the EU today, as it has grown from 6 to 28 members.\n  This basis in an economic union was always intended to grow into a \npolitical union as well. Jean Monnet, often regarded as the father of \nthe European Union, stated that ``we are not forming coalitions of \nstates, we are uniting men.'' This principle serves as the basis for \ncooperation amongst member states as they have pooled diplomatic \nresources to address some of the most pressing issues around the world, \nusually in concert and in lock-step with the United States. In capitals \naround the world, the U.S. works with EU representatives to address \nvexing regional challenges, the provision of humanitarian assistance, \nand support for values that we hold dear.\n  The allure of EU membership has served as a powerful incentive, \nespecially for countries in Central and Eastern Europe, to reform and \nadopt high governance standards in preparation for EU membership. \nNowhere else in the world does such an incentive exist; and, while not \nwithout its challenges, this accession process has improved the \neconomic circumstances, political rights, and civil liberties of \nmillions across the continent.\n  Today, however, the EU is confronting its most serious crises, which \ncollectively threaten the future of the European project. These threats \nto European cohesion are both internal and external, between north and \nsouth and east and west, as well as within and outside individual \nmember states.\n  First, the refugee and migrant crisis today consumes policymakers in \nBrussels and across Europe. Tensions have grown among member states on \nthe right approach to accepting them, as more than 1 million entered \nGermany alone in 2015, with the prospect of more in 2016. The heated \ndebate within the Union on how to deal with the crisis has called into \nquestion the ability of Brussels to enforce commitments by its member \nstates on borders, Schengen visa-free travel, and quotas associated \nwith resettlement.\n  In recent months, member states have agreed to resettlement quotas \nand border protocols, only to see those agreements fall apart in quick \nsuccession. Some are now concerned that this trend could extend to \nother EU member states' commitments in areas like sanctions on Russia.\n  Second, the 2008 financial crisis and the possibility of Greece \nexiting the Eurozone drew attention to the fiscal policy differences \nbetween Europe's industrialized north and less developed south and \nshook the foundations of the monetary union. The EU has not yet \nweathered this particular storm, and while perhaps not as prominent in \nthe news due to other challenges, the fiscal situation in Greece \nremains very precarious. Member states and the IMF remain focused on \nresolving the crisis, but the natural tension between painful economic \nreforms and the associated political and humanitarian costs remains.\n  Third, governments across the EU are contending with the very real \nthreat of domestic terrorism and foreign fighters. Horrific attacks \nhave galvanized European leaders to action, but significant challenges \nremain as the necessity for enhanced counterterrorism and intelligence \nmeasures interact with real concerns regarding privacy.\n  Fourth, an alarming nationalist trend has emerged in several \ncountries across the Union. Although nationalism has, of course, \nexisted for years across the Continent, it has been exacerbated by the \nmigrant crisis. In some countries, governments have embraced a brand of \n``illiberal democracy'' which calls into question the very democratic \nvalues of the EU and the four freedoms that make up its core.\n  Every member state signed up for these values when they joined the \nUnion--many of which had to enact difficult reforms to make them a \nreality. It is unfortunate and worrying that we have seen an erosion of \nsupport for these principles in some corners, a dynamic that deserves \nincreased attention and understanding.\n  Fifth, Russia continues to place pressure on the EU and poses a \nthreat to the security of EU countries in the east. Ukraine is the \nclearest example, where Ukrainian aspirations for an association \nagreement with the EU were met with the illegal Russian annexation of \nCrimea and subsequent invasion of eastern Ukraine.\n  We have worked closely with the EU to establish and maintain a \nsanctions regime on Russia that is having a measurable impact. We must \nstay united on sanctions until the Minsk II agreement is fully \nimplemented and Crimea is returned to Ukrainian control.\n  For years, Russia has also sought to erode support for EU \ninstitutions though a sustained propaganda campaign across the Union. \nWe understand that Russia works to fund and influence anti-EU political \nparties, think tanks, NGOs, and media voices within the Union and among \naspirant countries.\n  Russia is using the very strengths of Europe's democratic societies \nagainst it--free press, civil society, and open debate. We should be \nprepared to push back against these revanchist efforts, not through \npropaganda, but a clear and forceful debate on facts.\n  Russia has not been reluctant to use its energy resources as a weapon \nas it seeks to pursue its ambitions, including by withholding energy \nexports to Europe in order to extract concessions on other issues. Much \nof Europe imports a considerable share of its oil and gas supplies from \nRussia.\n  The EU plays an important role in negotiating energy deals with \nRussia and must constantly contend with the threat that the country \nposes to the energy needs of member states. The collective negotiating \npower the EU wields with Russia is critical to ensuring the individual \nenergy security of all EU nations.\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\n  Finally, UK Prime Minister Cameron is negotiating a new settlement \nbetween Britain and the 27 other members of the EU prior to a \nreferendum this summer on the UK's continued participation in the EU. \nAlthough the Prime Minister has said that the ``best answer'' is for \nthe UK to remain part of a reformed EU, it is up to the British \ncitizens to vote to remain within the Union.\n  All of this matters greatly to the United States. EU member states \ninclude some of our oldest and closest allies in the world. Our \npartnership with the EU has afforded us the possibility of addressing \nsome of the most challenging international issues--this partnership has \nmade us safer and stronger.\n  We also draw great economic benefit from a stable EU--the Union is \nour largest trading partner and our economies are intertwined in \nbeneficial ways for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic. This \npartnership is vital to our interests, but only works if the EU's \ninstitutions are vibrant and able to respond to the challenges before \nit.\n  While many of these problems will be up to the EU member states to \nresolve, I strongly believe that we should stand in solidarity with the \nUnion through this difficult period and take tangible action to support \nour friends.\n  First, we must continue to make clear our support for the democratic \nprinciples that serve as the basis for the EU and should be clear in \nspeaking out against the growing chorus of illiberal voices. The U.S. \nshould reenergize ties with civil society across the continent, \nespecially in Central and Eastern Europe where strong civil society \nconnections established after the Cold War atrophied as attention \nshifted elsewhere.\n  We also need to reinvigorate the transatlantic dialogue--among \ngovernments, think tanks, NGOs, and civil society organizations--on \nthese issues. The transatlantic relationship always has and always will \nbenefit from enhanced ties among our people.\n  The U.S. should also work to develop a new generation of foreign \npolicy and security policy leaders and analysts that focus on Europe \nand the centrality that the continent has for our interests.\n  Second, we should support European efforts to bolster energy security \nacross the continent in a way that ensures reliability and decreased \ndependence on Russian supply.\n  Third, we should continue to work with Europe on strengthening \nsecurity, its border controls, and the vitality of the Schengen visa-\nfree zone. This means sharing of intelligence and best practices on how \nto prevent terrorist attacks before they happen. I also want to applaud \nthe administration's intention to invest $3.4 billion into the European \nReassurance Initiative, which will ensure a sustained U.S. military \npresence in Europe to help deter further Russian aggression.\n  Fourth, we should continue our robust support for the UN High \nCommissioner for Refugees, International Organizations for Migration, \nand several outstanding NGOs which work directly with refugees and \nmigrants across Europe. We should be proud of this commitment and \ncontinue to support the most vulnerable populations.\n  Fifth, we should continue to work closely with the EU and member \nstates on working to ensure that the Minsk II deal is fully \nimplemented. Success to date has been rooted in U.S.-EU solidarity, and \nwe must finish the job--the sanctions regime must remain in place until \nMinsk II is realized and Crimea is returned to Ukrainian control.\n  Finally, we should continue our robust support for Ukraine while \nholding the government accountable to progress in the fight against \ncorruption. I am concerned by the recent departure of Ukraine's \nMinister of Economy who resigned in protest against the slow pace of \nreform and anticorruption efforts.\n  The U.S. Congress passed two pieces of legislation last year \nsupporting Ukraine's economy, Ukrainian civil society, and the \ngovernment's broad-based reform efforts. Although some progress has \nbeen made, we must finish the job.\n  The success of Ukraine will be the success of Europe and the ideals \nthat have drawn sovereign states to join its ranks for the last 75 \nyears. I call on this body to continue to support Ukraine's reformers \nthroughout civil society and government as they continue to make real \nstrides towards integration with the west and adoption of the \ndemocratic ideals that we uphold.\n  More importantly, I again call upon Ukraine's leaders to prove that \nthey are serious about countering corruption. The international \ncommunity's patience in this regard exists, but is not limitless. We \nneed to see concrete results soon.\n  In 2012, the Nobel Peace prize was awarded in recognition of the EU's \ncentral role in providing stability in Europe. The chairman of the \nNobel committee said the following at the ceremony: ``We are not \ngathered here today in the belief that the EU is perfect. We are \ngathered in the belief that here in Europe we must solve our problems \ntogether. For that purpose we need institutions that can enter into the \nnecessary compromises. We need institutions to ensure that both nation-\nstates and individuals exercise self-control and moderation. In a world \nof so many dangers, compromise, self-control and moderation are the \nprincipal needs of the 21st century.''\n  These words continue to ring true today as pressure on the Union \ngrows. Across the ocean here in the U.S., we should resolutely stand in \nsolidarity with our friends in Europe and the principles they embrace. \nNever before has the EU been so challenged or our transatlantic \nalliance so valuable. We must bolster our ties this year and renew our \ncommitment to a robust transatlantic relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S666-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S666-S667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   GENERIC DRUG USER FEE AMENDMENTS: ACCELERATING PATIENT ACCESS TO \n                             GENERIC DRUGS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks to the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\nGeneric Drug User Fee Amendments: Accelerating Patient Access to \nGeneric Drugs\n       In December, the president signed into law the Every \n     Student Succeeds Act, a bill to fix No Child Left Behind and \n     proof that this committee can work together to tackle very \n     difficult issues.\n       But a law not properly implemented isn't worth the paper \n     it's written on, which is why I'm going to be working with \n     Senator Murray to set up a strong oversight process during \n     2016 to make sure the teachers, governors, chief state school \n     officers, parents and students who counted on us to fix that \n     law see that it's implemented properly.\n       We're here today for a similar purpose: to conduct \n     oversight of the 2012 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     Safety and Innovation Act--specifically the law's Generic \n     Drug User Fee Amendments, which are fees negotiated between \n     the FDA and generic drug makers to give the agency additional \n     resources intended to speed the review of generic drugs.\n       This is Congress' first oversight hearing since these \n     agreements were passed in 2012, and it comes at a critical \n     time for patients: Despite the FDA receiving nearly $1 \n     billion in user fees since 2012 as a result of these user fee \n     agreements, performance is not living up to Congress' or \n     patients' expectations, as the number of generic drugs \n     approved per year remains about the same.\n       The user fee agreements are due to be reauthorized next \n     year, and discussions between the FDA and industry are \n     already underway--making now the appropriate time for us to \n     better understand whether or not these 2012 agreements are \n     working to give Americans better access to generic drugs.\n       The generic drug program, established by the Hatch-Waxman \n     Amendments over 30 years ago, has had great success \n     increasing competition and lowering drug prices.\n       The program was created to make it easier for generic drugs \n     to enter the market.\n       Let me quickly explain how this works: Once a drug is \n     approved by the FDA, for example, Lipitor--which is widely \n     used to help lower cholesterol--no other manufacturer can \n     make that drug for a period of time. When that period of time \n     expires, a manufacturer may make a copy of that drug--and we \n     call that a generic drug.\n       That generic copy must also have FDA approval.\n       This generic approval process doesn't include full clinical \n     trials, which often are long and expensive, contributing to \n     higher prices for brand drugs.\n       As a result, more generic drugs in the market creates \n     competition and lowers prices for consumers.\n       And today, 88 percent of prescription drugs purchased in \n     the United States are generic drugs.\n       However, in 2012, 26 years after the law first passed, it \n     became clear the generic drug approval program needed an \n     overhaul.\n       More generic drugs were coming from overseas. Generic drug \n     companies in China and India were inspected much less \n     frequently than American companies, putting American\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\n     companies at a disadvantage and, more importantly, putting \n     patients at risk.\n       There was a backlog of 4,700 applications waiting to be \n     reviewed, and the median approval time to get review of a \n     generic drug was 30 months, far surpassing the 180-day \n     timeframe for review as laid out in the Hatch-Waxman \n     amendments in 1984.\n       Additionally, in 2012, many generic sterile injectable \n     drugs were in shortage, causing doctors and hospitals to \n     scramble to ensure patients were getting the best treatment \n     possible.\n       To address these problems, Congress passed the first \n     Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (often referred to by its \n     acronym GDUFA or as congressional staff and industry insiders \n     call it--``Ga-DOO-Fa'') as part of the FDA Safety and \n     Innovation Act.\n       This built on the success of similar agreements that \n     Congress had previously passed between drug and device \n     manufacturers and their regulators in the FDA.\n       This user fee agreement was the first agreement between the \n     generic industry and the FDA on how to improve the review \n     process for generic drugs.\n       With the enactment of these amendments, Congress \n     anticipated:\n       One: that generic drug facilities abroad would be brought \n     up to the same standards as facilities in the United States; \n     and\n       Two: that American patients would benefit from faster \n     approval of generic drugs. These two actions would bring more \n     competition to the market and lower the price of drugs for \n     consumers.\n       But there are concerns about the implementation of this \n     program.\n       Some progress has been made on the backlog of applications \n     for generic drugs--some progress, but certainly not enough. \n     In 2012 there was a backlog of 4,700 pending applications and \n     that has now dropped to just over 3,500 applications pending \n     approval, according to the Generic Pharmaceutical \n     Association.\n       The HHS Inspector General has reported that the FDA is \n     improving its inspections abroad, one of the important goals \n     of the user fee agreements.\n       But, the troubling news is that it is taking longer for the \n     FDA to get drugs through the approval process, and according \n     to a survey of generic drug makers, the median approval times \n     have slowed from 30 to 48 months.\n       According to one estimate, once there are six or more \n     generic competitors, a drug costs about 10 percent of the \n     brand price--so, these slower approval times mean less \n     competition and higher costs for consumers.\n       This slowdown in approval time is despite the fact that the \n     FDA has received nearly $1 billion in user fees since this \n     law was passed--that's funding that is on top of the money \n     that Congress annually provides to the FDA through the \n     appropriations bill.\n       That's about $300 million a year, or 20 percent of the \n     total amount that the FDA spent researching, inspecting, and \n     reviewing all drugs--generic and brand name alike--in fiscal \n     year 2015.\n       I understand that the FDA has met most of the goals laid \n     out in the agreement for industry user fees for regulatory \n     actions, hiring staff, and increasing inspections.\n       But I look forward to hearing whether these metrics are the \n     most appropriate, given I continue to hear that generic drug \n     approval is too slow from manufacturers and patients.\n       While industry provides funding according to the agreement, \n     the American taxpayer, through the Congressional \n     appropriations process, provided over 40 percent for the \n     generic drug review program in fiscal year 2014, according to \n     the FDA's financial report.\n       But the data points that matter to American people are \n     generic drug approval times and the number of approvals, \n     which to them mean increased market competition, a reduction \n     in drug shortages, and more, lower-cost drugs available for \n     patients.\n       Another issue we're hearing a lot about is drug pricing--\n     and here are some points to consider:\n       One: While the cost of drugs is a legitimate concern for \n     many Americans--it's part of an even larger problem of rising \n     health care costs.\n       Just this week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     announced in its annual ``Budget and Economic Outlook'' that \n     for the first time, federal spending for the major health \n     care programs (Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, Obamacare) \n     represents the largest fraction--more than 60 percent--of the \n     projected growth in mandatory spending in 2016. CBO notes \n     that this spending is partially driven by the increase in per \n     capita health care costs.\n       Two: While we work to lower the cost of drugs, we need to \n     invest in and incentivize the development of life-saving \n     therapies.\n       Congress last year added $2 billion in the appropriations \n     process, bringing NIH's total budget in FY2016 up to around \n     $32 billion--but this is still less than what's spent in the \n     private sector.\n       Members of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of America, who \n     only represent a portion of the market, spent over $50 \n     billion in FY2014 alone coming up with new cures and \n     treatments.\n       The clinical trials required to prove that medicine is safe \n     cost hundreds of millions of dollars, even for the ninety \n     percent of drugs that fail. In addition, the regulatory \n     approval process is lengthy, which also adds costs.\n       As a result of this effort, biotech and drug companies big \n     and small have done remarkable things to help patients with \n     diseases like HIV, Cystic Fibrosis, and cancer live longer, \n     healthier lives--a critical development we do not want to \n     interrupt.\n       Third: To best restrain the growth of drug prices we must \n     encourage investment in life-saving therapies, avoid \n     unnecessary regulatory burdens that slow down development and \n     drive up costs, and ensure the marketplace remains \n     competitive.\n       For the past year, this committee--in a bipartisan way--has \n     been looking at ways to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden \n     so we can get safe, innovative, life-saving therapies into \n     patients' medicine cabinets more quickly.\n       At the same time, Sens. Collins and McCaskill, leaders of \n     the Aging Committee, have been examining what improvements \n     may be necessary to ensure that the FDA expedites \n     applications for generic drugs to keep the marketplace \n     competitive, which will help keep drug prices down, and I \n     look forward to working with them on that effort.\n       The generic drug industry really is a remarkable story. \n     Over the last 30 years--generic drugs have gone from a very \n     small fraction of the marketplace to 88 percent. It's hard to \n     imagine what the prescription drug market would look like \n     today without generic drugs.\n       I look forward to hearing from our witness today to learn \n     more about where Congress can help make improvements to the \n     regulatory process and ensure that the FDA has the tools it \n     needs to create a generic drug review system that functions \n     as Congress intended and as American patients and taxpayers \n     deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S667-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO DWAN EDWARDS AND BROCK OSWEILER\n\n Mr. DAINES.

He then went on to play for Oregon State University and \neventually was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in 2004, where he played \nfor five seasons. In 2010, he was picked up by the Buffalo Bills for \ntwo seasons. He signed with the Carolina Panthers in 2012 and is now \nplaying in his 12th NFL season.\n  Dwan has certainly not forgotten where he is from. He is currently \nmaking arrangements to bring former Columbus High School football coach \nJohn Smith out to watch Dwan play in his first Super Bowl game. This \nsummer, he will put on the eighth Dwan Edwards Elite Football camp, \nwhere he spends a week in Billings helping young players develop their \nfootball skills.\n  Brock represents Kalispell, where he attended Flathead High School. \nHe graduated in 2009 as an honor roll student and was coached by \nRussell McGarvel. Brock played college football for Arizona State and \nwas drafted by the Denver Broncos in 2012.\n  During his time playing in the NFL, he has given back to Flathead and \nits football program by regularly sending letters of encouragement to \nthe high school team and donating a Flathead Football captains board in \n2014. The football team's captains' names are etched into the board \neach year, which serves as a great honor for these young leaders.\n  My biggest congratulations goes out to both of these fine men for \nrepresenting the great State of Montana well, both on and off the \nfield.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Col. \nJeannie Leavitt on her recent selection as commander of the 57th Wing \nat Nellis Air Force Base. Colonel Leavitt is the first woman to command \nthe wing, making her the highest ranking female officer to command at \nNellis AFB. It gives me great pleasure to recognize her achievement in \nthis historic moment.\n  Colonel Leavitt joined the U.S. Air Force in 1992 after earning her \nbachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas \nand her\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\nmaster's degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford \nUniversity. She completed pilot training at the top of her class in \n1992, kicking off the start of her successful career. Since then, she \nhas logged over 300 hours of combat, serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nas well as Operation Southern Watch.\n  In 1993, Colonel Leavitt became the first female fighter pilot and \nlater the service's first woman to graduate from the Air Force Weapons \nSchool at Nellis AFB. In addition, in 2012, she became the Nation's \nfirst female fighter wing commander when she assumed command of the 4th \nFighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, and \nshe will now be the first woman to assume command of the 57th Wing at \nthe Silver State's Nellis AFB. She is truly a role model, demonstrating \na great amount of strength and courage.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Colonel Leavitt for her courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America. Her unwavering \ndedication to her career is commendable, and she stands as a shining \nexample for future generations of heroes. Colonel Leavitt's service to \nher country and her bravery earn her a place among the outstanding men \nand women who have valiantly defended our nation.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. Equally as important, it is crucial that female \nservicemembers and veterans have access to their specific health care \nneeds. There are countless distinguished women who have made sacrifices \nbeyond measure and deserve nothing but the best treatment. I remain \ncommitted to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers \nin Nevada and throughout the Nation and will continue to fight until \nthis becomes a reality.\n  During her tenure, Colonel Leavitt has demonstrated professionalism, \ncommitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of \nthe Air Force. I am both humbled and honored by her service and am \nproud to have such a distinguished member of the Air Force serving in \nthe State of Nevada. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Colonel Leavitt for all of her accomplishments and wish her \nwell in all of her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S668-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JANE ALBRIGHT\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a true \nrole model in the Nevada Wolf Pack community, women's basketball coach \nJane Albright, on reaching a significant milestone of 500 collegiate \nbasketball wins. This is a tremendous accomplishment for Ms. Albright, \nwho has dedicated eight seasons to making Nevada women's basketball the \nbest it can be.\n  Ms. Albright began her career coaching collegiate basketball in 1981, \nwhen she served as a graduate assistant for the University of \nTennessee. She later spent one season as an assistant coach at the \nUniversity of Cincinnati before taking on her first role as head coach \nat Northern Illinois. During her 10 seasons with this university, Ms. \nAlbright led the women's basketball team in its most successful run in \nNorthern Illinois history with a record of 188 wins to 110 losses from \n1984-94.\n  Following her tenure at Northern Illinois, Ms. Albright coached the \nwomen's basketball team at the University of Wisconsin, where she \nrevitalized the program. Ms. Albright led this team, which previously \nhad experienced nine losing seasons, to eight consecutive winning \nseasons. Prior to her tenure with the University of Nevada, Reno, UNR, \nMs. Albright served as head coach at Wichita State.\n  Beginning in 2008, Ms. Albright became a member of the Pack, taking \non the role of UNR's head women's basketball coach. Throughout her \nfirst year at Nevada, Ms. Albright achieved the most wins as a first-\nyear coach, with an overall record of 18 wins to 14 losses. In that \nsame season, she also picked up her 400th career win when Nevada \ndefeated Northern Iowa. In the 2013-14 season, Ms. Albright led the \nWolf Pack in winning 12 Mountain West games, setting a program record \nfor most conference wins in a single season and securing the number \nthree seed for the Mountain West Championships.\n  She was also awarded the 2014 Carol Eckman Award this season, \nrecognizing her for her commitment to the incredible student athletes \non her team. On January 27, 2016, Ms. Albright reached her 500th career \nwin, leading the Pack against San Diego State. Her ability as a coach \nis remarkable, and we are lucky to have someone like Ms. Albright \nrepresenting UNR.\n  Aside from her incredible record as a coach, Ms. Albright also goes \nabove and beyond to keep her team involved in the community, as well as \nin the classroom. In 2009-10 alone, UNR logged more than 530 hours of \nservice to the city of Reno. Ms. Albright is a shining example of true \nleadership for our community.\n  Ms. Albright is an inspiration to many across northern Nevada both on \nand off the basketball court. Her enthusiasm and passion for her team \nhave not gone unnoticed. Today I join citizens across the Silver State \nin congratulating Ms. Albright on this incredible achievement and wish \nher well as she continues to lead the Nevada Wolf Pack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S668-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S668-S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING MICHAEL A. WERMUTH\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nlife of Michael Wermuth of Birmingham, AL.\n  Michael Anthony Wermuth was born in Birmingham, AL, in 1946, was \ncommissioned in the U.S. Army upon graduating from the University of \nAlabama, earned his law degree from the University of Alabama School of \nLaw, and practiced law in Mobile, AL, as a partner of the firm Wilkins, \nDruhan & Wermuth. While in Mobile, Mike became involved in local \npolitics and worked on the senatorial campaign of ADM Jeremiah A. \nDenton. Upon Admiral Denton's election to the Senate, Mike and his \nfamily moved to Washington where he served as Senator Denton's chief \ncounsel and legislative director from 1980 to 1987.\n  After his time in the U.S. Senate, Mike served in the Department of \nJustice as a legislative counsel for civil rights and was Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General for legislative affairs. In 1989, he was \nnamed Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for drug enforcement policy \nand was instrumental in the implementation of President George H.W. \nBush's national drug control strategy that was highly effective in \nreducing drug use and importation.\n  After 30 years of service, Mike retired as a colonel in the Army \nReserves. That same year, he joined the RAND Corporation as the \ndirector of its homeland security program and was the executive \ndirector of a Federal advisory panel on terrorism. During his time at \nRAND, he worked on a variety of issues including infrastructure \nprotection, emergency preparedness, risk management, border control, \nand intelligence.\n  After leaving RAND in 2010, Mike continued his work as a consultant \nthere and served as an adjunct faculty member at the Texas A \nUniversity Bush School of Government and Public Service. He taught \ngraduate level online courses in homeland security defense. His \ninfluence in terrorism defense strategy was vast, and his enduring \nlegacy will be his dedication to the stewardship of the next generation \nof policymakers.\n  I knew Mike for many years. In Mobile, we served in the same Army \nReserve center. He was a conscientious and superior officer with a \nsteady sense of duty and love of country. As a top member of Senator \nDenton's staff, he was dedicated, loyal, and effective. He was tireless \nin his work to advance the agenda in which Senator Denton so deeply \nbelieved. I can say his support and that of Senator Denton was critical \nto my appointment as U.S. attorney. In the U.S. Army, the U.S. Senate, \nthe Department of Justice, the RAND Corporation, and as a teacher and \nlawyer, Mike always excelled. Discipline, work, loyalty, and patriotism \nwere his hallmarks. He was indeed a talented American patriot.\n  Michael passed away on November 1, 2015. He is survived by his \nwonderful wife of 35 years, Fran; his children, Ken and Heather; and \nnumerous other family members. His partner throughout, Fran is highly \naccomplished in her own right having served in top positions within the \nU.S. Marshals Service. Our\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\nsympathy is extended to her, the family, and friends upon his \npassing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S669-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEWPORT WINTER CARNIVAL\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the 100th anniversary Newport \nWinter Carnival opens this week to great expectations. Citizens in \nNewport, NH, are pretty confident that theirs is the oldest continuous \nwinter carnival in the Nation, and they are certain it is the very \nbest.\n  Newport is a town of classic New England charm, nestled in the scenic \nhills of western New Hampshire. Much has changed in Newport since the \ntown held its first winter carnival. A century ago, the swift currents \nof the Sugar River turned water wheels that powered the town's \nprosperous textile mills. During long winters, townspeople enjoyed \nskiing, skating, snowshoeing, and other activities that were at the \nheart of the first Newport Winter Carnival.\n  Today those mills are no longer in operation, but their handsome \nbrick buildings have been repurposed as offices, shops, restaurants, \nand apartments. Like many other former mill towns in rural New \nHampshire, Newport has weathered economic challenges in recent decades. \nDuring many visits over the years, I have admired the town's resilience \nand indomitable spirit, which have earned it the nickname ``the \nSunshine Town.''\n  Despite a century of dramatic changes and challenges, the Newport \nWinter Carnival has been a proud constant. People from neighboring \ncommunities come to Newport in midwinter to enjoy the warmth and \nfriendliness of their neighbors and to have lots of old-fashioned fun.\n  This year's carnival will begin with a reenactment. In 1917, a \nDartmouth student from Newport skied the 29 miles from Hanover to his \nhometown to enjoy the Winter Carnival. His feat will be reenacted on \nFriday by his grandson and five others, who will light the ceremonial \ntorch on Newport Common to start the festival. Festivities this year \ninclude the traditional Carnival Queen contest, a parade and talent \npageant, broom hockey games, skijoring, and an arm wrestling \ncompetition with ``armed and ready'' Cathy Merrill, a Newport resident \nwho recently won gold medals at the U.S. Arm Wrestling Nationals. The \ncarnival will close on Sunday evening, February 14, with a fireworks \ndisplay.\n  I salute the Newport carnival committee and the scores of additional \nvolunteers who put in countless hours to make the carnival a success. \nFor them, this is truly a labor of love. I also salute the townspeople \nand families of Newport, who warmly welcome visitors not only for the \ncarnival, but year-round, and always make us proud to be Granite \nStaters.\n  Congratulations to the entire Newport community, and I wish everyone \nyet another successful Newport Winter Carnival.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S669-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S669-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S669-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Hatch) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills, which were previously signed by the Speaker \nof the House:\n\n       H.R. 515.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to allow for \nadvertising relating to certain activities in compliance with State \nlaw; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Marijuana \nAdvertising In Legal States Act to allow small businesses and \nnewspapers in States that have legalized marijuana to advertise \nmarijuana products.\n  In the last few years, voters in Oregon, Washington, Colorado and \nAlaska overwhelmingly approved initiatives to legalize the adult use \nand sale of marijuana. Additionally, 23 States, the District of \nColumbia and Guam have legalized full medical marijuana programs, and \n17 more States have approved more limited medical marijuana programs. \nIn many of these States, State-approved dispensaries are up and \nrunning, bringing the industry out of the shadows of the black market \nand creating a safe, regulated system in much of America.\n  Despite passage of these state laws, marijuana remains stuck in the \npast as a Schedule I substance according to the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act, CSA. This designation means it is a felony to \ndistribute, possess or consume it. Recognizing this discrepancy, the \nObama administration issued a memorandum in 2013 which held: so long as \ncertain enforcement criteria were met, Federal law enforcement entities \nwould not interfere with legal state marijuana activity. Congress then \nfollowed suit and barred the Department of Justice from expending \nresources in contravention of state medical marijuana laws.\n  However, since marijuana is designated as a Schedule I substance, \naccording to Federal law it is still unlawful for anyone to place an \nadvertisement for marijuana, including a medical marijuana product, in \nany newspaper, magazine, handbill or other publication, even if that \nactivity is legal under State law. This creates a legally conflicted \nreality in States, like Oregon, where marijuana is legal for those \nmarijuana businesses that seek to advertise in local newspapers, as \nwell as for the many newspapers around the country that rely on \nadvertising revenue.\n  Further complicating the matter, the United States Postal Service, \nUSPS, recently declared that it is illegal to mail any items, including \nnewspapers, which contain advertisements offering\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\nto buy or sell marijuana, even if the marijuana-related activity is in \ncompliance with a state law. The USPS stated that if it uncovers any \nitems deemed to be ``non-mailable,'' it would report the item to the \nPostal Inspection Service, which would refer it to a law enforcement \nagency for investigation. Despite the 2013 Obama administration memo \nindicating Federal law enforcement would not interfere, these \nbusinesses are concerned. Small businesses and community newspapers \nrely on the USPS to reach their customers, especially in rural areas. \nThe USPS policy could have the effect of stopping all written marijuana \nadvertisements in states that have already made the decision to \nlegalize marijuana, which would be a blow to newspapers and small \nbusinesses that are already struggling financially.\n  My proposal would create a narrow exception in CSA to allow for the \nwritten advertisement of an activity, involving marijuana, if it is in \ncompliance with State law.\n  I am pleased to be joined on this bill by my colleague from Oregon \nSenator Jeff Merkley who has worked closely with me over the years to \nensure that the decision that Oregon voters made at the polls is \nrespected by the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 403(c)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 843(c)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: ``This paragraph does not apply to an \n     advertisement to the extent that the advertisement relates to \n     an activity, involving marihuana, that is in compliance with \n     the law of the State in which that activity takes place.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Franken, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 2506. A bill to restore statutory rights to the people of the \nUnited States from forced arbitration; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation I am \nintroducing today to protect workers and families in Vermont and across \nthe country who are being forced to give up crucial rights because of \nlegal fine print forced on them by corporations.\n  The Restoring Statutory Rights Act combats the injustice of forced \narbitration. It will ensure that hardworking men and women can \nvindicate their rights in court instead of being forced into a private, \nshadow justice program. Some of the contracts people sign \nautomatically, with little, tiny type, say: If we overbill you, if we \ngive you defective equipment, if we do anything to you, it will go to \narbitration. Guess what. The only people who primarily get to pick the \narbitrators are those who side with the corporations.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this legislation on behalf of myself, \nMr. Franken, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Whitehouse.\n  Today I want to speak about a problem that many Americans are unaware \nof but that affects all of us in our daily lives. When Americans sign \ncell phone agreements, rent an apartment, or accept a contract for a \njob, most of us focus on the service we are about to receive or that we \nare about to provide. What Americans do not realize--until it is too \nlate--is that too often we are also signing away crucial legal rights. \nLegal fine print tips the scales against us. It is forcing consumers \ninto private arbitration, denying us of our constitutional right to \nprotect ourselves in court and to have others learn about the harm \ncaused by corporations.\n  This problem has meaningful, real-world implications for Americans' \nability to seek justice. When victims are forced into private \narbitration, their cases proceed without public record. The cases \ncannot serve as precedent for future injustices, and the plaintiffs--\nhardworking consumers--cannot obtain a meaningful appeal. An arbitrator \nis selected by the corporate defendant, creating incentives that favor \nrepeat corporate players. In many cases, forced arbitration stops \nvictims' legal actions altogether: by requiring victims to waive their \nlegal right to join with other victims in a class action, arbitration \nclauses often remove the crucial tool that plaintiffs need to afford \npursuing their claims.\n  The injustice of forced arbitration affects consumers, workers, \nseniors, veterans, and families in every State across the country. The \ncases are heart-wrenching. In one recent case, a pregnant woman \nsuffered a tragic miscarriage and was not able to work for 7 days. When \nshe returned to work, she was fired. When this woman attempted to hold \nher employer accountable in court for violating the Family and Medical \nLeave Act and her State's pregnancy discrimination laws, her case was \nforced into private arbitration. We do not know the outcome of the \ncase, but that is precisely the problem. In private arbitration, there \nis no way to know if she obtained justice, no precedent to deter other \nemployers from such behavior, and no public accountability for the \ncorporation that may have violated both State and Federal law.\n  In another recent case, an hourly employee at a hospital realized she \nwas not being paid for all of the time she worked because her \nemployer's payroll system was ``rounding down'' her time. When she \nattempted to bring a class action on behalf of all the hourly employees \nat the hospital, her lawsuit was dismissed and forced into individual \narbitration. To seek justice, the hospital employees must now pay to \nbring their complaints case-by-case, even though the cost of bringing \nan individual arbitration almost certainly outweighs the lost wages any \nworker would receive.\n  Forced arbitration has also been a favorite tool for well-heeled \ncorporations to make an end-run around our civil rights laws. When \nworking women are paid less for doing the same job; when minorities are \ndenied promotions despite their success; or when banks target poor \nminority neighborhoods with predatory loans, the closed and \nunaccountable forum of private arbitration lets them conceal their \ndiscriminatory actions.\n  This system of forced arbitration denies individuals access to \njustice. But it also guts vital protections we have fought for in our \nlaws. Whether we are talking about family and medical leave, equal pay, \nor crucial civil rights protections, what strength do our laws have \nwhen the legal process Congress created to enforce them is stripped \naway without recourse? Through legal fine print, corporations are \ngiving themselves a ``get out of jail free'' pass that guts citizens' \nrights and shields bad actors from accountability.\n  When Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act, it was intended to \ngive sophisticated businesses an alternative venue to resolve their \ndisputes. There is a valid role for arbitration when parties choose it \nwillingly, after a dispute arises, as an alternative to court. But \narbitration should not be forced upon consumers and workers through \ntake-it-or-leave it contracts they have no real choice but to accept. \nAnd it should not--it must not--prevent Americans from enforcing their \nrights under fundamental State and Federal laws.\n  Nor should Federal law interfere when States take action to address \nthe injustice of forced arbitration. A full 47 of our 50 States have \ntried to protect their citizens in some way from forced arbitration, \nbut these efforts have been thwarted by Federal law. In Vermont, \nlawmakers required that arbitration clauses be accompanied by a written \nacknowledgement signed by both parties, to ensure that consumers were \naware of them. This reasonable, commonsense requirement was invalidated \nbecause it conflicted with Federal law.\n  Following a 2011 Supreme Court case, AT v. Concepcion, other \nefforts in Vermont and across the country to protect citizens from \nforced arbitration have also been invalidated. Vermonters who tried to \nsue their phone service provider for disturbing them with unwanted text \nmessages and Vermont drivers who tried to sue their car insurers over \ncoverage have all been forced into private arbitration despite \nconflicting measures in Vermont law. This restriction on States' \nauthority is wrong, especially when the enforceability of contracts is \ntraditionally an area left to State law. This is not a partisan issue. \nBoth Republican and Democratic attorneys general have repeatedly spoken \nout against the Federal Arbitration Act's intrusion on State \nsovereignty and a State's compelling interest in protecting the health \nand welfare of its citizens.\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\n  Congress must act to stop these abuses. That is why today I am \nintroducing legislation to limit the injustice of forced arbitration \nand protect Americans' right to seek justice in our courts. The \nRestoring Statutory Rights Act will ensure that critical State and \nFederal laws can actually be effective, by ensuring that citizens \ncannot be stripped of their ability to enforce their rights using our \nindependent justice system. It will also ensure that when States take \naction to address forced arbitration, they are not preempted by an \noverbroad reading of our Federal arbitration laws.\n  This effort is supported by the Leadership Conference for Civil and \nHuman Rights, the National Employment Lawyers' Association, Americans \nFor Financial Reform, Alliance for Justice, Earthjustice and consumer \ngroups such as Consumers Union, Public Citizen, the National Consumer \nLaw Center, and Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety. These groups \nand many others have worked tirelessly to highlight the injustice of \nforced arbitration and the unparalleled scope and number of people it \naffects.\n  All Senators should care about the implications of forced arbitration \nfor statutes that this body writes, debates, and enacts into law. \nSenators should also care about their home States' ability to protect \nconsumers from unconscionable contracts when their State chooses to \nact. I urge Members to support this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the widespread \nand harmful impact of forced arbitration--mandatory arbitration. Last \nNovember, the New York Times published a three-part investigative \nseries, which I recommend to every Member, on the pervasive use of \nforced arbitration--or mandatory arbitration. Mandatory arbitration is \na privatized system of justice that corporations rely on when their \ncustomers or workers seek justice for being cheated, injured, or \nmistreated.\n  The series in the New York Times, while shocking, illustrates \nsomething that I have been saying for a long time: Mandatory \narbitration agreements--forced arbitration agreements, which are often \nburied in the fine print of employment and service contracts, severely \nrestrict Americans' access to justice by stripping consumers and \nworkers of their legal rights and insulating corporations from \nliability. From nursing home contracts and employment agreements to \ncredit card and cell phone contracts, corporate America uses forced \narbitration clauses to rig the system against ordinary Americans in a \nwide variety of cases.\n  My staff recently heard from a Minnesota lawyer who represents \nfamilies with serious injury and wrongful death claims. He told the \nheartbreaking story of a man who suffered from dementia and was \neventually checked into a nursing home. Twenty-one days after entering \nthe home, it became clear to the man's family that his life was in \ndanger; he was rapidly losing weight and had fallen into a coma. He was \nthen sent to a hospital, where it was discovered that he was suffering \nfrom ``profound dehydration.'' Unfortunately, the hospital could not \ncorrect the harm caused by the nursing home, and the man died shortly \nthereafter. He was 71 years old. Then, instead of being able to take \nthe nursing home to court, the man's family was forced to settle their \nwrongful death claim through arbitration. When all was said and done, \nthe arbitrators actually received greater compensation than the family, \nand the nursing home got away with a slap on the wrist.\n  Egregious cases like that of this Minnesota family are not rare. Time \nand again, arbitration clauses stack the deck in favor of big business \nand against consumers, as if the deck weren't stacked enough already. \nAs the number of unbelievable stories grows, the need for reform has \nbecome clearer and more urgent. That is why I am proud to be joining \nSenator Leahy, as well as Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, and Whitehouse, \nin introducing the Restoring Statutory Rights Act to ensure that \nAmericans can enforce their civil rights.\n  As Members of Congress, we have fought hard to pass legislation that \nwill protect Americans from discrimination. This critical work is \nundermined, however, if we strip away their right to go to court and \ninstead force these claims into a privatized justice system.\n  Remember that corporations can write the rules for the arbitration \nproceedings; everything can be done in secret, without public rulings; \ndiscovery can be limited, making it hard for consumers to get the \nevidence they need to prove their case; and there is no meaningful \njudicial review, so there is not much a consumer or an employee can do \nif the arbitrator gets it wrong. It is simply not fair.\n  I have also introduced with a number of colleagues my own bill, the \nArbitration Fairness Act, which would fix these unfair practices by \namending the Federal Arbitration Act to prohibit the use of mandatory, \npredispute arbitration agreements in consumer, employment, civil \nrights, and anti-trust cases. This bill gives Americans a real choice: \nIf a consumer or worker wants to take his claim into arbitration, then, \nby all means, he is free to do so, provided that the corporation is \nwilling to do so as well. However, if the consumer or employee wants to \ngo to court, that option will once again be available.\n  To put it simply, both of these bills are about reopening the \ncourthouse doors to American consumers and workers, because the \ncourthouse doors never should have been closed in the first place.\n  I ask others to please join me in fighting back against mandatory \narbitration and cosponsor the Restoring Statutory Rights Act and the \nArbitration Fairness Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/04/senate-section/article/S673-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S673-S674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 362--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MONTAGNARD \n  INDIGENOUS TRIBESPEOPLE OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OF VIETNAM TO THE \n UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES DURING THE VIETNAM WAR, AND CONDEMNING THE \n ONGOING VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST \n                          REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mr. Tillis) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

 Whereas, after the Vietnam War, the United States \n     Government resettled large numbers of Montagnards, mostly in \n     North Carolina, and an estimated several thousand Montagnards \n

one-party state, ruled and controlled by the Communist \n     Party of Vietnam (CPV), which continues to restrict freedom \n     of religion, movement, land and property rights, and \n     political expression;\n       Whereas officials of the Government of Vietnam have forced \n     Montagnards to publicly denounce their religion, arrested and \n     imprisoned Montagnards who organized public demonstrations, \n     and mistreated Montagnards in detention;\n       Whereas some Montagnard Americans have complained that \n     Vietnamese authorities either have prevented them from \n     visiting Vietnam or have subjected them to interrogation upon \n     re-entering the country on visits;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2014 Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices (``2014 Human Rights Report'') \n     documents that, despite Vietnam's significant economic \n     growth, some indigenous and ethnic minority communities \n     benefitted little from improved economic conditions, even \n     though such communities formed a majority of the population \n     in certain areas, including the Northwest and Central \n     Highlands and portions of the Mekong Delta;\n       Whereas the 2014 Human Rights Report states that, although \n     Vietnamese law prohibits discrimination against ethnic \n     minorities, such social discrimination was longstanding and \n     persistent, notably in the Central Highlands;\n       Whereas the 2014 Human Rights Report documents that land \n     rights protesters have reported regular instances of \n     government authorities physically harassing and intimidating \n     them at land expropriation sites around the country;\n       Whereas, in its 2015 Annual Report, the United States \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) \n     references the accounts of Montagnards, including children, \n     fleeing persecution in Vietnam to seek refugee status in \n     Cambodia, only to suffer harsh conditions while hiding in the \n     jungles and forcibly returned to Vietnam by Cambodian \n     officials;\n       Whereas USCIRF reports the Government of Vietnam continues \n     to detain numerous prisoners of conscience and the number of \n     new church registrations is exceptionally low when compared \n     to the thousands of congregations that either choose to \n     remain independent or are denied registration, leaving them \n     no choice but to operate illegally;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2014 International \n     Religious Freedom Report documents that leaders of \n     unregistered Protestant denominations continued to report \n     that local authorities in the Central Highlands discriminated \n     against their followers by threatening to exclude them from \n     state programs if they did not denounce their faith and that \n     students who were openly Protestant often suffered \n     discrimination; and\n       Whereas USCIRF recommends that Vietnam be designated a \n     Country of Particular Concern (CPC) as ongoing human rights \n     violations ``serve as a cautionary tale of the potential for \n     backsliding in religious freedoms when vigilance in \n     monitoring such abuses ceases'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contributions of the Montagnards who \n     fought loyally and bravely with United States Armed Forces \n     during the Vietnam War and who continue to suffer persecution \n     in Vietnam as a result of this relationship;\n       (2) condemns ongoing actions by the Government of Vietnam \n     to suppress basic human rights and civil liberties for all \n     its citizens;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Vietnam to allow human \n     rights groups access to all regions of the country and to end \n     restrictions of basic human rights, including the right for \n     Montagnards to practice their Christian faith freely, the \n     right to land and property, freedom of movement, the right to \n     retain ethnic identity and culture, and access to an adequate \n     standard of living; and\n       (4) urges the President and Congress to develop policies \n     that support Montagnards and other marginalized ethnic \n     minority and indigenous populations in Vietnam and reflect \n     United States interests and commitment to upholding human \n     rights and democracy abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url":
